<text>Wolfgang Ernst Pauli (; ; 25 April 1900 – 15 December 1958) was an Austrian theoretical physicist and a pioneer of quantum physics. In 1945, after having been nominated by Albert Einstein, Pauli received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his &quot;decisive contribution through his discovery of a new law of Nature, the exclusion principle or Pauli principle&quot;. The discovery involved spin theory, which is the basis of a theory of the structure of matter.

== Early life ==
Pauli was born in Vienna to a chemist, (&quot;né&quot; Wolf Pascheles, 1869–1955), and his wife, Bertha Camilla Schütz; his sister was Hertha Pauli, a writer and actress. Pauli&#x27;s middle name was given in honor of his godfather, physicist Ernst Mach. Pauli&#x27;s paternal grandparents were from prominent Jewish families of Prague; his great-grandfather was the Jewish publisher Wolf Pascheles. Pauli&#x27;s mother, Bertha Schütz, was raised in her mother&#x27;s Roman Catholic religion; her father was Jewish writer Friedrich Schütz. Pauli was raised as a Roman Catholic.

Pauli attended the Döblinger-Gymnasium in Vienna, graduating with distinction in 1918. Two months later, he published his first paper, on Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity. He attended the University of Munich, working under Arnold Sommerfeld, where he received his PhD in July 1921 for his thesis on the quantum theory of ionized diatomic hydrogen ().

== Career ==
Sommerfeld asked Pauli to review the theory of relativity for the &quot;Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften&quot; (&quot;Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences&quot;). Two months after receiving his doctorate, Pauli completed the article, which came to 237 pages. Einstein praised it; published as a monograph, it remains a standard reference on the subject.
Pauli spent a year at the University of Göttingen as the assistant to Max Born, and the next year at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen (later the Niels Bohr Institute). From 1923 to 1928, he was a professor at the University of Hamburg. During this period, Pauli was instrumental in the development of the modern theory of quantum mechanics. In particular, he formulated the exclusion principle and the theory of nonrelativistic spin. 

In 1928, Pauli was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1930. He held visiting professorships at the University of Michigan in 1931 and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1935.

===Jung===
At the end of 1930, shortly after his postulation of the neutrino and immediately after his divorce and his mother&#x27;s suicide, Pauli experienced a personal crisis. In January 1932 he consulted psychiatrist and psychotherapist Carl Jung, who also lived near Zürich. Jung immediately began interpreting Pauli&#x27;s deeply archetypal dreams and Pauli became a collaborator of Jung&#x27;s. He soon began to critique the epistemology of Jung&#x27;s theory scientifically, and this contributed to a certain clarification of Jung&#x27;s ideas, especially about synchronicity. A great many of these discussions are documented in the Pauli/Jung letters, today published as &quot;Atom and Archetype&quot;. Jung&#x27;s elaborate analysis of more than 400 of Pauli&#x27;s dreams is documented in &quot;Psychology and Alchemy&quot;. In 1933 Pauli published the second part of his book on physics, &quot;Handbuch der Physik&quot;, which was considered the definitive book on the new field of quantum physics. Robert Oppenheimer called it &quot;the only adult introduction to quantum mechanics.&quot;

The German annexation of Austria in 1938 made Pauli a German citizen, which became a problem for him in 1939 after World War II broke out. In 1940, he tried in vain to obtain Swiss citizenship, which would have allowed him to remain at the ETH.

===United States and Switzerland===
In 1940, Pauli moved to the United States, where he was employed as a professor of theoretical physics at the Institute for Advanced Study. In 1946, after the war, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen and returned to Zürich, where he mostly remained for the rest of his life. In 1949, he was granted Swiss citizenship.

In 1958, Pauli was awarded the Max Planck medal. The same year, he fell ill with pancreatic cancer. When his last assistant, Charles Enz, visited him at the Rotkreuz hospital in Zürich, Pauli asked him, &quot;Did you see the room number?&quot; It was 137. Throughout his life, Pauli had been preoccupied with the question of why the fine-structure constant, a dimensionless fundamental constant, has a value nearly equal to 1/137. Pauli died in that room on 15 December 1958.

== Scientific research ==
Pauli made many important contributions as a physicist, primarily in the field of quantum mechanics. He seldom published papers, preferring lengthy correspondences with colleagues such as Niels Bohr from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and Werner Heisenberg, with whom he had close friendships. Many of his ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. In 1921 Pauli worked with Bohr to create the Aufbau Principle, which described building up electrons in shells based on the German word for building up, as Bohr was also fluent in German.

Pauli proposed in 1924 a new quantum degree of freedom (or quantum number) with two possible values, to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the developing theory of quantum mechanics. He formulated the Pauli exclusion principle, perhaps his most important work, which stated that no two electrons could exist in the same quantum state, identified by four quantum numbers including his new two-valued degree of freedom. The idea of spin originated with Ralph Kronig. A year later, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit identified Pauli&#x27;s new degree of freedom as electron spin, in which Pauli for a very long time wrongly refused to believe.

In 1926, shortly after Heisenberg published the matrix theory of modern quantum mechanics, Pauli used it to derive the observed spectrum of the hydrogen atom. This result was important in securing credibility for Heisenberg&#x27;s theory.

Pauli introduced the 2×2 Pauli matrices as a basis of spin operators, thus solving the nonrelativistic theory of spin. This work, including the Pauli equation, is sometimes said to have influenced Paul Dirac in his creation of the Dirac equation for the relativistic electron, though Dirac said that he invented these same matrices himself independently at the time. Dirac invented similar but larger (4x4) spin matrices for use in his relativistic treatment of fermionic spin.

In 1930, Pauli considered the problem of beta decay. In a letter of 4 December to Lise Meitner &quot;et al.&quot;, beginning, &quot;Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen&quot;, he proposed the existence of a hitherto unobserved neutral particle with a small mass, no greater than 1% the mass of a proton, to explain the continuous spectrum of beta decay. In 1934, Enrico Fermi incorporated the particle, which he called a neutrino, &quot;little neutral one&quot; in Fermi&#x27;s native Italian, into his theory of beta decay. The neutrino was first confirmed experimentally in 1956 by Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan, two and a half years before Pauli&#x27;s death. On receiving the news, he replied by telegram: &quot;Thanks for message. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait. Pauli.&quot;

In 1940, Pauli re-derived the spin-statistics theorem, a critical result of quantum field theory that states that particles with half-integer spin are fermions, while particles with integer spin are bosons.

In 1949, he published a paper on Pauli–Villars regularization: regularization is the term for techniques that modify infinite mathematical integrals to make them finite during calculations, so that one can identify whether the intrinsically infinite quantities in the theory (mass, charge, wavefunction) form a finite and hence calculable set that can be redefined in terms of their experimental values, which criterion is termed renormalization, and which removes infinities from quantum field theories, but also importantly allows the calculation of higher-order corrections in perturbation theory.

Pauli made repeated criticisms of the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology, and his contemporary admirers point to modes of epigenetic inheritance as supporting his arguments.

Paul Drude in 1900 proposed the first theoretical model for a classical electron moving through a metallic solid. Drude&#x27;s classical model was also augmented by Pauli and other physicists. Pauli realized that the free electrons in metal must obey the Fermi–Dirac statistics. Using this idea, he developed the theory of paramagnetism in 1926. Pauli said, &quot;Festkörperphysik ist eine Schmutzphysik&quot;—solid-state physics is the physics of dirt.

Pauli was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1953 and president of the Swiss Physical Society in 1955 for two years. In 1958 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

== Personality and friendships ==

The Pauli effect was named after his anecdotal bizarre ability to break experimental equipment simply by being in its vicinity. Pauli was aware of his reputation and was delighted whenever the Pauli effect manifested. These strange occurrences were in line with his controversial investigations into the legitimacy of parapsychology, particularly his collaboration with C. G. Jung on synchronicity. Max Born considered Pauli &quot;only comparable to Einstein himself... perhaps even greater&quot;. Einstein declared Pauli his &quot;spiritual heir&quot;.

Pauli was famously a perfectionist. This extended not just to his own work, but also to that of his colleagues. As a result, he became known in the physics community as the &quot;conscience of physics&quot;, the critic to whom his colleagues were accountable. He could be scathing in his dismissal of any theory he found lacking, often labelling it &quot;ganz falsch&quot;, &quot;utterly wrong&quot;.

But this was not his most severe criticism, which he reserved for theories or theses so unclearly presented as to be untestable or unevaluatable and thus not properly belonging within the realm of science, even though posing as such. They were worse than wrong because they could not be proved wrong. Famously, he once said of such an unclear paper: &quot;It is not even wrong!&quot;

His supposed remark when meeting another leading physicist, Paul Ehrenfest, illustrates this notion of an arrogant Pauli. The two met at a conference for the first time. Ehrenfest was familiar with Pauli&#x27;s papers and quite impressed with them. After a few minutes of conversation, Ehrenfest remarked, &quot;I think I like your Encyclopedia article [on relativity theory] better than I like you,&quot; to which Pauli retorted, &quot;That&#x27;s strange. With me, regarding you, it is just the opposite.&quot; The two became very good friends from then on.

A somewhat warmer picture emerges from this story, which appears in the article on Dirac:

Werner Heisenberg [in &quot;Physics and Beyond&quot;, 1971] recollects a friendly conversation among young participants at the 1927 Solvay Conference, about Einstein and Planck&#x27;s views on religion. Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg, and Dirac took part in it. Dirac&#x27;s contribution was a poignant and clear criticism of the political manipulation of religion, that was much appreciated for its lucidity by Bohr, when Heisenberg reported it to him later. Among other things, Dirac said: &quot;I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest – and as scientists honesty is our precise duty – we cannot help but admit that any religion is a pack of false statements, deprived of any real foundation. The very idea of God is a product of human imagination. [ ... ] I do not recognize any religious myth, at least because they contradict one another. [ ... ]&quot; Heisenberg&#x27;s view was tolerant. Pauli had kept silent, after some initial remarks. But when finally he was asked for his opinion, jokingly he said: &quot;Well, I&#x27;d say that also our friend Dirac has got a religion and the first commandment of this religion is &#x27;God does not exist and Paul Dirac is his prophet&#x27;&quot;. Everybody burst into laughter, including Dirac.

Many of Pauli&#x27;s ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. Pauli may have been unconcerned that much of his work thus went uncredited, but when it came to Heisenberg&#x27;s world-renowned 1958 lecture at Göttingen on their joint work on a unified field theory, and the press release calling Pauli a mere &quot;assistant to Professor Heisenberg&quot;, Pauli became offended, denouncing Heisenberg&#x27;s physics prowess. The deterioration of their relationship resulted in Heisenberg ignoring Pauli&#x27;s funeral, and writing in his autobiography that Pauli&#x27;s criticisms were overwrought, though ultimately the field theory was proved untenable, validating Pauli&#x27;s criticisms.

== Philosophy ==
In his discussions with Carl Jung, Pauli developed an ontological theory that has been dubbed the &quot;Pauli–Jung Conjecture&quot; and has been seen as a kind of dual-aspect theory. The theory holds that there is &quot;a psychophysically neutral reality&quot; and that mental and physical aspects are derivative of this reality. Pauli thought that elements of quantum physics pointed to a deeper reality that might explain the mind/matter gap and wrote, &quot;we must postulate a cosmic order of nature beyond our control to which &quot;both&quot; the outward material objects &quot;and&quot; the inward images are subject.&quot;

Pauli and Jung held that this reality was governed by common principles (&quot;archetypes&quot;) that appear as psychological phenomena or as physical events. They also held that synchronicities might reveal some of this underlying reality&#x27;s workings.

==Beliefs==
He is considered to have been a deist and a mystic. In &quot;No Time to Be Brief: A Scientific Biography of Wolfgang Pauli&quot; he is quoted as writing to science historian Shmuel Sambursky, &quot;In opposition to the monotheist religions – but in unison with the mysticism of all peoples, including the Jewish mysticism – I believe that the ultimate reality is not personal.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In 1929, Pauli married Käthe Margarethe Deppner, a cabaret dancer. The marriage was unhappy, ending in divorce after less than a year. He married again in 1934 to Franziska Bertram (1901–1987). They had no children.

==Death==
Pauli died of pancreatic cancer on 15 December 1958, at age 58.

<text>William Erwin Eisner (; March 6, 1917 – January 3, 2005) was an American cartoonist, writer, and entrepreneur. He was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the American comic book industry, and his series &quot;The Spirit&quot; (1940–1952) was noted for its experiments in content and form. In 1978, he popularized the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; with the publication of his book &quot;A Contract with God&quot;. He was an early contributor to formal comics studies with his book &quot;Comics and Sequential Art&quot; (1985). The Eisner Award was named in his honor and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium; he was one of the three inaugural inductees to the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.

==1917–1936: Early life==

===Family background===

Eisner&#x27;s father, Shmuel &quot;Samuel&quot; Eisner, was born to Galician Jewish parents on March 6, 1886, in Kolomyia, Austria-Hungary (present-day Ukraine), and was one of eleven children. He aspired to be an artist, and as a teenager painted murals for rich patrons and Catholic churches in Vienna. To avoid conscription in the army, he moved to New York before the outbreak of World War I. There he found getting work difficult, as his English skills were poor. He made what living he could painting backdrops for vaudeville and the Jewish theater.

Eisner&#x27;s mother, Fannie Ingber, was born to Romanian Jewish parents on April 25, 1891, on a ship bound for the US. Her mother died on her tenth birthday and was quickly followed by her father. An older stepsister thereafter raised her and kept her so busy with chores that she had little time for socializing or schooling; she did what she could later in life to keep knowledge of her illiteracy from her children.

Shmuel and Fannie, who were distant relatives, met through family members. They had three children: son Will Erwin, born on his father&#x27;s birthday in 1917; son Julian, born February 3, 1921; and daughter Rhoda, born November 2, 1929.

===Early life===

Eisner was born in Brooklyn. He grew up poor, and the family moved frequently. Young Eisner often got into physical confrontations when subjected to antisemitism from his schoolmates. 

Young Eisner was tall and of sturdy build, but lacked athletic skills. He was a voracious consumer of pulp magazines and film, including avant-garde films such as those by Man Ray. To his mother&#x27;s disappointment, Eisner had his father&#x27;s interest in art, and his father encouraged him by buying him art supplies.

Eisner&#x27;s mother frequently berated his father for not providing the family a better income, as he went from one job to another. Without success he also tried his hand at such ventures as a furniture retailer and a coat factory. The family situation was especially dire following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that marked the beginning of the Great Depression. In 1930, the situation was so desperate that Eisner&#x27;s mother demanded that he, at thirteen, find some way to contribute to the family&#x27;s income. He entered working life selling newspapers on street corners, a competitive job where the toughest boys fought for the best locations.

Eisner attended DeWitt Clinton High School. With influences that included the early 20th-century commercial artist J. C. Leyendecker, he drew for the school newspaper (&quot;The Clinton News&quot;), the literary magazine (&quot;The Magpie&quot;) and the yearbook &quot;The clintonian and did stage design, leading him to consider doing that kind of work for theater. Upon graduation, he studied under Canadian artist George Brandt Bridgman for a year at the Art Students League of New York. Contacts made there led to a position as an advertising writer-cartoonist for the &quot;New York American&quot; newspaper. Eisner also drew $10-a-page illustrations for pulp magazines, including &quot;Western Sheriffs and Outlaws&quot;.

In 1936, high-school friend and fellow cartoonist Bob Kane, of future Batman fame, suggested that the 19-year-old Eisner try selling cartoons to the new comic book &quot;Wow, What A Magazine!&quot; &quot;Comic books&quot; at the time were tabloid-sized collections of comic strip reprints in color. By 1935, they had begun to include occasional new comic strip-like material. &quot;Wow&quot; editor Jerry Iger bought an Eisner adventure strip called &quot;Captain Scott Dalton&quot;, an H. Rider Haggard-styled hero who traveled the world after rare artifacts. Eisner subsequently wrote and drew the pirate strip &quot;The Flame&quot; and the secret agent strip &quot;Harry Karry&quot; for &quot;Wow&quot; as well.

Eisner said that on one occasion a man whom Eisner described as &quot;a mob type straight out of Damon Runyon, complete with pinkie ring, broken nose, black shirt, and white tie, who claimed to have &quot;exclusive distribution rights for all Brooklyn&quot; asked Eisner to draw Tijuana bibles for $3 a page. Eisner said that he declined the offer; he described the decision as &quot;one of the most difficult moral decisions of my life&quot;.

== 1936–1941: Comics industry and &quot;The Spirit&quot; ==

===Eisner &amp; Iger===
&quot;Wow&quot; lasted four issues (cover-dated July–September and November 1936). After it ended, Eisner and Iger worked together producing and selling original comics material, anticipating that the well of available reprints would soon run dry, though their accounts of how their partnership was founded differ. One of the first such comic-book &quot;packagers&quot;, their partnership was an immediate success, and the two soon had a stable of comics creators supplying work to Fox Comics, Fiction House, Quality Comics (for whom Eisner co-created such characters as Doll Man and Blackhawk), and others. Turning a profit of $1.50 a page, Eisner claimed that he &quot;got very rich before I was 22,&quot; later detailing that in Depression-era 1939 alone, he and Iger &quot;had split $25,000 between us&quot;, a considerable amount for the time.

Among the studio&#x27;s products was a self-syndicated Sunday comic strip, &quot;Hawks of the Seas&quot;, that initially reprinted Eisner&#x27;s old strip &quot;Wow, What A Magazine!&quot; feature &quot;The Flame&quot; and then continued it with new material. Eisner&#x27;s original work even crossed the Atlantic, with Eisner drawing the new cover of the October 16, 1937, issue of Boardman Books&#x27; comic-strip reprint tabloid &quot;Okay Comics Weekly.&quot;

In 1939, Eisner was commissioned to create Wonder Man for Victor Fox, an accountant who had previously worked at DC Comics and was becoming a comic book publisher himself. Following Fox&#x27;s instructions to create a Superman-type character, and using the pen name Willis, Eisner wrote and drew the first issue of &quot;Wonder Comics.&quot; Eisner said in interviews throughout his later life that he had protested the derivative nature of the character and story, and that when subpoenaed after National Periodical Publications, the company that would evolve into DC Comics, sued Fox, alleging Wonder Man was an illegal copy of Superman, Eisner testified that this was so, undermining Fox&#x27;s case; Eisner even depicts himself doing so in his semi-autobiographical graphic novel &quot;The Dreamer&quot;. However, a transcript of the proceeding, uncovered by comics historian Ken Quattro in 2010, indicates Eisner in fact supported Fox and claimed Wonder Man as an original Eisner creation.

===&quot;The Spirit&quot;===
In &quot;late &#x27;39, just before Christmas time,&quot; Eisner recalled in 1979, Quality Comics publisher Everett M. &quot;Busy&quot; Arnold &quot;came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom,&quot; In a 2004 interview, he elaborated on that meeting:

Eisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright &quot;The Spirit,&quot; but &quot;[w]ritten down in the contract I had with &#x27;Busy&#x27; Arnold —and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership—Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to &#x27;Busy&#x27; Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership&quot;. This would include the eventual backup features &quot;Mr. Mystic&quot; and &quot;Lady Luck&quot;.

Selling his share of their firm to Iger, who would continue to package comics as the S.M. Iger Studio and as Phoenix Features through 1955, for $20,000, Eisner left to create &quot;The Spirit.&quot; &quot;They gave me an adult audience&quot;, Eisner said in 1997, &quot;and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he&#x27;d have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, &#x27;Yes, he has a costume!&#x27;&quot;

&quot;The Spirit&quot;, an initially eight- and later seven-page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features &quot;Mr. Mystic&quot; and &quot;Lady Luck&quot; in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called &quot;The Spirit Section&quot;) that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952. Eisner has cited the Spirit story &quot;Gerhard Shnobble&quot; as a particular favorite, as it was one of his first attempts at injecting his personal point of view into the series.

==1942–1970s: Military publications, &quot;The Spirit&quot;, and new endeavors==

===World War II and &quot;Joe Dope&quot;===
Eisner was drafted into the U.S. Army in &quot;late &#x27;41, early &#x27;42&quot; and then &quot;had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off&quot; to fight in World War II. He was assigned to the camp newspaper at Aberdeen Proving Ground, where &quot;there was also a big training program there, so I got involved in the use of comics for training. ... I finally became a warrant officer, which involved taking a test – that way you didn&#x27;t have to go through Officer Candidate School.&quot;

En route to Washington, D.C., he stopped at the Holabird Ordnance Depot in Baltimore, where a mimeographed publication titled &quot;Army Motors&quot; was put together. &quot;Together with the people there ... I helped develop its format. I began doing cartoons – and we began fashioning a magazine that had the ability to talk to the G.I.s in their language. So I began to use comics as a teaching tool, and when I got to Washington, they assigned me to the business of teaching – or selling – preventive maintenance.&quot;

Eisner then created the educational comic strip and titular character &quot;Joe Dope&quot; for &quot;Army Motors&quot;, and spent four years working in The Pentagon editing the magazine &quot;Firepower&quot; and doing &quot;all the general illustrations – that is, cartoons&quot; for &quot;Army Motors&quot;. He continued to work on that and its 1950 successor magazine, &quot;PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly&quot;, until 1971. Eisner also illustrated an official Army pamphlet in 1968 and 1969 called &quot;The M16A1 Rifle&quot; specifically for troops in Vietnam to help minimize the M16 rifle&#x27;s notorious early reliability problems with proper maintenance. Eisner&#x27;s style helped to popularize these officially-distributed works in order to better educate soldiers on equipment maintenance.

While Eisner&#x27;s later graphic novels were entirely his own work, he had a studio working under his supervision on &quot;The Spirit&quot;. In particular, letterer Abe Kanegson came up with the distinctive lettering style which Eisner himself would later imitate in his book-length works, and Kanegson would often rewrite Eisner&#x27;s dialogue.

Eisner&#x27;s most trusted assistant on &quot;The Spirit,&quot; however, was Jules Feiffer, later a renowned cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter in his own right. Eisner later said of their memories of their working methods on the feature, &quot;You should hear me and Jules Feiffer going at it in a room. &#x27;No, you designed the splash page for this one, then you wrote the ending – I came up with the idea for the story, and you did it up to this point, then I did the next page and this sequence here and...&#x27; And I&#x27;ll be swearing up and down that &#x27;he&#x27; wrote the ending on that one. We never agree.&quot;

So trusted were Eisner&#x27;s assistants that Eisner allowed them to &quot;ghost&quot; &quot;The Spirit&quot; from the time that he was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942 until his return to civilian life in 1945. The primary wartime artists were the uncredited Lou Fine and Jack Cole, with future &quot;Kid Colt, Outlaw&quot; artist Jack Keller drawing backgrounds. Ghost writers included Manly Wade Wellman and William Woolfolk. The wartime ghosted stories have been reprinted in DC Comics&#x27; hardcover collections &quot;The Spirit Archives&quot; Vols. 5 to 11 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942 to December 1945.

===Post-war comics===

On Eisner&#x27;s return from service and resumption of his role in the studio, he created the bulk of the &quot;Spirit&quot; stories on which his reputation was solidified. The post-war years also saw him attempt to launch the comic-strip/comic-book series &quot;Baseball,&quot; &quot;John Law,&quot; &quot;Kewpies,&quot; and &quot;Nubbin the Shoeshine Boy;&quot; none succeeded, but some material was recycled into &quot;The Spirit&quot;.

&quot;The Spirit&quot; ceased publishing in 1952. During the 1960s and 1970s, various publishers reprinted the adventures, often with covers by Eisner and with a few new stories from him.

===American Visuals Corporation===
During his World War II military service, Eisner had introduced the use of comics for training personnel in the publication &quot;Army Motors&quot;, for which he created the cautionary bumbling soldier Joe Dope, who illustrated various methods of preventive maintenance of various military equipment and weapons. In 1948, while continuing to do &quot;The Spirit&quot; and seeing television and other post-war trends eat away at the readership base of newspapers, he formed the American Visuals Corporation in order to produce instructional materials for the government, related agencies, and businesses.

One of his longest-running jobs was &quot;PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly,&quot; a digest sized magazine with comic book elements that he started for the Army in 1951 and continued to work on until the 1970s with Klaus Nordling, Mike Ploog, and other artists. In addition, Eisner produced other military publications such as the graphic manual in 1969, &quot;The M-16A1 Rifle: Operation and Preventative Maintenance&quot;, which was distributed along with cleaning kits to address serious reliability concerns with the M16 rifle during the Vietnam War.

Other clients of his Connecticut-based company included RCA Records, the Baltimore Colts football team, and New York Telephone.

==1970s–2005: Godfather of the graphic novel==

===Graphic novels===
Eisner credited the 1971 Comic Art Convention (CAC) for his return to comics. In a 1983 interview with CAC organizer Phil Seuling, he said, &quot;I came back into the field because of you. I remember you calling me in New London, where I was sitting there as chairman of the board of Croft Publishing Co. My secretary said, &#x27;There&#x27;s a Mr. Seuling on the phone and he&#x27;s talking about a comics convention. What is that?&#x27; She said, &#x27;I didn&#x27;t know you were a cartoonist, Mr. Eisner.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, yes,&#x27; I said, &#x27;secretly; I&#x27;m a closet cartoonist.&#x27; I came down and was stunned at the existence of the whole world. ... That was a world that I had left, and I found it very exciting, very stimulating&quot;.

Eisner later elaborated about meeting underground comics creators and publishers, including Denis Kitchen:

In the late 1970s, Eisner turned his attention to longer storytelling forms. &quot;A Contract with God: and Other Tenement Stories&quot; (Baronet Books, October 1978) is an early example of an American graphic novel, combining thematically linked short stories into a single square-bound volume. Eisner continued with a string of graphic novels that tell the history of New York&#x27;s immigrant communities, particularly Jews, including &quot;The Building&quot;, &quot;A Life Force&quot;, &quot;Dropsie Avenue&quot; and &quot;To the Heart of the Storm&quot;. He continued producing new books into his seventies and eighties, at an average rate of nearly one a year. Each of these books was done twice – once as a rough version to show editor Dave Schreiner, then as a second, finished version incorporating suggested changes.

Some of his last work was the retelling in sequential art of novels and myths, including &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. In 2002, at the age of 85, he published &quot;Sundiata&quot;, based on the part-historical, part-mythical stories of a West African king, &quot;The Lion of Mali&quot;. &quot;Fagin the Jew&quot; is an account of the life of Dickens&#x27;s character Fagin, in which Eisner tries to get past the stereotyped portrait of Fagin in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.

His last graphic novel, &quot;The Plot: The Secret Story of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, an account of the making, and refutation, of the antisemitic hoax &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, was completed shortly before his death and published in 2005.

In 2008, Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit: A Pop-Up Graphic Novel&quot; was published, with Bruce Foster as paper engineer.

===Teaching===

In his later years especially, Eisner was a frequent lecturer about the craft and uses of sequential art. He taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he published &quot;Will Eisner&#x27;s Gallery&quot;, a collection of work by his students and wrote two books based on these lectures, &quot;Comics and Sequential Art&quot; and &quot;Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative&quot;, which are widely used by students of cartooning. In 2002, Eisner participated in the Will Eisner Symposium of the 2002 University of Florida Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels.

==Death==
Eisner died January 3, 2005, in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, of complications from a quadruple bypass surgery performed December 22, 2004. DC Comics held a memorial service in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, a neighborhood Eisner often visited in his work, at the Angel Orensanz Foundation on Norfolk Street.

Eisner was survived by his wife, Ann Weingarten Eisner, and their son, John. In the introduction to the 2001 reissue of &quot;A Contract with God&quot;, Eisner revealed that the inspiration for the title story grew out of the 1970 death of his leukemia-stricken teenaged daughter, Alice, next to whom he is buried. Until then, only Eisner&#x27;s closest friends were aware of his daughter&#x27;s life and death.

==Awards and honors==

Eisner has been recognized for his work with the National Cartoonists Society Comic Book Award for 1967, 1968, 1969, 1987 and 1988, as well as its Story Comic Book Award in 1979, and its Reuben Award in 1998. In 1975, he was awarded the Inkpot Award and the second Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême.

He was inducted into the Academy of Comic Book Arts Hall of Fame in 1971, and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1987. The following year, the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards were established in his honor. In 2015, Eisner was posthumously elected to the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame.

Comics by Will Eisner are archived in the James Branch Cabell Library of Virginia Commonwealth University. VCU&#x27;s James Branch Cabell Library has served as the repository for the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards since 2005. Each year following Comic-Con, nominated and award-winning titles are donated to the library&#x27;s Special Collections and Archives and made available to researchers and visitors. Approximately 1,000 comic books, graphic novels, archival editions, scholarly titles, and journals are included in the VCU library&#x27;s expansive Comic Arts Collection.

On the 94th anniversary of Eisner&#x27;s birth, in 2011, Google used an image featuring the Spirit as its logo.

With Jack Kirby, Robert Crumb, Harvey Kurtzman, Gary Panter, and Chris Ware, Eisner was among the artists honored in the exhibition &quot;Masters of American Comics&quot; at the Jewish Museum in New York City, from September 16, 2006, to January 28, 2007. In honor of Eisner&#x27;s centennial in 2017, Denis Kitchen and John Lind co-curated the largest retrospective exhibitions of Will Eisner&#x27;s original artwork, shown simultaneously at The Society of Illustrators in New York City and Le Musée de la Bande Dessinée in Angoulême, France. Both exhibitions were titled &quot;Will Eisner Centennial Celebration&quot; and collectively over 400 original pieces were included. A catalogue of the same name was released by Dark Horse Books and nominated for multiple Eisner Awards in 2018.

<doc id="33978" wikidata="Q11663" url="?curid=33978" title="Weather">
<text>Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet&#x27;s atmosphere, the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, &quot;weather&quot; is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.

Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the Sun&#x27;s angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream. Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow. Because Earth&#x27;s axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth&#x27;s surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 104 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth&#x27;s orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.

Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth&#x27;s surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Earth&#x27;s weather system is a chaotic system; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.

Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, the weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star&#x27;s corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.

== Causes ==

On Earth, common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Some more common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.

Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences from one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude in the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due to the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity). Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.

Because the Earth&#x27;s axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth&#x27;s orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).

The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which is the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or human-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.

Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth&#x27;s rotation then causes deflection of this airflow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes.

The atmosphere is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to one part of the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tidal waves or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.

==Shaping the planet Earth==

Weather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather plays a major role in erosion of the surface.

==Effect on humans==

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, the effect the weather, and especially inclement weather, has on humans in different situations, etc. Therefore, weather is something people often communicate about.

In the United States, the National Weather Service has an annual report for fatalities, injury, and total damage costs which include crop and property. They gather this data via National Weather Service offices located throughout the 50 states in the United States as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. As of 2019, tornadoes have had the greatest impact on humans with 42 fatalities while costing crop and property damage over 3 billion dollars.

===Effects on populations===

The weather has played a large and sometimes direct part in human history. Aside from climatic changes that have caused the gradual drift of populations (for example the desertification of the Middle East, and the formation of land bridges during glacial periods), extreme weather events have caused smaller scale population movements and intruded directly in historical events. One such event is the saving of Japan from invasion by the Mongol fleet of Kublai Khan by the Kamikaze winds in 1281. French claims to Florida came to an end in 1565 when a hurricane destroyed the French fleet, allowing Spain to conquer Fort Caroline. More recently, Hurricane Katrina redistributed over one million people from the central Gulf coast elsewhere across the United States, becoming the largest diaspora in the history of the United States.

The Little Ice Age caused crop failures and famines in Europe. During the period known as the Grindelwald Fluctuation (1560–1630), volcanic forcing events seem to have led to more extreme weather events. These included droughts, storms and unseasonal blizzards, as well as causing the Swiss Grindelwald Glacier to expand. The 1690s saw the worst famine in France since the Middle Ages. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696–1697, during which about one-third of the Finnish population died.

== Forecasting ==

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since at least the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.

Once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, forecast models are now used to determine future conditions. On the other hand, human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves many disciplines such as pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases.

The chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as of the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the &quot;range&quot; of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.

There are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days.

In some areas, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and the wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead to survive through them.

Tropical weather forecasting is different from that at higher latitudes. The sun shines more directly on the tropics than on higher latitudes (at least on average over a year), which makes the tropics warm (Stevens 2011). And, the vertical direction (up, as one stands on the Earth&#x27;s surface) is perpendicular to the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation at the equator, while the axis of rotation and the vertical are the same at the pole; this causes the Earth&#x27;s rotation to influence the atmospheric circulation more strongly at high latitudes than low latitudes. Because of these two factors, clouds and rainstorms in the tropics can occur more spontaneously compared to those at higher latitudes, where they are more tightly controlled by larger-scale forces in the atmosphere. Because of these differences, clouds and rain are more difficult to forecast in the tropics than at higher latitudes. On the other hand, the temperature is easily forecast in the tropics, because it does not change much.

==Modification==
The aspiration to control the weather is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military Operation Popeye, an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding; they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains, and techniques to suppress hail. A recent example of weather control was China&#x27;s preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of Beijing in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in Baoding City of Hebei Province, to the southwest and Beijing&#x27;s Fangshan District recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.

Whereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques&#x27; efficacy, there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification:
* Acid rain, caused by industrial emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, adversely affects freshwater lakes, vegetation, and structures.
* Anthropogenic pollutants reduce air quality and visibility.
* Climate change caused by human activities that emit greenhouse gases into the air is expected to affect the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, extreme temperatures, flooding, high winds, and severe storms.
* Heat, generated by large metropolitan areas have been shown to minutely affect nearby weather, even at distances as far as .

The effects of inadvertent weather modification may pose serious threats to many aspects of civilization, including ecosystems, natural resources, food and fiber production, economic development, and human health.

==Microscale meteorology==
Microscale meteorology is the study of short-lived atmospheric phenomena smaller than mesoscale, about 1 km or less. These two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as &quot;mesoscale and microscale meteorology&quot; (MMM) and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale; that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a weather map. These include small and generally fleeting cloud &quot;puffs&quot; and other small cloud features.

==Extremes on Earth==

On Earth, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (100 °F to −40 °F) annually. The range of climates and latitudes across the planet can offer extremes of temperature outside this range. The coldest air temperature ever recorded on Earth is , at Vostok Station, Antarctica on 21 July 1983. The hottest air temperature ever recorded was at &#x27;Aziziya, Libya, on 13 September 1922, but that reading is queried. The highest recorded average annual temperature was at Dallol, Ethiopia. The coldest recorded average annual temperature was at Vostok Station, Antarctica.

The coldest average annual temperature in a permanently inhabited location is at Eureka, Nunavut, in Canada, where the annual average temperature is .

The windiest place ever recorded is in Antarctica, Commonwealth Bay (George V Coast). Here the gales reach . Furthermore, the greatest snowfall in a period of twelve months occurred in Mount Rainier, Washington, US. It was recorded as of snow.

==Extraterrestrial weather==

Studying how the weather works on other planets has been seen as helpful in understanding how it works on Earth. Weather on other planets follows many of the same physical principles as weather on Earth, but occurs on different scales and in atmospheres having different chemical composition. The &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission to Titan discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid methane and other organic compounds. Earth&#x27;s atmosphere includes six latitudinal circulation zones, three in each hemisphere. In contrast, Jupiter&#x27;s banded appearance shows many such zones, Titan has a single jet stream near the 50th parallel north latitude, and Venus has a single jet near the equator.

One of the most famous landmarks in the Solar System, Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. On other giant planets, the lack of a surface allows the wind to reach enormous speeds: gusts of up to 600 metres per second (about ) have been measured on the planet Neptune. This has created a puzzle for planetary scientists. The weather is ultimately created by solar energy and the amount of energy received by Neptune is only about of that received by Earth, yet the intensity of weather phenomena on Neptune is far greater than on Earth. , the strongest planetary winds discovered are on the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b, which is thought to have easterly winds moving at more than .

==Space weather==
Weather is not limited to planetary bodies. Like all stars, the Sun&#x27;s corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind. Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star, such as coronal mass ejections, form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as space weather. Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the Solar System as Saturn. The activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces. The interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae, and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as electricity grids and radio signals.

<doc id="33980" wikidata="Q478175" url="?curid=33980" title="Waterfall model">
<text>The waterfall model is a breakdown of developmental activities into linear sequential phases, meaning that each phase is passed down onto each other, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.
This approach is typical for certain areas of engineering design. In software development,
it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction (downwards like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

The waterfall model is the earliest Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach used in software development.

When it was first adopted, there were no recognized alternatives for knowledge-based creative work.

==History==
The first known presentation describing the use of such phases in software engineering was held by Herbert D. Benington at the Symposium on Advanced Programming Methods for Digital Computers on 29 June 1956.
This presentation was about the development of software for SAGE. In 1983, Benington republished his paper with a foreword explaining that the phases were on purpose organized according to the specialization of tasks, and pointing out that the process was not in fact performed in a strict top-down fashion, but depended on a prototype.
Although the term &quot;waterfall&quot; is not used in the paper, the first formal detailed diagram of the process later known as the &quot;waterfall model&quot; is often cited as coming from a 1970 article by Winston W. Royce. However, he commented that it had major flaws stemming from how testing only happened at the end of the process, which he described as being &quot;risky and [inviting] failure&quot;. The rest of his paper introduced five steps which he felt were necessary to &quot;eliminate most of the development risks&quot; associated with the unaltered waterfall approach.

Royce&#x27;s five additional steps (which included writing complete documentation at various stages of development) never took mainstream hold, but his diagram of what he considered a flawed process became the starting point when describing a &quot;waterfall&quot; approach.
The earliest use of the term &quot;waterfall&quot; may have been in a 1976 paper by Bell and Thayer.
In 1985, the United States Department of Defense adopted the waterfall model in the DOD-STD-2167 standard for working with software development contractors. This standard referred for iterations of a software development to &quot;&quot;the sequential phases of a software development cycle&quot; and stated that &quot;the contractor shall implement a software development cycle that includes the following six phases: Software Requirement Analysis, Preliminary Design, Detailed Design, Coding and Unit Testing, Integration, and Testing&quot;&quot;.

==Model==
Although Royce never recommended nor described a waterfall model, rigid adherence to the following phases are criticized by him:
# System and software requirements: captured in a product requirements document
# Analysis: resulting in models, schema, and business rules
# Design: resulting in the software architecture
# Coding: the development, proving, and integration of software
# Testing: the systematic discovery and debugging of defects
# Operations: the installation, migration, support, and maintenance of complete systems

Thus, the waterfall model maintains that one should move to a phase only when its preceding phase is reviewed and verified.

Various modified waterfall models (including Royce&#x27;s final model), however, can include slight or major variations on this process. These variations include returning to the previous cycle after flaws are found downstream, or returning to the design phase if downstream phases are deemed insufficient.

==Supporting arguments==
Time spent early in the software production cycle can reduce costs at later stages. For example, a problem found in the early stages (such as requirements specification) is cheaper to fix than the same bug found later on in the process (by a factor of 50 to 200).

In common practice, waterfall methodologies result in a project schedule with 20–40% of the time invested for the first two phases, 30–40% of the time to coding, and the rest dedicated to testing and implementation. With the project organization needing to be highly structured, most medium and large projects will include a detailed set of procedures and controls, which regulate every process on the project.

A further argument supporting the waterfall model is that it places emphasis on documentation (such as requirements documents and design documents) as well as source code. In less thoroughly designed and documented methodologies, knowledge is lost if team members leave before the project is completed, and it may be difficult for a project to recover from the loss. If a fully working design document is present (as is the intent of big design up front and the waterfall model), new team members and new teams should be able to familiarise themselves to the project by reading the documents.

The waterfall model provides a structured approach; the model itself progresses linearly through discrete, easily understandable and explainable phases and thus is easy to understand. It also provides easily identifiable milestones in the development process, often being used as a beginning example of a development model in many software engineering texts and courses.

Similarly, simulation can play a valuable role within the waterfall model. By creating computerized or mathematical simulations of the system being developed, teams can gain insights into how the system will perform before proceeding to the next phase. Simulations allow for testing and refining the design, identifying potential issues or bottlenecks, and making informed decisions about the system&#x27;s functionality and performance.

==Criticism==
Clients may not know the exact requirements before they see working software and thus change their requirements further on, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting, and increased costs.

Designers may not be aware of future difficulties when designing a new software product or feature, in which case revising the design initially can increase efficiency in comparison to a design not built to account for newly discovered constraints, requirements, or problems.

Organisations may attempt to deal with a lack of concrete requirements from clients by employing systems analysts to examine existing manual systems and analyse what they do and how they might be replaced. However, in practice, it is difficult to sustain a strict separation between systems analysis and programming, as implementing any non-trivial system will often expose issues and edge cases that the systems analyst did not consider.

Some organisations, such as the United States Department of Defense, now have a stated preference against waterfall-type methodologies, starting with MIL-STD-498 released in 1994, which encourages &quot;evolutionary acquisition&quot; and &quot;Iterative and Incremental Development&quot;.

==Modified waterfall models==
In response to the perceived problems with the &quot;pure&quot; waterfall model, many &#x27;modified waterfall models&#x27; have been introduced. These models may address some or all of the criticisms of the &quot;pure&quot; waterfall model.

These include the Rapid Development models that Steve McConnell calls &quot;modified waterfalls&quot;: Peter DeGrace&#x27;s &quot;sashimi model&quot; (waterfall with overlapping phases), waterfall with subprojects, and waterfall with risk reduction. Other software development model combinations such as &quot;incremental waterfall model&quot; also exist.

==Royce&#x27;s final model==
Winston W. Royce&#x27;s final model, his intended improvement upon his initial &quot;waterfall model&quot;, illustrated that feedback could (should, and often would) lead from code testing to design (as testing of code uncovered flaws in the design) and from design back to requirements specification (as design problems may necessitate the removal of conflicting or otherwise unsatisfiable/undesignable requirements). In the same paper Royce also advocated large quantities of documentation, doing the job &quot;twice if possible&quot; (a sentiment similar to that of Fred Brooks, famous for writing the Mythical Man Month — an influential book in software project management — who advocated planning to &quot;throw one away&quot;), and involving the customer as much as possible (a sentiment similar to that of extreme programming).

Royce notes on the final model are the following:
# Complete program design before analysis and coding begins
# Documentation must be current and complete
# Do the job twice if possible
# Testing must be planned, controlled, and monitored
# Involve the customer

<doc id="33983" wikidata="Q72250" url="?curid=33983" title="Wau Holland">
<text>Herwart Holland-Moritz, known as Wau Holland, (20 December 1951 – 29 July 2001) was a German computer security activist and journalist who in 1981 cofounded the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), one of the world&#x27;s oldest hacking clubs. 

== Career ==
From 1979 onwards, Holland supported the film historian Hans-Michael Bock with the development of the filmographic database CineGraph - a lexicon for German-language films, which appeared as a loose-leaf collection from 1984. In 1981, Holland co-founded the Chaos Computer Club (CCC).

From 1983 he was a columnist for the Berlin-based &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;, often reporting on the BBS scene and the computer underground. In the same year, he also supervised the phototypesetting of one of the early books created entirely on a computer (Osborne 1). 

Holland also co-founded the CCC&#x27;s hacker magazine &quot;Datenschleuder&quot; in 1984, which praised the possibilities of global information networks and powerful computers, and included detailed wiring diagrams for building modems cheaply. The then-monopolist telephone company of Germany&#x27;s Deutsche Bundespost had to approve modems and sold expensive, slow modems of their own. &quot;Connecting a do-it-yourself modem was punished more severely than negligent triggering of a nuclear explosion&quot;, Wau Holland famously said about this situation. The telecommunications branch of Deutsche Bundespost was privatized and is now Deutsche Telekom.
Because of Holland&#x27;s continuing participation in the club, the CCC gained popularity and credibility. He gave speeches on information control for the government and the private sector. Holland fought against copy protection and all forms of censorship and for an open information infrastructure. He compared the censorship demands by some governments to those of the Christian church in the Middle Ages and regarded copy protection as a product defect. In his last years, he spent a lot of his time at a youth centre teaching children both the ethics and the technology of hacking.

== Personal life ==
Holland was born in Kassel, and grew up in Marburg, Hesse. He graduated from the Gymnasium Philippinum secondary school and attended the University of Marburg, though he did not graduate. 

Holland was an amateur radio operator and held the call sign DB4FA.

After the Peaceful Revolution, Holland lived in Ilmenau and taught ethics in computer science with Gabriele Schade at the Technical University of Ilmenau (therefore calling himself ironically honorary professor). He was close friends with Bernd Fix and Wolfgang Rudolph. He became an advocate for encrypted messaging.

Holland died in Bielefeld on 29 July 2001 of complications caused by a brain stem stroke from which he suffered in May.

<text>The Weather Underground was a far-left Marxist militant organization first active in 1969, founded on the Ann Arbor campus of the University of Michigan. Originally known as the Weathermen, or simply Weatherman, the group was organized as a faction of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) national leadership. Officially known as the Weather Underground Organization (WUO) beginning in 1970, the group&#x27;s express political goal was to create a revolutionary party to overthrow the United States government, which WUO believed to be imperialist.

The FBI described the WUO as a domestic terrorist group, with revolutionary positions characterized by Black Power and opposition to the Vietnam War. The WUO took part in domestic attacks such as the jailbreak of Timothy Leary in 1970. The &quot;Days of Rage&quot; was the WUO&#x27;s first riot in October 1969 in Chicago, timed to coincide with the trial of the Chicago Seven. In 1970, the group issued a &quot;Declaration of a State of War&quot; against the United States government under the name &quot;Weather Underground Organization.&quot;

In the 1970s, the WUO conducted a bombing campaign targeting government buildings and several banks. Some attacks were preceded by evacuation warnings, along with threats identifying the particular matter that the attack was intended to protest. Three members of the group were killed in an accidental Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, but none were killed in any of the bombings. The WUO communiqué issued in connection with the bombing of the United States Capitol on March 1, 1971, indicated that it was &quot;in protest of the U.S. invasion of Laos&quot;. The WUO asserted that its May 19, 1972, bombing of the Pentagon was &quot;in retaliation for the U.S. bombing raid in Hanoi&quot;. On September 28, 1973, an ITT Inc building in New York City was bombed for the involvement of this company in the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état. The WUO announced that its January 29, 1975 bombing of the United States Department of State building was &quot;in response to the escalation in Vietnam&quot;.

The WUO began to disintegrate after the United States reached a peace accord in Vietnam in 1973, and it was defunct by 1977. Some members of the WUO joined the May 19th Communist Organization and continued their activities until that group disbanded in 1985.

The group took its name from Bob Dylan&#x27;s lyric &quot;You don&#x27;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows&quot;, from the song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; (1965). That Dylan line was also the title of a position paper distributed at an SDS convention in Chicago on June 18, 1969. This founding document called for a &quot;White fighting force&quot; to be allied with the &quot;Black Liberation Movement&quot; and other radical movements to achieve &quot;the destruction of U.S. imperialism and form a classless communist world&quot;.

==Background and formation==
The Weathermen emerged from the campus-based opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War as well as from the civil rights movement of the 1960s. One of the factors that contributed to the radicalization of SDS members was the Economic Research and Action Project that the SDS undertook in Northern urban neighborhoods from 1963 to 1968. This project was aimed at creating an interracial movement of the poor that would mobilize for full and fair employment or guaranteed annual income and political rights for poverty class Americans. Their goal was to create a more democratic society &quot;which guarantees political freedom, economic and physical security, abundant education, and incentives for wide cultural variety&quot;. While the initial phase of the SDS involved campus organizing, phase two involved community organizing. These experiences led some SDS members to conclude that deep social change would not happen through community organizing and electoral politics, and that more radical and disruptive tactics were needed.

In the late 1960s, United States military action in Southeast Asia escalated, especially in Vietnam. In the U.S., the anti-war sentiment was particularly pronounced during the 1968 U.S. presidential election.

The origins of the Weathermen can be traced to the collapse and fragmentation of the Students for a Democratic Society following a split between office holders of the SDS, or the &quot;National Office&quot;, and their supporters and the Progressive Labor Party (PLP). During the factional struggle, National Office leaders such as Bernardine Dohrn and Mike Klonsky began announcing their emerging perspectives, and Klonsky published a document titled &quot;Toward a Revolutionary Youth Movement&quot; (RYM).

RYM promoted the philosophy that young workers possessed the potential to be a revolutionary force which could overthrow capitalism, if not by themselves then by transmitting radical ideas to the working class. Klonsky&#x27;s document reflected the philosophy of the National Office and it was eventually adopted as the SDS&#x27;s official doctrine. During the summer of 1969, the National Office began to split. A group led by Klonsky became known as RYM II, and the other side, RYM I, was led by Dohrn and endorsed more aggressive tactics such as direct action, as some members felt that years of nonviolent resistance had done little or nothing to stop the Vietnam War. The Weathermen strongly sympathized with the radical Black Panther Party. The police killing of Panther Fred Hampton prompted the Weatherman to issue a declaration of war upon the United States government.

===SDS Convention, June 1969===
At an SDS convention in Chicago on June 18, 1969, the National Office attempted to persuade unaffiliated delegates not to endorse a takeover of SDS by Progressive Labor who had packed the convention with their supporters. It was at the 1966 convention of SDS that members of Progressive Labor Party began to make their presence known for the first time. The PLP was a Stalinist group that had turned to SDS as fertile ground for recruiting new members after meeting with little success in organizing industrial workers, their preferred base. SDS members of that time were nearly all anti-communist, but they also refused to be drawn into actions that appeared like red-baiting, which they viewed as mostly irrelevant and out of date. The PLP soon began to organize a Worker Student Alliance. By 1968 and 1969 they would profoundly affect SDS, particularly at national gatherings of the membership, forming a well-groomed, disciplined faction which followed the Progressive Labor Party line. At the beginning of the convention, two position papers were passed out by the National Office leadership, one a revised statement of Klonsky&#x27;s RYM manifesto, the other called &quot;You Don&#x27;t Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows&quot;.

The latter document outlined the position of the group that would become the Weathermen. It had been signed by Karen Ashley, Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, John Jacobs, Jeff Jones, Gerry Long, Howie Machtinger, Jim Mellen, Terry Robbins, Mark Rudd, and Steve Tappis. The document called for creating a clandestine revolutionary party.

The most important task for us toward making the revolution, and the work our collectives should engage in, is the creation of a mass revolutionary movement, without which a clandestine revolutionary party will be impossible. A revolutionary mass movement is different from the traditional revisionist mass base of &quot;sympathizers&quot;. Rather it is akin to the Red Guard in China, based on the full participation and involvement of masses of people in the practice of making revolution; a movement with a full willingness to participate in the violent and illegal struggle.

At this convention the Weatherman&#x27;s faction of the Students for a Democratic Society, planned for October 8–11, as a &quot;National Action&quot; built around John Jacobs&#x27; slogan, &quot;bring the war home&quot;. The National Action grew out of a resolution drafted by Jacobs and introduced at the October 1968 SDS National Council meeting in Boulder, Colorado. The resolution, titled &quot;The Elections Don&#x27;t Mean Shit—Vote Where the Power Is—Our Power Is In The Street&quot; and adopted by the council, was prompted by the success of the Democratic National Convention protests in August 1968 and reflected Jacobs&#x27; strong advocacy of direct action.

As part of the &quot;National Action Staff&quot;, Jacobs was an integral part of the planning for what quickly came to be called &quot;Four Days of Rage&quot;. For Jacobs, the goal of the &quot;Days of Rage&quot; was clear:

Weatherman would shove the war down their dumb, fascist throats and show them, while we were at it, how much better we were than them, both tactically and strategically, as a people. In an all-out civil war over Vietnam and other fascist U.S. imperialism, we were going to bring the war home. &#x27;Turn the imperialists&#x27; war into a civil war&#x27;, in Lenin&#x27;s words. And we were going to kick ass.

In July 1969, 30 members of Weatherman leadership traveled to Cuba and met with North Vietnamese representatives to gain from their revolutionary experience. The North Vietnamese requested armed political action in order to stop the U.S. government&#x27;s war in Vietnam. Subsequently, they accepted funding, training, recommendations on tactics and slogans from Cuba, and perhaps explosives as well.

===SDS Convention, December 1969===
After the Days of Rage riots the Weatherman held the last of its National Council meetings from December 26 to December 31, 1969, in Flint, Michigan. The meeting, dubbed the &quot;War Council&quot; by the 300 people who attended, adopted Jacobs&#x27; call for violent revolution. Dohrn opened the conference by telling the delegates they needed to stop being afraid and begin the &quot;armed struggle.&quot; Over the next five days, the participants met in informal groups to discuss what &quot;going underground&quot; meant, how best to organize collectives, and justifications for violence. In the evening, the groups reconvened for a mass &quot;wargasm&quot;—practicing karate, engaging in physical exercise, singing songs, and listening to speeches.

The War Council ended with a major speech by John Jacobs. Jacobs condemned the &quot;pacifism&quot; of white middle-class American youth, a belief which he claimed they held because they were insulated from the violence which afflicted blacks and the poor. He predicted a successful revolution, and declared that youth were moving away from passivity and apathy and toward a new high-energy culture of &quot;depersonalization&quot; brought about by drugs, sex, and armed revolution. &quot;We&#x27;re against everything that&#x27;s &#x27;good and decent&#x27; in honky America,&quot; Jacobs said in his most commonly quoted statement. &quot;We will burn and loot and destroy. We are the incubation of your mother&#x27;s nightmare.&quot;
Two major decisions came out of the War Council. The first was to go underground and to begin a violent, armed struggle against the state without attempting to organize or mobilize a broad swath of the public. The Weather Underground hoped to create underground collectives in major cities throughout the country. In fact, the Weathermen eventually created only three significant, active collectives; one in California, one in the Midwest, and one in New York City. The New York City collective was led by Jacobs and Terry Robbins, and included Ted Gold, Kathy Boudin, Cathy Wilkerson (Robbins&#x27;s girlfriend), and Diana Oughton. Jacobs was one of Robbins&#x27;s biggest supporters, and pushed the Weathermen to let Robbins be as violent as he wanted to be. The Weatherman national leadership agreed, as did the New York City collective. The collective&#x27;s first target was Judge John Murtagh, who was overseeing the trial of the &quot;Panther 21&quot;.

The second major decision was the dissolution of SDS. After the summer of 1969 fragmentation of SDS, Weatherman&#x27;s adherents explicitly claimed themselves the &quot;real leaders&quot; of SDS and retained control of the SDS National Office. Thereafter, any leaflet, label, or logo bearing the name &quot;Students for a Democratic Society&quot; (SDS) was in fact the views and politics of Weatherman, not of the slate elected by Progressive Labor. Weatherman contained the vast majority of former SDS National Committee members, including Mark Rudd, David Gilbert and Bernardine Dohrn. The group, while small, was able to commandeer the mantle of SDS and all of its membership lists, but with Weatherman in charge there was little or no support from local branches or members of the organization, and local chapters soon disbanded. At the War Council, the Weathermen had decided to close the SDS National Office, ending the major campus-based organization of the 1960s which at its peak was a mass organization with 100,000 members.

===Ideology===
The thesis of Weatherman theory, as expounded in its founding document, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows&quot;, was that &quot;the main struggle going on in the world today is between U.S. imperialism and the national liberation struggles against it&quot;, based on Lenin&#x27;s theory of imperialism, first expounded in 1916 in &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot;. In Weatherman theory &quot;oppressed peoples&quot; are the creators of the wealth of empire, &quot;and it is to them that it belongs.&quot; &quot;The goal of revolutionary struggle must be the control and use of this wealth in the interest of the oppressed peoples of the world.&quot; &quot;The goal is the destruction of U.S. imperialism and the achievement of a classless world: world communism&quot;

The Vietnamese and other third world countries, as well as third world people within the United States play a vanguard role. They &quot;set the terms for class struggle in America ...&quot;. The role of the &quot;Revolutionary Youth Movement&quot; is to build a centralized organization of revolutionaries, a &quot;Marxist–Leninist Party&quot; supported by a mass revolutionary movement to support international liberation movements and &quot;open another battlefield of the revolution.&quot;

The theoretical basis of the Revolutionary Youth Movement was an insight that most of the American population, including both students and the supposed &quot;middle class,&quot; comprised, due to their relationship to the instruments of production, the working class, thus the organizational basis of the SDS, which had begun in the elite colleges and had been extended to public institutions as the organization grew could be extended to youth as a whole including students, those serving in the military, and the unemployed. Students could be viewed as workers gaining skills prior to employment. This contrasted to the Progressive Labor view which viewed students and workers as being in separate categories which could ally, but should not jointly organize.

FBI analysis of the travel history of the founders and initial followers of the organization emphasized contacts with foreign governments, particularly the Cuban and North Vietnamese and their influence on the ideology of the organization. Participation in the Venceremos Brigade, a program which involved U.S. students volunteering to work in the sugar harvest in Cuba, is highlighted as a common factor in the background of the founders of the Weather Underground, with China a secondary influence. This experience was cited by both Kathy Boudin and Bernardine Dohrn as a major influence on their political development.

Terry Robbins took the organization&#x27;s name from the lyrics of the Bob Dylan song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues,&quot; which featured the lyrics &quot;You don&#x27;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.&quot; The lyrics had been quoted at the bottom of an influential essay in the SDS newspaper, &quot;New Left Notes&quot;. By using this title the Weathermen meant, partially, to appeal to the segment of U.S. youth inspired to action for social justice by Dylan&#x27;s songs.

The Weatherman group had long held that militancy was becoming more important than nonviolent forms of anti-war action, and that university campus-based demonstrations needed to be punctuated with more dramatic actions, which had the potential to interfere with the U.S. military and internal security apparatus. The belief was that these types of urban guerrilla actions would act as a catalyst for the coming revolution. Many international events indeed seemed to support the Weathermen&#x27;s overall assertion that worldwide revolution was imminent, such as the tumultuous Cultural Revolution in China; the 1968 student revolts in France, Mexico City and elsewhere; the Prague Spring; the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association; the emergence of the Tupamaros organization in Uruguay; the emergence of the Guinea-Bissauan Revolution and similar Marxist-led independence movements throughout Africa; and within the United States, the prominence of the Black Panther Party, together with a series of &quot;ghetto rebellions&quot; throughout poor black neighborhoods across the country.

The Weathermen were outspoken critics of the concepts that later came to be known as &quot;white privilege&quot; (described as white-skin privilege) and identity politics. As the civil disorder in poor black neighborhoods intensified in the early 1970s, Bernardine Dohrn said, &quot;White youth must choose sides &quot;now.&quot; They must either fight on the side of the oppressed or be on the side of the oppressor.&quot;

The Weathermen called for the overthrow of the United States government.

===Anti-imperialism, anti-racism, and white privilege===
Weather maintained that their stance differed from the rest of the movements at the time in the sense that they predicated their critiques on the notion that they were engaged in &quot;an anti-imperialist, anti-racist struggle&quot;. Weather put the &quot;international&quot; proletariat at the center of their political theory. Weather warned that other political theories, including those addressing class interests or youth interests, were &quot;bound to lead in a racist and chauvinist direction&quot;. Weather denounced other political theories of the time as &quot;objectively racist&quot; if they did not side with the international proletariat; such political theories, they argued, needed to be &quot;smashed&quot;.

Members of Weather further contended that efforts at &quot;organizing whites against their own perceived oppression&quot; were &quot;attempts by whites to carve out even more privilege than they already derive from the imperialist nexus&quot;. Weather&#x27;s political theory sought to make every struggle an anti-imperialist, anti-racist struggle; out of this premise came their interrogation of critical concepts that would later be known as &quot;white privilege&quot;. As historian Dan Berger writes, Weather raised the question &quot;what does it mean to be a white person opposing racism and imperialism?&quot;

At one point, the Weathermen adopted the belief that all white babies were &quot;tainted with the original sin of &quot;skin privilege&quot;, declaring &quot;all white babies are pigs&quot; with one Weatherwoman telling feminist poet Robin Morgan &quot;You have no right to that pig male baby&quot; after she saw Morgan breastfeeding her son and told Morgan to put the baby in the garbage. Charles Manson was an obsession within the group and Bernardine Dohrn claimed he truly understood the iniquity of white America, with the Manson family being praised for the murder of Sharon Tate; Dohrn&#x27;s cell subsequently made its salute a four-fingered gesture that represented the &quot;fork&quot; used to stab Tate.

===Practice===
Shortly after its formation as an independent group, Weatherman created a central committee, the Weather Bureau, which assigned its cadres to a series of collectives in major cities. These cities included New York, Boston, Seattle, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Buffalo, and Chicago, the home of the SDS&#x27;s head office. The collectives set up under the Weather Bureau drew their design from Che Guevara&#x27;s &quot;foco&quot; theory, which focused on the building of small, semi-autonomous cells guided by a central leadership.

To try to turn their members into hardened revolutionaries and to promote solidarity and cohesion, members of collectives engaged in intensive criticism sessions which attempted to reconcile their prior and current activities to Weathermen doctrine. These &quot;criticism self-criticism&quot; sessions (also called &quot;CSC&quot; or &quot;Weatherfries&quot;) were the most distressing part of life in the collective. Derived from Maoist techniques, it was intended to root out racist, individualist and chauvinist tendencies within group members. At its most intense, members would be berated for a dozen or more hours non-stop about their flaws. It was intended to make group members believe that they were, deep down, white supremacists by subjecting them to constant criticism to break them down. The sessions were used to ridicule and bully those who didn&#x27;t agree with the party line and force them into acceptance. However, the sessions were also almost entirely successful at purging potential informants from the Weathermen&#x27;s ranks, making them crucial to the Weathermen&#x27;s survival as an underground organization. The Weathermen were also determined to destroy &quot;bourgeois individualism&quot; amongst members that would potentially interfere with their commitment to both the Weathermen and the goal of revolution. Personal property was either renounced or given to the collective, with income being used to purchase the needs of the group and members enduring Spartan living conditions. Conventional comforts were forbidden, and the leadership was exalted, giving them immense power over their subordinates (in some collectives the leadership could even dictate personal decisions such as where one went). Martial arts were practiced and occasional direct actions were engaged in. Critical of monogamy, they launched a &quot;smash monogamy&quot; campaign, in which couples (whose affection was deemed unacceptably possessive, counterrevolutionary or even selfish) were to be split apart; collectives underwent forced rotation of sex partners (including allegations that some male leaders rotated women between collectives in order to sleep with them) and in some cases engaged in sexual orgies. This formation continued during 1969 and 1970 until the group went underground and a more relaxed lifestyle was adopted as the group blended into the counterculture.

Life in the collectives could be particularly hard for women, who made up about half the members. Their political awakening had included a growing awareness of sexism, yet they often found that men took the lead in political activities and discussion, with women often engaging in domestic work, as well as finding themselves confined to second-tier leadership roles. Certain feminist political beliefs had to be disavowed or muted and the women had to prove, regardless of prior activist credentials, that they were as capable as men in engaging in political action as part of &quot;women&#x27;s cadres&quot;, which were felt to be driven by coerced machismo and failed to promote genuine solidarity amongst the women. While the Weathermen&#x27;s sexual politics did allow women to assert desire and explore relationships with each other, it also made them vulnerable to sexual exploitation.

===Recruitment===
Weather used various means by which to recruit new members and set into motion a nationwide revolt against the government. Weather members aimed to mobilize people into action against the established leaders of the nation and the patterns of injustice which existed in America and abroad due to America&#x27;s presence overseas. They also aimed to convince people to resist reliance upon their given privilege and to rebel and take arms if necessary. According to Weatherman, if people tolerated the unjust actions of the state, they became complicit in those actions. In the manifesto compiled by Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, Jeff Jones, and Celia Sojourn, entitled &quot;Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism,&quot; Weatherman explained that their intention was to encourage the people and provoke leaps in confidence and consciousness in an attempt to stir the imagination, organize the masses, and join in the people&#x27;s day-to-day struggles in every way possible.

In the year 1960, over a third of America&#x27;s population was under 18 years of age. The number of young citizens set the stage for a widespread revolt against perceived structures of racism, sexism, and classism, the violence of the Vietnam War and America&#x27;s interventions abroad. At college campuses throughout the country, anger against &quot;the Establishment&#x27;s&quot; practices prompted both peaceful and violent protest.
The members of Weatherman targeted high school and college students, assuming they would be willing to rebel against the authoritative figures who had oppressed them, including cops, principals, and bosses. Weather aimed to develop roots within the class struggle, targeting white working-class youths. The younger members of the working class became the focus of the organizing effort because they felt the oppression strongly in regard to the military draft, low-wage jobs, and schooling.

Schools became a common place of recruitment for the movement. In direct actions, dubbed Jailbreaks, Weather members invaded educational institutions as a means by which to recruit high school and college students. The motivation of these jailbreaks was the organization&#x27;s belief that school was where the youth were oppressed by the system and where they learned to tolerate society&#x27;s faults instead of rise against them. According to &quot;Prairie Fire&quot;, young people are channeled, coerced, misled, miseducated, misused in the school setting. It is in schools that the youth of the nation become alienated from the authentic processes of learning about the world.

Factions of the Weatherman organization began recruiting members by applying their own strategies. Women&#x27;s groups such as The Motor City Nine and Cell 16 took the lead in various recruitment efforts. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, a member of the radical women&#x27;s liberation group Cell 16 spoke about her personal recruitment agenda saying that she wanted their group to go out in every corner of the country and tell women the truth, recruit the local people, poor and working-class people, in order to build a new society.

Berger explains the controversy surrounding recruitment strategies saying, &quot;As an organizing strategy it was less than successful: white working class youths were more alienated than organized by Weather&#x27;s spectacles, and even some of those interested in the group were turned off by its early hi-jinks.&quot;

====Armed propaganda====
In 2006, Dan Berger (writer, activist, and longtime anti-racism organizer) states that following their initial set of bombings, which resulted in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, the organization adopted a new paradigm of direct action set forth in the communiqué &quot;New Morning, Changing Weather&quot;, which abjured attacks on people. The shift in the organization&#x27;s outlook was in good part due to the 1970 death of Weatherman Terry Robbins, Diana Oughton and Ted Gold, all graduate students, in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion.

According to Dan Berger a relatively sophisticated program of armed propaganda was adopted. This consisted of a series of bombings of government and corporate targets in retaliation for specific imperialist and oppressive acts. Small, well-constructed time bombs were used, generally in vents in restrooms, which exploded at times the spaces were empty. Timely warnings were made, and communiqués issued explaining the reason for the actions.

== Major activities==
===Haymarket Police Memorial bombing===

Shortly before the Days of Rage demonstrations on October 6, 1969, the Weatherman planted a bomb which blew up a statue in Chicago commemorating the deaths of police officers during the 1886 Haymarket Riot. The blast broke nearly 100 windows and scattered pieces of the statue onto the Kennedy Expressway below. The city rebuilt the statue and unveiled it on May 4, 1970, but the Weathermen blew it up as well on October 6, 1970. The city rebuilt the statue once again, and Mayor Richard J. Daley posted a 24-hour police guard to protect it, but the Weathermen destroyed the third one, as well. The city compromised and rebuilt the monument once more, but this time they located it at Chicago Police Headquarters.

===&quot;Days of Rage&quot;===

One of the first acts of the Weathermen after splitting from SDS was to announce they would hold the &quot;Days of Rage&quot; that autumn. This was advertised to &quot;Bring the war home!&quot; Hoping to cause sufficient chaos to &quot;wake&quot; the American public out of what they saw as complacency toward the role of the U.S. in the Vietnam War, the Weathermen meant it to be the largest protest of the decade. They had been told by their regional cadre to expect thousands to attend; however, when they arrived, they found only a few hundred people.

According to Bill Ayers in 2003, &quot;The Days of Rage was an attempt to break from the norms of kind of acceptable theatre of &#x27;here are the anti-war people: containable, marginal, predictable, and here&#x27;s the little path they&#x27;re going to march down, and here&#x27;s where they can make their little statement.&#x27; We wanted to say, &quot;No, what we&#x27;re going to do is whatever we had to do to stop the violence in Vietnam.&#x27;&quot; The protests did not meet Ayers&#x27; stated expectations.

Though the October 8, 1969, rally in Chicago had failed to draw as many as the Weathermen had anticipated, the two or three hundred who did attend shocked police by rioting through the affluent Gold Coast neighborhood. They smashed the windows of a bank and those of many cars. The crowd ran four blocks before encountering police barricades. They charged the police but broke into small groups; more than 1,000 police counter attacked. Many protesters were wearing motorcycle or football helmets, but the police were well trained and armed. Large amounts of tear gas were used, and at least twice police ran squad cars into the mob. The rioting lasted about half an hour, during which 28 policemen were injured. Six Weathermen were shot by the police and an unknown number injured; 68 rioters were arrested.

For the next two days, the Weathermen held no rallies or protests. Supporters of the RYM II movement, led by Klonsky and Noel Ignatin, held peaceful rallies in front of the federal courthouse, an International Harvester factory, and Cook County Hospital. The largest event of the Days of Rage took place on Friday, October 9, when RYM II led an interracial march of 2,000 people through a Spanish-speaking part of Chicago.

On October 10, the Weatherman attempted to regroup and resume their demonstrations. About 300 protesters marched through The Loop, Chicago&#x27;s main business district, watched by a double line of heavily armed police. The protesters suddenly broke through the police lines and rampaged through the Loop, smashing the windows of cars and stores. The police were prepared, and quickly isolated the rioters. Within 15 minutes, more than half the crowd had been arrested.

The Days of Rage cost Chicago and the state of Illinois about $183,000 ($100,000 for National Guard expenses, $35,000 in damages, and $20,000 for one injured citizen&#x27;s medical expenses). Most of the Weathermen and SDS leaders were now in jail, and the Weathermen would have to pay over $243,000 for their bail.

===Flint War Council===

The Flint War Council was a series of meetings of the Weather Underground Organization and associates in Flint, Michigan, that took place 27–31 December 1969. During these meetings, the decisions were made for the Weather Underground Organization to go underground and to &quot;engage in guerilla warfare against the U.S. government.&quot; This decision was made in response to increased pressure from law enforcement, and a belief that underground guerilla warfare was the best way to combat the U.S. government.

During a closed-door meeting of the Weather Underground&#x27;s leadership, the decision was also taken to abolish Students for a Democratic Society. This decision reflected the splintering of SDS into hostile rival factions.

===New York City arson attacks===
On February 21, 1970, at around 4:30 a.m., three gasoline-filled Molotov cocktails exploded in front of the home of New York Supreme Court Justice John M. Murtagh, who was presiding over the pretrial hearings of the so-called &quot;Panther 21&quot; members of the Black Panther Party over a plot to bomb New York landmarks and department stores. Justice Murtagh and his family were unharmed, but two panes of a front window were shattered, an overhanging wooden eave was scorched, and the paint on a car in the garage was charred. &quot;Free the Panther 21&quot; and &quot;Viet Cong have won&quot; were written in large red letters on the sidewalk in front of the judge&#x27;s house at 529 W. 217th Street in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan. The judge&#x27;s house had been under hourly police surveillance and an unidentified woman called the police a few minutes before the explosions to report several prowlers there, which resulted in a police car being sent immediately to the scene.

In the preceding hours, Molotov cocktails had been thrown at the second floor of Columbia University&#x27;s International Law Library at 434 W. 116th Street and at a police car parked across the street from the Charles Street police station in the West Village in Manhattan, and at Army and Navy recruiting booths on Nostrand Avenue on the eastern fringe of the Brooklyn College campus in Brooklyn, causing no or minimal damage in incidents of unknown relation to that at Judge Murtagh&#x27;s home.

According to the December 6, 1970, &quot;New Morning—Changing Weather&quot; Weather Underground communiqué signed by Bernardine Dohrn, and Cathy Wilkerson&#x27;s 2007 memoir, the fire-bombing of Judge Murtagh&#x27;s home, in solidarity with the Panther 21, was carried out by four members of the New York cell that was devastated two weeks later by the March 6, 1970, townhouse explosion.

===Greenwich Village townhouse explosion===
Weather Underground members Diana Oughton, Ted Gold, Terry Robbins, Cathy Wilkerson, and Kathy Boudin were making bombs in a Greenwich Village townhouse on March 6, 1970, when one of the bombs detonated. Oughton, Gold, and Robbins were killed; Wilkerson and Boudin escaped unharmed.

These bombs were made to target a Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) dance at Fort Dix, which would be attended by non-commissioned officers and their companions, as well as Butler Library at Columbia University. An FBI report stated that they had enough explosives to &quot;level ... both sides of the street&quot;. Weather Underground leadership members Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, and Jeff Jones claimed the planned bombings of the Fort Dix NCO dance and Columbia University building were a rogue operation led by more extreme Greenwich Village townhouse residents, Ayers singling out Terry Robbins. However, later researchers concluded Weather Underground leaders planned and approved the bombings of an NCO dance, a Columbia University building, and several bombings in Detroit which were defused by the Detroit Police aided by informant Larry Grathwohl.

The site of the Village explosion was the former residence of Charles Merrill, co-founder of the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm, and the childhood home of his son James Merrill. James Merrill memorialized the event in his poem &quot;18 West 11th Street&quot;, the address of the brownstone townhouse.

====Underground strategy change====

After the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, per the December 1969 Flint War Council decisions the group was now well underground, and began to refer to themselves as the Weather Underground Organization. At this juncture, WUO shrank considerably, becoming even fewer than they had been when first formed. The group was devastated by the loss of their friends, and in late April 1970, members of the Weathermen met in California to discuss what had happened in New York and the future of the organization.

In 2003, Weather Underground members stated in interviews that they had wanted to convince the American public that the United States was truly responsible for the calamity in Vietnam. The group began striking at night, bombing empty offices, with warnings always issued in advance to ensure a safe evacuation. According to David Gilbert, who took part in the 1981 Brink&#x27;s robbery that killed two police officers and a Brink&#x27;s guard, and was jailed for murder, &quot;[their] goal was to not hurt any people, and a lot of work went into that. But we wanted to pick targets that showed to the public who was responsible for what was really going on.&quot; After the Greenwich Village explosion, in a review of the documentary film &quot;The Weather Underground&quot; (2002), a &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist restated the film&#x27;s contention that no one was killed by WUO bombs.

===Declaration of war===
In response to the death of Black Panther members Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in December 1969 during a police raid, and the Kent State Shootings 5 months later, on May 21, 1970, the Weather Underground issued a &quot;Declaration of War&quot; against the United States government, using for the first time its new name, the &quot;Weather Underground Organization&quot; (WUO), adopting fake identities, and pursuing covert activities only. These initially included preparations for a bombing of a U.S. military non-commissioned officers&#x27; dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey, in what Brian Flanagan said had been intended to be &quot;the most horrific hit the United States government had ever suffered on its territory&quot;.

Bernardine Dohrn subsequently stated that it was Fred Hampton&#x27;s death that prompted the Weather Underground to declare war on the U.S. government.

In December 1969, the Chicago Police Department, in conjunction with the FBI, conducted a raid on the home of Black Panther Fred Hampton, in which he and Mark Clark were killed, with four of the seven other people in the apartment wounded. The survivors of the raid were all charged with assault and attempted murder. The police claimed they shot in self-defense, although a controversy arose when the Panthers, other activists and a Chicago newspaper reporter presented visual evidence, as well as the testimony of an FBI ballistics expert, showing that the sleeping Panthers were not resisting arrest and fired only one shot, as opposed to the more than one hundred the police fired into the apartment. The charges were later dropped, and the families of the dead won a $1.8 million settlement from the government. It was discovered in 1971 that Hampton had been targeted by the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO. True to Dohrn&#x27;s words, this single event, in the continuing string of public killings of black leaders of any political stripe, was the trigger that pushed a large number of Weatherman and other students who had just attended the last SDS national convention months earlier to go underground and develop its logistical support network nationally.

On May 21, 1970, a communiqué from the Weather Underground was issued promising to attack a &quot;symbol or institution of American injustice&quot; within two weeks. The communiqué included taunts towards the FBI, daring them to try to find the group, whose members were spread throughout the United States. Many leftist organizations showed curiosity in the communiqué, and waited to see if the act would in fact occur. However, two weeks would pass without any occurrence. Then on June 9, 1970, their first publicly acknowledged bombing occurred at a New York City police station. The FBI placed the Weather Underground organization on the ten most-wanted list by the end of 1970.

===Activity in 1970===
On June 9, 1970, a bomb made with ten sticks of dynamite exploded in the 240 Centre Street headquarters of the New York City Police Department. The explosion was preceded by a warning about six minutes prior to the detonation and was followed by a WUO claim of responsibility.

On July 23, 1970, a Detroit federal grand jury indicted 13 Weathermen members in a national bombing conspiracy, along with several unnamed co-conspirators. Ten of the thirteen already had outstanding federal warrants.

In September 1970, the group accepted a $20,000 payment from the largest international psychedelic drug distribution organization, called The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, to break LSD advocate Timothy Leary out of a California prison in San Luis Obispo, north of Santa Barbara, California, and transport him and his wife to Algeria, where Leary joined Eldridge Cleaver.

In October 1970, Bernardine Dohrn was put on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted List.

===United States Capitol bombing===
On March 1, 1971, members of the Weather Underground set off a bomb on the Senate side of the United States Capitol. While the bomb smashed windows and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of damage, there were no casualties.

===Pentagon bombing===

On May 19, 1972, Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s birthday, the Weather Underground placed a bomb in the women&#x27;s bathroom in the Air Force wing of the Pentagon. The damage caused flooding that destroyed computer tapes holding classified information. Other radical groups worldwide applauded the bombing, illustrated by German youths protesting against American military systems in Frankfurt. This was &quot;in retaliation for the U.S. bombing raid in Hanoi.&quot;

===Withdrawal of charges===
In 1973, the government requested dropping charges against most of the WUO members. The requests cited a recent decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that barred electronic surveillance without a court order. This Supreme Court decision would hamper any prosecution of the WUO cases. In addition, the government did not want to reveal foreign intelligence secrets that a trial would require. Bernardine Dohrn was removed from the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted List on 7 December 1973. As with the earlier federal grand juries that subpoenaed Leslie Bacon and Stew Albert in the U.S. Capitol bombing case, these investigations were known as &quot;fishing expeditions&quot;, with the evidence gathered through &quot;black bag&quot; jobs including illegal mail openings that involved the FBI and United States Postal Service, burglaries by FBI field offices, and electronic surveillance by the Central Intelligence Agency against the support network, friends, and family members of the Weather Underground as part of Nixon&#x27;s COINTELPRO apparatus.

These grand juries caused Sylvia Jane Brown, Robert Gelbhard, and future members of the Seattle Weather Collective to be subpoenaed in Seattle and Portland for the investigation of one of the first (and last) captured WUO members. Four months afterwards the cases were dismissed. The decisions in these cases led directly to the subsequent resignation of FBI Director, L. Patrick Gray, and the federal indictments of W. Mark Felt or &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and Edwin Miller and which, earlier, was the factor leading to the removal of federal &quot;most-wanted&quot; status against members of the Weather Underground leadership in 1973.

===&quot;Prairie Fire&quot;===
With the help of Clayton Van Lydegraf, the Weather Underground sought a more Marxist–Leninist ideological approach to the post-Vietnam reality. The leading members of the Weather Underground (Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, Jeff Jones, and Celia Sojourn) collaborated on ideas and published a manifesto: &quot;Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism.&quot; The name came from a quote by Mao Zedong, &quot;a single spark can set a prairie fire.&quot; By the summer of 1974, five thousand copies had surfaced in coffee houses, bookstores and public libraries across the U.S. Leftist newspapers praised the manifesto.

Abbie Hoffman publicly praised &quot;Prairie Fire&quot; and believed every American should be given a copy. The manifesto&#x27;s influence initiated the formation of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee in several American cities. Hundreds of above-ground activists helped further the new political vision of the Weather Underground. Essentially, after the 1969 failure of the Days of Rage to involve thousands of youths in massive street fighting, Weather renounced most of the Left and decided to operate as an isolated underground group. Prairie Fire urged people to never &quot;dissociate mass struggle from revolutionary violence&quot;. To do so, asserted Weather, was to do the state&#x27;s work. Just as in 1969–1970, Weather still refused to renounce revolutionary violence for &quot;to leave people unprepared to fight the state is to seriously mislead them about the inevitable nature of what lies ahead&quot;. However, the decision to build only an underground group caused the Weather Underground to lose sight of its commitment to mass struggle and made future alliances with the mass movement difficult and tenuous.

By 1974, Weather had recognized this shortcoming and in &quot;Prairie Fire&quot; detailed a different strategy for the 1970s which demanded both mass and clandestine organizations. The role of a clandestine organization would be to build the &quot;consciousness of action&quot; and prepare the way for the development of a people&#x27;s militia. Concurrently, the role of the mass movement (i.e., above-ground Prairie Fire collective) would include support for, and encouragement of, armed action. Such an alliance would, according to Weather, &quot;help create the &#x27;sea&#x27; for the guerrillas to swim in&quot;.

According to Bill Ayers, writing in 2001, by the late 1970s, the Weatherman group had further split into two factions—the May 19th Communist Organization and the Prairie Fire Collective—with Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers in the latter. The Prairie Fire Collective favored coming out of hiding and establishing an above-ground revolutionary mass movement. With most WUO members facing limited criminal charges (most charges had been dropped by the government in 1973) against them creating an above-ground organization was more feasible. The May 19 Communist Organization continued in hiding as the clandestine organization. A decisive factor in Dohrn&#x27;s coming out of hiding was her concerns about her children. The Prairie Fire Collective faction started to surrender to the authorities from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The remaining Weather Underground members continued to attack U.S. institutions.

==COINTELPRO==
===Event===
In April 1971, the &quot;Citizens&#x27; Commission to Investigate the FBI&quot; broke into an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania. The group stole files with several hundred pages. The files detailed the targeting of civil rights leaders, labor rights organizations, and left-wing groups in general, and included documentation of acts of intimidation and disinformation by the FBI and attempts to erode public support for those popular movements. By the end of April, the FBI offices were to terminate all files dealing with leftist groups. The files were part of an FBI program called COINTELPRO.

After COINTELPRO was dissolved in 1971 by J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI continued its counterintelligence on groups like the Weather Underground. In 1973, the FBI established the &quot;Special Target Information Development&quot; program, where agents were sent undercover to penetrate the Weather Underground. Due to the illegal tactics of FBI agents involved with the program, government attorneys requested all weapons- and bomb-related charges be dropped against the Weather Underground. The most well-publicized of these tactics were the &quot;black-bag jobs,&quot; referring to searches conducted in the homes of relatives and acquaintances of Weatherman. The Weather Underground was no longer a fugitive organization and could turn themselves in with minimal charges against them. Additionally, the illegal domestic spying conducted by the CIA in collaboration with the FBI also lessened the legal repercussions for Weatherman turning themselves in.

===Investigation and trial===
After the Church Committee revealed the FBI&#x27;s illegal activities, many agents were investigated. In 1976, former FBI Associate Director W. Mark Felt publicly stated he had ordered break-ins and that individual agents were merely obeying orders and should not be punished for it. Felt also stated that acting Director L. Patrick Gray had also authorized the break-ins, but Gray denied this. Felt said on the CBS television program &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that he would probably be a &quot;scapegoat&quot; for the Bureau&#x27;s work. &quot;I think this is justified and I&#x27;d do it again tomorrow,&quot; he said on the program. While admitting the break-ins were &quot;extralegal,&quot; he justified it as protecting the &quot;greater good.&quot; Felt said, &quot;To not take action against these people and know of a bombing in advance would simply be to stick your fingers in your ears and protect your eardrums when the explosion went off and then start the investigation.&quot;

The Attorney General in the new Carter administration, Griffin Bell, investigated, and on April 10, 1978, a federal grand jury charged Felt, Edward S. Miller, and Gray with conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by searching their homes without warrants. The case did not go to trial and was dropped by the government for lack of evidence on December 11, 1980.

The indictment charged violations of Title 18, Section 241 of the United States Code. The indictment charged Felt and the others &quot;did unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to injure and oppress citizens of the United States who were relatives and acquaintances of the Weatherman fugitives, in the free exercise and enjoyments of certain rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.

Felt and Miller attempted to plea bargain with the government, willing to agree to a misdemeanor guilty plea to conducting searches without warrants—a violation of 18 U.S.C. sec. 2236—but the government rejected the offer in 1979. After eight postponements, the case against Felt and Miller went to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 18, 1980. On October 29, former President Richard Nixon appeared as a rebuttal witness for the defense, and testified that presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt had authorized the bureau to engage in break-ins while conducting foreign intelligence and counterespionage investigations.

It was Nixon&#x27;s first courtroom appearance since his resignation in 1974. Nixon also contributed money to Felt&#x27;s legal defense fund, with Felt&#x27;s legal expenses running over $600,000. Also testifying were former Attorneys General Herbert Brownell Jr., Nicholas Katzenbach, Ramsey Clark, John N. Mitchell, and Richard G. Kleindienst, all of whom said warrantless searches in national security matters were commonplace and not understood to be illegal, but Mitchell and Kleindienst denied they had authorized any of the break-ins at issue in the trial.

The jury returned guilty verdicts on November 6, 1980. Although the charge carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, Felt was fined $5,000. (Miller was fined $3,500.) Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; a week after the conviction, Roy Cohn claimed that Felt and Miller were being used as scapegoats by the Carter administration and that it was an unfair prosecution. Cohn wrote it was the &quot;final dirty trick&quot; and that there had been no &quot;personal motive&quot; for their actions.

&quot;The Times&quot; saluted the convictions, saying that it showed &quot;the case has established that zeal is no excuse for violating the Constitution&quot;. Felt and Miller appealed the verdict, and they were later pardoned by Ronald Reagan.

==Dissolution==
Despite the change in their legal status, the Weather Underground remained underground for a few more years. However, by 1976 the organization was disintegrating. The Weather Underground held a conference in Chicago called Hard Times. The idea was to create an umbrella organization for all radical groups. However, the event turned sour when Hispanic and Black groups accused the Weather Underground and the Prairie Fire Committee of limiting their roles in racial issues. The Weather Underground faced accusations of abandonment of the revolution by reversing their original ideology.

The conference increased divisions within the Weather Underground. East coast members favored a commitment to violence and challenged the commitments of old leaders, Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, and Jeff Jones. These older members found they were no longer liable for federal prosecution because of illegal wire taps and the government&#x27;s unwillingness to reveal sources and methods favored a strategy of inversion where they would be above-ground &quot;revolutionary leaders&quot;. Jeremy Varon argues that by 1977 the WUO had disbanded.

Matthew Steen appeared on the lead segment of CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 1976 and was interviewed by Mike Wallace about the ease of creating fake identification, the first ex-Weatherman interview on national television. (The House document has the date wrong, it aired February 1, 1976, and the title was Fake ID.)

The federal government estimated that only 38 Weathermen had gone underground in 1970, though the estimates varied widely, according to a variety of official and unofficial sources, as between 50 and 600 members. Most modern sources lean towards a much larger number than the FBI reference. An FBI estimate in 1976, or slightly later, of the current membership was down to 30 or fewer.

===Plot to bomb the office of a California State Senator===
In November 1977, five WUO members were arrested on conspiracy to bomb the office of California State Senator John Briggs. It was later revealed that the Revolutionary Committee and the PFOC had both been infiltrated by the FBI for almost six years. FBI agents Richard J. Gianotti and William D. Reagan lost their cover in November when federal judges needed their testimony to issue warrants for the arrest of Clayton Van Lydegraf and four Weather people. The arrests were the results of the infiltration. WUO members Judith Bissell, Thomas Justesen, Leslie Mullin, and Marc Curtis pleaded guilty while Van Lydegraf, who helped write the 1974 Prairie Fire Manifesto, went to trial.

Within two years, many members took advantage of President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s amnesty for draft dodgers by turning themselves in. Mark Rudd turned himself into authorities on January 20, 1978. Rudd was fined $4,000 and received two years&#x27; probation. Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers turned themselves in on December 3, 1980, in New York, with substantial media coverage. Charges were dropped for Ayers. Dohrn received three years&#x27; probation and a $15,000 fine.

===Brink&#x27;s robbery===

Some members remained underground and joined splinter radical groups. The U.S. government states that years after the dissolution of the Weather Underground, three former members, Kathy Boudin, Judith Alice Clark, and David Gilbert, joined the May 19 Communist Organization, and on October 20, 1981, in Nanuet, New York, the group helped the Black Liberation Army rob a Brink&#x27;s armored truck containing $1.6 million. The robbery resulted in a shootout and the deaths of Brink&#x27;s Guard Peter Paige, Police Sergeant Edward O&#x27;Grady Jr., and Police Officer Waverly Brown, the first black police officer on the Nyack police force.

Boudin, Clark, and Gilbert were found guilty and sentenced to lengthy terms in prison. Media reports listed them as former Weatherman Underground members considered the &quot;last gasps&quot; of the Weather Underground. The documentary &quot;The Weather Underground&quot; described the Brink&#x27;s robbery as the &quot;unofficial end&quot; of the Weather Underground.

===May 19th Communist Organization===

The Weather Underground members who were involved in the May 19th Communist Organization&#x27;s alliance with the Black Liberation Army continued to perpetrate a series of jail breaks, armed robberies and bombings until 1985, when most of them were finally arrested and sentenced for their involvement in the Brink&#x27;s robbery and the Resistance Conspiracy case.

==Coalitions with non-WUO members==

Throughout their years in the underground, the members of the Weather Underground worked closely with their counterparts in other organizations, including Jane Alpert, to bring attention to their further actions to the press. She helped the Weathermen pursue their main goal of overthrowing the U.S. government through her writings. However, there were tensions within the organization, brought about by her famous manifesto, &quot;Mother Right&quot;, that specifically called on the female members of the organization to focus on their own cause rather than anti-imperialist causes. Weather members then wrote in response to her manifesto.

==Legacy==
Widely known members of the Weather Underground include Kathy Boudin, Linda Sue Evans, Brian Flanagan, David Gilbert, Ted Gold, Naomi Jaffe, Jeff Jones, Joe Kelly, Diana Oughton, Eleanor Raskin, Terry Robbins, Mark Rudd, Matthew Steen, Susan Stern, Laura Whitehorn, Eric Mann, Cathy Wilkerson, and the married couple Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers.

The Weather Underground was referred to as a terrorist group by articles in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, United Press International, and &quot;Time&quot; Magazine. The group fell under the jurisdiction of the FBI-New York City Police Anti-Terrorist Task Force, a forerunner of the FBI&#x27;s Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The FBI refers to the organization in a 2004 news story titled &quot;Byte out of History&quot; published on its website as having been a &quot;domestic terrorist group&quot; that is no longer an active concern. Some members have disputed the &quot;terrorist&quot; categorization and justified the group&#x27;s actions as an appropriate response to what they described as the &quot;terrorist activities&quot; of the war in Vietnam, domestic racism, and the deaths of black leaders.

Ayers objected to the description of the WUO as a terrorist organization in his 2001 book &quot;Fugitive Days&quot;. &quot;Terrorists terrorize,&quot; he argues, &quot;they kill innocent civilians, while we organized and agitated. Terrorists destroy randomly, while our actions bore, we hoped, the precise stamp of a cut diamond. Terrorists intimidate, while we aimed only to educate.&quot; Dan Berger asserts in &quot;Outlaws of America&quot; that the group &quot;purposefully and successfully avoided injuring anyone&quot; as an argument that their actions were not terrorism. &quot;Its war against property by definition means that the WUO was not a terrorist organization.&quot;

Others, however, have suggested that these arguments are specious. Former Weather Underground member Mark Rudd admitted that the group intended to target people prior to the accidental explosion in the town house. &quot;On the morning of March 6, 1970, three of my comrades were building pipe bombs packed with dynamite and nails, destined for a dance of non-commissioned officers and their dates at Fort Dix, New Jersey, that night.&quot; Grand juries were convened in 2001 and 2009 to investigate whether Weather Underground was responsible for the San Francisco Police Department Park Station bombing, in which one officer was killed, one was maimed, and eight more were wounded by shrapnel from a pipe bomb. They ultimately concluded that members of the Black Liberation Army were responsible, with whom WUO members were affiliated. They were also responsible for the bombing of another police precinct in San Francisco, as well as bombing the Catholic Church funeral services of the police officer killed in the Park Precinct bombing in the early summer of 1970. Ayers said in a 2001 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, &quot;I don&#x27;t regret setting bombs&quot;. He has since claimed that he was misquoted. Mark Rudd teaches mathematics at Central New Mexico Community College, and he has said that he doesn&#x27;t speak publicly about his experiences because he has &quot;mixed feelings, guilt and shame&quot;. &quot;These are things I am not proud of, and I find it hard to speak publicly about them and to tease out what was right from what was wrong.&quot;

<text>A war hammer (French: &quot;martel-de-fer&quot;, &quot;iron hammer&quot;) is a weapon that was used by both foot soldiers and cavalry. It is a very old weapon and gave its name, owing to its constant use, to Judah Maccabee, a 2nd-century BC Jewish rebel, and to Charles Martel, one of the rulers of France. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the war hammer became an elaborately decorated and handsome weapon.

The war hammer was a popular weapon in the late medieval period. It became somewhat of a necessity in combat when armor became so strong that swords and axes were no longer able to pierce and ricocheted upon impact. The war hammer could inflict significant damage on the enemy through their heavy impact without the need to pierce the armor.

==Design==

A war hammer consists of a handle and a head. The length of the handle may vary, the longest being roughly equivalent to that of a halberd (five to six feet or 1.5 to 1.8 meters), and the shortest about the same as that of a mace (two to three feet or 60 to 90 centimeters). Long war hammers were polearms meant for use on foot, whereas short ones were used from horseback.

War hammers, especially when mounted on a pole, could in some cases transmit their impact through helmets and cause concussions. Later war hammers often had a spike on one side of the head, making them more versatile weapons.

The spike end could be used for grappling the target&#x27;s armor, reins, or shield. If against mounted opponents, the weapon could be directed at the legs of a horse, toppling the armored foe to the ground where they could be more easily attacked. The blunt side of a war hammer was usually used first to knock down and stun an enemy and, once the opponent were immobilized on the ground, the hammer is rotated around to hit the target with the pointed side, which can punch a hole through the helmet and deliver the coup de grâce. A powerful swing from a war hammer (especially with the spike) can deliver a strike force of several hundred kilograms per square millimeterthis is the same penetrating force as a rifle bullet.

==Maul==
A maul is a long-handled hammer with a heavy head, of wood, lead, iron, or steel. It is similar in appearance and function to a modern sledgehammer, it is sometimes shown as having a spear-like spike on the fore-end of the shaft.

The use of the maul as a weapon seems to date from the later 14th century. During the Harelle of 1382, rebellious citizens of Paris seized 3000 mauls () from the city armory, leading to the rebels&#x27; being dubbed &quot;Maillotins&quot;. Later in the same year, Froissart records French men-at-arms using mauls at the Battle of Roosebeke, demonstrating that they were not simply weapons of the lower classes.

A particular use of the maul was by archers in the 15th and 16th centuries. At the Battle of Agincourt, English longbowmen are recorded as using lead mauls, initially as a tool to drive in stakes but later as improvised weapons. Other references during the century (for example, in Charles the Bold&#x27;s 1472 Ordinance) suggest continued use. They are recorded as a weapon of Tudor archers as late as 1562.

==History==
Full-fledged warhammers emerged in the mid-14th century as a direct response to the growing prevalence and effectiveness of plate armor on European battlefields. By 1395, French infantry deployed sophisticated warhammers equipped with thrusting tips, side flanges, and a basic beak, known as &quot;Picoise.&quot; These initially single-handed warhammers would later evolve into longer two-handed pole hammers, becoming not only widespread on European battlefields but also prominent in duels, particularly those involving armored combatants in tournaments or judicial settings. 

In the context of duels, the pole hammer was often categorized as a subtype of the pole-axe, commonly referred to as &quot;axes&quot; in period fencing manuals (German: (Mord)Axt, Italian: (Azza)). Pole hammers designed for duels frequently featured a rondel-shaped guard to protect the forward hand and a spike at the rear for increased versatility. Some variants also incorporated additional hooks at the rear to facilitate binding enemy weapons and limbs. While earlier pole hammers had flat surfaces, by the 15th century, there was a trend towards dividing the hammerhead into three or four diamond-shaped tips to avoid the head of the weapon from sliding on armor plate and to focus the impact onto a smaller area. According to Austrian army officer and weapons expert Wendelin Boeheim, these modifications were primarily driven by aesthetic considerations rather than functional improvements. In some instances, the hammer surface featured the monogram of its owner, enabling the identification of victims on the battlefield. 

Starting from the 15th century, shorter warhammers found use as cavalry weapons. Initially rejected by the nobility due to their commoner origins, practicality eventually compelled their adoption. This perception would later shift, with cavalry commanders, known as Rottmeister (lit. packmaster), carrying warhammers both as weapons and symbols of rank. These hammers became known as &quot;Rottmeister hammers&quot; or &quot;packmaster hammers.&quot; In landsknecht armies, a similar connotation existed, where hammers evolved into status symbols among the lower nobility in eastern parts of central Europe (Poland-Lithuania/Hungary), second only to sabers in prestige. According to Polish aristocrat Andrzej Kitowicz, a nobleman would not leave his house without his saber and his warhammer, which could also serve as a walking stick. Late Central European hammers can be categorized into three subtypes: the Czekan, a warhammer with a flattened square or hexagonal surface and a bearded axe blade on the back; the Nadziak, a classic warhammer with a flattened square or hexagonal surface and a beak at the back; and the Ogbur, similar to the Nadziak but with an S-shaped or strictly curved beak on the back. All these types shared the characteristic of having staffs made from hard wood, often extending over the socket, and lacking a thrusting tip. 

While the warhammer fell out of favor in most parts of Europe, it remained popular in Poland and Hungary until the first half of the 18th century.

<text>Wulfstan of Hedeby was a late ninth-century traveller and trader. His travel accounts, as well as those of another trader, Ohthere of Hålogaland, were included in the &quot;Old English Orosius&quot;. It is unclear if Wulfstan was English or indeed if he was from Hedeby, in what is now northern Germany near the city of Schleswig but in the 9th century was Danish.

According to this account, Wulfstan undertook a journey by sea from Hedeby to the Prussian trading centre of Truso around the year 880. He names the lands the coasts he passes.
This may be the earliest recorded use of the word &quot;Denmark&quot; (&quot;Danemearcan&quot;). The text of Wulfstan is also one of the earliest attestments of unique traditions and customs of Western Balts – Prussians, called Aesti, and their land called Witland in his text. The purpose of this travel remains unclear; one hypothesis is that King Alfred was interested in having allies against Vikings and therefore looked at Prussians (Aesti) as a potential ally.

<text>Warren Thomas Farrell (born June 26, 1943) is an American political scientist and activist who initially came to prominence in the 1970s as a supporter of second wave feminism. He is the author of nine books on the issues of men, women, fathers, and couples’ communication. He served for three years on the New York City Board of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Farrell advocates for &quot;a gender liberation movement&quot;, with &quot;both sexes walking a mile in each other&#x27;s moccasins&quot;.

Farrell&#x27;s books cover history, law, sociology and politics (&quot;The Myth of Male Power&quot;); couples&#x27; communication (&quot;Women Can&#x27;t Hear What Men Don&#x27;t Say&quot;, and &quot;Role Mate to Soul Mate&quot;); economic and career issues (&quot;Why Men Earn More&quot;); child psychology and child custody (&quot;Father and Child Reunion&quot;); and teenage to adult psychology and socialization (&quot;Why Men Are The Way They Are&quot;, &quot;The Liberated Man,&quot; and &quot;The Boy Crisis)&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Farrell was born in 1943. He is the eldest of three children born to an accountant father and housewife mother. He grew up in New Jersey. Farrell graduated from Midland Park High School in New Jersey in 1961.

Farrell received a B.A. from Montclair State University in social sciences in 1965. As a college student, Farrell was a national vice-president of the Student-National Education Association, leading President Lyndon B. Johnson to invite him to the White House Conference on Education.

In 1966, he received an M.A. from the University of California, Los Angeles in political science and in 1974 a Ph.D. in the same discipline from New York University. He was an assistant to the president of New York University.

== University teaching ==
Farrell has taught university level courses in five disciplines (psychology; women&#x27;s studies; sociology; political science; gender and parenting issues). These were at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego; the California School of Professional Psychology; in the Department of Women&#x27;s Studies at San Diego State; at Brooklyn College; Georgetown University; American University, and Rutgers.

== Feminist foundation ==
When the second wave of the women&#x27;s movement evolved in the late 1960s, Farrell&#x27;s support of it led the National Organization for Women&#x27;s New York City chapter to ask him to form a men&#x27;s group. The response to that group led to his ultimately forming some 300 additional men and women&#x27;s groups and becoming the only man to be elected three times to the board of directors of the National Organization for Women in N.Y.C. (1971–74). In 1974, Farrell left N.O.W. in N.Y.C. and his teaching at Rutgers when his wife became a White House Fellow and he moved with her to D.C. They subsequently divorced.
During his feminist period, Farrell wrote op-eds for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and appeared frequently on the &quot;Today&quot; show and &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, and was featured in &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Parade&quot; and the international media. This, and his women and men&#x27;s groups, one of which had been joined by John Lennon, inspired &quot;The Liberated Man&quot;. &quot;The Liberated Man&quot; was written from a feminist perspective, introducing alternative family and work arrangements that could better accommodate working women and encourage care-giving men. &quot;The Liberated Man&quot; was the beginning of Farrell&#x27;s development of parallels for men to the female experience: for example, to women&#x27;s experience as &quot;sex objects&quot;, Farrell labeled men&#x27;s parallel experience as &quot;success objects.&quot;

As a speaker, Farrell was known for creating audience participation role-reversal experiences to get both sexes &quot;to walk a mile in the other&#x27;s moccasins.&quot; The most publicized were his &quot;men&#x27;s beauty contest&quot; and &quot;role-reversal date.&quot; In the men&#x27;s beauty contest, all the men are invited to experience &quot;the beauty contest of everyday life that no woman can escape.&quot; In the &quot;role-reversal date&quot; every woman was encouraged to &quot;risk a few of the 150 risks of rejection men typically experience between eye contact and intercourse.&quot;

== Integrating men&#x27;s issues into gender issues ==

In a 1997 interview, Farrell stated: &quot;Everything went well until the mid-seventies when NOW came out against the presumption of joint custody. I couldn&#x27;t believe the people I thought were pioneers in equality were saying that women should have the first option to have children or not to have children — that children should not have equal rights to their dad.&quot;

=== &quot;Why Men Are the Way They Are&quot; ===
Farrell&#x27;s books each contain personal introductions that describe his perspective on how aspects of public consciousness and his own personal development led to the book. By the mid-1980s, Farrell was writing that both the role-reversal exercises and the women and men&#x27;s groups allowed him to hear women&#x27;s increasing anger toward men, and also learn about men&#x27;s feelings of being misrepresented. He wrote &quot;Why Men Are The Way They Are&quot; to answer women&#x27;s questions about men in a way he hoped rang true for the men.

He distinguished between what he believed to be each sex&#x27;s primary fantasies and primary needs, stating that &quot;both sexes fell in love with members of the other sex who are the least capable of loving: women with men who are successful; men with women who are young and beautiful.&quot; He said that women feel disappointed because, &quot;the qualities it takes to be successful at work are often in tension with the qualities it takes to be successful in love.&quot; He also said that men feel disappointed because, &quot;a young and beautiful woman (&#x27;genetic celebrity&#x27;) often learns more about receiving, not giving, while older and less-attractive women often learn more about giving and doing for others, which is more compatible with love.&quot;

=== &quot;The Myth of Male Power&quot; ===

In 1993, Farrell wrote &quot;The Myth of Male Power&quot;, in which he argued that the widespread perception of men having inordinate social and economic power is false, and that men are systematically disadvantaged in many ways. The book became a foundational text of the Men&#x27;s Rights Movement, and made Farrell one of its leading figures.

&quot;The Myth of Male Power&quot; was ardently challenged by some academic feminists, whose critique is that men earn more money, and that money is power. Farrell concurs that men earn more money, and that money is one form of power. However, Farrell also adds that &quot;men often feel obligated to earn money someone else spends while they die sooner—and feeling &quot;obligated&quot; is not power.&quot; This perspective was to be more fully developed in Farrell&#x27;s &quot;Why Men Earn More&quot;.

Susan Faludi argued that Farrell had effectively recanted his original position as part of a generalized backlash against feminism.

=== &quot;Women Can&#x27;t Hear What Men Don&#x27;t Say&quot; and &quot;Father and Child Reunion&quot; ===
The increase in divorces in the 1980s and 1990s turned Farrell&#x27;s writing toward two issues: the poverty of couples&#x27; communication and children&#x27;s loss of their father in child custody cases.

In &quot;Women Can&#x27;t Hear What Men Don&#x27;t Say&quot;, Farrell asserts that couples often fail to use couples&#x27; communication outside of counseling if the person receiving criticism does not know how to make her or himself feel safe. Farrell develops a method called &quot;Cinematic Immersion&quot; to create that safety and overcome what he posits is humans&#x27; biological propensity to respond defensively to personal criticism.

To address children&#x27;s loss of their father in child custody cases, Farrell wrote &quot;Father and Child Reunion&quot;, a meta-analysis of research about what is the optimal family arrangement for children of divorce. &quot;Father and Child Reunion&#x27;s&quot; findings include some 26 ways in which children of divorce do better when three conditions prevail: equally-shared parenting (or joint custody); close parental proximity; and no bad-mouthing. His research for &quot;Father and Child Reunion&quot; provided the basis for his frequently appearing in the first decade of the 21st Century as an expert witness in child custody cases on the balance between mothers&#x27; and fathers&#x27; rights needed to create the optimal family arrangement for children of divorce.

=== &quot;Why Men Earn More&quot; ===
By the start of the 21st century, Farrell felt he had re-examined every substantial adult male-female issue except the pay gap (i.e., that men as a group tend to earn more money than women as a group). In &quot;Why Men Earn More: The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap—and What Women Can Do About It,&quot; he documents 25 differences in men and women&#x27;s work-life choices which, he argues, account for most or all of the pay gap more accurately than did claims of widespread discrimination against women. Farrell writes that men chose to earn more money, while each of women&#x27;s choices prioritized having a more balanced life. These 25 differences allowed Farrell to offer women 25 ways to higher pay—and accompany each with their possible trade-offs. The trade-offs include working more hours and for more years; taking technical or more hazardous jobs; relocating overseas or traveling overnight. This led to considerable praise for &quot;Why Men Earn More&quot; as a career book for women.

Some of Farrell&#x27;s findings in &quot;Why Men Earn More&quot; include his analysis of census bureau data that never-married women without children earn 13% more than their male counterparts, and that the gender pay gap is largely about married men with children who earn more due to their assuming more workplace obligations.

Themes woven throughout &quot;Why Men Earn More&quot; are the importance of assessing trade-offs; that &quot;the road to high pay is a toll road;&quot; the &quot;Pay Paradox&quot; (that &quot;pay is about the power we forfeit to get the power of pay&quot;); and, since men earn more, and women have more balanced lives, that men have more to learn from women than women do from men.

=== &quot;Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men?&quot; ===
Farrell&#x27;s book, &quot;Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men?&quot;, published in 2008, is a debate book with feminist co-author James P. Sterba. Farrell felt gender studies in universities rarely incorporated the masculine gender except to demonize it. This book was Farrell&#x27;s attempt to test whether a positive perspective about men would be allowed to be incorporated into universities&#x27; gender studies curriculum even if there were a feminist rebuttal. Farrell and Sterba debated 13 topics, from children&#x27;s and fathers&#x27; rights, to the &quot;Boy Crisis.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
Early critiques in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; by Larry McMurtry and John Leonard included disdain for Farrell&#x27;s use of gender neutral language in &quot;The Liberated Man&quot;. More recently, conservative and antifeminist Phyllis Schlafly labeled Farrell a &quot;feminist apologist&quot;, though praises his research for &quot;Father and Child Reunion&quot;. Kate Zernike of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; refers to Farrell as &quot;the sage of the men&#x27;s movement&quot;, and the description of him as the &quot;Gloria Steinem of men&#x27;s liberation&quot; by Carol Kleiman of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. &quot;Esquire&quot; ranked Farrell, Thomas Aquinas, and John Stuart Mill as three of history&#x27;s leading male feminists.

Farrell&#x27;s collaborations with Ken Wilber, John Gray, and Richard Bolles have introduced his messages to more diverse and receptive audiences.

Farrell&#x27;s advocacy for boys and men&#x27;s issues is often criticized in the media as making him &#x27;a leading figure of the men&#x27;s rights movement&#x27;; &quot;GQ&quot; calls Farrell &quot;The Martin Luther King of the men&#x27;s movement.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Farrell married Ursula (Ursie), a mathematician and IBM executive, in the 1960s. After 10 years of marriage, in 1976, he and Ursie separated and subsequently divorced. After what Farrell described as &quot;twenty years of adventuresome single-hood&quot;, he married Liz Dowling in August 2002. He has two step-daughters. They live in Mill Valley, California.

Farrell backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election.

== Other activities ==
During the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, Farrell ran as a Democratic candidate, on a platform of fathers&#x27; rights, and received 626 votes.
Farrell&#x27;s current foci are conducting communication workshops, being an expert witness in child custody cases and researching a forthcoming book (working title &quot;The Boy Crisis&quot;), to be co-authored with John Gray. In 2010–11, he keynoted, along with Deepak Chopra, a world conference on spirituality (the Integral Spiritual Experience), addressing the evolution of love. He was then invited by the Center for World Spirituality to be one of their world leaders. Farrell speaks frequently on boys, men&#x27;s and gender issues, including doing a keynote in 2016 for UK Male Psychology Conference.

In 2009, a call from the White House requesting Farrell to be an advisor to the White House Council on Women and Girls led to Farrell creating and chairing a commission to create a White House Council on Boys and Men. The multi-partisan commission consists of thirty-five authors and practitioners (e.g., John Gray, Gov. Jennifer Granholm, Michael Gurian, Michael Thompson, Bill Pollack, Leonard Sax) of boys&#x27; and men&#x27;s issues. They have completed a study that defines five components to a &quot;boys&#x27; crisis,&quot; which was submitted as a proposal for President Obama to create a White House Council on Boys and Men. In April 2015, the coalition went to Iowa to discuss their position with 2016 U.S. presidential candidates.

Farrell appeared in Cassie Jaye&#x27;s 2016 documentary film about the men&#x27;s rights movement, &quot;The Red Pill&quot;.

<text>A cocktail is a mixed drink typically made with a distilled liquor (such as arrack, brandy, cachaça, gin, rum, tequila, vodka, or whiskey) as its base ingredient that is then mixed with other ingredients or garnishments. Sweetened liqueurs, wine, or beer may also serve as the base or be added. If beer is one of the ingredients, the drink is called a beer cocktail.

Cocktails often also contain various types of juice, fruit, honey, milk or cream, spices, or other flavorings. Cocktails may vary in their ingredients from bartender to bartender, and from region to region. Two creations may have the same name but taste very different because of differences in how the drinks are prepared.

This article is organized by the primary type of alcohol (by volume) contained in the beverage. Cocktails marked with &quot;IBA&quot; are designated as IBA official cocktails by the International Bartenders Association, and are some of the most popular cocktails worldwide.

== By mixer ==

=== Strawberry ===
Strawberries can be muddled or puréed and added to many drinks, and they are liquor-friendly, being compatible with, e.g., bourbon whiskey, Cointreau, vodka, tequila, rum, and Champagne, among other spirits and liqueurs and so on.

Some recipes call for a strawberry syrup that can be made using strawberries, vanilla extract, sugar, and water. Some strawberry cocktail recipes do not call for a syrup, but rely on puréed strawberries to play that part.

Strawberries are often mixed with basil. Strawberry is popular in smashes since after the beverage has been drunk, the alcohol-infused strawberries can be consumed as well.

* Strawberry Mango Bourbon Smash (bourbon, strawberries, mango juice, lime juice, sugar syrup, ginger beer)

=== Carrot juice ===
Carrot juice can be mixed with spirits such as agave spirits, whiskey, tequila, gin, or mezcal. Vodka is sometimes chosen because its neutral taste allows more of the carrot juice taste to shine through. Carrot juice can also be mixed with liqueurs such as amaro. ginger, orange, lemon and honey can be other ingredients in carrot juice cocktails. Turmeric infusions are also common. Examples of drinks made with carrot juice include:
*24 Carrot Gold Punch (gin, carrot juice, pineapple juice, lemon juice, ginger beer, pineapple slices, edible flowers)

=== Smashed fruit ===
A smash is a casual icy (spirits, sugar, and herb) cocktail filled with hunks of fresh fruit, so that after the liquid part of the drink has been consumed, one can also eat the alcohol-infused fruit (e.g. strawberries). The history of smashes goes back at least as far as the 1862 book &quot;How to Mix Drinks&quot;. The old-style whiskey smash was an example of an early smash.

The herb used in a smash is often mint, although basil is sometimes used in cocktails that go well with it, e.g. many strawberry cocktails. The name &quot;smash&quot; comes from the idea that on a hot day, one takes whatever fruit is on hand and smashes it all together to make a refreshing beverage. Generally a smash will have crushed ice.

Geographically, it is an area of many lakes and lies at the upper Łyna river and on the right bank of Pasłęka, stretching in the northwest to the Vistula Bay. Warmia has a number of architectural monuments ranging from Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque to Classicism, Historicism and Art Nouveau.

Warmia is part of a larger historical region called Prussia, which was inhabited by the Old Prussians and later on was populated mainly by Germans and Poles. Warmia has traditionally strong connections with neighbouring Masuria, but it remained Catholic and belonged directly to Poland between 1454/1466 and 1772, whereas Masuria was a part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Order and Ducal Prussia, which became predominantly Protestant. Warmia has been under the dominion of various states over the course of its history, most notably the Old Prussians, the Teutonic Knights, the Kingdom of Poland and the Kingdom of Prussia. The history of the region is closely connected to that of the Archbishopric of Warmia (formerly Prince-Bishopric of Warmia). The region is associated with the Prussian tribe, the Warmians, who settled in an approximate area. According to folk etymology, Warmia is named after the legendary Prussian chief Warmo, and Ermland derives from his widow Erma.

Warmia is bordered by Powiśle in the west, Masuria in the south and east, and Bartia and Natangia in the north.

==Geography==
Warmia occupies a 100 kilometer long strip of land along the right bank of the Pasłęka River, approximately 20 kilometers wide in the north and increasing to over 70 kilometers wide in the south. The Łyna River drains the southern portion of the region, flowing to the northeast to join with the Pregolya. The terrain is composed of gentle hills and wide plains, and has a humid continental climate, with milder temperatures found at lower elevations in the north near the coast.

With the exception of the far northern and southern ends of the region, the Pasłęka constitutes its western border. That river flows into the Vistula Lagoon just after passing the town of Braniewo. The historically important port town of Frombork lies west of the Pasłęka, near the mouth of the . Further south, the Pasłęka is joined by the tributaries and Drwęca Warmińska, with the headwaters of the river located near the southern end of Warmia.

The source of the Łyna river is found just south of the southern tip of the region, near the eponymous town of Łyna. The river flows through several lakes on the western end of the Masurian Lake District, passing through the cities of Olsztyn and Lidzbark Warmiński as it takes in numerous tributaries on its journey north. This southern portion of Warmia is more heavily forested and historically had many towns with Polish-speaking majorities, while the rest of the region was almost entirely German-speaking.

==History==
=== Early times ===

By the early Middle Ages the Warmians, an Old Prussian tribe, inhabited the area.

=== Beginning of the Northern Crusades ===
In the 13th century the area became a battleground in the Northern Crusades. Having failed to gather an expedition against Palestine, Pope Innocent III resolved in 1207 to organize a new crusade; beginning in 1209, he called for crusades against the Albigenses, against the Almohad dynasty of Spain (1213), and, also around that time, against the pagans of Prussia. The first Bishop of Prussia, Christian of Oliva, was commissioned in 1209 to convert the Prussians, at the request of Konrad I of Masovia (duke from 1194 to 1247).

=== Teutonic Order ===
In 1226 Duke Konrad I of Masovia invited the Teutonic Knights to Christianize the pagan Prussians. He supplied the Teutonic Order and allowed the usage of Chełmno Land as a base for the knights. They had the task of establishing secure borders between Masovia and the Prussians, with the assumption that conquered territories would become part of Masovia. The Order waited until they received official authorisation from the Empire, which Emperor Frederick II granted by issuing the Golden Bull of Rimini (March 1226). The papal Golden Bull of Rieti from Pope Gregory IX in 1234 confirmed the grant, although Konrad of Masovia never recognized the rights of the Order to rule Prussia. Later, the Knights were accused of forging these land grants.

By the end of the 13th century the Teutonic Order had conquered and Christianized most of the Prussian region, including Warmia. The Teutonic Order recruited mostly German-speaking settlers to develop the land. The new régime reduced many of the native Prussians to the status of serfs and gradually Germanized them. . Native Prussians were also reported as holders of estates. Over several centuries the colonists, native Prussians and immigrants gradually intermingled. Until the early 13th century, also the southern parts of Warmia were German-speaking. Polish settlers arrived later, particularly after 1410, mainly to southern Warmia, so that German was replaced by Polish in this area.
In 1242 the papal legate William of Modena set up four dioceses, including the Archbishopric of Warmia. The bishopric was exempt and was governed by a prince-bishop, confirmed by Emperor Charles IV. The Bishops of Warmia were usually Germans or Poles, although Enea Silvio Piccolomini, the later Pope Pius II, served as an Italian bishop of the diocese.

After the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, Bishop Heinrich Vogelsang of Warmia surrendered to King Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland, and later with Bishop Henry of Sambia paid homage to the Polish king at the Polish camp during the siege of Marienburg Castle (Malbork). After the Polish army moved out of Warmia, the new Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Heinrich von Plauen the Elder, accused the bishop of treachery and reconquered the region.

=== Kingdom of Poland ===

In February 1440 the nobility of Warmia and the town of Braniewo (Braunsberg) co-founded the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and most towns of the Warmia joined the organization in May 1440. In February 1454, the organization asked Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon to incorporate the region to the Kingdom of Poland, to which the king agreed and signed the act of incorporation in Kraków on 6 March 1454, and the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466) broke out. During the war Warmia was recaptured by the Teutonic Knights, however, in 1464 Bishop Paweł Legendorf vel Mgowski sided with Poland and the Prince-Bishopric came again under the overlordship of the Polish King. In the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) the Teutonic Knights renounced any claims to Warmia, and recognized Polish sovereignty over the region, which was confirmed to be part of Poland. It was administratively remained a Prince-Bishopric with several privileges, part of the larger provinces of Royal Prussia and Greater Poland Province.

Soon after, in 1467, the Cathedral Chapter elected Nicolas von Tüngen against the wish of the Polish king. The Estates of Royal Prussia did not take the side of the Cathedral Chapter. Nicholas von Tüngen allied himself with the Teutonic Order and with King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. The feud, known as the War of the Priests, was a low scale affair, affecting mainly Warmia. In 1478 Braniewo (Braunsberg) withstood a Polish siege which was ended in an agreement in which the Polish king recognized von Tüngen as bishop and the right of the Cathedral Chapter to elect future bishops, which however would have to be accepted by the king, and the bishop as well as Cathedral Chapter swore an oath to the Polish king. Later in the Treaty of Piotrków Trybunalski (7 December 1512), conceded to the king of Poland a limited right to determine the election of bishops by choosing four candidates from Royal Prussia. The region retained autonomy, governing itself and maintaining its own laws, customs, rights and German language.
Warmia was invaded by the Teutonic Knights during the Polish–Teutonic War of 1519–1521, however, the Poles, led by renown astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, repulsed the Teutonic siege of Olsztyn in 1521. Copernicus spent more than half of his life in Warmia, where he wrote many of his groundbreaking works and conducted astronomical observations and mathematical calculations, which became the basis for his heliocentric model of the universe. After the war of 1519–1521, he coordinated the reconstruction and resettlement of the devastated southern Warmia.

In 1565, Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius founded the Collegium Hosianum in Braniewo, which became the leading institution of higher learning in the region.

After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia was integrated more directly into the Polish Crown within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. At the same time, the territory continued to enjoy substantial autonomy, with many legal differences from neighbouring lands. For example, the bishops were by law members of Polish Senat and the land elected MP&#x27;s to the Sejmik of Royal Prussia as well as MP&#x27;s to the Sejm of Poland.
Warmia was under the Church jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Riga until 1512, when Prince-Bishop Lucas Watzenrode received exempt status, placing Warmia directly under the authority of the Pope (in terms of church jurisdiction), which remained until the resolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.

=== Prussia and Germany ===
By the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Warmia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia; the properties of the Archbishopric of Warmia were secularized by the Prussian state. In 1773 Warmia was merged with the surrounding areas into the newly established province of East Prussia. Ignacy Krasicki, the last prince-bishop of Warmia as well as Enlightenment Polish poet, friend of Frederick the Great (whom he did not give homage as his new king), was nominated to the Archbishopric of Gniezno (and thus Primate of Poland) in 1795. After the last partition of Poland and during his tenure as Primate of Poland and Prussian subject he was ordered by Pope Pius VI to teach his Catholic Poles to &#x27;stay obedient, faithful, and loving to their new kings&#x27;, Papal brief of 1795. The Prussian census in 1772 showed a total population of 96,547, including an urban population of 24,612 in 12 towns. 17,749 houses were listed and the biggest city was Braunsberg (Braniewo).

Between 1773 and 1945 Warmia was part of the predominantly Lutheran province of East Prussia, with the exception that the people of Warmia remained largely Catholic. Most of the population of Warmia spoke High Prussian German, while a small area in the north spoke Low Prussian German; southern Warmia was populated by both Germans and Polish Warmiaks. The Polish population was subjected to intense Germanisation policies. Warmia was divided into four districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;) - Allenstein (Olsztyn), Rössel (Reszel), Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmiński) and Braunsberg (Braniewo). The city of Allenstein was separated from the Allenstein district in 1910 and became an independent city.

On 6 May 1863, the village of Bredynki was the site of a massacre of Polish inhabitants. Local farmers protested the taking of the lake from the village and handing it over to a local miller. Prussian troops fired on the crowd, killing more than a dozen people, including women, and wounding 30.

In the winter of 1863–1864, Polish insurgents of the January Uprising who fled the Russian Partition of Poland, found shelter in Warmia.


In 1871, along with the rest of East Prussia, Warmia became part of the German Empire. In 1873, according to a regulation of the Imperial German government, school lessons at public schools inside Germany had to be held in German, as a result the Polish language was forbidden in all schools in Warmia, including Polish schools already founded in the sixteenth century. In 1900 Warmia&#x27;s population was 240,000. In the jingoistic climate after World War I, Warmian Poles were subject to persecution by the German government. Polish children speaking their language were punished in schools and often had to wear signs with insulting names, such as &quot;Pollack&quot;.

After the First World War, Poland regained independence, and a plebiscite was held to determine the future of Warmia. In February 1920, Poland opened a consulate in Olsztyn in 1920, however, due to the German persecution of Poles and the advances of the Red Army towards Warsaw in the Polish–Soviet War in 1920, the plebiscite resulted in a German victory, and the region remained within Germany in the interbellum.

Despite German hostility, the Poles founded numerous Polish organizations in Warmia in the interbellum. Persecution of Poles intensified after the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany. Due to severe persecution, from 1936 Polish organizations carried out their activities partly in conspiracy. Polish organizations were heavily invigilated by the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (German security police) through its undercover agents, known as the &quot;Vertrauensmänner&quot;. Based on their information, the German police compiled files and lists of Poles who were supposed to be either executed or imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. Nazi militants carried out attacks on Polish schools, organizations, printshops, shops. The persecution of Poles further intensified in 1939. In early 1939, many Polish activists were expelled. Afterwards, in an attempt to rig the results of an upcoming census and understate the number of Poles in the region, the Germans terrorized the Polish population, attacked Polish schools and organizations, and confiscated Polish pre-census information leaflets. In summer 1939 the German terror against the Poles even exceeded the terror from the period of the 1920 plebiscite. Poles were subjected to expulsions and arrests, there were terrorist attacks on Polish organizations and schools, Polish libraries were looted or destroyed, and entire volumes of Polish press were confiscated. In August 1939, Germany introduced martial law in the region, which allowed for even more blatant persecution of Poles. Germany co-formed the &quot;Einsatzgruppe V&quot; in Olsztyn, which then committed various atrocities against Poles during the German invasion of Poland that began World War II in September 1939. In August and September 1939, the Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles, including activists, teachers, school principals, bank employees, newspaper editors, entrepreneurs, priests, scout leaders, and the consul and employees of the Polish Consulate in Olsztyn, and shut down or seized Polish newspapers and libraries. Arrested Poles were mostly deported to concentration camps, incl. , Soldau, Stutthof, Sachsenhausen, Gusen and Ravensbrück. During World War II, many Poles from the region were forcibly conscripted into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. The Germans operated a notable Nazi prison in the town of Barczewo (Wartenburg) with several forced labour subcamps in the region. The Polish resistance movement was active in the region and Polish underground press was distributed.

=== Polish Republic ===
Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, and the Yalta Conference and Potsdam Conference of 1945, Warmia became again part of Poland as part of so-called Recovered Territories, pending a final peace conference with Germany which eventually never took place. The German inhabitants either fled or were transferred to Germany by Soviet and communist authorities installed in Poland and the remaining Polish inhabitants were joined by Polish settlers, many of whom were displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

Olsztyn is the largest city in Warmia and the capital of the Warmian-Masurian Voivedeship. During 1945–46, Warmia was part of the &quot;Okreg Mazurski&quot; (Masurian District). In 1946 a new voivodeship was created and named the Olsztyn Voivodeship, which encompassed both Warmia and Masurian counties. From 1975 to 1998, Warmia was divided between the Olsztyn and Elbląg Voivodeships, and in 1999 it was entirely included with the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. The Catholic character of Warmia has been preserved in the architecture of its villages and towns, as well as in folk customs.

==Anthem==

The unofficial anthem of Warmia is &quot;O Warmio moja miła&quot; from 1920, with music by local Polish composer Feliks Nowowiejski and lyrics by Maria Paruszewska. It is also the bugle call of the region&#x27;s largest city of Olsztyn.

==Sights==
Three landmarks in Warmia are listed as Historic Monuments of Poland:
* Gothic Archcathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Andrew in Frombork with its fortifications and the Copernicus Tower
* Gothic Castle of the Warmian Bishops in Lidzbark Warmiński
* Baroque Sanctuary of Saint Mary in Stoczek Klasztorny
Other sights include the old towns of Olsztyn and Reszel with the Reszel and Olsztyn castles, the Old Town of Barczewo with the museum of Polish composer Feliks Nowowiejski at his birthplace. There are also several palaces, including the Baroque Grabowski Palace in Lidzbark Warmiński and the palace in Smolajny, favorite summer residence of leading Polish Enlightenment poet Ignacy Krasicki. The Basilica of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Gietrzwałd is a popular regional pilgrimage site.

Places of stay of Nicolaus Copernicus include the medieval castles in Olsztyn, Lidzbark Warmiński and Pieniężno, whereas the Frombork Cathedral contains his grave and epitaph.

A typical feature of the Warmian landscape are the massive Gothic churches in the towns and the numerous historic wayside shrines in various towns and villages, a reminder of the region&#x27;s strong Catholic traditions.

There is a small cemetery of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Markajmy at which British and Commonwealth prisoners-of-war of Germany from World War I are buried.

==Cuisine==
In addition to traditional nationwide Polish cuisine, Warmia has its own regional and local traditional foods and beverages, as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland.

Unique local dishes include the Lord-style turkey wings (&quot;Skrzydła indycze po pańsku&quot;). Ignacy Krasicki is considered one of the pioneers of turkey meat consumption in Warmia, as already in 1791, during a feast he organized, he ordered turkey to be served, among other dishes.

The tradition of producing Warmian smoked beef ham (&quot;Warmińska szynka wołowa wędzona&quot;) is cultivated by several meat-packing plants in Warmia.

The officially protected traditional alcoholic beverages of Warmia are &quot;Okowita miodowa warmińska&quot;, a beverage of 42% alcohol by volume made from Warmian honey, and the Warmian porter, a local type of Polish beer.

The traditional cuisine of German Warmiaks include Königsberger Klopse, Heilsberger Keilchen, a form of potato dumplings, and Wruken (turnip), or Klunkersuppe (flour milk soup) mit Bratschukken (fried potatoes).

==Sports==
The most accomplished sports team of Warmia is AZS Olsztyn, multiple times Polish volleyball champions and Polish Cup winners. The first several tournaments of the Memorial of Hubert Jerzy Wagner, an international volleyball friendly competition, were held in Warmia.

<text>William O&#x27;Dwyer (July 11, 1890November 24, 1964) was an Irish-American politician who served as the 100th Mayor of New York City, holding that office from 1946 to 1950. O&#x27;Dwyer went on to serve President Harry Truman as Ambassador to Mexico from 1950–1952. O&#x27;Dwyer began his political career by serving as the Kings County District Attorney from 1940–45. His brother Paul O&#x27;Dwyer served as President of the City Council from 1973–77, and his nephew Brian O&#x27;Dwyer was appointed by Governor Kathy Hochul as New York State Gaming Commission Chair in 2022.

==Life and career==
O&#x27;Dwyer was born in Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland and studied at St. Nathys College, Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon. In 1907, O&#x27;Dwyer began to study for the priesthood at the Pontifical University of Salamanca, a Jesuit seminary in Spain, where he became fluent in Spanish. He later decided not to join the clergy, and emigrated to the United States in 1910. He sailed to New York as a steerage passenger on board the liner &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and was inspected at Ellis Island on June 27, 1910. He first worked as a laborer, then as a New York City police officer, while studying law at night at Fordham University Law School. He received his degree in 1923 and then built up a successful practice before serving as a Kings County (Brooklyn) Court judge. He won election as the Kings County District Attorney in November 1939 and his prosecution of the organized crime syndicate known as Murder, Inc. made him a national celebrity.

After losing the mayoral election to Fiorello La Guardia in 1941, O&#x27;Dwyer joined the United States Army for World War II, achieving the rank of brigadier general as a member of the Allied Commission for Italy and executive director of the War Refugee Board, for which he received the Legion of Merit. During that time, he was on leave from his elected position as district attorney and replaced by his chief assistant, Thomas Cradock Hughes, and was re-elected in November 1943.

In 1945, O&#x27;Dwyer received the support of Tammany Hall leader Edward V. Loughlin, won the Democratic nomination, and then easily won the mayoral election. At his inauguration, O&#x27;Dwyer celebrated to the song, &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Day for the Irish&quot;, and addressed the 700 people gathered in Council Chambers at City Hall: &quot;It is our high purpose to devote our whole time, our whole energy to do good work...&quot; He established the Office of City Construction Coordinator, appointing Park Commissioner Robert Moses to the post, worked to have the permanent home of the United Nations located in Manhattan, presided over the first billion-dollar New York City budget, created a traffic department and raised the subway fare from five cents to ten cents. In 1948, O&#x27;Dwyer received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.&quot; In 1948, he received the epithets &quot;Whirling Willie&quot; and &quot;Flip-Flop Willie&quot; from U.S. Representative Vito Marcantonio of the opposition American Labor Party while the latter was campaigning for Henry A. Wallace.

Shortly after his re-election to the mayoralty in 1949, O&#x27;Dwyer was confronted with a police corruption scandal uncovered by the Kings County District Attorney, Miles McDonald. O&#x27;Dwyer resigned from office on August 31, 1950. Upon his resignation, he was given a ticker tape parade up Broadway&#x27;s Canyon of Heroes in the borough of Manhattan. President Harry Truman appointed him U.S. Ambassador to Mexico. He returned to New York City in 1951 to answer questions concerning his association with organized crime figures and the accusations followed him for the rest of his life. He resigned as ambassador on December 6, 1952, but remained in Mexico until 1960.

He helped organize the first Israel Day Parade, along with New York&#x27;s Jewish community.

==Death==
O&#x27;Dwyer died in New York City on November 24, 1964, in Beth Israel Hospital, aged 74, from heart failure. His funeral mass was held at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral on November 27, and he was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 2, Grave 889-A-RH.

==Family==
In 1916, O&#x27;Dwyer married Catherine Lenihan, whom he met while he was working as a bartender at the Vanderbilt Hotel and she was employed as one of the Vanderbilt&#x27;s telephone switchboard operators. They had no children, and she was in ill health for many years before her death in 1946. Her funeral was originally planned for St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan, where she and her husband were members. The large number of attendees resulted in a move to St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, where the service was presided over by Cardinal Francis Spellman.

On December 20, 1949, O&#x27;Dwyer married Elizabeth Sloan Simpson at St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church in Stuart, Florida. They divorced in 1953, but remained close, and Simpson attended O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s funeral in 1964.

<text>Worms is a series of artillery tactical video games developed by British company Team17. In these games, small platoons of anthropomorphic worms battle each other across a destructible landscape with the objective being to become the sole surviving team. The games are noted for their cartoony animation and extensive use of surrealism and slapstick humour.

The game, whose concept was devised by Andy Davidson, was described by the Amiga gaming press as a cross between &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; and &quot;Lemmings&quot;. It is part of a wider genre of turn-based artillery games involving projectile weapons; similar games include &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; (1991), &quot;Gorillas&quot; (1991) and &quot;Artillery Duel&quot; (1983).

==Gameplay==

&quot;Worms&quot; games are turn-based artillery games presented in a 2D or 3D environment. Each player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents&#x27; worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the &quot;Bungee&quot; and &quot;Ninja Rope&quot;, to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games.

Over 50 weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played; differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a &quot;scheme&quot; for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.

When most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. The types of playable terrains include &quot;island&quot; (terrain floating on a body of water), or &quot;cave&quot; (cave with water at the bottom and terrain at both top and bottom of the screen that certain weapons such as &quot;Air Strike&quot; cannot go through; this type is not available in 3D versions due to camera restrictions). If a worm is hit with a weapon, the amount of damage dealt to the worm will be removed from the worm&#x27;s initial amount of health. The damage dealt to the attacked worm or worms after any player&#x27;s turn is shown when all movement on the battlefield has ceased.

Worms die when one of the following situations occurs:
* When a worm enters water (either by falling off the island, through a hole in the bottom of it, or by the waterline being raised above the worm during sudden death)
* When a worm is thrown off either side of the arena
* When a worm&#x27;s health is reduced to zero

===Weapons and tools===
The &quot;Worms&quot; series is notable for its extensive variety of weapons. With each new game that is released, weapons are added, though many were removed in the 3D versions for gameplay reasons. As a result, the 2D series has accumulated 60 weapons, and the 3D series 40 weapons.

The weapons available in the game range from a standard timed grenade and homing missiles to exploding sheep and the highly destructive Banana Bomb, both of which have appeared in every &quot;Worms&quot; game so far. The &quot;Worms&quot; series has seen weapons such as the iconic Holy Hand Grenade, the Priceless Ming Vase and the Inflatable Scouser.

Some of the bizarre weapons in a particular game are based on topical subjects at the time of the game&#x27;s release. The Mail Strike, for example, which consists of a flying postbox dropping explosive envelopes, is a reference to the postal strikes of the time, while the Mad Cow refers to the BSE epidemic of the 1990s. The French Nuclear Test, introduced in &quot;Worms 2&quot;, was updated to the Indian Nuclear Test in &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; to keep with the times.

Other weapons are inside jokes. The MB Bomb, for example, which floats down from the sky and explodes on impact, is a cartoon caricature of Martyn Brown, Team17&#x27;s studio director. Other such weapons include the &quot;Concrete Donkey&quot;, one of the most powerful weapons in the game, which is based on a garden ornament in Andy Davidson&#x27;s home garden, and an airstrike known in the game as Mike&#x27;s Carpet Bomb was actually inspired by a store near the Team17 headquarters called &quot;Mike&#x27;s Carpets&quot;.

Since &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot;, weapons that were intended to aid as utilities rather than damage-dealers were classified as tools. This classification mainly differs in the fact that they do not fall in ordinary weapon crates, and instead appear in toolboxes. Many tools were left in the wrong class for the sake of keyboard-shortcut conveniences. This was resolved in &quot;Worms 3D&quot;.

Some weapons were inspired from popular films and TV programs, including the Holy Hand Grenade (from &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;) and Ninja Rope (named the Bat Rope in early demos of the original game).

==History==

===Creator===

Andy Davidson is the creator of the original &quot;Worms&quot; video game by Team17. The game &quot;Worms&quot; is based on the 2D classic &quot;Artillery&quot;, and originally did not feature worms, but the &quot;Lemmings&quot; from the popular game of the same name.

====Background====
Davidson was working on a program called &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; for the Amiga personal computer, which allowed him to trawl the residual contents of RAM after applications had been run and quit. In this way, he &quot;ripped&quot; the graphics from Lemmings, and used them while developing his version of &quot;Artillery&quot;. The original name of the game was &quot;Lemartillery&quot;, and it was created purely as a bit of fun for him and his school friends in 1993. The positive reaction he witnessed encouraged him to develop it further. Knowing he could never commercially release the &quot;Lemmings&quot; characters, he changed them to worms and changed the name of the game to &quot;Total Wormage&quot;.

===Development===
Created as an entry for a Blitz BASIC programming competition run by the &quot;Amiga Format&quot; magazine, a cut-down version of the programming language having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called &quot;Total Wormage&quot; (possibly in reference to &quot;Total Carnage&quot;) and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He took the game to the European Computer Trade Show in London in September 1994, where Team17 had a stand. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game. It subsequently evolved into a full commercial game, renamed &quot;Worms&quot;, available initially for the Amiga. As the game was popular, it was regularly released for other platforms.

During the development of &quot;Worms 2&quot;, Davidson wrote &quot;&quot;, a special edition produced for the Amiga. &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; would be the last &quot;Worms&quot; game released for the Amiga.

For &quot;Worms 2&quot;, the engine was redesigned using Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX. The game would overhaul the series&#x27; visuals, dropping the darker tones of its predecessor and adopting a more cartoonish look. &quot;Worms 2&quot; would be the first game in the series to introduce internet play. The following release, &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot;, featured the series&#x27; first campaign mode and was initially intended to be released as an expansion pack for &quot;Worms 2&quot;. &quot;Armageddon&quot; marked the introduction of &quot;WormNET&quot;, an online services which required registration and provided leagues and ranks. A variety of &quot;schemes&quot; have been developed by the WormNET community that are often played instead of the official schemes created by Team17. Some schemes have &quot;rules&quot; agreed to by the players but not enforced by the game itself.

&quot;Worms 3D&quot;, released in 2003, was the first installment of the series with three-dimensional gameplay. The game features a &#x27;poxel&#x27; engine, described as a hybrid of polygons and voxels (the 3D analogues of pixels), which allows for pseudo-realistic terrain deformation similar in style to the 2D games, in which the terrain was represented by a bitmap. The game was followed in 2004 by a spin-off, &quot;Worms Forts: Under Siege&quot;, and the fourth-numbered sequel, &quot;Worms 4: Mayhem&quot;, in 2005. In the same year as &quot;Worms 3&quot;&#x27;s release, Team17 would announce the cancellation of &quot;Worms Battle Rally&quot;, a karting game that would allow players to frag their opponents.

&quot;&quot;, a handheld game was released in March 2006, returned to the original 2D gameplay. In addition to , a console port of &quot;Open Warfare&quot; would be first released on Xbox Live Arcade in 2007. In turn, the port would be followed by 2009&#x27;s &quot;Worms 2: Armageddon&quot;, which was directly inspired by &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; and tries to mimic the game&#x27;s physics and several other aspects. &quot;Worms 2: Armageddon&quot; would itself be ported to home computers as &quot;Worms Reloaded&quot; in 2010.

In an attempt to revamp the series&#x27; gameplay, &quot;Worms Revolution&quot; was released in 2012. &quot;Revolution&quot; was a 2.5D game that features a class-based mechanic, with each class having their own advantages and disadvantages. &quot;Worms W.M.D&quot;, released in 2016, introduced vehicles to the series.

A board game was announced in June 2023 to be released in 2024.

==Reception==
While initial installments were generally praised, later games in the series have been criticized for the lack of meaningful additions. In 2001, Metacritic quoted &quot;Worms World Party&quot; reviews with comments such as &quot;it&#x27;s virtually nothing more than an expansion pack for &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot;&quot; and, as ActionTrip&#x27;s Dejan Grbavcic put it: &quot;And I thought that only Eidos was impertinent enough to keep selling the same game with a slightly different name...&quot;. In 2007, &quot;IGN&quot; included the &quot;Worms&quot; series in its list of game franchises that have jumped the shark.

===Sales===
The &quot;Worms&quot; series is commercially successful. Its combined sales by January 2002 had reached 6 million copies. By May 2014, 60 million copies of the games in the &quot;Worms&quot; franchise had been sold since launching in 1995. By December 2015, the 20th anniversary of Team17, the franchise has sold over 70 million game units. By March 2020, the 25th anniversary of Worms series, the franchise has sold over 75 million game units.

<text>Wildebeest ( , ,), also called gnu ( or ), are antelopes of the genus Connochaetes and native to Eastern and Southern Africa. They belong to the family Bovidae, which includes true antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep, and other even-toed horned ungulates. There are two species of wildebeest: the black wildebeest or white-tailed gnu (&quot;C. gnou&quot;), and the blue wildebeest or brindled gnu (&quot;C. taurinus&quot;).

Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago, resulting in a northern and a southern species. The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species, while the black wildebeest changed more as adaptation to its open grassland habitat in the south. The most obvious ways of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring and in the way their horns are oriented.

In East Africa, the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big-game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over a short period of time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena.

Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra, which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Illegal hunting does take place but the population trend is fairly stable. Wildebeest can also be found in national parks or on private land. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both kinds of wildebeest as least-concern species.

== Etymology ==
 is Dutch for &#x27;wild beast&#x27;, &#x27;wild ox&#x27; or &#x27;wild cattle&#x27; in Afrikaans (&quot;bees&quot; &#x27;cattle&#x27;), The name was given by Dutch settlers who saw them on their way to the interior of South Africa in about 1700 because they resemble wild ox. The blue wildebeest was first known to westerners in the northern part of South Africa a century later, in the 1800s.

Some sources claim the name &quot;gnu&quot; originates from the Khoekhoe name for these animals, &quot;t&#x27;gnu&quot;. Others contend the name and its pronunciation in English go back to the word &quot;!nu:&quot; used for the black wildebeest by the San people.

== Classification ==
=== Taxonomy and evolution ===
The genus name &quot;Connochaetes&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek words , &#x27;beard&#x27;, and χαίτη, &#x27;flowing hair, mane&#x27;. It is placed under the family Bovidae and subfamily Alcelaphinae, where its closest relatives are the hartebeest (&quot;Alcelaphus&quot; spp.), the hirola (&quot;Beatragus hunteri&quot;), and species in the genus &quot;Damaliscus&quot;, such as the topi, the tsessebe, the blesbok and the bontebok. The name &quot;Connochaetes&quot; was given by German zoologist Hinrich Lichtenstein in 1812.

In the early 20th century, one species of the wildebeest, &quot;C. albojubatus&quot;, was identified in eastern Africa. In 1914, two separate races of the wildebeest were introduced, namely &quot;Gorgon a. albojubatus&quot; (&quot;Athi white-bearded wildebeest&quot;) and &quot;G. a. mearnsi&quot; (&quot;Loita white-bearded wildebeest&quot;). However, in 1939, the two were once again merged into a single race, &quot;Connochaetes taurinus albojubatus&quot;. In the mid-20th century, two separate forms were recognised, &quot;Gorgon taurinus hecki&quot; and &quot;G. t. albojubatus&quot;. Finally, two distinct types of wildebeest – the blue and black wildebeest – were identified. The blue wildebeest was at first placed under a separate genus, &quot;Gorgon&quot;, while the black wildebeest belonged to the genus &quot;Connochaetes&quot;. Today, they are united in the single genus &quot;Connochaetes&quot;, with the black wildebeest being named (&quot;C. gnou&quot;) and the blue wildebeest (&quot;C. taurinus&quot;).

According to a mitochondrial DNA analysis, the black wildebeest are estimated to have diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate around 2% has been calculated. The split does not seem to have been driven by competition for resources, but instead because each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.

Blue wildebeest fossils dating back some 2.5 million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil-bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa, they are plentiful at such sites as Elandsfontein, Cornelia, and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Free State and dated back about 800,000 years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised, while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.

===Genetics and hybrids===
The diploid number of chromosomes in the wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes were studied in a male and a female wildebeest. In the female, all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes were found to be acrocentric. Metaphases were studied in the male&#x27;s chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there, as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. Other chromosomes were acrocentric. The X chromosome is a large acrocentric and the Y chromosome a minute one.

The two species of the wildebeest are known to hybridise. Male black wildebeest have been reported to mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, but hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring are usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns, and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase in the size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals, the tympanic part of the temporal bone is highly deformed, and in others, the radius and ulna are fused.

===Characteristics of the species===

Both species of wildebeest are even-toed, horned, greyish-brown ungulates resembling cattle. Males are larger than females and both have heavy forequarters compared to their hindquarters. They have broad muzzles, Roman noses, and shaggy manes and tails. The most striking morphological differences between the black and blue wildebeest are the orientation and curvature of their horns and the colour of their coats. The blue wildebeest is the bigger of the two species. In males, blue wildebeest stand tall at the shoulder and weigh around , while the black wildebeest stands tall and weighs about . In females, blue wildebeest have a shoulder height of and weigh while black wildebeest females stand at the shoulder and weigh . The horns of blue wildebeest protrude to the side, then curve downwards before curving up back towards the skull, while the horns of the black wildebeest curve forward then downward before curving upwards at the tips. Blue wildebeest tend to be a dark grey colour with stripes, but may have a bluish sheen. The black wildebeest has brown-coloured hair, with a mane that ranges in colour from cream to black, and a cream-coloured tail. The blue wildebeest lives in a wide variety of habitats, including woodlands and grasslands, while the black wildebeest tends to reside exclusively in open grassland areas. In some areas, the blue wildebeest migrates over long distances in the winter, whereas the black wildebeest does not. The milk of the black wildebeest contains a higher protein, lower fat, and lower lactose content than the milk of the blue wildebeest. Wildebeest can live more than 40 years, though their average lifespan is around 20 years. 

==Distribution and habitat==
Wildebeest inhabit the plains and open woodlands of parts of Africa south of the Sahara. The black wildebeest is native to the southernmost parts of the continent. Its historical range included South Africa, Eswatini, and Lesotho, but in the latter two countries, it was hunted to extinction in the 19th century. It has now been reintroduced to them and also introduced to Namibia, where it has become well established. It inhabits open plains, grasslands, and Karoo shrublands in both steep mountainous regions and lower undulating hills at altitudes varying between . In the past, it inhabited the highveld temperate grasslands during the dry winter season and the arid Karoo region during the rains. However, as a result of widespread hunting, the black wildebeest no longer occupies its historical range or makes migrations, and is now largely limited to game farms and protected reserves.

The blue wildebeest is native to eastern and southern Africa. Its range includes Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Eswatini and Angola. It is no longer found in Malawi but has been successfully reintroduced into Namibia. Blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas, thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too dry. They can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open woodland floodplains. In East Africa, the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big game species, both in population and biomass. It is a notable feature of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya and the Liuwa Plain National Park in Zambia.

===Migration===

Not all wildebeest are migratory. Black wildebeest herds are often nomadic or may have a regular home range of . Bulls may occupy territories, usually about apart, but this spacing varies according to the quality of the habitat. In favourable conditions, they may be as close as , or they may be as far apart as in poor habitat. Female herds have home ranges of about in size. Herds of nonterritorial bachelor males roam at will and do not seem to have any restrictions on where they wander.

Blue wildebeest have both migratory and sedentary populations. In the Ngorongoro, most animals are sedentary and males maintain a network of territories throughout the year, though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about 10 individuals or join in larger aggregations, and nonterritorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories for a few hours or a day or so, and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.

In the Maasai Mara game reserve, a non-migratory population of blue wildebeest had dwindled from about 119,000 animals in 1977 to about 22,000 in 1997. The reason for the decline is thought to be the increasing competition between cattle and wildebeest for a diminishing area of grazing land as a result of changes in agricultural practices, and possibly fluctuations in rainfall.

Each year, some East African populations of blue wildebeest have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.

Aerial photography has revealed that a level of organisation occurs in the movement of the herd that cannot be apparent to each individual animal; for example, the migratory herd exhibits a wavy front, and this suggests that some degree of local decision-making is taking place. Numerous documentaries feature wildebeest crossing rivers, with many being eaten by crocodiles or drowning in the attempt. While having the appearance of a frenzy, recent research has shown a herd of wildebeest possesses what is known as a &quot;swarm intelligence&quot;, whereby the animals systematically explore and overcome the obstacle as one.

===Interdigital glands===
The wildebeest only has interdigital (hoof) glands in its fore legs. Analysis of chemical constituents from a free ranging blue wildebeest from Zimbabwe (Cawston Block) showed this gland contains cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, phenol, 2-phenolethanol, and six short-chain carboxylic acids. .

==Ecology==

===Predators===

Major predators that feed on wildebeest include the lion, hyena, African wild dog, cheetah, leopard, and Nile crocodile, which seem to favour the wildebeest over other prey. Wildebeest, however, are very strong, and can inflict considerable injury even to a lion. Wildebeest have a maximum running speed of around . The primary defensive tactic is herding, where the young animals are protected by the older, larger ones, while the herd runs as a group. Typically, the predators attempt to isolate a young or ill animal and attack without having to worry about the herd. Wildebeest have developed additional sophisticated cooperative behaviours, such as animals taking turns sleeping while others stand guard against a night attack by invading predators. Wildebeest migrations are closely followed by vultures, as wildebeest carcasses are an important source of food for these scavengers. The vultures consume about 70% of the wildebeest carcasses available. Decreases in the number of migrating wildebeest have also had a negative effect on the vultures. In the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, wildebeest may help facilitate the migration of other, smaller-bodied grazers, such as Thomson&#x27;s gazelles (&quot;Eudorcas thomsonii&quot;), which eat the new-growth grasses stimulated by wildebeest foraging.

===Interactions with nonpredators===
Zebras and wildebeest group together in open savannah environments with high chances of predation. This grouping strategy reduces predation risk because larger groups decrease each individual&#x27;s chance of being hunted, and predators are more easily seen in open areas. The seasonal presence of thousands of migratory wildebeests reduces local lion predation on giraffe calves, resulting in greater survival of giraffes.

Wildebeest can also listen in on the alarm calls of other species, and by doing so, can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more strongly to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred. Wildebeest compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle.

===Breeding and reproduction===

Wildebeest do not form permanent pair bonds and during the mating season, or rut, the males establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them. These small territories are about , with up to 300 territories per . The males defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into oestrus. The males use grunts and distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories. Wildebeest usually breed at the end of the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness. This usually occurs between May and July, and birthing usually takes place between January and March, at the start of the wet season. Wildebeest females breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneously.

The estrous cycle is about 23 days and the gestation period lasts 250 to 260 days. The calves weigh about at birth and scramble to their feet within minutes, being able to move with the herd soon afterwards, a fact on which their survival relies. The main predator of the calves is the spotted hyena. The calving peak period lasts for 2–3 weeks, and in small subpopulations and isolated groups, mortality of calves may be as high as 50%. However, in larger aggregations, or small groups living near large herds, mortality rates may be under 20%.

Groups of wildebeest females and young live in the small areas established by the male. When groups of wildebeest join, the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose to move to the areas held by a smaller number of males. This female-dominated sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance, with higher male mortality having been attributed to hunting.

==Threats and conservation==
The black wildebeest has been classified as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in the &quot;IUCN Red List&quot;. The populations of this species are on an increase. Now, more than 18,000 individuals are believed to remain, 7,000 of which are in Namibia, outside their natural range, and where it is farmed. Around 80% of the wildebeest occurs in private areas, while the other 20% is confined in protected areas. Its introduction into Namibia has been a success and numbers have increased substantially there from 150 in 1982 to 7,000 in 1992.
The blue wildebeest has also been rated as of least concern. The population trend is stable, and their numbers are estimated to be around 1,500,000 – mainly due to the increase of the populations in Serengeti National Park (Tanzania) to 1,300,000 as of 1998. However, the numbers of one of the subspecies, the eastern white-bearded wildebeest (&quot;C. t. albojubatus&quot;) have seen a steep decline. Population density ranges from 0.15/km2. in Hwange and Etosha National Parks to 35/km2 in Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Serengeti National Park.

Overland migration as a biological process requires large, connected landscapes, which are increasingly difficult to maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In one of the more striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (which include lions, leopards, African hunting dogs, cheetahs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest.

==Uses and interaction with humans==
Wildebeest provide several useful animal products. The hide makes good-quality leather and the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard. Wildebeest are killed for food, especially to make biltong in Southern Africa. This dried game meat is a delicacy and an important food item in Africa. The meat of females is more tender than that of males, and is the most tender during the autumn season. Wildebeest are a regular target for illegal meat hunters because their numbers make them easy to find. Cooks preparing the wildebeest carcass usually cut it into 11 pieces. The estimated price for wildebeest meat was about US$0.47 per around 2008. The silky, flowing tail of the black wildebeest is used to make fly-whisks or &quot;chowries&quot;.

Wildebeest benefit the ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta. They are economically important for human beings, as they are a major tourist attraction. They also provide important products, such as leather, to humans. Wildebeest, however, can also have a negative impact on humans. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit diseases and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies, and paramphistome flukes.

=== Cultural depictions ===

The wildebeest is depicted on the coat of arms of the Province of Natal and later KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. Over the years, the South African authorities have issued several stamps displaying the animal and the South African Mint has struck a two-cent piece with a prancing black wildebeest.

Movies and television shows also feature wildebeests, including &quot;Khumba&quot; (Mama V), &quot;The Wild&quot; (Kazar and his minions), &quot;All Hail King Julien&quot; (Vigman Wildebeest), &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; (Newton the Gnu), &quot;The Great Space Coaster&quot; (newscaster Gary Gnu), and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (the wildebeest stampede that resulted in Mufasa&#x27;s death).

Michael Flanders wrote a humorous song called &quot;The Gnu&quot;, which was very popular when he performed it, with Donald Swann, in a revue called &quot;At the Drop of a Hat&quot;, which opened in London on 31 December 1956.

In the 1970s, British tea brand Typhoo ran a series of television advertisements featuring an animated anthropomorphic gnu character.

The wildebeest is the mascot of the GNU Project and GNU operating system.

In the &quot;Llama Llama&quot; picture-book series by Anna Dewdney, an anthropomorphised wildebeest named Nelly Gnu is the main character, Llama Llama&#x27;s best friend, and is also featured in a title of her own, &quot;Nelly Gnu and Daddy Too&quot;.

In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series, Discworld analogues of wildebeests, which inhabited Howonderland, were called &quot;bewilderbeest&quot;.

<text>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term &quot;web design&quot; is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

==History==

===1988–2001===
Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design, user experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people&#x27;s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, backgrounds, videos and music. The web was announced on August 6, 1991; in November 1992, CERN was the first website to go live on the World Wide Web. During this period, websites were structured by using the &lt;table&gt; tag which created numbers on the website. Eventually, web designers were able to find their way around it to create more structures and formats. In early history, the structure of the websites was fragile and hard to contain, so it became very difficult to use them. In November 1993, ALIWEB was the first ever search engine to be created (Archie Like Indexing for the WEB).

====The start of the web and web design====
In 1989, whilst working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. From 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only HTML pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode web browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text-heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould. The W3C was created in October 1994 to &quot;lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability.&quot; This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a proprietary browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. From 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.

==== Evolution of web design ====
In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its features and HTML tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique and is today an important aspect of web design. The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However, designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good markup structure, little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing. CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. This allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational and improved web accessibility, see tableless web design.

In 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to GIF animations (if they did not forego using motion graphics altogether) and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.

====End of the first browser wars====

In 1998, Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an open-source licence, enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, these developers decided to start a standard for the web from scratch, which guided the development of the open-source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform. The Web Standards Project was formed and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards. Programs like Acid1, Acid2, and Acid3 were created in order to test browsers for compliance with web standards. In 2000, Internet Explorer was released for Mac, which was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1. It was also the first browser to fully support the PNG image format. By 2001, after a campaign by Microsoft to popularize Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer had reached 96% of web browser usage share, which signified the end of the first browser wars as Internet Explorer had no real competition.

===2001–2012===
Since the start of the 21st century, the web has become more and more integrated into people&#x27;s lives. As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.

Since the end of the browsers wars new browsers have been released. Many of these are open source meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. The new options are considered by many to be better than Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer.

The W3C has released new standards for HTML (HTML5) and CSS (CSS3), as well as new JavaScript APIs, each as a new but individual standard. While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and &quot;some&quot; of the JavaScript APIs, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).

===2012 and later===
With the advancements in 3G and LTE internet coverage, a significant portion of website traffic shifted to mobile devices. This shift influenced the web design industry, steering it towards a minimalist, lighter, and more simplistic style. The &quot;mobile first&quot; approach emerged as a result, emphasizing the creation of website designs that prioritize mobile-oriented layouts first, before adapting them to larger screen dimensions.

== Tools and technologies ==
Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same. Web designers use both vector and raster graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes. A website can be created using WYSIWYG website builder software or a content management system, or the individual web pages can be hand-coded in just the same manner as the first web pages were created. Other tools web designers might use include markup validators and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.

=== UX Design ===
One popular tool in web design is UX Design, a type of art that designs products to perform an accurate user background. UX design is very deep. UX is more than the web, it is very independent, and its fundamentals can be applied to many other browsers or apps. Web design is mostly based on web-based things. UX can overlap both web design and design. UX design mostly focuses on products that are less web-based.

== Skills and techniques ==

=== Marketing and communication design ===
Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that (B2B) business-to-business website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer-targeted website such as a retail or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of web navigation, especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favorably. Web designers normally oversee all the websites that are made on how they work or operate on things. They constantly are updating and changing everything on websites behind the scenes. All the elements they do are text, photos, graphics, and layout of the web. Before beginning work on a website, web designers normally set an appointment with their clients to discuss layout, colour, graphics, and design. Web designers spend the majority of their time designing websites and making sure the speed is right. Web designers typically engage in testing and working, marketing, and communicating with other designers about laying out the websites and finding the right elements for the websites.

=== User experience design and interactive design ===
User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works. This is part of the user experience design. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions, and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the interactive design of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed in website use may find a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less user-friendly website interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill. Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the user interface design.

Advanced interactive functions may require plug-ins if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the plug-in doesn&#x27;t come pre-installed with most browsers, there&#x27;s a risk that the user will have neither the know-how nor the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There&#x27;s also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn&#x27;t work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it&#x27;s likely to be needed or worth any risks.

=== Progressive enhancement ===
Progressive enhancement is a strategy in web design that puts emphasis on web content first, allowing everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, whilst users with additional browser features or faster Internet access receive the enhanced version instead.

In practice, this means serving content through HTML and applying styling and animation through CSS to the technically possible extent, then applying further enhancements through JavaScript. Pages&#x27; text is loaded immediately through the HTML source code rather than having to wait for JavaScript to initiate and load the content subsequently, which allows content to be readable with minimum loading time and bandwidth, and through text-based browsers, and maximizes backwards compatibility.

As an example, MediaWiki-based sites including Wikipedia use progressive enhancement, as they remain usable while JavaScript and even CSS is deactivated, as pages&#x27; content is included in the page&#x27;s HTML source code, whereas counter-example Everipedia relies on JavaScript to load pages&#x27; content subsequently; a blank page appears with JavaScript deactivated.

=== Page layout ===
Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the page layout. For example, a designer may consider whether the site&#x27;s page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout. Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of aesthetics on larger screens.

Fluid layouts increased in popularity around 2000 to allow the browser to make user-specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts based on the details of the reader&#x27;s screen (window size, font size relative to window, etc.). They grew as an alternative to HTML-table-based layouts and grid-based design in both page layout design principles and in coding technique but were very slow to be adopted. This was due to considerations of screen reading devices and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, embedded advertising areas, navigation areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the browser, as best it can. Although such a display may often change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below body text rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded grid-based layout that doesn&#x27;t fit the device window. In particular, the relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block unaffected. This also minimizes the user&#x27;s need to horizontally scroll the page.

Responsive web design is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device specification within the page&#x27;s style sheet through an enhanced use of the CSS codice_1 rule. In March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing. Sites using responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.

===Typography===

Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of typefaces or type styles. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.

Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10, and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in web typography, as well as the usage of font downloading.

Most site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.

===Motion graphics===
The page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn&#x27;t mean that more serious content couldn&#x27;t be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to the content. In either case, motion graphic design may make the difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals.

Motion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable the animations.

=== Quality of code ===
Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error-prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well as making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors in code, a more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly. Poorly coded pages are sometimes colloquially called tag soup. Validating via W3C can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. This information can then be corrected by the user.

=== Generated content ===
There are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.

==== Static websites ====

A static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. These automatically created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as Jekyll and Adobe Muse.

The benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost server hardware. This advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and virtual servers offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.

Almost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and style sheets are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.

==== Dynamic websites ====

Dynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate web pages. They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a relational database to query a catalog or to summarise numeric information, and others may use a document database such as MongoDB or NoSQL to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.

In the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or wireframed using static pages. The skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static page, involving server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus almost always a team effort.

When dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as Perl, PHP or ASP. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a &#x27;template&#x27; approach where a server-side page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page, and data was inserted into places defined by &#x27;tags&#x27;. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding language such as Perl.

Both of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused tools such as content management systems. These build on top of general-purpose coding platforms and assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well-recognised models, such as a time-sequenced blog, a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki, or a user forum. These tools make the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organizational and design-based task, without requiring any coding.

Editing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site itself and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is Wikipedia.

==Homepage design==
Usability experts, including Jakob Nielsen and Kyle Soucy, have often emphasised homepage design for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a website. However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage, going directly to internal content pages through search engines, e-newsletters and RSS feeds. This led many practitioners to argue that homepages are less important than most people think. Jared Spool argued in 2007 that a site&#x27;s homepage was actually the least important page on a website.

In 2012 and 2013, carousels (also called &#x27;sliders&#x27; and &#x27;rotating banners&#x27;) have become an extremely popular design element on homepages, often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined space. Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a website&#x27;s search engine optimisation and usability.

== Occupations ==
There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, colouring, and typography of a web page. Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another. Particularly in smaller organizations, one person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.

Further jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include: 
*Graphic designers to create visuals for the site such as logos, layouts, and buttons
*Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through strategic solutions on targeting viewers to the site, by using marketing and promotional techniques on the internet
*SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be incorporated into a particular website and make the website more accessible and found on numerous search engines
*Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal to the targeted viewers of the site
*User experience (UX) designer incorporates aspects of user-focused design considerations which include information architecture, user-centred design, user testing, interaction design, and occasionally visual design.

== Artificial intelligence and web design ==
Chat GPT and other AI models are being used to write and code websites making it faster and easier to create websites. There are still discussions about the ethical implications on using artificial intelligence for design as the world becomes more familiar with using AI for time-consuming tasks used in design processes.

<text>The Whitcomb area rule, named after NACA engineer Richard Whitcomb and also called the transonic area rule, is a design procedure used to reduce an aircraft&#x27;s drag at transonic speeds which occur between about Mach 0.75 and 1.2. For supersonic speeds a different procedure called the supersonic area rule, developed by NACA aerodynamicist Robert Jones, is used.

Transonic is one of the most important speed ranges for commercial and military fixed-wing aircraft today, with transonic acceleration an important performance requirement for combat aircraft and which is improved by reductions in transonic drag.

==Description==
At high-subsonic flight speeds, the local speed of the airflow can reach the speed of sound where the flow accelerates around the aircraft body and wings. The speed at which this development occurs varies from aircraft to aircraft and is known as the critical Mach number. The resulting shock waves formed at these zones of sonic flow cause a sudden increase in drag, called wave drag. To reduce the number and strength of these shock waves, an aerodynamic shape should change in cross sectional area as smoothly as possible from front to rear.

===Transonic area rule===
The area rule says that two airplanes with the same longitudinal cross-sectional area distribution have the same wave drag, independent of how the area is distributed laterally (i.e. in the fuselage or in the wing). Furthermore, to avoid the formation of strong shock waves the external shape of the aircraft has to be carefully arranged so that the cross-sectional area changes as smoothly as possible going from nose to tail. At the location of the wing, the fuselage is narrowed or &quot;waisted&quot;. Fuselage cross-sectional area may need to be reduced by flattening the sides of the fuselage below a bubble canopy and at the tail surfaces to compensate for their presence, both of which were done on the Hawker Siddeley Buccaneer.

===Supersonic area rule===
A different area rule, known as the supersonic area rule, developed by NACA aerodynamicist Robert Jones in &quot;Theory of wing-body drag at supersonic speeds&quot;, is applicable at speeds beyond transonic, and in this case, the cross-sectional area requirement is established with relation to the angle of the Mach cone for the design speed. For example, consider that at Mach 1.3 the angle of the Mach cone generated by the nose of the aircraft will be at an angle μ = arcsin(1/M) = 50.3° (where μ is the angle of the Mach cone, also known as Mach angle, and M is the Mach number). In this case the &quot;perfect shape&quot; is biased rearward; therefore, aircraft designed for lower wave drag at supersonic speed usually have wings towards the rear.

==Sears–Haack body==

A superficially related concept is the Sears–Haack body, the shape of which allows minimum wave drag for a given length and a given volume. However, the Sears–Haack body shape is derived starting with the Prandtl–Glauert equation which approximately governs small-disturbance subsonic flows, as well as Ackeret Theory, which closely describes supersonic flow. Both methods lose validity for transonic flows where the area rule applies, due to assumptions made in their derivations. So although the Sears–Haack body shape, being smooth, will have favorable wave drag properties according to the area rule, it is not theoretically optimum.

==History==
===Germany===
The area rule was discovered by when comparing a swept wing with a w-wing with extreme high wave drag while working on a transonic wind tunnel at Junkers works in Germany between 1943 and 1945. He wrote a description on 17 December 1943, with the title &quot;Anordnung von Verdrängungskörpern beim Hochgeschwindigkeitsflug&quot; (&quot;Arrangement of Displacement Bodies in High-Speed Flight&quot;); this was used in a patent filed in 1944. The results of this research were presented to a wide circle in March 1944 by Theodor Zobel at the &quot;Deutsche Akademie der Luftfahrtforschung&quot; (German Academy of Aeronautics Research) in the lecture &quot;Fundamentally new ways to increase performance of high speed aircraft.&quot;

Subsequent German wartime aircraft design took account of the discovery, evident in slim mid-fuselage of aircraft including the Messerschmitt P.1112, P.1106 and Focke-Wulf 1000x1000x1000 type A long-range bomber, but also apparent in delta wing designs including the Henschel Hs 135. Several other researchers came close to developing a similar theory, notably Dietrich Küchemann who designed a tapered fighter that was dubbed the &quot;Küchemann Coke Bottle&quot; when it was discovered by US forces in 1946. In this case Küchemann arrived at the theory by studying airflow, notably the interference, or local flow streamlines, at the junction between a fuselage and swept wing. The fuselage was contoured, or waisted, to match the flow. The shaping requirement of this &quot;near field&quot; approach would also result from Whitcomb&#x27;s later &quot;far field&quot; approach to drag reduction using his Sonic area rule.

===United States===
Wallace D. Hayes, a pioneer of supersonic flight, developed the transonic area rule in publications beginning in 1947 with his Ph.D. thesis at the California Institute of Technology.
Richard T. Whitcomb, after whom the rule is named, independently discovered this rule in 1952, while working at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). While using the new Eight-Foot High-Speed Tunnel, a wind tunnel with performance up to Mach 0.95 at NACA&#x27;s Langley Research Center, he was surprised by the increase in drag due to shock wave formation. Whitcomb realized that, for analytical purposes, an airplane could be reduced to a streamlined body of revolution, elongated as much as possible to mitigate abrupt discontinuities and, hence, equally abrupt drag rise. The shocks could be seen using Schlieren photography, but the reason they were being created at speeds far below the speed of sound, sometimes as low as Mach 0.70, remained a mystery.

In late 1951, the lab hosted a talk by Adolf Busemann, a famous German aerodynamicist who had moved to Langley after World War II. He talked about the behavior of airflow around an airplane as its speed approached the critical Mach number, when air no longer behaved as an incompressible fluid. Whereas engineers were used to thinking of air flowing smoothly around the body of the aircraft, at high speeds it simply did not have time to &quot;get out of the way&quot;, and instead started to flow as if it were rigid pipes of flow, a concept Busemann referred to as &quot;streampipes&quot;, as opposed to streamlines, and jokingly suggested that engineers had to consider themselves &quot;pipefitters&quot;.

Several days later Whitcomb had a &quot;Eureka&quot; moment. The reason for the high drag was that the &quot;pipes&quot; of air were interfering with each other in three dimensions. One does not simply consider the air flowing over a 2D cross-section of the aircraft as others could in the past; now they also had to consider the air to the &quot;sides&quot; of the aircraft which would also interact with these streampipes. Whitcomb realized that the shaping had to apply to the aircraft &quot;as a whole&quot;, rather than just to the fuselage. That meant that the extra cross-sectional area of the wings and tail had to be accounted for in the overall shaping, and that the fuselage should actually be narrowed where they meet to more closely match the ideal.

==Applications==
The first aircraft where the area rule was consequently implemented was the German bomber testbed Junkers Ju-287 (1944). Other corresponding German designs were not completed due to the end of the war or even remained in the planning stage.

When the area rule was re-discovered by Whitcomb, it was made available to the U.S. aircraft industry on a secret basis for military programs from 1952 and it was reported in 1957 for civilian programs.

Convair and Grumman, with Whitcomb&#x27;s help, used it concurrently to design the Grumman F-11 Tiger and to redesign the Convair F-102. The Grumman F-11 Tiger was the first of the two aircraft to fly and had been designed using the area rule from the outset. The Convair F-102 Delta Dagger had to be redesigned as it had been unable to reach Mach 1 although its design speed was Mach 1.2. The expectation that it would reach design speed had been based on optimistic wind-tunnel drag predictions. Modifications which included indenting the fuselage beside the wings and adding more volume to the rear of the aircraft, reduced the transonic drag significantly and the Mach 1.2 design speed was reached. The reason for using the area rule on these fighter aircraft was to reduce the peak value of the drag which occurs at Mach 1 and so enable supersonic speeds with less thrust than would otherwise have been necessary.

In 1957 a modified area rule was available for raising the subsonic cruise speed of transport aircraft by 50 mph. The cruise speed is limited by the sudden increase in drag which indicates the presence of local supersonic flow on top of the wing. Whitcomb&#x27;s modified rule reduced the supersonic speed before the shock, which weakened it and reduced the drag associated with it. The Convair 990 had bumps called antishock bodies added to the top surface of the wing with the intent of achieving the required cruise speed. However, the area distribution in the channels formed by the nacelle/pylon/wing surfaces also caused supersonic velocities and was the source of significant drag. An area-rule technique, so-called channel area-ruling, was applied to achieve the required cruise speed.

Designers at Armstrong-Whitworth took the sonic area rule a step further in their proposed M-Wing, in which the wing was first swept forward and then to the rear. This allowed the fuselage to be narrowed in front of the root as well as behind it, leading to a smoother fuselage that remained wider on average than one using a classic swept wing.

The extension behind the flight deck on the Rockwell B-1 Lancer and Boeing 747 was added to improve the cross-sectional area distribution according to the area rule.

Aircraft designed according to Whitcomb&#x27;s area rule (such as the F-102 Delta Dagger and the Northrop F-5) looked odd when they first appeared and were sometimes dubbed &quot;flying Coke bottles&quot;, but this became an expected part of the appearance of some transonic aircraft. Visually-apparent indications that the area rule has defined the shape of an aircraft are fuselage &quot;waisting&quot; and tip-tank shaping as on the Northrop F-5, and rear fuselage thinning on business jets with rear engines such as the Bombardier Global Express. The rule also requires careful positioning of parts, like the boosters and cargo bay on rockets and the shape and location of the canopy on the F-22 Raptor.

The supersonic area rule was applied, at Mach 2, to the prototype Concorde. The rear fuselage was extended by 3.73m on the production aircraft and reduced wave drag by 1.8%.

<text>Word Grammar is a theory of linguistics, developed by Richard Hudson since the 1980s. It started as a model of syntax, whose most distinctive characteristic is its use of dependency grammar, an approach to syntax in which the sentence&#x27;s structure is almost entirely contained in the information about individual words, and syntax is seen as consisting primarily of principles for combining words. The central syntactic relation is that of dependency between words; constituent structure is not recognized except in the special case of coordinate structures.

However an even more important claim of Word Grammar is that statements about words and their properties form a complex network of propositions. More recent work on Word Grammar cites neurocognitive linguistics as a source of inspiration for the idea that language is nothing but a network. One of the attractions of the network view is the possibility of analysing language in the same way as other kinds of knowledge, given that knowledge, or long-term memory, is widely considered to be a network.

Word grammar is an example of cognitive linguistics, which models language as part of general knowledge and not as a specialised mental faculty. This is in contrast to the nativism of Noam Chomsky and his students.

<text>West Pakistan was the western province of Pakistan between 1955 and 1970, covering the territory of present-day Pakistan. Its land borders were with Afghanistan, India and Iran, with a maritime border with Oman in the Gulf of Oman in the Arabian Sea.

Following its independence from British rule, the new Dominion of Pakistan was physically separated into two exclaves, with the western and eastern wings geographically separated from each other by India. The western wing of Pakistan comprised three governor&#x27;s provinces (the North-West Frontier, West Punjab and Sind), one chief commissioner&#x27;s province (Baluchistan) along with the Baluchistan States Union, several independent princely states (notably Bahawalpur, Chitral, Dir, Hunza, Khairpur and Swat), the Karachi Federal Capital Territory, and the autonomous tribal areas adjoining the North-West Frontier Province. The eastern wing of the new country—known as East Pakistan—comprised the single province of East Bengal (which included the former Assamese district of Sylhet and the Chittagong Hill Tracts).

West Pakistan was the politically dominant division of the Pakistani union, despite East Pakistan making up more than half of its population. The eastern wing also had a disproportionately small number of seats in the Constituent Assembly. This administrative inequality between the two wings, coupled with the major geographical distance between them, was believed to be delaying the adoption of a constitution for Pakistan. To aid in diminishing the differences between the two regions, the Pakistani government decided to reorganize the country into two distinct provinces under the One Unit policy announced by then Pakistani Prime Minister Chaudhry Muhammad Ali on 22 November 1954.

In 1970, the President of Pakistan General Yahya Khan enacted a series of territorial, constitutional and military reforms. These established the provincial assemblies, state parliament, as well as the current provisional borders of Pakistan&#x27;s four official provinces. On 1July 1970, West Pakistan was abolished under the Legal Framework Order of 1970, which dissolved the One Unit policy and restored the four provinces. This order had no effect on East Pakistan, which retained the geopolitical position established in 1955. The following year saw a major civil war erupt between West Pakistan and Bengali nationalists in East Pakistan. After a full-scale military intervention by India in support of the Bengali freedom fighters and after West Pakistan&#x27;s subsequent defeat, the exclave of East Pakistan seceded from its union with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan as the new People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh.

==Political history==

===Independence after British colonial period===
At the time of the state establishment in 1947, the founding fathers of Pakistan participated in the Boundary Commission conference. Headed by Cyril Radcliffe, the commission was tasked with negotiating the arrangement, area division, and future political set up of Pakistan and India.

Pakistan was formed from two distinct areas, separated by of India. The western state was composed of three Governor&#x27;s provinces (North-West Frontier, West-Punjab and Sindh Province), one Chief Commissioner&#x27;s province (Baluchistan Province), the Baluchistan States Union, several other princely states (notably Bahawalpur, Chitral, Dir, Hunza, Khairpur and Swat), the Federal Capital Territory (around Karachi) and the tribal areas. The eastern wing of the new country – East Pakistan – formed the single province of East Bengal, including the former Assam district of Sylhet and the Hill Tracts.

West Pakistan experienced great problems related to the divisions, including ethnic and racial friction, lack of knowledge, and uncertainty of where to demarcate the permanent borders. East Pakistan, Balochistan, and the North-West Frontier Province experienced little difficulty, but Southern Pakistani Punjab faced considerable problems that had to be fixed. Former East Punjab was integrated with the Indian administration and millions of Punjabi Muslims were expelled to be replaced by a Sikh and Hindu population and vice versa. The communal violence spread to all over the Indian subcontinent. Economic rehabilitation efforts needing the attention of Pakistan&#x27;s founding fathers further escalated the problems.

The division also divided the natural resources, industries, economic infrastructure, manpower, and military might, with India as the larger share owner. India retained 345 million in population (91%) to Pakistan&#x27;s 35 million (9%). Land area was divided as 78% to India and 22% to Pakistan. Military forces were divided up with a ratio of 64% for India and 36% for Pakistan. Most of the military assets – such as weapons depots and military bases – were located inside India; facilities in Pakistan were mostly obsolete, and they had a dangerously low ammunition reserve of only one week. Four divisions were raised in West Pakistan, whilst one division was raised in East Pakistan.

===Parliamentary democracy===
From the time of its establishment, the State of Pakistan had the vision of a federal parliamentary democratic republic form of government. With the founding fathers remaining in West Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan was appointed the country&#x27;s first prime minister, with Mohammad Ali Jinnah as Governor-General. West Pakistan claimed the exclusive mandate over all of Pakistan, with the majority of the Pakistan Movement&#x27;s leading figures in West Pakistan. In 1949, the Constituent Assembly passed the Objectives Resolution and the Annex to the Constitution of Pakistan, paving the road to a Westernized federal parliamentary republic. The work on parliamentary reforms was constituted by the constituent assembly the year after, in 1950.

The western section of Pakistan dominated the politics of the new country. Although East Pakistan had over half of the population, it had a disproportionately small number of seats in the Constituent Assembly. This inequality of the two wings and the geographical distance between them was believed to be holding up the adoption of a new constitution. To diminish the differences between the two regions, the government decided to reorganise the country into two distinct provinces.

Under the One Unit policy announced by Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra on 22 November 1954, the four provinces and territories of western Pakistan were integrated into one unit to mirror the single province in the east. The state of West Pakistan was established by the merger of the provinces, states, and tribal areas of West Pakistan. The province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at Karachi. Later the state capital moved to Lahore, and it was finally established in Islamabad in 1965. The province of East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan with the provincial state capital at Dhaka (Dacca).

Clashes between West Pakistan and East Pakistan soon erupted, further destabilising the entire country. The two states had different political ideologies and different lingual cultural aspect. West Pakistan had been founded on the main basis of a parliamentary democracy (and had a parliamentary republic form of government since 1947), with Islam as its state religion. In contrast, East Pakistan had been a socialist state since the 1954 elections, with state secularism proclaimed. West Pakistan sided with the United States and her NATO allies, whilst East Pakistan remained sympathetic to the Soviet Union and her Eastern Bloc. Pakistan&#x27;s 1956 constitution validated the parliamentary form of government, with Islam as state religion and Urdu, English and Bengali as state languages. The 1956 constitution also established the Parliament of Pakistan as well as the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

Ethnic and religious violence in Lahore, which began in 1953, spread all over the country. Muhammad Ali Bogra, prime minister of Pakistan, declared martial law in Lahore to curb the violence. This inter-communal violence soon spread to India, and a regional conflict put West Pakistan and India in a war-threatening situation. The prime ministers of Pakistan and India held an emergency meeting in Lahore.

===Military dictatorships===
From 1947 to 1959, the government was only partially stable. Seven prime ministers, four governors-general, and one president were forcefully removed either by constitutional coup or by military coup. The One Unit program was met with harsh opposition, civil unrest, and political disturbance. Support for the Muslim League and Pakistan Socialist Party in the upcoming elections threatened Pakistan&#x27;s technocracy. The Muslim League and Socialist Party gained momentum after the League&#x27;s defeat in the 1954 elections, and the Socialist Party were challenging for the constituencies of the President Iskandar Mirza&#x27;s Republican Party. Relations with the United States deteriorated, with the US assessing that democracy in both states was failing.

A US-backed military coup d&#x27;état was launched in 1958 by the Pakistan Army command. The Urdu-speaking class and the Bengali nation were forcefully removed from the affairs of West Pakistan. With the imposition of martial law led by then-Army Commander-in-Chief General Ayub Khan, the state capital was moved from Karachi to Army Generals Combatant Headquarters (The GHQ) at Rawalpindi in 1959, whilst the federal legislature was moved to Dacca. In 1963, Rawalpindi had become ineffective as a federal capital; a new city was planned and constructed, finally completing in 1965. In 1965, the state capital was finally re-located in Islamabad.

===Dissolution in 1970===

On contrary perception, the provinces did not benefit from economic progress, but the One Unit program strengthened the central government. In West Pakistan, the four provinces also struggled hard for the abolition of One Unit which caused injustices to them as it was imposed on them.

The provisional powerful committees pressured the central government through the means of civil disobedience, violence on street, raising slogans against the martial law, and attacks on government machines such as police forces. For several weeks, the four provinces worked together and guided the &quot;One Unit Dissolution Committee&quot;, towards resolving all outstanding issues in time set by the Yahya government. Finally, the committee&#x27;s plan went into effect on 1 July 1970, when West Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;One Unit&quot; was dissolved, and all power was transferred to the provinces of Balochistan, the North West Frontier Province, Punjab and Sindh.

In the 1970 general elections (held in December 1970), the Bengali Awami League under Mujibur Rahman won an overall majority of seats in Parliament and all but 2 of the 162 seats allocated to East Pakistan. The Awami League advocated greater autonomy for East Pakistan but the military government did not permit Mujib-ur-Rahman to form a government.

East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh on 16 December 1971. The term West Pakistan became redundant.

== Demographics ==

The total population of the region that composes West Pakistan was approximately 29.6 million as per the 1941 census.

According to the 1961 census, the total population of Pakistan was 93 million, with 42.8 million residing in West Pakistan and 50 million residing in East Pakistan. East Pakistan hence made up around 55% of Undivided Pakistan&#x27;s population whilst remaining 45% was in West Pakistan. West Pakistan also had a marginally faster growing population than East Pakistan. 

=== Literacy rate ===
The literacy rate in Pakistan was 19.2%, in which East Pakistan had a literacy rate of 21.5% while West Pakistan had a literacy rate of 16.9%. 

=== Ethnic groups ===
The major ethnic groups of West Pakistan was made up of Punjabis (who made up the overall majority of the province), Pashtuns, Sindhis, Muhajirs, and Balochis. 

=== Migration ===
During British India&#x27;s partition, it was estimated that 15 million were displaced, and nearly more than 2 million consisting of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs were killed in the deadly riots.
During the period between 1947 and 1950, 8.6 million Muslims had moved to specially Pakistan&#x27;s West Punjab region and about 6.7 million Hindus and Sikhs had gone the other way to India&#x27;s East Punjab region and thus changing the demography of Pakistan drastically and resulting in overwhelming Muslim majority to this region.

=== Religion ===
With the exception of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, all administrative divisions in the region that would compose West Pakistan after independence collected religious data, with a combined total population of 27,266,001, for an overall response rate of 92 percent. Similar to the contemporary era, where censuses do not collect religious data in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan, the total number of responses for religion is slightly smaller than the total population, as detailed in the table breakdown below.

According to the 1961 census, in West Pakistan, Muslims made up 97.2% of the population, Christians 1.4%, and the remaining 1.4% belonging to other religions.

==Government==

West Pakistan went through many political changes, and had a multiple political party system. West Pakistan&#x27;s political system consisted of the popular influential Left-wing sphere against elite Right-wing circles.

===Parliamentary republic===
Since independence, Pakistan had been a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy (even as of today, the parliamentary system is the official form of government of Pakistan) with a Prime minister as the head of the government and a Monarch as the head of state in a ceremonial office.

The 1956 Constitution provided the country with Parliamentary form of Government and the office of President was inaugurated the same year. The career civil service officer Major-General (retired) Iskander Mirza became the country&#x27;s first President, but the system did not evolve for more than the three years, when Mirza imposed the martial law in 1958. Mirza appointed army commander-in-chief General Ayub Khan as Chief Martial Law Administrator; he later turned his back on the President and exiled him to Great Britain after the military government was installed.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan was a judicial authority, a power broker in country&#x27;s politics that played a major role in minimising the role of parliament. The Supreme Court was moved to Islamabad in 1965 and Chief Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius re-located the entire judicial arbiter, personnel and high-profile cases in Islamabad. The Supreme Court building is one of the most attractive places in Islamabad, yet the most largely beautiful building in the state capital.

This provisional parliament had no lasting effects of West Pakistan&#x27;s affairs but it was a ceremonial legislature where the lawmakers would gather around to discuss non-political matters. In 1965, the legislative parliament was moved to Islamabad after Ayub Khan built a massive capitol. The assembly was renamed as the Parliament of Pakistan and staffed only with technocrats.

===Governor and chief minister===
The office of Governor of West Pakistan was a largely ceremonial position but later Governors wielded some executive powers as well. The first Governor was Mushtaq Ahmed Gurmani, who was also the last Governor of West Punjab. Ayub Khan abolished the Governor&#x27;s office and instead established the Martial Law Administrator of West Pakistan (MLA West).

The office Chief Minister of West Pakistan was the chief executive of the state and the leader of the largest party in the provincial assembly. The first Chief Minister was Abdul Jabbar Khan who had served twice as Chief Minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province prior to independence. The office of Chief Minister was abolished in 1958 when Ayub Khan took over the administration of West Pakistan.

===Local government===
The twelve divisions of West Pakistan province were Bahawalpur, Dera Ismail Khan, Hyderabad, Kalat, Khairpur, Lahore, Malakand, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta, Rawalpindi, and Sargodha; all named after their capitals except the capital of Malakand was Saidu, and Rawalpindi was administered from Islamabad. The province also incorporated the former Omani enclave of Gwadar following its purchase in 1958, and the former Federal Capital Territory (Karachi) in 1958; the latter in 1960 forming a new division in its own right.

In 1970, the Martial Law Office was dissolved by General Yahya Khan who disestablished the state of West Pakistan. On 1 July 1970, the provisional assemblies of Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Office of Prime minister, and much of the civil institutions were revived and re-established by the decree signed by Yahya Khan. The four provinces and four administrative units retained their current status and local governments were constitutionally established in 1970 to manage and administer the provisional autonomy given to the provinces in 1970.

== Geography ==
West Pakistan was extremely diverse in terms of geography, climate, and variety of wildlife. North-Western West Pakistan was mountainous, Punjab and Sindh were semi-arid, and the Baluchistan region in particular was predominantly desert. West Pakistan had a varied relief, consisting as it does of plains, plateaux and mountains watered by the Indus River and its tributaries. Climatically, West Pakistan had a continental type of climate without extensive rainfall. Due to its low rainfall, the main crops of West Pakistan were wheat, millets, and cotton and any crop that did not require much water.

== Administration ==
West Pakistan Province Comprises in 12 divisions, 45 districts and 6 agencies.

The administration of West Pakistan Province is given below:
==Domestic affairs==
===Position toward East Pakistan===
During West Pakistan&#x27;s conflict with India, East Pakistan&#x27;s military government remained silent and did not send any troops to exert pressure on Eastern India. West Pakistan accused East Pakistan of not taking any action, and their inaction caused West Pakistani resentment against East Pakistan&#x27;s government. In fact, the Indian Air Force Eastern Air Command attacked East Pakistan&#x27;s Air Force. However, East Pakistan was defended only by the under-strength 14th Infantry Division and sixteen fighter jets; no tanks and no navy were established in East Pakistan.

===Days of disintegration===
The One Unit policy was regarded as a rational administrative reform that would reduce expenditure and eliminate provincial prejudices. West Pakistan formed a seemingly block, but in reality it comprised marked linguistic and ethnic distinctions. The four provinces did not quite fit official definitions of a single nation.

The Sindhi and Urdu-speaking class in Sindh Province revolted against the One Unit policy. The violence spread to Balochistan Province, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab Province. The One Unit policy was a failure in West Pakistan, and its survival was seen as improbable. However, with the military coup of 1958, trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President took over executive powers for West Pakistan.

===Influence of socialism===

Due to West Pakistan&#x27;s close relations with the United States and the capitalist states, the influence of socialism had far more deeper roots in the West Pakistan population. The population favoured socialism but never allied with communism. The Pakistan Socialist Party had previously lost support due to its anti-Pakistan clauses during the time of the pre-independence movement. However, despite initiatives to improve the population during the Ayub Khan&#x27;s government, the poor masses did not enjoy the benefits and reforms that were enjoyed by the middle and gentry classes of Pakistan.

After the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, the cultural revolution, resentment, hostility towards the government began to arise when the population felt that &quot;Kashmir cause&quot; was betrayed by President Ayub Khan. Problems further mounted after Foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was sacked and vowed to take a revenge. After gathering and uniting the scattered democratic socialist and Marxist masses, Bhutto founded the Pakistan Peoples Party in 1967. The socialists tapped a wave of antipathy against the United States-allied president. The socialists integrated in poor and urban provinces of West Pakistan, educating people to cast their vote for their better future, and the importance of democracy was widely sensed in the entire country. The socialists, under Bhutto&#x27;s guidance and leadership, played a vital role in managing labour strikes and civil disobedience to challenge Khan&#x27;s authority. The military government responded fiercely after arresting the senior socialists&#x27; leadership, notably Bhutto, Mubashir Hassan, and Malick Mirage. This sparked gruesome violence in West Pakistan, thereby increasing pressure on Khan that he was unable to endure. Khan called for a Round Table Conference in Rawalpindi, but socialists led by Bhutto refused to accept Ayub&#x27;s continuation in office and rejected the 6 Point Movement for regional autonomy put forth in 1966 by East Pakistani politician Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

In 1969, Khan handed over power to Army Chief of Staff General Yahya Khan, who promised to hold elections within two years. Meantime, Bhutto extensively worked to gather and unite the country&#x27;s left-wing organisations, which, under Bhutto&#x27;s leadership, participated with full force and became vital players in the country&#x27;s politics.

==Foreign relations==
===Afghanistan===

The long border between West Pakistan and Afghanistan was uneasy. This is due in part to the independent Pashtun tribes that inhabit the area. In addition, the physical boundary is uncertain: the 1893 Durand Line was used by West Pakistan to mark the border between the two countries, but Afghanistan has never recognised that frontier.

In 1955, diplomatic relations were severed with the ransacking of Pakistan&#x27;s embassy. In 1961, the Pakistan Armed Forces and local Pashtun tribes suppressed an Afghan invasion in the Bajaur region of Pakistan.

===India===

West Pakistan had hostile relations with India, primarily due to aftermath of the 1947 independence from the British Empire and the issue of Kashmir.

In 1965, &quot;Operation Gibraltar&quot; had long-ranging negative effects, outside and inside the country. Foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Defence minister Vice-Admiral Afzal Rahman Khan approached President Ayub Khan for approval of a covert operation to infiltrate Indian-administered Kashmir using airborne troops from the Pakistan Army (Special Service Group) and Pakistan Air Force (Special Service Wing). During nights in August 1965, airborne troops parachuted into Indian Kashmir whilst ground assault began by Pakistan Army&#x27;s troops. The airborne troops managed to occupy much of Indian-administered Kashmir and were only from Srinagar, but this was the closest Pakistani troops ever got to capturing the city. In September 1965, India launched a counter-attack and the airborne troops were pushed back to what is today Azad Kashmir. Indian forces also crossed the ceasefire line into Azad Kashmir and captured the Haji Pir pass. 

Subsequently, Pakistan launched Operation Grand Slam, which gained significant momentum. Grand Slam was aborted after India launched an all out attack on West Pakistan, for which Pakistani troops had to be diverted. The Soviet Union intervened in the conflict in September 1965 (for fear of escalation), and the month–long war ended with no permanent territorial changes. West Pakistan and India signed the Tashkent Declaration in January 1966, but the ceasefire was criticised both in India and Pakistan, and public resentment against each other grew. In West Pakistan, Ayub Khan deposed Bhutto as his Foreign minister, and Vice-Admiral Khan blamed Bhutto for the operation&#x27;s failure. As an aftermath, Bhutto tapped into an anti-Ayub Khan movement and kicked off a storm of civil disobedience. Protests and spontaneous demonstrations broke out around the country, and Ayub Khan lost the control. In 1967, another martial law was imposed by another Army Commander-in-Chief, General Yahya Khan, who designated himself as the Chief Martial Law Administrator.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

West Pakistan had positive relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with whom it shared a small northern border.

In 1950, Pakistan was among the first countries to end official diplomatic relations with the Taiwanese Republic of China and recognise the PRC. After that, both countries maintained an extremely close and supportive relationship. The PRC provided economic, military and technical assistance to Pakistan during the Cold War, and the two countries considered each other to be close strategic allies.

===Soviet Union===

Relations varied from cool to extremely strained between West Pakistan and the Soviet Union. This was during the Cold War, and Pakistan&#x27;s close ties with the United States came at the expense of relations with the Soviets.

Soviet-Pakistan relations were further eroded during the 1960 U-2 incident, when the Soviets shot down a US spyplane; Army Chief-of-Staff Ayub Khan had given the US permission to fly out of Peshawar Air Station on reconnaissance and covert surveillance missions over the Soviet Union.

The USSR backed India during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The Soviets were the biggest supplier of military hardware to India at that time.

===United States===

The United States was one of the first nations to establish relations with Pakistan upon its independence.

Pakistan was allied with the US during the Cold War against the USSR. Pakistan was an integral member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), both alliances opposed to the Soviet Union and communism.

A major factor in Pakistan&#x27;s decision to ally with the West was their urgent need for aid. In the years that followed, the US supplied extensive economic, scientific, and military assistance to Pakistan.

This close relationship continued through Pakistan&#x27;s years of democracy and military rule. Relations only soured after West Pakistan had dissolved into Pakistan, when the left-oriented Pakistan Peoples Party came to power in 1971.

<text>West Bengal (; Bengali: , , abbr. WB) is a state in the eastern portion of India. It is situated along the Bay of Bengal, along with a population of over 91 million inhabitants within an area of as of 2011. The population estimate as of 2023 is 99,723,000. West Bengal is the fourth-most populous and thirteenth-largest state by area in India, as well as the eighth-most populous country subdivision of the world. As a part of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it borders Bangladesh in the east, and Nepal and Bhutan in the north. It also borders the Indian states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata, the third-largest metropolis, and seventh largest city by population in India. West Bengal includes the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, the Ganges delta, the Rarh region, the coastal Sundarbans and the Bay of Bengal. The state&#x27;s main ethnic group are the Bengalis, with the Bengali Hindus forming the demographic majority.

The area&#x27;s early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas, while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. The region was part of several ancient pan−Indian empires, including the Vangas, Mauryans, and the Guptas. The citadel of Gauḍa served as the capital of the Gauda kingdom, the Pala Empire, and the Sena Empire. Islam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate, but following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, the Muslim faith spread across the entire Bengal region. During the Bengal Sultanate, the territory was a major trading nation in the world, and was often referred by the Europeans as the &quot;richest country to trade with&quot;. It was absorbed into the Mughal Empire in 1576. Simultaneously, some parts of the region were ruled by several Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, and part of it was briefly overrun by the Suri Empire. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in the early 1700s, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the first Industrial Revolution. The region was later annexed into the Bengal Presidency by the British East India Company after the Battle of Buxar in 1764. From 1772 to 1911, Calcutta was the capital of all of East India Company&#x27;s territories and then the capital of the entirety of India after the establishment of the Viceroyalty. From 1912 to India&#x27;s Independence in 1947, it was the capital of the Bengal Province.

The region was a hotbed of the Indian independence movement and has remained one of India&#x27;s great artistic and intellectual centres. Following widespread religious violence, the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal in 1947 along religious lines into two independent dominions: West Bengal, a Hindu-majority Indian state, and East Bengal, a Muslim-majority province of Pakistan which later became the independent Bangladesh. The state was also flooded with Hindu refugees from East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) in the decades following the 1947 partition of India, transforming its landscape and shaping its politics. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in an expansion of Western education, culminating in developments in science, institutional education, and social reforms in the region, including what became known as the Bengali Renaissance. Several regional and pan−Indian empires throughout Bengal&#x27;s history have shaped its culture, cuisine, and architecture.
Post-Indian independence, as a welfare state, West Bengal&#x27;s economy is based on agricultural production and small and medium-sized enterprises. The state&#x27;s cultural heritage, besides varied folk traditions, ranges from stalwarts in literature including Nobel-laureate Rabindranath Tagore to scores of musicians, film-makers and artists. For several decades, the state underwent political violence and economic stagnation after the beginning of communist rule in 1977 before it rebounded. In 2023–24, the economy of West Bengal is the sixth-largest state economy in India with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of , and has the country&#x27;s 20th-highest GSDP per capita of as of 2020–21. Despite being one of the fastest-growing major economies, West Bengal has struggled to attract foreign direct investment due to adverse land acquisition policies, poor infrastructure, and red tape. It also has the 26th-highest ranking among Indian states in human development index, with the index value being lower than the Indian average. The state government debt of , or 37.67% of GSDP, has dropped from 40.65% since 2010–11. West Bengal has three World Heritage sites and ranks as the eight-most visited tourist destination in India and third-most visited state of India globally.

== Etymology ==

The origin of the name Bengal (&quot;Bangla&quot; and &quot;Bongo&quot; in Bengali) is unknown. One theory suggests the word derives from &quot;Bang&quot;, the name of a Dravidian tribe that settled the region around 1000BCE. The Bengali word &quot;Bongo&quot; might have been derived from the ancient kingdom of &quot;Vanga&quot; (or &quot;Banga&quot;). Although some early Sanskrit literature mentions the name &quot;Vanga&quot;, the region&#x27;s early history is obscure.

In 1947, at the end of British rule over the Indian subcontinent the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal, which continued as an Indian state and East Bengal, a province of Pakistan, which came to be known be as East Pakistan and later became the independent Bangladesh.

In 2011 the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the official name of the state to Paschim Banga ( &quot;Pôshchimbônggô&quot;). This is the native name of the state, literally meaning &quot;western Bengal&quot; in the native Bengali language. In August 2016 the West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed another resolution to change the name of West Bengal to &quot;Bengal&quot; in English and &quot;Bangla&quot; in Bengali. Despite the Trinamool Congress government&#x27;s efforts to forge a consensus on the name change resolution, the Indian National Congress, the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the resolution. However, the central government has turned down the proposal maintaining the state should have one single name for all languages instead of three and it should not be the same as that of any other territory (pointing out that the name &#x27;Bangla&#x27; may create confusion with neighbouring Bangladesh).

== History ==
=== Ancient and classical period ===

Stone Age tools dating back 20,000 years have been excavated in the state, showing human occupation 8,000 years earlier than scholars had thought. According to the Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; the region was part of the Vanga kingdom. Several Vedic realms were present in the Bengal region, including Vanga, Rarh, Pundravardhana and the Suhma kingdom. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention by the Ancient Greeks around 100BCE of a land named Gangaridai located at the mouths of the Ganges. Bengal had overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi (Burma, Lower Thailand, the Lower Malay Peninsula and Sumatra). According to the Sri Lankan chronicle &quot;Mahavamsa,&quot; Prince Vijaya (), a Vanga kingdom prince, conquered Lanka (modern-day Sri Lanka) and named the country Sinhala kingdom.

The kingdom of Magadha was formed in the 7thcentury BCE, consisting of the regions now comprising Bihar and Bengal. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of the lives of Mahavira, the principal figure of Jainism and Gautama Buddha, founder of Buddhism. It consisted of several janapadas, or kingdoms. Under Ashoka, the Maurya Empire of Magadha in the 3rdcentury BCE extended over nearly all of South Asia, including Afghanistan and parts of Balochistan. From the 3rd to the 6thcenturies CE, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire.
Two kingdoms—Vanga or Samatata, and Gauda—are said in some texts to have appeared after the end of the Gupta Empire although details of their ascendancy are uncertain. The first recorded independent king of Bengal was Shashanka, who reigned in the early 7thcentury. Shashanka is often recorded in Buddhist annals as an intolerant Hindu ruler noted for his persecution of the Buddhists. He murdered Rajyavardhana, the Buddhist king of Thanesar, and is noted for destroying the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, and replacing Buddha statues with Shiva lingams. After a period of anarchy, the Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years beginning in the 8thcentury. A shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty followed.

Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty invaded some areas of Bengal between 1021 and 1023.

Islam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate. Following the Ghurid conquests led by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, it spread across the entire Bengal region. Mosques, madrasas and khanqahs were built throughout these stages. During the Islamic Bengal Sultanate, founded in 1352, Bengal was a major world trading nation and was often referred by the Europeans as the richest country with which to trade. Later, in 1576, it was absorbed into the Mughal Empire.

=== Medieval and early modern periods ===

Subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region. It was ruled by dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate for the next few hundred years. The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for twenty years by a Hindu uprising under Raja Ganesha. In the 16thcentury, Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal. Administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence under the Nawabs of Murshidabad, who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi. Several independent Hindu states were established in Bengal during the Mughal period, including those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb and the Governor of Bengal, Shaista Khan, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the world&#x27;s first Industrial Revolution. The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the 16th and 17thcenturies; it weathered the Mughals and survived until the advent of the British colonial era.

=== Colonial period ===

Several European traders reached this area in the late 15thcentury. The British East India Company defeated Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab, in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The company gained the right to collect revenue in Bengal subah (province) in 1765 with the signing of the treaty between the East India company and the Mughal emperor following the Battle of Buxar in 1764. The Bengal Presidency was established in 1765; it later incorporated all British-controlled territory north of the Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh), from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab. The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives due to tax policies enacted by the British company. Calcutta, the headquarters of the East India company, was named the capital of British-held territories in India in 1773. The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in a transfer of authority to the British Crown, administered by the Viceroy of India.

The Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj socio-cultural reform movements significantly influenced the cultural and economic life of Bengal. Between 1905 and 1911 an abortive attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones. Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943, which claimed threemillion lives during World WarII. Bengalis played a major role in the Indian independence movement, in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant. Armed attempts against the British Raj from Bengal reached a climax when news of Subhas Chandra Bose leading the Indian National Army against the British reached Bengal. The Indian National Army was subsequently routed by the British.

=== Indian independence and afterwards ===

When India gained independence in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines. The western part went to the Dominion of India and was named West Bengal. The eastern part went to the Dominion of Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan in 1956), becoming the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971. In 1950 the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal. In 1955 the former French enclave of Chandannagar, which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal; portions of Bihar were also subsequently merged with West Bengal. Both West and East Bengal experienced large influxes of refugees during and after the partition in 1947. Refugee resettlement and related issues continued to play a significant role in the politics and socio-economic condition of the state.
During the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist–Maoist movement by groups known as the Naxalites damaged much of the city&#x27;s infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation and deindustrialisation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in an influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure. The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress. The Left Front, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), governed the state for the next three decades.

The state&#x27;s economic recovery gathered momentum after the central government introduced economic liberalisations in the mid-1990s. This was aided by the advent of information technology and IT-enabled services. Beginning in the mid-2000s, armed activists conducted minor terrorist attacks in some parts of the state. Clashes with the administration took place at several controversial locations over the issue of industrial land acquisition. This became a decisive reason behind the defeat of the ruling Left Front government in the 2011 assembly election. Although the economy was severely damaged during the unrest in the 1970s, the state has managed to revive its economy steadily throughout the years. The state has shown improvement regarding &quot;bandhs&quot; (strikes) and educational infrastructure. Significant strides have been made in reducing unemployment, though the state suffers from substandard healthcare services, a lack of socio-economic development, poor infrastructure, unemployment and civil violence. In 2006 the state&#x27;s healthcare system was severely criticised in the aftermath of the West Bengal blood test kit scam.

== Geography ==
West Bengal is on the eastern bottleneck of India, stretching from the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. The state has a total area of . The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state is a part of the eastern Himalayas mountain range. In this region is Sandakfu, which, at , is the highest peak in the state. The narrow Terai region separates the hills from the North Bengal plains, which in turn transitions into the Ganges delta towards the south. The Rarh region intervenes between the Ganges delta in the east and the western plateau and high lands. A small coastal region is in the extreme south, while the Sundarbans mangrove forests form a geographical landmark at the Ganges delta.

The main river in West Bengal is the Ganges, which divides into two branches. One branch enters Bangladesh as the &quot;Padma&quot;, or &quot;Pôdda&quot;, while the other flows through West Bengal as the Bhagirathi River and Hooghly River. The Farakka barrage over the Ganges feeds the Hooghly branch of the river by a feeder canal. Its water flow management has been a source of lingering dispute between India and Bangladesh. The Teesta, Torsa, Jaldhaka and Mahananda rivers are in the northern hilly region. The western plateau region has rivers like the Damodar, Ajay and Kangsabati. The Ganges delta and the Sundarbans area have numerous rivers and creeks. Pollution of the Ganges from indiscriminate waste dumped into the river is a major problem. Damodar, another tributary of the Ganges and once known as the &quot;Sorrow of Bengal&quot; (due to its frequent floods), has several dams under the Damodar Valley Project. At least nine districts in the state suffer from arsenic contamination of groundwater, and as of 2017 an estimated 1.04crore people were afflicted by arsenic poisoning.

West Bengal&#x27;s climate varies from tropical savanna in the southern portions to humid subtropical in the north. The main seasons are summer, the rainy season, a short autumn and winter. While the summer in the delta region is noted for excessive humidity, the western highlands experience a dry summer like northern India. The highest daytime temperatures range from . At night, a cool southerly breeze carries moisture from the Bay of Bengal. In early summer, brief squalls and thunderstorms known as &quot;Kalbaisakhi&quot;, or Nor&#x27;westers, often occur. West Bengal receives the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian Ocean monsoon that moves in a southeast to northwest direction. Monsoons bring rain to the whole state from June to September. Heavy rainfall of above is observed in the Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, and Cooch Behar district. During the arrival of the monsoons, low pressure in the Bay of Bengal region often leads to the formation of storms in the coastal areas. Winter (December–January) is mild over the plains with average minimum temperatures of . A cold and dry northern wind blows in the winter, substantially lowering the humidity level. The Darjeeling Himalayan Hill region experiences a harsh winter, with occasional snowfall.

=== Flora and fauna ===
The &quot;India State of Forest Report 2017&quot;, recorded forest area in the state is , while in 2013, forest area was , which was 18.93% of the state&#x27;s geographical area, compared to the then national average of 21.23%. Reserves and protected and unclassed forests constitute 59.4%, 31.8% and 8.9%, respectively, of forested areas, as of 2009. Part of the world&#x27;s largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans in southern West Bengal.

From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of the western part of the state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is &quot;Shorea robusta&quot;, commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the &quot;Casuarina&quot;. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous &quot;sundari&quot; (&quot;Heritiera fomes&quot;), from which the forest gets its name.

The distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation. For example, the foothills of the Himalayas, the &quot;Dooars&quot;, are densely wooded with sal and other tropical evergreen trees. Above an elevation of , the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above , temperate forest trees like oaks, conifers and rhododendrons predominate.

3.26% of the geographical area of West Bengal is protected land, comprising fifteen wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks—Sundarbans National Park, Buxa Tiger Reserve, Gorumara National Park, Neora Valley National Park and Singalila National Park. Extant wildlife includes Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephant, deer, leopard, gaur, tiger and crocodiles, as well as many bird species. Migratory birds come to the state during the winter. The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer, red panda, chinkara, takin, serow, pangolin, minivet and kalij pheasants. The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project devoted to conserving the endangered Bengal tiger, although the forest hosts many other endangered species such as the Gangetic dolphin, river terrapin and estuarine crocodile. The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal. Recognising its special conservation value, the Sundarbans area has been declared a Biosphere Reserve.

== Government and politics ==
West Bengal is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker&#x27;s absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor is the Head of State appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor. The Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 members, or MLAs, including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. Terms of office run for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved before the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as &quot;panchayats&quot;, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes 42 seats to the Lok Sabha and 16 seats to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament.

Politics in West Bengal is dominated by the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian National Congress (INC), and the Left Front alliance (led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M)). Following the West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress coalition under Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress was elected to power with 225 seats in the legislature.

Prior to this, West Bengal was ruled by the Left Front for 34 years (1977–2011), making it the world&#x27;s longest-running democratically elected communist government. Banerjee was re-elected twice as Chief Minister in the 2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election and 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election with 211 and 215 seats respectively, an absolute majority by the Trinamool Congress. The state has one autonomous region, the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration.

== Districts and cities ==
=== Districts ===

 West Bengal is divided into 23 districts.

Each district is governed by a district collector or district magistrate, appointed by either the Indian Administrative Service or the West Bengal Civil Service. Each district is subdivided into sub-divisions, governed by a Sub-Divisional Magistrate, and again into blocks. Blocks consists of panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities.

===Cities===
The capital and largest city of the state is Kolkata—the third-largest urban agglomeration and the seventh-largest city in India. Asansol is the second-largest city and urban agglomeration in West Bengal.

Major planned cities of West Bengal include Bidhannagar, New Town, Kalyani, Haldia, Durgapur and Kharagpur. Kolkata has some planned neighbourhoods like New Garia, Tollygunge, and Lake Town. Siliguri is an economically important city, strategically located in the northeastern Siliguri Corridor (Chicken&#x27;s Neck) of India. Other larger cities and towns in West Bengal are Howrah, Chandannagar, Bardhaman, Baharampur, Jalpaiguri, and Purulia etc. 

== Economy ==

, West Bengal has the sixth-highest GSDP in India. GSDP at current prices (base 2004–2005) has increased from Rs 2,086.56 billion in 2004–05 to Rs 8,00,868 crores in 2014–2015, reaching Rs 10,21,000 crores in 2017–18. GSDP per cent growth at current prices varied from a low of 10.3% in 2010–2011 to a high of 17.11% in 2013–2014. The growth rate was 13.35% in 2014–2015. The state&#x27;s per capita income has lagged the all India average for over two decades. As of 2014–2015, per capita NSDP at current prices was Rs78,903. Per-capita NSDP growth rate at current prices varied from 9.4% in 2010–2011 to a high of 16.15% in 2013–2014. The growth rate was 12.62% in 2014–2015.

In 2015–2016, the percentage share of Gross Value Added (GVA) at factor cost by economic activity at the constant price (the base year 2011–2012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery—4.84%, Industry 18.51% and Services 66.65%. It has been observed that there has been a slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state&#x27;s principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane and wheat are the state&#x27;s top five crops. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high-quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia Port region. The Durgapur-Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of steel plants. Important manufacturing industries include: engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established several industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in nearby areas have made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.

Years after independence, West Bengal is dependent on the central government for help in meeting its demands for food; food production remained stagnant, and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, there has been a significant increase in food production since the 1980s and the state now has a surplus of grains. The state&#x27;s share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–1981, declining to 5% by 1997–1998. In contrast, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate. The state&#x27;s total financial debt stood at as of 2011.
In the period 2004–2010, the average gross state domestic product (GSDP) growth rate was 13.9% (calculated in Indian rupee terms) lower than 15.5%, the average for all states of the country.

The economy of West Bengal has witnessed many surprising changes in direction. The agricultural sector in particular rose to 8.33% in 2010–11 before tumbling to −4.01% in 2012–13. Many major industries such as the Uttarpara Hindustan Motors car manufacturing unit, the jute industry, and the Haldia Petrochemicals unit experienced shutdowns in 2014. In the same year, plans for a 300 billion Jindal Steel project was mothballed. The tea industry of West Bengal has also witnessed shutdowns for financial and political reasons. The tourism industry of West Bengal was negatively impacted in 2017 because of the Gorkhaland agitation.

However, over the years due to effective changes in the stance towards industrialisation, ease of doing business has improved in West Bengal. Steps are being taken to remedy this situation by promoting West Bengal as an investment destination. A leather complex has been built in Kolkata. Smart cities are being planned close to Kolkata, and major roadway projects are in the offing to revive the economy. West Bengal has been able to attract 2% of the foreign direct investment in the last decade.

== Culture ==
=== Literature ===
The Bengali language boasts a rich literary heritage it shares with neighbouring Bangladesh. West Bengal has a long tradition of folk literature, evidenced by the &quot;Charyapada&quot;, a collection of Buddhist mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11thcenturies; &quot;Mangalkavya&quot;, a collection of Hindu narrative poetry composed around the 13thcentury; &quot;Shreekrishna Kirtana&quot;, a pastoral Vaishnava drama in verse composed by Boru Chandidas; &quot;Thakurmar Jhuli&quot;, a collection of Bengali folk and fairy tales compiled by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder; and stories of Gopal Bhar, a court jester in medieval Bengal. In the 19th and 20thcenturies, Bengali literature was modernised in the works of authors such as Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works marked a departure from the traditional verse-oriented writings prevalent in that period; Michael Madhusudan Dutt, a pioneer in Bengali drama who introduced the use of blank verse; and Rabindranath Tagore, who reshaped Bengali literature and music. Indian art saw the introduction of Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20thcenturies. Other notable figures include Kazi Nazrul Islam, whose compositions form the avant-garde genre of &quot;Nazrul Sangeet&quot;, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works on contemporary social practices in Bengal are widely acclaimed, and Manik Bandyopadhyay, who is considered one of the leading lights of modern Bengali fiction. In modern times, Jibanananda Das has been acknowledged as &quot;the premier poet of the post-Tagore era in India&quot;. Other writers include: Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, best known for his work &quot;Pather Panchali&quot;; Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, well known for his portrayal of the lower strata of society; Manik Bandopadhyay, a pioneering novelist; and Ashapurna Devi, Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, Saradindu Bandopadhyay, Buddhadeb Guha, Mahashweta Devi, Samaresh Majumdar, Sanjeev Chattopadhyay, Shakti Chattopadhyay, Buddhadeb Basu, Joy Goswami and Sunil Gangopadhyay.

=== Music and dance ===

A notable music tradition is the Baul music, practised by the Bauls, a sect of mystic minstrels. Other folk music forms include Gombhira and Bhawaiya. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the ektara, a one-stringed instrument. Shyama Sangeet is a genre of devotional songs, praising the Hindu goddess Kali; kirtan is devotional group songs dedicated to the god Krishna. Like other states in northern India, West Bengal also has a heritage in North Indian classical music. Rabindrasangeet, songs composed and set to words by Rabindranath Tagore, and Nazrul geeti (by Kazi Nazrul Islam) are popular. Also prominent are Dwijendralal, Atulprasad and Rajanikanta&#x27;s songs, and &quot;adhunik&quot; or modern music from films and other composers. From the early 1990s, new genres of music have emerged, including what has been called Bengali &quot;Jeebonmukhi Gaan&quot; (a modern genre based on realism). Bengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance traditions. Chhau dance of Purulia is a rare form of masked dance.

=== Films ===
West Bengali films are shot mostly in studios in the Kolkata neighbourhood of Tollygunge; the name &quot;Tollywood&quot; (similar to Hollywood and Bollywood) is derived from that name. The Bengali film industry is well known for its art films, and has produced acclaimed directors like Satyajit Ray who is widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century, Mrinal Sen whose films were known for their artistic depiction of social reality, Tapan Sinha, and Ritwik Ghatak. Some contemporary directors include veterans such as: Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Tarun Majumdar, Goutam Ghose, Aparna Sen, and Rituparno Ghosh, and a newer pool of directors such as Kaushik Ganguly and Srijit Mukherji. Uttam Kumar was the most popular lead actor for decades, and his romantic pairing with actress Suchitra Sen in films attained legendary status. Soumitra Chatterjee, who acted in many Satyajit Ray-films, and Prosenjit Chatterjee are among other popular lead male actors. , Bengali films have won India&#x27;s annual National Film Award for Best Feature Film twenty-two times in sixty seven years, the highest among all Indian languages.

=== Fine arts ===

There are significant examples of fine arts in Bengal from earlier times, including the terracotta art of Hindu temples and the Kalighat paintings. Bengal has been in the vanguard of modernism in fine arts. Abanindranath Tagore, called the father of modern Indian art, started the Bengal School of Art, one of whose goals was to promote the development of styles of art outside the European realist tradition that had been taught in art colleges under the British colonial administration. The movement had many adherents, including: Gaganendranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baij, Jamini Roy and Rabindranath Tagore. After Indian Independence, important groups such as the Calcutta Group and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India.

=== Reformist heritage ===
The capital, Kolkata, was the workplace of several social reformers, including Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Vivekananda. Their social reforms eventually led to a cultural atmosphere that made it possible for practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination, or untouchability, to be abolished. The region was also home to several religious teachers, such as Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Prabhupada and Paramahansa Yogananda.

=== Cuisine ===
Rice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying in Bengali, &quot;machhe bhate bangali&quot;, that translates as &quot;fish and rice make a Bengali&quot;. Bengal&#x27;s vast repertoire of fish-based dishes includes hilsa preparations, a favourite among Bengalis. There are numerous ways of cooking fish depending on its texture, size, fat content and bones. Most of the people also consume eggs, chicken, mutton, and shrimp. &quot;Panta bhat&quot; (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen include cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies and turmeric. Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including &quot;Rôshogolla&quot;, &quot;Chômchôm&quot;, &quot;Kalojam&quot; and several kinds of &quot;sondesh&quot;. Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread, or dim sum, are specialties of the winter season. Sweets such as &quot;narkol-naru&quot;, &quot;til-naru&quot;, &quot;moa&quot; and &quot;payesh&quot; are prepared during festivals such as Lakshmi puja. Popular street foods include Aloor Chop, Beguni, Kati roll, biryani, and phuchka.

=== Clothing ===

Bengali women commonly wear the &quot;sari&quot;, often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear western attire. Among men, western dress has greater acceptance. Particularly on cultural occasions, men also wear traditional costumes such as the &quot;panjabi&quot; with &quot;dhuti&quot; while women wear &quot;salwar kameez&quot; or &quot;sari&quot;.

West Bengal produces several varieties of cotton and silk &quot;saris&quot; in the country. Handlooms are a popular way for the state&#x27;s rural population to earn a living through weaving. Every district has weaving clusters, which are home to artisan communities, each specialising in specific varieties of handloom weaving. Notable handloom saris include &quot;tant&quot;, &quot;jamdani&quot;, &quot;garad&quot;, &quot;korial&quot;, &quot;baluchari&quot;, &quot;tussar&quot; and muslin.

=== Festivals ===
Durga Puja is the biggest, most popular and widely celebrated festival in West Bengal. The five-day-long colourful Hindu festival includes intense celebration across the state. Pandals are erected in various cities, towns, and villages throughout West Bengal. The city of Kolkata transforms Durga Puja. It is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of the goddess Durga and her four children are displayed and worshipped. The idols of the goddess are brought in from Kumortuli, where idol-makers work throughout the year fashioning clay models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival. Today people of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds partake in the festivities. On Vijayadashami, the last day of the festival, the effigies are paraded through the streets with riotous pageantry before being immersed into the rivers.

Rath Yatra is a Hindu festival which celebrates Jagannath, a form of Krishna. It is celebrated with much fanfare in Kolkata as well as in rural Bengal. Images of Jagannath are set upon a chariot and pulled through the streets.

Christmas, called &quot;Bôŗodin&quot; (Great day) is perhaps the next major festival celebrated in Kolkata, after Durga Puja. Although Hinduism is the major religion in the state, people show significant passion to the festival. Just like Durga Puja, Christmas in Kolkata is an occasion when all communities and people of every religion take part. Large masses of people go to parks, gardens, museums, parties, fairs, churches and other places to celebrate the day. A lot of Hindus go to Hindu-temples and the festival is celebrated there too with Hindu rituals. The state tourism department organises a gala Christmas Festival every year in Park Street. The whole of Park Street is hung with colourful lights, and food stalls sell cakes, chocolates, Chinese cuisine, momo, and various other items. The state invites musical groups from Darjeeling and other North East India states to perform choir recitals, carols, and jazz numbers.

Buddha Purnima, which marks the birth of Gautama Buddha, is one of the most important Hindu/Buddhist festivals and is celebrated with much gusto in the Darjeeling hills. On this day, processions begin at the various Buddhist monasteries, or &quot;gumpas&quot;, and congregate at the Chowrasta (Darjeeling) Mall. The Lamas chant mantras and sound their bugles, and students, as well as people from every community, carry the holy books or &quot;pustaks&quot; on their heads. Besides Buddha Purnima, Dashain, or Dusshera, Holi, Diwali, Losar, Namsoong or the Lepcha New Year, and Losoong are the other major festivals of the Darjeeling Himalayan region.

Each year between July and August at Tarakeswar Yatra held, nearly 10 million devotees come from various part of India bringing holy water of Ganga fin order to offer it to Lord Shiva.

Poush Mela is a popular winter festival of Shantiniketan, with performances of folk music, Baul songs, dance, and theatre taking place throughout the town.

Ganga Sagar Mela coincides with the Makar Sankranti, and hundreds of thousands of Hindu pilgrims converge where the river Ganges meets the sea to bathe enmasse during this fervent festival.

<doc id="34043" wikidata="Q7544" url="?curid=34043" title="Wormhole">
<text>A wormholeis a hypothetical structure which connects disparate points in spacetime. It may be visualized as a tunnel with two ends at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations, different points in time, or both). Wormholes are based on a special solution of the Einstein field equations. Specifically, they are a transcendental bijection of the spacetime continuum, an asymptotic projection of the Calabi–Yau manifold manifesting itself in anti-de Sitter space.

Wormholes are consistent with the general theory of relativity, but whether they actually exist is unknown. Many scientists postulate that wormholes are merely projections of a fourth spatial dimension, analogous to how a two-dimensional (2D) being could experience only part of a three-dimensional (3D) object. A well-known analogy of such constructs is provided by the Klein bottle, displaying a hole when rendered in three dimensions but not in four or higher dimensions. 

In 1995, Matt Visser suggested there may be many wormholes in the universe if cosmic strings with negative mass were generated in the early universe. Some physicists, such as Kip Thorne, have suggested how to make wormholes artificially.

== Visualization technique ==
For a simplified notion of a wormhole, space can be visualized as a two-dimensional surface. In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, lead into a 3D tube (the inside surface of a cylinder), then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. For example, instead of circular holes on a 2-Dimensional plane, the entry and exit points could be visualized as spherical holes in 3D space leading into a four-dimensional &quot;tube&quot; similar to a spherinder.

Another way to imagine wormholes is to take a sheet of paper and draw two somewhat distant points on one side of the paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, but theoretically, a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane (⁠&quot;i.e.&quot; the paper) so the points are touching. In this way, it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching. 

== Terminology ==
In 1928, German mathematician, philosopher and theoretical physicist Hermann Weyl proposed a wormhole hypothesis of matter in connection with mass analysis of electromagnetic field energy; however, he did not use the term &quot;wormhole&quot; (he spoke of &quot;one-dimensional tubes&quot; instead).

American theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler (inspired by Weyl&#x27;s work) coined the term &quot;wormhole&quot;. In a 1957 paper that he wrote with Charles W. Misner, they write:

=== Modern definitions ===
Wormholes have been defined both&quot; geometrically&quot; and &quot;topologically&quot;. From a topological point of view, an intra-universe wormhole (a wormhole between two points in the same universe) is a compact region of spacetime whose boundary is topologically trivial, but whose interior is not simply connected. Formalizing this idea leads to definitions such as the following, taken from Matt Visser&#x27;s &quot;Lorentzian Wormholes&quot; (1996).

Geometrically, wormholes can be described as regions of spacetime that constrain the incremental deformation of closed surfaces. For example, in Enrico Rodrigo&#x27;s &quot;The Physics of Stargates, &quot;a wormhole is defined informally as: 

== Development ==
=== Schwarzschild wormholes ===
The first type of wormhole solution discovered was the Schwarzschild wormhole, which would be present in the Schwarzschild metric describing an &quot;eternal black hole&quot;, but it was found that it would collapse too quickly for anything to cross from one end to the other. Wormholes that could be crossed in both directions, known as traversable wormholes, were thought to be possible only if exotic matter with negative energy density could be used to stabilize them. However, physicists later reported that microscopic traversable wormholes may be possible and not require any exotic matter, instead requiring only electrically charged fermionic matter with small enough mass that it cannot collapse into a charged black hole. While such wormholes, if possible, may be limited to transfers of information, humanly traversable wormholes may exist if reality can broadly be described by the Randall–Sundrum model 2, a brane-based theory consistent with string theory.

==== Einstein–Rosen bridges ====
Einstein–Rosen bridges (or ER bridges), named after Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen, are connections between areas of space that can be modeled as vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equations, and that are now understood to be intrinsic parts of the maximally extended version of the Schwarzschild metric describing an eternal black hole with no charge and no rotation. Here, &quot;maximally extended&quot; refers to the idea that the spacetime should not have any &quot;edges&quot;: it should be possible to continue this path arbitrarily far into the particle&#x27;s future or past for any possible trajectory of a free-falling particle (following a geodesic in the spacetime).

In order to satisfy this requirement, it turns out that in addition to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the event horizon from the outside, there must be a separate white hole interior region that allows us to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up &quot;away&quot; from the event horizon. And just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different &quot;universes&quot;, with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see the light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior white hole region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates.

In this spacetime, it is possible to come up with coordinate systems such that if a hypersurface of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a space-like separation, giving what is called a &#x27;space-like surface&#x27;) is picked and an &quot;embedding diagram&quot; drawn depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an &quot;Einstein–Rosen bridge&quot;. The Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole&#x27;s geography, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.

The Einstein–Rosen bridge was discovered by Ludwig Flamm in 1916, a few months after Schwarzschild published his solution, and was rediscovered by Albert Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen, who published their result in 1935. However, in 1962, John Archibald Wheeler and Robert W. Fuller published a paper showing that this type of wormhole is unstable if it connects two parts of the same universe, and that it will pinch off too quickly for light (or any particle moving slower than light) that falls in from one exterior region to make it to the other exterior region.

According to general relativity, the gravitational collapse of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular Schwarzschild black hole. In the Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, however, it forms a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge. This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric part, the torsion tensor, as a dynamic variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of matter. The minimal coupling between torsion and Dirac spinors generates a repulsive spin–spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity (e.g. a black hole). Instead, the collapsing matter reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming the other side of the bridge.

Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not traversable in both directions, their existence inspired Kip Thorne to imagine traversable wormholes created by holding the &quot;throat&quot; of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with exotic matter (material that has negative mass/energy).

Other non-traversable wormholes include &quot;Lorentzian wormholes&quot; (first proposed by John Archibald Wheeler in 1957), wormholes creating a spacetime foam in a general relativistic spacetime manifold depicted by a Lorentzian manifold, and &quot;Euclidean wormholes&quot; (named after Euclidean manifold, a structure of Riemannian manifold).

=== Traversable wormholes ===
The Casimir effect shows that quantum field theory allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be negative relative to the ordinary matter vacuum energy, and it has been shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where energy can be &quot;arbitrarily&quot; negative at a given point. Many physicists, such as Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne, and others, argued that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a traversable wormhole. The only known natural process that is theoretically predicted to form a wormhole in the context of general relativity and quantum mechanics was put forth by Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind in their ER = EPR conjecture. The quantum foam hypothesis is sometimes used to suggest that tiny wormholes might appear and disappear spontaneously at the Planck scale, and stable versions of such wormholes have been suggested as dark matter candidates. It has also been proposed that, if a tiny wormhole held open by a negative mass cosmic string had appeared around the time of the Big Bang, it could have been inflated to macroscopic size by cosmic inflation.

Lorentzian traversable wormholes would allow travel in both directions from one part of the universe to another part of that same universe very quickly or would allow travel from one universe to another. The possibility of traversable wormholes in general relativity was first demonstrated in a 1973 paper by Homer Ellis and independently in a 1973 paper by K. A. Bronnikov. Ellis analyzed the topology and the geodesics of the Ellis drainhole, showing it to be geodesically complete, horizonless, singularity-free, and fully traversable in both directions. The drainhole is a solution manifold of Einstein&#x27;s field equations for a vacuum spacetime, modified by inclusion of a scalar field minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor with antiorthodox polarity (negative instead of positive). (Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as &#x27;exotic&#x27; because of the antiorthodox coupling, finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive.) The solution depends on two parameters: , which fixes the strength of its gravitational field, and , which determines the curvature of its spatial cross sections. When is set equal to 0, the drainhole&#x27;s gravitational field vanishes. What is left is the Ellis wormhole, a nongravitating, purely geometric, traversable wormhole.

Kip Thorne and his graduate student Mike Morris independently discovered in 1988 the Ellis wormhole and argued for its use as a tool for teaching general relativity. For this reason, the type of traversable wormhole they proposed, held open by a spherical shell of exotic matter, is also known as a &quot;Morris–Thorne wormhole&quot;.

Later, other types of traversable wormholes were discovered as allowable solutions to the equations of general relativity, including a variety analyzed in a 1989 paper by Matt Visser, in which a path through the wormhole can be made where the traversing path does not pass through a region of exotic matter. However, in the pure Gauss–Bonnet gravity (a modification to general relativity involving extra spatial dimensions which is sometimes studied in the context of brane cosmology) exotic matter is not needed in order for wormholes to exist—they can exist even with no matter. A type held open by negative mass cosmic strings was put forth by Visser in collaboration with Cramer &quot;et al.&quot;, in which it was proposed that such wormholes could have been naturally created in the early universe.

Wormholes connect two points in spacetime, which means that they would in principle allow travel in time, as well as in space. In 1988, Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever worked out how to convert a wormhole traversing space into one traversing time by accelerating one of its two mouths. However, according to general relativity, it would not be possible to use a wormhole to travel back to a time earlier than when the wormhole was first converted into a time &quot;machine&quot;. Until this time it could not have been noticed or have been used.

== Raychaudhuri&#x27;s theorem and exotic matter ==
To see why exotic matter is required, consider an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands on the other side. The expansion goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect caustics to develop, at least within the vicinity of the neck. According to the optical Raychaudhuri&#x27;s theorem, this requires a violation of the averaged null energy condition. Quantum effects such as the Casimir effect cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature, but calculations in semiclassical gravity suggest that quantum effects may be able to violate this condition in curved spacetime. Although it was hoped recently that quantum effects could not violate an achronal version of the averaged null energy condition, violations have nevertheless been found, so it remains an open possibility that quantum effects might be used to support a wormhole.

== Modified general relativity ==
In some hypotheses where general relativity is modified, it is possible to have a wormhole that does not collapse without having to resort to exotic matter. For example, this is possible with R gravity, a form of () gravity.

== Faster-than-light travel ==

The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed applies only locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal (faster-than-light) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them &quot;outside&quot; the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space &quot;outside&quot; the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the same wormhole would beat the traveler.

== Time travel ==
If traversable wormholes exist, they might allow time travel. A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole might hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced propulsion system, and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both these methods, time dilation causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become &quot;younger&quot;, than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently &quot;through&quot; the wormhole than &quot;outside&quot; it, so that synchronized clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around. This means that an observer entering the &quot;younger&quot; end would exit the &quot;older&quot; end at a time when it was the same age as the &quot;younger&quot; end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine; it is more of a path through time rather than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.

According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as &quot;exotic matter&quot;. More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various energy conditions, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition, and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the Casimir effect in quantum physics. Although early calculations suggested a very large amount of negative energy would be required, later calculations showed that the amount of negative energy can be made arbitrarily small.

In 1993, Matt Visser argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other, or otherwise prevent information from passing through the wormhole. Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for causality violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex &quot;Roman ring&quot; (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.

== Interuniversal travel ==

A possible resolution to the paradoxes resulting from wormhole-enabled time travel rests on the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

In 1991 David Deutsch showed that quantum theory is fully consistent (in the sense that the so-called density matrix can be made free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves. However, later it was shown that such a model of closed timelike curves can have internal inconsistencies as it will lead to strange phenomena like distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states and distinguishing proper and improper mixture. Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe. This suggests that a wormhole time machine with an exceedingly short time jump is a theoretical bridge between contemporaneous parallel universes.

Because a wormhole time-machine introduces a type of nonlinearity into quantum theory, this sort of communication between parallel universes is consistent with Joseph Polchinski&#x27;s proposal of an Everett phone (named after Hugh Everett) in Steven Weinberg&#x27;s formulation of nonlinear quantum mechanics.

The possibility of communication between parallel universes has been dubbed interuniversal travel.

Wormhole can also be depicted in a Penrose diagram of a Schwarzschild black hole. In the Penrose diagram, an object traveling faster than light will cross the black hole and will emerge from another end into a different space, time or universe. This will be an inter-universal wormhole.

== Metrics ==
Theories of &quot;wormhole metrics&quot; describe the spacetime geometry of a wormhole and serve as theoretical models for time travel. An example of a (traversable) wormhole metric is the following:
first presented by Ellis (see Ellis wormhole) as a special case of the Ellis drainhole.

One type of non-traversable wormhole metric is the Schwarzschild solution (see the first diagram):

 + r^2(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\varphi^2).&lt;/math&gt;}}

The original Einstein–Rosen bridge was described in an article published in July 1935.

For the Schwarzschild spherically symmetric static solution 
 \, dr^2 - r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\varphi^2) + \left(1 - \frac{2m}{r} \right) \, dt^2,&lt;/math&gt;}}
where formula_1 is the proper time and formula_2.

If one replaces formula_3 with formula_4 according to formula_5

For the combined field, gravity and electricity, Einstein and Rosen derived the following Schwarzschild static spherically symmetric solution
where formula_6 is the electric charge.

The field equations without denominators in the case when formula_7 can be written


In order to eliminate singularities, if one replaces formula_3 by formula_4 according to the equation:
and with formula_7 one obtains

&lt;/math&gt;}}

== In fiction ==

Wormholes are a common element in science fiction because they allow interstellar, intergalactic, and sometimes even interuniversal travel within human lifetime scales. In fiction, wormholes have also served as a method for time travel.

<text>A web banner or banner ad is a form of advertising on the World Wide Web delivered by an ad server. This form of online advertising entails embedding an advertisement into a web page. It is intended to attract traffic to a website by linking to the website of the advertiser. In many cases, banners are delivered by a central ad server. This payback system is often how the content provider is able to pay for the Internet access to supply the content in the first place. Usually though, advertisers use ad networks to serve their advertisements, resulting in a revshare system and higher quality ad placement.

Web banners function the same way as traditional advertisements are intended to function: notifying consumers of the product or service and presenting reasons why the consumer should choose the product in question, a fact first documented on HotWired in 1996 by researchers Rex Briggs and Nigel Hollis. Web banners differ in that the results for advertisement campaigns may be monitored real-time and may be targeted to the viewer&#x27;s interests. 

Behavior is often tracked through the use of a click tag.

Many web surfers regard web advertisements as annoying because they distract from a web page&#x27;s actual content or waste bandwidth. In some cases, web banners cover screen content that the user wishes to see. Newer web browsers often include software &quot;adblocker&quot; options to disable pop-ups or block images from selected websites. Another way of avoiding banners is to use a proxy server that blocks them, such as Privoxy. Web browsers may also have extensions available that block banners, for example Adblock Plus for Mozilla Firefox, or AdThwart for Google Chrome and ie7pro for Internet Explorer.

==History==
The banner ad played a significant role in enabling the rapid development of paid advertising on the Internet.

The pioneer of online advertising was Prodigy, a company owned by IBM and Sears at the time. Prodigy used online advertising first to promote Sears products in the 1980s, and then other advertisers, including AOL, one of Prodigy&#x27;s direct competitors. Prodigy was unable to capitalize on any of its first mover advantage in online advertising. The first clickable web ad (which later came to be known by the term &quot;banner ad&quot;) was sold by Global Network Navigator (GNN) in 1993 to Heller, Ehrman, White, &amp; McAuliffe, a now defunct law firm with a Silicon Valley office. GNN was the first commercially supported web publication and one of the first commercial websites.

For many years, HotWired was regarded as the inventor of the digital banner ad, and the first web site to sell banner ads in large quantities to a wide range of major corporate advertisers. Andrew Anker was HotWired&#x27;s first CEO. Rick Boyce, a former media buyer with San Francisco advertising agency Hal Riney &amp; Partners, spearheaded the sales effort for the company. HotWired coined the term &quot;banner ad&quot; and was the first company to provide click through rate reports to its customers. The first web banner sold by HotWired was paid for by AT&amp;T Corp. and was put online on October 27, 1994. Another source also credits HotWired and October 1994, but has Coors&#x27; &quot;Zima&quot; campaign as the first web banner. In May 1994, Ken McCarthy mentored Boyce in his transition from traditional to online advertising and first introduced the concept of a clickable/trackable ad. He stated that he believed that only a direct response model—in which the return on investment of individual ads was measured—would prove sustainable over the long run for online advertising. In spite of this prediction, banner ads were valued and sold based on the number of impressions they generated.

However, Time Warner&#x27;s Pathfinder (website), which launched on October 24, 1994, the same week as HotWired, but three days earlier included banner ads. Walter Isaacson, then President of Time Inc. New Media, and the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, both credit Bruce Judson, then General Manager of Time Inc. New Media, with inventing the concept of the banner ad. In an interview for Harvard&#x27;s Shorenstein Center for Media, Politics and Public Policy, on the history of the Internet, Isaacson discussed Judson&#x27;s contribution, saying, &quot;It really transformed everything. Immediately, Madison Avenue decided, &#x27;Oh my God, we’ve got to understand this. We have to hire a lot of young people.&#x27; They would send us money. It was almost like you could look out of the Time-Life Building to Madison Avenue, and watch people walking with bags of money, to dump it on our desk, or Bruce Judson’s desk, to buy banner ads.&quot;

The first central ad server was released in July 1995 by Focalink Communications, which enabled the management, targeting, and tracking of online ads. A local ad server quickly followed from NetGravity in January 1996. The technology innovation of the ad server, together with the sale of online ads on an impression basis, fueled a dramatic rise in the proliferation of web advertising and provided the economic foundation for the web industry from the period of 1994 to 2000. The new online advertising model that emerged in the early years of the 21st century, introduced by GoTo.com (later Overture, then Yahoo! and mass marketed by Google&#x27;s AdWords program), relies heavily on tracking ad response rather than impressions.

==Standard sizes==
Ad sizes have been standardized to some extent by the IAB. Prior to the IAB standardization, banner ads appeared in over 250 different sizes. However, some websites and advertising networks (outside the Eurosphere or North America) may not use any or all of the IAB base ad sizes. The IAB ad sizes as of 2007 are :
Notes
In 2015, IAB announced advertising creative guidelines for display &amp; mobile, considering HTML5.

In 2017, IAB also introduced the new guidelines, featuring adjustable ad formats, as well as the guidelines for new digital content experiences such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), social media, mobile video, emoji ad messaging, and 360-degree video ads.

Standard web banners included into the IAB&#x27;s Universal Package and Ad Units Guidelines are supported by major ad serving companies. This is particularly relevant for IAB members such as Adform, AppNexus, Chitika, Conversant, Epom, HIRO, Mixpo, SpotXchange, ZEDO, and many others. Additionally, ad serving providers may offer other, non-standard banner sizes and technologies, as well as the support of different online advertising formats (e.g. native ads).

However, standard banner ad sizes are constantly evolving due to consumer creative fatigue and banner blindness. Ad companies consistently test performance of ad units to ensure maximum performance for their clients. IAB has updated its guideline bi-annually. Some publishers that are known for their unique, custom executions include BuzzFeed, CraveOnline, Quartz (publication), Thought Catalog, Elite Daily, Vice Media, Inc., Mic (media company), and many others. According to media research firm eMarketer, such types of custom executions through publisher direct buys are on the rise, with Native advertising spending to hit over $4.3 Billion by the end of 2015.

==Other types==

The use of web banners is not restricted to online advertising. Website designs often use non-advertising banners, also known as &quot;hero images&quot; or &quot;hero headers&quot; for aesthetic reasons. Hero images are represented by large photos, graphics, or videos that are placed in the prominent sections of a website.

A &quot;live banner&quot; is a banner ad which is created dynamically at the time of display, instead of being pre-programmed with fixed content. Live banners usually employ animation together with text, images, graphics, sounds and video to catch the viewer&#x27;s attention. Depending on the banner design, any of these multimedia elements may be defined as dynamic and therefore variable. Formerly, they were built using technologies such as Adobe Flash, Java, or Microsoft Silverlight.

<text>The Vedda ( ; (&quot;Vēḍar&quot;)), or Wanniyalaeto, are a minority indigenous group of people in Sri Lanka who, among other sub-communities such as Coast Veddas, Anuradhapura Veddas and Bintenne Veddas, are accorded indigenous status. The Vedda minority in Sri Lanka may become completely assimilated. Most speak Sinhala instead of their indigenous languages, which are nearing extinction. It has been hypothesized that the Vedda were probably the earliest inhabitants of Sri Lanka and have lived on the island since before the arrival of other groups from the Indian mainland.

A 2024 genetics study using high-resolution autosomal and Mitochondrial DNA found that the Veddas were genetically closer to the Santhal, Juang, Irula and Paniya tribes (as well as the Pallar caste) of India, than to the Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamils. The study concluded that the Veddas were &quot;a genetically drifted group with limited gene flow from neighbouring Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil populations&quot; and that the maternal Haplogroup M mediated their initial settlement of the island. Other studies have shown the Vedda share genetic components with the Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamils as well as genetic affinity with the Irula, Kota and Mulla Kuruma of India, the Semai and Senoi of Malaysia and tribal groups of Upper Myanmar.

The Ratnapura District, which is part of the Sabaragamuwa Province, is known to have been inhabited by the Veddas in the distant past. This has been shown by scholars like Nandadeva Wijesekera. The very name &quot;Sabaragamuwa&quot; is believed to have meant the village of the &quot;Sabaras&quot; or &quot;forest barbarians&quot;. Place-names such as &quot;Vedda-gala&quot; (Vedda Rock), &quot;Vedda-ela&quot; (Vedda Canal) and &quot;Vedi-Kanda&quot; (Vedda Mountain) in the Ratnapura District also bear testimony to this. As Wijesekera observes, a strong Vedda element is discernible in the population of &quot;Vedda-gala&quot; and its environs.

== Etymology ==
Ethnonyms of Vedda include &quot;Vadda&quot;, &quot;Veddah&quot;, &quot;Veddha&quot; and &quot;Vaddo&quot;. &quot;Vedda&quot; is a word that stems from the Tamil word &quot;Vēdan&quot; meaning &quot;hunter&quot;, or from Sanskrit &quot;vyādha&quot; (&quot;hunter&quot;) or &quot;veddhṛ&quot; (&quot;the one who pierces&quot;).

== Population affinities ==

=== Anthropology ===
The Vedda are often seen as the native population of Sri Lanka. A 2011 study on dental characteristics suggested a close relation between Vedda and other South Asians as well as to western Eurasian populations. A 2012 study on crania showed the Vedda to have close affinities with other South Asian populations such as other Sri Lankans, South Indians, and Punjabis and to differ significantly from Andaman islanders.

A 2013 craniometric study by Raghavan et al. showed that the Vedda are closely related to other groups in Sri Lanka and India, especially to Sinhalese and Tamils, and also indicated deep relations between South Asian populations and the modern populations of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. According to Raghavan et al. the cranial characteristics of the Vedda are closest to other South Asians and distinct from &quot;Australo-Melanesians&quot;. However, Raghavan et al. also, while also noting the distinctiveness of between South Asian (including Vedda) and Andamanese crania, explain that this is not in conflict with genetic evidence showing a partial common ancestry (a non-West Eurasian component known as &quot;Ancestral South Indian&quot; or &quot;ASI&quot;) and genetic affinity between South Asians and the native Andamanese (who are sometimes classified as Australo-Melanesians), stating that &quot;The distinctiveness of Andamanese and southern Indian crania need not challenge the finding by Reich et al. for an &quot;Ancestral South Indian&quot; ancestry shared by southern Indians and Andamanese&quot;, and that the differences may be in part due to the greater craniometric specialization of South Asians compared to Andamanese.

=== Genetics ===
Groups ancestral to the modern Veddas were probably the earliest inhabitants of Sri Lanka. Their arrival is dated tentatively to about 40,000–35,000 years ago. They show a relationship with other South Asian and Sri Lankan populations, but are genetically distinguishable from the other peoples of Sri Lanka, and show a high degree of intra-group diversity. This is consistent with a long history of existing as small subgroups undergoing significant genetic drift.

In one study on maternal (mitochondrial DNA) haplogroups in Sri Lankan populations (the Vedda, Sri Lankan Tamils, Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka, and Sinhalese), the Vedda were found to carry predominantly haplogroups U and R and to carry maternal haplogroup M at about 17%, unlike the Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka and many mainland Indian tribal groups, among which haplogroup M is predominant. The Vedda people and Low-country Sinhalese showed frequencies of haplogroup R at 45.33 and 25%, respectively. The Vedda were found to be distinct but closer to Sinhalese than to other South Asian groups. It was determined in the study to be likely that the branches of haplogroups R and U &quot;found to be particularly prevalent in the Vedda, were derived from ancestors on the Indian subcontinent.&quot;

Another study on maternal haplogroups in Sri Lankan groups (also the Vedda, Sri Lankan Tamil, and Sinhalese) found similar results, with the Vedda belonging predominantly to the mitochondrial haplogroup N (which &quot;exists in almost all European, Oceanian, and many Asian and Amerindian populations.&quot;) and its subgroups U and R (with those comprising about two thirds of their maternal lineages), differing from other South Asian groups (such as the Sri Lankan Tamil, Sinhalese, and several Indian Tribal groups) among whom haplogroup M is predominant. The study also found that &quot;South Asian (Indian) haplogroups were predominant&quot; in the three Sri Lankan groups (including the Vedda) but that the Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Tamil, and Vedda populations also &quot;had a considerable presence of West Eurasian haplogroups.&quot; One phylogenetic study on mitochondrial DNA hypervariable segments HVI and part of HVII showed the Vedda to be &quot;genetically distinct from other major ethnic groups (Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Tamils and Indian Tamils) in Sri Lanka.&quot; Another study on alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein allele frequency showed the Veddas and Sinhalese to be more biologically related to each other than to most other ethnic groups in Asia.

==Language==


The original language of the Veddas is the Vedda language, which today is used primarily by the interior Veddas of Dambana. Communities such as Coast Veddas and Anuradhapura Veddas, who do not identify themselves strictly as Veddas, also use Vedda language for communication during hunting and or for religious chants. When a systematic field study was conducted in 1959, it was determined that the language was confined to the older generation of Veddas from Dambana. In the 1990s, self-identifying Veddas knew few words and phrases in the Vedda language, but there were individuals who knew the language comprehensively. Initially, there was considerable debate among linguists as to whether Vedda is a dialect of Sinhala or an independent language. Later studies indicate that it diverged from its parent stock in the 10th century and became a Creole and a stable independent language by the 13th century, under the influence of Sinhala.

The parent Vedda language(s) is of unknown genetic origins, while Sinhala is of the Indo-Aryan branch of Indo-European languages. Phonologically it is distinguished from Sinhala by the higher frequency of palatal sounds C and J. The effect is also heightened by the addition of inanimate suffixes. Vedda language word class is morphologically divided into nouns, verbs and variables with unique gender distinctions in animate nouns. Per its Creole tradition, it has reduced and simplified many forms of Sinhala such as second person pronouns and denotations of negative meanings. Instead of borrowing new words from Sinhala, Vedda created combinations of words from a limited lexical stock. Vedda also maintains many archaic Sinhala terms prior to the 10th to 12th centuries, as a relict of its close contact with Sinhala. Vedda also retains a number of unique words that cannot be derived from Sinhala. Likewise, Sinhala has also borrowed from the original Vedda language, words, and grammatical structures, differentiating it from its related Indo-Aryan languages. Vedda has exerted a substratum influence in the formation of Sinhala.

Veddas that have adopted Sinhala are found primarily in the southeastern part of the country, especially in the vicinity of Bintenne in Uva Province. There are also Veddas that have adopted Sinhala who live in Anuradhapura District in the North Central Province.

Another group, often termed East Coast Veddas, is found in coastal areas of the Eastern Province, between Batticaloa and Trincomalee. These Veddas have adopted Tamil as their mother tongue.

==Cultural aspects==

===Language===

The parent of Vedda language is of unknown linguistic origin and is considered a language isolate. Early linguists and observers of the language considered it to be either a separate language or a dialect of Sinhala. The chief proponent of the dialect theory was Wilhelm Geiger, but he also contradicted himself by claiming that Vedda was a relexified aboriginal language.

Veddas consider the Vedda language to be distinct from Sinhala and use it as an ethnic marker to differentiate them from Sinhalese people.

===Religion===
The original religion of Veddas is animism. The Sinhalized interior Veddahs follow a mix of animism and nominal Buddhism; whereas the Tamilized east coast Veddahs follow a mix of animism and nominal Hinduism with folk influences among anthropologists.

One of the most distinctive features of Vedda religion is the worship of dead ancestors, who are called &quot;nae yaku&quot; among the Sinhala-speaking Veddas and are invoked for the game and yams. There are also peculiar deities unique to Veddas, such as &quot;Kande Yakka&quot;.

Veddas, along with the Island&#x27;s Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim communities, venerate the temple complex situated at Kataragama, showing the syncretism that has evolved over 2,000 years of coexistence and assimilation. Kataragama is supposed to be the site where the Hindu god Skanda or Murugan in Tamil met and married a local tribal girl, Valli, who in Sri Lanka is believed to have been a Vedda.

There are a number of less famous shrines across the island which are sacred to the Veddas as well as to other communities.

===Rituals===

Vedda marriage is a simple ceremony. It consists of the bride tying a bark rope (&quot;Diya lanuva&quot;) that she has twisted, around the waist of the groom. This symbolizes the bride&#x27;s acceptance of the man as her mate and life partner. Although endogamous marriage between cross-cousins was the norm until recently, this has changed significantly, with Vedda women even contracting marriages with their Sinhalese and Moor neighbors.

In Vedda society, women are in many respects men&#x27;s equals. They are entitled to similar inheritance. Monogamy is the general rule, though a widow would frequently marry her husband&#x27;s brother as a means of support and consolation (levirate marriage). They also do not practice a caste system.

Death, too, is a simple affair without ostentatious funeral ceremonies where the corpse of the deceased is promptly buried.

===Burial===
Since the opening of colonization schemes, Vedda burials changed when they dug graves of deep and wrapped the body wrapped cloth and covered it with leaves and earth. The Veddas also laid the body between the scooped out trunks of the &quot;gadumba&quot; tree (&quot;Trema orientalis&quot;) before they buried it. At the head of the grave were kept three open coconuts and a small bundle of wood, while at its foot were kept an opened coconut and an untouched coconut. Certain cactus species (&quot;pathok&quot;, &quot;Opuntia dillenii&quot; or &quot;O. stricta&quot;) were planted at the head, the middle and the foot. Personal possessions like the bow and arrow, betel pouch, were also buried. This practice varied by community. The contents of the betel pouch of the deceased were eaten after his death.

===Cult of the dead===
The Veddas practice what is referred to by Western ethnologists as &quot;a cult of the dead&quot;. The Vedda perception of the world when originally studied in the mid 19th and early 20th centuries was not divided into polarities as life and afterlife or living and dead. At that time when asked whether the dead lived on as spirits they found that &quot;they did not consider whether the departed were living or dead, they were just spirits...all spirits were alike neither good nor bad&quot;.

In the words of John Bailey studying this population in 1853: &quot;the Veddahs have a vague belief in a host of undefined spirits, whose influence is rather for good than evil...they believe the air is peopled by spirits, that every rock and every tree, every forest and every hill, in short every feature of nature, has its genus loci;but these seem little else than nameless phantoms whom they regard with mysterious awe than actual dread&quot;.

In addition to this experience of the world often referred to as &quot;animism&quot; they have a belief that after death every relative is a spirit &quot;of those who watches over the welfare of those left behind. These, which include their ancestors and their children, the term their &#x27;nehya yakoon&#x27;, kindred spirits. They describe them as ever watchful, coming to them in sickness, visiting them in dreams, giving them flesh when hunting&quot;.

The Vedda behavior at the time of these original ethnological studies regarding the recently dead is quite different from our behavior toward the dead.
&quot;When a person dies it is the hetha that killed him; and the hetha of the dead one remains by the corpse and haunts the vicinity for years.&quot;

The majority of the Vedda tribes studied at that time held what is referred to as a &quot;kirikohraha ceremony&quot;. This was often held &quot;to present an offering to the newly dead within a week or two of their decease...The yaku of the recently dead...are supposed to stand towards the surviving members of the group in the light of friends and relatives, who if well treated will continue to show loving kindness to their survivors, and only if neglected will show disgust and anger by withdrawing their assistance, or becoming actively hostile.&quot;

===Clothing===

Until fairly recent times, the clothing of the Veddas was limited. In the case of men, it consisted only of a loincloth suspended with a string at the waist, while in the case of women, it was a piece of cloth that extended from the navel to the knees. Today, however, Vedda attire is more covering, men wear a short sarong extending from the waist to the knees, while the women clad themselves in a garment similar to the Sinhala &quot;diya-redda&quot; which extends from the breast line to the knees.

===Music===

Meaning of this song: The bees from yonder hills of Palle Talawa and Kade suck nectar from the flowers and made the honeycomb. So why should you give them undue pain when there is no honey by cutting the honeycomb.

==Livelihood==

Veddas were originally hunter-gatherers. They used bows and arrows to hunt game, harpoons and toxic plants for fishing and gathered wild plants, yams, honey, fruit and nuts. Many Veddas also farm, frequently using slash and burn or swidden cultivation, which is called &quot;Hena&quot; in Sri Lanka. East Coast Veddas also practice sea fishing. Veddas are famously known for their rich meat diet. Venison and the flesh of rabbit, turtle, tortoise, monitor lizard, wild boar and the common brown monkey are consumed with much relish. The Veddas kill only for food and do not harm young or pregnant animals. Game is commonly shared amongst the family and clan. Fish are caught by employing fish poisons such as the juice of the &quot;pus-vel&quot; (Entada scandens) and &quot;daluk-kiri&quot; (Cactus milk).

Vedda culinary fare is also deserving of mention. Amongst the best known are &quot;gona perume&quot;, which is a sort of sausage containing alternate layers of meat and fat, and &quot;goya-tel-perume&quot;, which is the tail of the monitor lizard (talagoya), stuffed with fat obtained from its sides and roasted in embers. Another Vedda delicacy is dried meat preserve soaked in honey. The Veddas used to preserve such meat in the hollow of a tree, enclosing it with clay.
Such succulent meat served as a ready food supply in times of scarcity. The early part of the year (January–February) is considered to be the season of yams and mid-year (June–July) that of fruit and honey, while hunting is availed of throughout the year. &quot;Kurakkan&quot; (&quot;Eleusine coracana&quot;) is cultivated very often. Maize, yams, gourds and melons are also cultivated. The Veddas used to live in caves and rock shelters. Today, they live in huts of wattle, daub and thatch.

In the reign of Datusena (6th century CE) the Mahaweli ganga was diverted at Minipe in the Minipe canal nearly long said to be constructed with help from the Yakkas. The Mahawamsa refers to the canal as Yaka-bendi-ela. When the Ruwanweli Seya was built in King Dutugemunu&#x27;s time (2nd century BCE) the Veddas procured the necessary minerals from the jungles.

Parakrama Bahu the Great (12th century), in his war against the rebels, employed Veddas as scouts.

Rajasinghe II (17th century), in his battle with the Dutch, had a Vedda regiment. In the abortive Uva-Welessa revolt of 1817–1818 of the British times, led by Keppetipola Disawe, the Veddas too fought with the rebels against the British forces.

==Current status==
Some observers have said Veddas are disappearing and have lamented the decline of their distinct culture. Land acquisition for mass irrigation projects, government forest reserve restrictions, and the civil war have disrupted traditional Vedda ways of life. Between 1977 and 1983 under the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project and colonization schemes, approximately 51468 hectares were turned into a gigantic hydroelectric dam irrigation project. Subsequently, the creation of the Maduru Oya National Park deprived the Veddhas their last hunting grounds. In 1985, the Veddha Chief Thissahamy and his delegation were obstructed from attending the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations. Dr. Wiveca Stegeborn, an anthropologist, has been studying the Vedda since 1977 and alleges that their young women are being tricked into accepting contracts to the Middle East as domestic workers when in fact they will be trafficked into prostitution or sold as sex slaves.

However, cultural assimilation of Veddas with other local populations has been going on for a long time. &quot;Vedda&quot; has been used in Sri Lanka to mean not only hunter-gatherers but also to refer to any people who adopt an unsettled and rural way of life and thus can be a derogatory term not based on ethnic group. Thus, over time, it is possible for non-Vedda groups to become Veddas, in this broad cultural sense. Vedda populations of this kind are increasing in some districts.

==In zoology==
A spider genus endemic to Sri Lanka was named &quot;Wanniyala&quot; as a dedication to Sri Lanka&#x27;s oldest civilized people.

A species of Sri Lankan snake, &quot;Indotyphlops veddae&quot;, was named in honor of the Vedda.

<text>Warts are non-cancerous viral growths usually occurring on the hands and feet but which can also affect other locations, such as the genitals or face. One or many warts may appear. They are distinguished from cancerous tumors as they are caused by a viral infection, such as a human papillomavirus, rather than a cancer growth.
Factors that increase the risk include the use of public showers and pools, working with meat, eczema, and a weak immune system. The virus is believed to infect the host through the entrance of a skin wound. A number of types exist, including plantar warts, &quot;filiform warts&quot;, and genital warts. Genital warts are often sexually transmitted.
Without treatment, most types of warts resolve in months to years. A number of treatments may speed resolution, including salicylic acid applied to the skin and cryotherapy. In those who are otherwise healthy, they do not typically result in significant problems. Treatment of genital warts differs from that of other types. Infection of a virus, such as HIV, can cause warts. This is prevented through careful handling of needles or sharp objects that could infect the individual through physical trauma of the skin, plus the practice of safe sex using barrier methods such as condoms. Viruses that are not sexually transmitted, or are not transmitted in the case of a wart, can be prevented through a number of behaviors, such as wearing shoes outdoors and avoiding unsanitized areas without proper shoes or clothing, such as public restrooms or locker rooms.
Warts are very common, with most people being infected at some point in their lives. The estimated current rate of non-genital warts among the general population is 1–13%. They are more common among young people. Prior to widespread adoption of the HPV vaccine, the estimated rate of genital warts in sexually active women was 12%. Warts have been described as far back as 400 BC by Hippocrates.

==Types==

A range of types of wart have been identified, varying in shape and site affected, as well as the type of human papillomavirus involved. These include:
* Common wart (&quot;verruca vulgaris&quot;), a raised wart with a roughened surface, most common on hands, but can grow anywhere on the body. Sometimes known as a Palmer wart or Junior wart.
* Flat wart (&quot;verruca plana&quot;), a small, smooth flattened wart, flesh-coloured, which can occur in large numbers; most common on the face, neck, hands, wrists, and knees.
* Filiform or digitate wart, a thread- or finger-like wart, most common on the face, especially near the eyelids and lips.
* Genital wart (venereal wart, &quot;condyloma acuminatum&quot;, &quot;verruca acuminata&quot;), a wart that occurs on the genitalia.
* Periungual wart, a cauliflower-like cluster of warts that occurs around the nails.
* Plantar wart (&quot;verruca&quot;, &quot;verruca plantaris&quot;), a hard, sometimes painful lump, often with multiple black specks in the center; usually only found on pressure points on the soles of the feet.
* Mosaic wart, a group of tightly clustered plantar-type warts, commonly on the hands or soles of the feet.

== Cause ==

Warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are about 130 known types of human papillomaviruses. HPV infects the squamous epithelium, usually of the skin or genitals, but each HPV type is typically only able to infect a few specific areas of the body. Many HPV types can produce a benign growth, often called a &quot;wart&quot; or &quot;papilloma&quot;, in the area they infect. Many of the more common HPV and wart types are listed below.
* Common warts – HPV types 2 and 4 (most common); also types 1, 3, 26, 29, and 57 and others.
* Cancers and genital dysplasia – &quot;high-risk&quot; HPV types are associated with cancers, notably cervical cancer, and can also cause some vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal and some oropharyngeal cancers. &quot;Low-risk&quot; types are associated with warts or other conditions.
** High-risk: 16, 18 (cause the most cervical cancer); also 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 52, 58, 59, and others.
* Plantar warts (verruca) – HPV type 1 (most common); also types 2, 3, 4, 27, 28, and 58 and others.
* Anogenital warts (condylomata acuminata or venereal warts) – HPV types 6 and 11 (most common); also types 42, 44 and others.
** Low-risk: 6, 11 (most common); also 13, 44, 40, 43, 42, 54, 61, 72, 81, 89, and others.
* &quot;Verruca plana&quot; (flat warts) – HPV types 3, 10, and 28.
* Butcher&#x27;s warts – HPV type 7.
* Heck&#x27;s disease (focal epithelial hyperplasia) – HPV types 13 and 32.

== Pathophysiology ==
Common warts have a characteristic appearance under the microscope. They have thickening of the stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis), thickening of the stratum spinosum (acanthosis), thickening of the stratum granulosum, rete ridge elongation, and large blood vessels at the dermoepidermal junction.

==Diagnosis==
On dermatoscopic examination, warts will commonly have fingerlike or knoblike extensions.

== Prevention ==

Gardasil 6 is an HPV vaccine aimed at preventing cervical cancers and genital warts. Gardasil is designed to prevent infection with HPV types 16, 18, 6, and 11. HPV types 16 and 18 currently cause about 70% of cervical cancer cases, and also cause some vulvar, vaginal, penile and anal cancers. HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for 90% of documented cases of genital warts.

Gardasil 9 protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.

HPV vaccines do not currently protect against the virus strains responsible for plantar warts (verrucae).

=== Disinfection ===
The virus is relatively hardy and immune to many common disinfectants. Exposure to 90% ethanol for at least 1 minute, 2% glutaraldehyde, 30% Savlon, and/or 1% sodium hypochlorite can disinfect the pathogen.

The virus is resistant to drying and heat, but killed by temperature and ultraviolet radiation.

==Treatment==

There are many treatments and procedures associated with wart removal. A review of various skin wart treatments concluded that topical treatments containing salicylic acid were more effective than placebo. Cryotherapy appears to be as effective as salicylic acid, but there have been fewer trials.

===Medication===
* Salicylic acid can be prescribed by a dermatologist in a higher concentration than that found in over-the-counter products. Several over-the-counter products are readily available at pharmacies and supermarkets of roughly two types: adhesive pads treated with salicylic acid, and bottled concentrated salicylic acid and lactic acid solution.
* Fluorouracil — Fluorouracil cream, a chemotherapy agent sometimes used to treat skin cancer, can be used on particularly resistant warts, by blocking viral DNA and RNA production and repair.
* Imiquimod is a topical cream that helps the body&#x27;s immune system fight the wart virus by encouraging interferon production. It has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for genital warts.
* Cantharidin, found naturally in the bodies of many members of the beetle family Meloidae, causes dermal blistering. It is used either by itself or compounded with podophyllin. Not FDA approved, but available through Canada or select US compounding pharmacies.
* Bleomycin — A more potent chemotherapy drug, can be injected into deep warts, destroying the viral DNA or RNA. Bleomycin is notably not US FDA approved for this purpose. Possible side effects include necrosis of the digits, nail loss and Raynaud syndrome. The usual treatment is one or two injections.
* Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), like salicylic acid, is applied directly to the wart. Studies show this method is effective with a cure rate of 80%. But DNCB must be used much more cautiously than salicylic acid; the chemical is known to cause genetic mutations, so it must be administered by a physician. This drug induces an allergic immune response, resulting in inflammation that wards off the wart-causing virus.
* Cidofovir is an antiviral drug which is injected into HPV lesions within the larynx (laryngeal papillomatosis) as an experimental treatment.
* Verrutop verruca treatment is a topical solution made from a combination of organic acids, inorganic acids, and metal ions. This solution causes the production of nitrites, which act to denature viral proteins and mummify the wart tissue. The difference between Verrutop and other acid treatments is that it does not damage the surrounding skin.
* Another product available over-the-counter that can aid in wart removal is silver nitrate in the form of a caustic pencil, which is also available at drug stores. In a placebo-controlled study of 70 patients, silver nitrate given over nine days resulted in clearance of all warts in 43% and improvement in warts in 26% one month after treatment compared to 11% and 14%, respectively, in the placebo group. The instructions must be followed to minimize staining of skin and clothing. Occasionally, pigmented scars may develop.
* Trichloroacetic acid can be used to treat warts if salicylic acid or cryotherapy fail or are not available. It requires repeat treatments every week or so. Side effects are burning and stinging.
===Procedures===

* Keratolysis, of dead surface skin cells usually using salicylic acid, blistering agents, immune system modifiers (&quot;immunomodulators&quot;), or formaldehyde, often with mechanical paring of the wart with a pumice stone, blade etc.
* Electrodesiccation
* Microwave Treatment
* Cryosurgery or cryotherapy, which involves freezing the wart (generally with liquid nitrogen), creating a blister between the wart and epidermal layer after which the wart and the surrounding dead skin fall off. An average of three to four treatments are required for warts on thin skin. Warts on calloused skin like plantar warts might take dozens or more treatments.
* Surgical curettage of the wart
* Laser treatment – often with a pulse dye laser or carbon dioxide (CO2) laser. Pulse dye lasers (wavelength 582 nm) work by selective absorption by blood cells (specifically hemoglobin). CO2 lasers work by selective absorption by water molecules. Pulse dye lasers are less destructive and more likely to heal without scarring. CO2 laser works by vaporizing and destroying tissue and skin. Laser treatments can be painful, expensive (though covered by many insurance plans), and not extensively scarring when used appropriately. CO2 lasers will require local anaesthetic. Pulse dye laser treatment does not need conscious sedation or local anesthetic. It takes 2 to 4 treatments but can be many more for extreme cases. Typically, 10–14 days are required between treatments. Preventive measures are important.
* Infrared coagulator – an intense source of infrared light in a small beam like a laser. This works essentially on the same principle as laser treatment. It is less expensive. Like the laser, it can cause blistering, pain and scarring.
* Intralesional immunotherapy with purified candida, MMR, and tuberculin (PPD) protein appears safe and effective.
* Duct tape occlusion therapy involves placing a piece of duct tape over the wart. The mechanism of action of this technique still remains unknown. Despite several trials, evidence for the efficacy of duct tape therapy is inconclusive. Despite the mixed evidence for efficacy, the simplicity of the method and its limited side-effects leads some researchers to be reluctant to dismiss it.
* No intervention. Spontaneous resolution within a few years can be recommended.

===Alternative medicine===

Daily application of the latex of Chelidonium majus is a traditional treatment.

The acrid yellow sap of Greater Celandine is used as a traditional wart remedy.

According to English folk belief, touching toads causes warts; according to a German belief, touching a toad under a full moon cures warts. The most common Northern Hemisphere toads have glands that protrude from their skin that superficially resemble warts. Warts are caused by a virus, and toads do not harbor it. A variety of traditional folk remedies and rituals claim to be able to remove warts.

In &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;, Mark Twain has his characters discuss a variety of such remedies. Tom Sawyer proposes &quot;spunk-water&quot; (or &quot;stump-water&quot;, the water collecting in the hollow of a tree stump) as a remedy for warts on the hand. You put your hand into the water at midnight and say:

You then &quot;walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm&#x27;s busted.&quot; This is given as an example of Huckleberry Finn&#x27;s planned remedy, which involves throwing a dead cat into a graveyard as a devil or devils comes to collect a recently buried wicked person. Another remedy involved splitting a bean, drawing blood from the wart and putting it on one of the halves, and burying that half at a crossroads at midnight. The theory of operation is that the blood on the buried bean will draw away the wart. Twain is recognized as an early collector and recorder of genuine American folklore.

Similar practices are recorded elsewhere. In Louisiana, one remedy for warts involves rubbing the wart with a potato, which is then buried; when the &quot;buried potato dries up, the wart will be cured&quot;. Another remedy similar to Twain&#x27;s is reported from Northern Ireland, where water from a specific well on Rathlin Island is credited with the power to cure warts.

==History==

Surviving ancient medical texts show that warts were a documented disease since at least the time of Hippocrates, who lived – . In the book &quot;De Medecia&quot; by the Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus, who lived – , different types of warts were described. Celsus described &quot;Myrmecia&quot;, today recognized as plantar wart, and categorized acrochordon (a skin tag) as a wart. In the 13th century, warts were described in books published by the surgeons William of Saliceto and Lanfranc of Milan. The word &quot;verruca&quot; to describe a wart was introduced by the physician Daniel Sennert, who described warts in his 1636 book &quot;Hypomnemata physicae&quot;.

The cause of warts was initially disputed in the medical profession. In the early 18th century the physician Daniel Turner, who published the first book on dermatology, suggested that warts were caused by damaged nerves close to the skin. In the mid-18th century, the surgeon John Hunter popularized the belief that warts were caused by a bacterial syphilis
infection. The surgeon Benjamin Bell documented that warts were caused by a disease entirely unrelated to syphilis, and established a causal link between warts and cancer. In the 19th century, the chief physician of Verona Hospital established a link between warts and cervical cancer. But in 1874 it was noted by the dermatologist Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra that while various theories were advanced by the medical profession, the &quot;influences causing warts are still very obscure&quot;.

In 1907 the physician Giuseppe Ciuffo was the first to demonstrate that warts were caused by a virus infection. In 1976 the virologist Harald zur Hausen was the first to discover that warts were caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). His continuous research established the evidence necessary to develop a HPV vaccine, which first became available in 2006.

<doc id="34050" wikidata="Q837643" url="?curid=34050" title="Warrant officer">
<text>Warrant officer (WO) is a rank or category of ranks in the armed forces of many countries. Depending on the country, service, or historical context, warrant officers are sometimes classified as the most junior of the commissioned officer ranks, the most senior of the non-commissioned officer (NCO) ranks, or in a separate category of their own. Warrant officer ranks are especially prominent in the militaries of Commonwealth nations and the United States.

The name of the rank originated in medieval England. It was first used during the 13th century, in the Royal Navy, where warrant officers achieved the designation by virtue of their accrued experience or seniority, and technically held the rank by a warrant, rather than by a formal commission (as in the case of a commissioned officer). Nevertheless, WOs in the British services have traditionally been considered and treated as distinct from non-commissioned officers.

Warrant officers in the United States are classified in rank category &quot;W&quot;, which is distinct from &quot;O&quot; (commissioned officers) and &quot;E&quot; (enlisted personnel, including non-commissioned officers). However, chief warrant officers are officially commissioned, on the same basis as commissioned officers, and take the same oath. US WOs are usually experts in a particular technical field, with long service as enlisted personnel; in some cases, however, direct entrants may become WOs—for example, individuals completing helicopter pilot training in the US Army Aviation Branch become flight warrant officers immediately.

In Commonwealth countries, warrant officers have usually been included alongside NCOs and enlisted personnel in a category called other ranks (ORs), which is equivalent to the US &quot;E&quot; category (i.e. there is no separate &quot;W&quot; category in these particular services). In Commonwealth services, warrant officers rank between chief petty officer and sub-lieutenant in the navy, between staff sergeant and second lieutenant in the army, and between flight sergeant and pilot officer in the air force.

==Origins==
The warrant officer corps began in the nascent Royal Navy, which dates its founding to 1546. At that time, noblemen with military experience took command of the new navy, adopting the military ranks of lieutenant and captain. These officers often had no knowledge of life on board a ship—let alone how to navigate such a vessel—and relied on the expertise of the ship&#x27;s master and other seamen who tended to the technical aspects of running the ship. As cannon came into use, the officers also required gunnery experts; specialist gunners began to appear in the 16th century and also had warrant officer status. Literacy was one thing that most warrant officers had in common, and this distinguished them from the common seamen: according to the Admiralty regulations, &quot;no person shall be appointed to any station in which he is to have charge of stores, unless he can read and write, and is sufficiently skilled in arithmetic to keep an account of them correctly&quot;. Since all warrant officers had responsibility for stores, this was enough to debar the illiterate.

===Rank and status in the 18th century===
In origin, warrant officers were specialist professionals whose expertise and authority demanded formal recognition. In the 18th century they fell into two clear categories: on the one hand, those privileged to share with the commissioned officers in the wardroom and on the quarterdeck; and on the other, those who ranked with more junior members of the ship&#x27;s crew. Somewhere between the two, however, were the standing officers, notable because, unlike the rest of the ship&#x27;s company, they remained with the ship even when she was out of commission (e.g. for repair, refitting or replenishment, or whilst laid up); in these circumstances they were under the pay and supervision of the Royal Dockyard.

====Wardroom warrant officers====
These classes of warrant officer messed in the wardroom with the commissioned officers:
*the master: the senior warrant officer, a qualified navigator and experienced seaman who set the sails, maintained the ship&#x27;s log and advised the captain on the seaworthiness of the ship and crew;
*the surgeon: who treated the sick and injured and advised the captain on matters of health;
*the purser: responsible for supplies, food and pay for the crew.
In the early 19th century, they were joined in the wardroom by naval chaplains, who also had warrant officer status (though they were only usually present on larger vessels).

====Standing warrant officers====
The standing officers were:
*the boatswain: responsible for maintenance of the ship&#x27;s boats, sails, rigging, anchors and cables;
*the carpenter: responsible for maintenance of the ship&#x27;s hull and masts;
*the gunner: responsible for care and maintenance of the ship&#x27;s guns and gunpowder.

====Junior warrant officers====
Other warrant officers included surgeon&#x27;s mates, boatswain&#x27;s mates and carpenter&#x27;s mates, sailmakers, armourers, schoolmasters (involved in the education of boys, midshipmen and others aboard ship) and clerks. Masters-at-arms, who had formerly overseen small-arms provision on board, had by this time taken on responsibility for discipline.

====Warrant officers in context====
By the end of the century, the rank structure could be illustrated as follows (the warrant officers are underlined):

===Demise of the royal naval warrants===
In 1843, the wardroom warrant officers were given commissioned status, while in 1853 the lower-grade warrant officers were absorbed into the new rate of chief petty officer, both classes thereby ceasing to be warrant officers. On 9 July 1864 the standing warrant officers were divided into two grades: warrant officers and chief warrant officers (or &quot;commissioned warrant officers&quot;, a phrase that was replaced in 1920 with &quot;commissioned officers promoted from warrant rank&quot;, although they were still usually referred to as &quot;commissioned warrant officers&quot;, even in official documents).

By the time of the First World War, their ranks had been expanded with the adoption of modern technology in the Royal Navy to include telegraphists, electricians, shipwrights, artificer engineers, etc. Both warrant officers and commissioned warrant officers messed in the warrant officers&#x27; mess rather than the wardroom (although in ships too small to have a warrant officers&#x27; mess, they did mess in the wardroom). Warrant officers and commissioned warrant officers also carried swords, were saluted by ratings, and ranked between sub-lieutenants and midshipmen.

In 1949, the ranks of warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer were changed to &quot;commissioned officer&quot; and &quot;senior commissioned officer&quot;, the latter ranking with but after the rank of lieutenant, and they were admitted to the wardroom, the warrant officers&#x27; messes closing down. Collectively, these officers were known as &quot;branch officers&quot;, being retitled &quot;special duties&quot; officers in 1956. In 1998, the special duties list was merged with the general list of officers in the Royal Navy, all officers now having the same opportunity to reach the highest commissioned ranks.

==Modern usage==

===Australia===
The Royal Australian Navy rank of warrant officer (WO) is the Navy&#x27;s only rank appointed by warrant and is equivalent to the Army&#x27;s WO1, and the RAAF&#x27;s warrant officer. The most senior non-commissioned member of the Navy is the Warrant Officer of the Navy (WO-N), an appointment that is only held by one person at a time.

The Australian Army has two warrant officer ranks: warrant officer class two (WO2) and warrant officer class one (WO1), the latter being senior in rank. The equivalent rank of WO2 in the Navy is now chief petty officer, and the RAAF equivalent of the Army&#x27;s WO2 is now flight sergeant, although in the past there were no equivalents. All warrant officers are addressed as &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; by subordinates. To gain the attention of a particular warrant officer in a group, they can be addressed as &quot;Warrant Officer Bloggs, sir/ma&#x27;am&quot; or by their appointment, e.g. &quot;ASM Bloggs, sir/ma&#x27;am&quot;. Some warrant officers hold an appointment such as company sergeant major (WO2) or regimental sergeant major (WO1). The warrant officer appointed to the position of Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A) is the most senior enlisted soldier in the Australian Army and differs from other Army warrant officers in that their rank is just warrant officer (WO). The appointment of RSM-A was introduced in 1983. The rank insignia are: a crown for a WO2 (or a crown in a square on AMCU (camouflage uniform) rank slides); the Australian Commonwealth Coat of Arms (changed from the Royal Coat of Arms in 1976) for a WO1; and the Australian Commonwealth Coat of Arms surrounded by a laurel wreath for the RSM-A.

The Royal Australian Air Force rank of warrant officer (WOFF) is the RAAF&#x27;s only rank appointed by warrant and is equivalent to both the Army&#x27;s WO1 and the Navy&#x27;s WO. The most senior non-commissioned member of the RAAF is the Warrant Officer of the Air Force (WOFF-AF), an appointment that is only held by one person at a time.
=== Bangladesh ===
Warrant officer is the lowest junior commissioned officer rank in the Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh Air Force, ranking below senior warrant officer and master warrant officer.

=== Canada ===
In the Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force, the cadre of warrant officers includes the specific ranks of warrant officer (), master warrant officer (), and chief warrant officer (). Before unification in 1968, there were two ranks of warrant officer (WO2 and WO1) in the Canadian Army and RCAF that followed the British structure. 
===India===
Junior commissioned officers are the Indian Armed Forces equivalent of warrant officer ranks. Those in the Indian Air Force actually use the ranks of junior warrant officer, warrant officer and master warrant officer.

In the British Indian Army, warrant officer ranks existed but were restricted to British personnel, mostly in specialist appointments such as conductor and sub-conductor. Unlike in the British Army, although these appointments were warranted, the appointment and rank continued to be the same and the actual rank of warrant officer was never created. Indian equivalents were viceroy&#x27;s commissioned officers.

===Ireland===
====Irish Naval Service====
===Malaysia===

In the Malaysian Armed Forces, warrant officers () are the highest ranks for non commissioned officers.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Army usage is the same as the British Army, having two ranks: warrant officer class two (WO2), addressed as &quot;sergeant major&quot;, and warrant officer class one (WO1), addressed as &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot;. There are also appointments such as company and squadron sergeant major (CSM and SSM) which are usually WO2 positions and regimental sergeant major (RSM), which are usually WO1 positions. The highest ranking WO1 holds the position of Sergeant Major of the Army (SMA).

The Royal New Zealand Navy has a single warrant officer rank, addressed as &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot;. This rank is equivalent to the Army WO1. The RNZN&#x27;s highest-ranking warrant officer is the Warrant Officer of the Navy.

The Royal New Zealand Air Force also has a single warrant officer rank, equivalent to the Navy warrant officer, and the Army warrant officer class 1 (WO1). A warrant officer in the RNZAF is addressed as &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot;. Previously an aircrew warrant officer was known as master aircrew; however this rank and designation is no longer used. The RNZAF also has a post of Warrant Officer of the Air Force (WOAF), the most senior warrant officer position in the RNZAF.

There is also the Warrant Officer of the Defence Force (WODF). This appointment is held by a warrant officer class one (if the recipient originated from the New Zealand Army), or warrant officer (if the recipient originated from the Royal New Zealand Navy or the Royal New Zealand Air Force).

===Singapore===
==== Boys&#x27; Brigade ====

The rank of warrant officer is the highest rank a Boys&#x27; Brigade boy can attain in secondary school.

==== National Civil Defence Cadet Corps ====
The rank of warrant officer is given to selected non-commissioned officers in National Civil Defence Cadet Corps units. It is above the rank of staff sergeant, and below the rank of cadet lieutenant. It is the highest rank a cadet can attain in the NCDCC while they are in secondary school. The rank insignia is one point-up chevron, a Singapore coat of arms, and a garland below.

==== Singapore Armed Forces ====
In the Singapore Armed Forces, warrant officers begin as third warrant officers (3WO), previously starting at the rank of second warrant officer, abbreviated differently as WO2 instead. This rank is given to former specialists who have attained the rank of master sergeant and have either gone through, or are about to go through the Warfighter Course at the Specialist and Warrant Officer Advanced School (SWAS) in the Specialist and Warrant Officer Institute (SWI). In order to be promoted to a second warrant officer (2WO) and above, they must have been selected for and graduated from the joint warrant officer course at the SAFWOS Leadership School. Warrant officers rank between specialists and commissioned officers. They ordinarily serve as battalion or brigade regimental sergeant majors. Many of them serve as instructors and subject-matter experts in various training establishments. Warrant officers are also seen on the various staffs headed by the respective specialist officers. There are six grades of warrant officer (3WO, 2WO, 1WO, MWO, SWO and CWO).

Warrant officers used to have their own mess. For smaller camps, this mess is combined with the officers&#x27; mess. Warrant officers have similar responsibilities to commissioned officers.

Warrant officers are usually addressed as (&#x27;mister&#x27; in Malay language) or as &quot;warrant (surname)&quot; or &quot; (surname)&quot;. Exceptions to this are those who hold appointments. Warrant officers holding the appointment such as commanding officer (CO) and officer commanding (OC) are to be addressed as &quot;sir&quot; by other ranks, and those holding sergeant major appointments such as regimental sergeant major (RSM), company sergeant major (CSM), formation sergeant major (FSM), institute sergeant major (ISM) and the Sergeant Major of the Army (SMA) are to be addressed as &quot;sergeant major&quot; by other ranks. Also, all warrant officers holding the rank of chief warrant officer (CWO) are to be addressed as &quot;sir&quot; by other ranks. Since all warrant officers are non-commissioned officers, they are not saluted.

Although ceremonial swords are usually reserved for commissioned officers, warrant officers of the rank of master warrant officer (MWO) and above are presented with ceremonial swords, but continue to carry the pace stick, with the sword sheathed during drills and parades.

==== Singapore Civil Defence Force ====
In the Singapore Civil Defence Force, there are two warrant officer ranks. These ranks are (in order of ascending seniority) warrant officer (1) and warrant officer (2). Previously, before the Home Team Unified Rank Scheme was introduced, there were two additional ranks of warrant officer, namely senior warrant officer (1) and senior warrant officer (2). Both ranks are now obsolete, although existing holders of these ranks were allowed to keep their rank.

===South Africa===
====South African National Defence Force====
In the South African National Defence Force, a warrant officer (WO) is set apart from those who hold a non-commissioned officer (NCO) rank. Warrant officers hold a warrant of appointment endorsed by the Minister of Defence. Warrant officers hold very specific powers, which are set out in the Defence Act and the Military Defence Supplementary Measures Act. Before 2008, there were two classes – warrant officer class 1 and 2. A warrant officer class 1 could be appointed to positions such as regimental sergeant major, formation sergeant major or Sergeant Major of the Army or Warrant Officer of the Navy. In 2008, five new warrant officer ranks were introduced above warrant officer class 1: senior warrant officer (SWO), master warrant officer (MWO), chief warrant officer (CWO), senior chief warrant officer (SCWO) and master chief warrant officer (MCWO).

====South African Police Service====
In the South African Police Service, there is only a single warrant officer (WO) rank.

===United Kingdom===
====Royal Navy====

In 1973, warrant officers reappeared in the Royal Navy, but these appointments followed the army model, with the new warrant officers being ratings rather than officers. They were initially known as fleet chief petty officers (FCPOs), but were renamed warrant officers in the 1980s. They rank with warrant officers class one in the British Army and Royal Marines and with warrant officers in the Royal Air Force.

There are executive warrant officers for commands and ships. Five branches (surface ships, submarines, Royal Marines, Fleet Air Arm, and Maritime Reserves) each have a command warrant officer. The senior RN WO is the Warrant Officer of the Royal Navy. Under the Navy Command Transformation Programme, there are now a Fleet Commander&#x27;s Warrant Officer and a Second Sea Lord&#x27;s Warrant Officer, all working with the Warrant Officer to the Royal Navy, taking over the roles of the Command Warrant Officers.

In 2004, the rank of warrant officer class 2 was introduced. However, the rank was phased out in April 2014, but is being reinstated for non-technical and technical branches of the Royal Navy in 2021.

====British Army====

In the British Army, there are two warrant ranks, warrant officer class two (WO2) and warrant officer class one (WO1), the latter being the senior of the two. These ranks were previously abbreviated as WOII and WOI (using Roman instead of Indo-Arabic numerals). &quot;Warrant officer first class&quot; or &quot;second class&quot; is incorrect. The rank immediately below WO2 is staff sergeant (or colour sergeant). From 1938 to 1940 there was a WOIII platoon sergeant major rank.

In March 2015, the new appointment of Army Sergeant Major was created, though the holder is not in fact a warrant officer but a commissioned officer holding the rank of captain. The creation of the appointment of command sergeant major was announced in 2009.

====Royal Marines====
Before 1879, the Royal Marines had no warrant officers: by the end of 1881, the Royal Marines had given warrant rank to their sergeant-majors and some other senior non-commissioned officers, in a similar fashion to the army. When the army introduced the ranks of warrant officer class I and class II in 1915, the Royal Marines did the same shortly after. From February 1920, Royal Marines warrant officers class I (renamed warrant officers) were given the same status as Royal Navy warrant officers and the rank of warrant officer class II was abolished in the Royal Marines, with no further promotions to this rank.

The marines had introduced warrant officers equivalent in status to the Royal Navy&#x27;s from 1910 with the Royal Marines gunner (originally titled gunnery sergeant-major), equivalent to the navy&#x27;s warrant rank of gunner. Development of these ranks closely paralleled that of their naval counterparts: as in the Royal Navy, by the Second World War there were warrant officers and commissioned warrant officers (e.g. staff sergeant majors, commissioned staff sergeant majors, Royal Marines gunners, commissioned Royal Marines gunners, etc.). As officers, they were saluted by junior ranks in the Royal Marines and the army. These all became (commissioned) branch officer ranks in 1949, and special duties officer ranks in 1956. These ranks would return in 1972, this time similar to their army counterparts, and not as the RN did before. The most senior Royal Marines warrant officer is the Corps Regimental Sergeant Major. Unlike the RN proper (since 2014), it retains both WO ranks.

====Royal Air Force====
The Royal Air Force first used the ranks of sergeant major first and second class as inherited from the Royal Flying Corps, with the rank badges of the Royal coat of arms and the crown respectively. In the 1930s, these ranks were renamed warrant officer class I and II as in the Army. In 1939, the RAF abolished the rank of WOII and retained just the WOI rank, referred to as just warrant officer (WO), which it remains to this day. The RAF has no equivalent to WO2 (NATO OR-8), an RAF WO being equivalent to WO1 (NATO OR-9) and wearing the same badge of rank, the Royal coat of arms. The correct way to address a warrant officer is &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; by airmen and &quot;mister or warrant officer (surname)&quot; by officers. Most RAF warrant officers do not hold appointments as in the army or Royal Marines; the exception to this is the station warrant officer, who is considered a &quot;first amongst equals&quot; on an RAF station. Warrant officer is the highest non-commissioned rank and ranks above flight sergeant.

In 1946, the RAF renamed its aircrew warrant officers to master aircrew, a designation which still survives. In 1950, it renamed warrant officers in technical trades to master technicians, a designation which survived only until 1964.

The most senior RAF warrant officer by appointment, although holding the same rank as other RAF warrant officers (OR9), is the Warrant Officer of the Royal Air Force, previously known as the Chief of the Air Staff&#x27;s Warrant Officer from the post&#x27;s creation in 1996 until 2021.

===United States===
In the United States Armed Forces, a warrant officer (grade W-1 to W-5) is ranked as an officer above the senior-most enlisted ranks, as well as officer cadets and officer candidates, but below the officer grade of O‑1 (NATO: OF‑1). All warrant officers rate a salute from those ranked below them; i.e., the enlisted ranks. Warrant officers are highly skilled, single-track specialty officers, and while the ranks are authorized by Congress, each branch of the military selects, manages, and utilizes warrant officers in slightly different ways. For appointment to warrant officer (W-1), normally a warrant is approved by the service secretary of the respective branch of service. However, appointment to this rank can come via commission by the President, but this is less common. For the chief warrant officer ranks (CW‑2 to CW‑5), these warrant officers are commissioned by the President. Both warrant officers and chief warrant officers take the same oath of office as regular commissioned officers (O-1 to O-10).

A small number of warrant officers command detachments, units, activities, vessels, aircraft, and armored vehicles, as well as lead, coach, train, and counsel subordinates. However, the warrant officer&#x27;s primary task is to serve as a technical expert, providing valuable skills, guidance, and expertise to commanders and organizations in their particular field.

All U.S. armed services employ warrant officer grades except the U.S. Space Force. Although still technically authorized, the U.S. Air Force discontinued appointing new warrant officers in 1959, retiring its last chief warrant officer from the Air Force Reserve in 1992. Space Force inherited the same lack of warrant officers from the Air Force, although its inaugural Chief Master Sergeant, Roger A. Towberman, stated in a January 2021 interview that Space Force would study the issue and decide whether or not to introduce them. In February 2024, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David W. Allvin announced that the Air Force will re-introduce the warrant officer rank within the information technology and cyber fields as a way to maintain technical leadership with those skills. The first class of 78 future warrant officers were selected in August and began training at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, in October 2024.

The U.S. Army utilizes warrant officers heavily and separates them into two types: Aviators and technical. Army aviation warrant officers pilot both rotary-wing and fixed wing aircraft and represent the largest group of Army warrant officers. Technical warrant officers in the Army specialize in a single branch technical area such as intelligence, sustainment, supply, military police, or special forces; and provide advice and support to commanders. For example, a military police officer and a military intelligence officer both have to be branch qualified in their respective fields, learning how to manage the entire spectrum of their profession. However, within those broad fields warrant officers include such specialists as CID Special Agents (a very specific track within the military police) and Counterintelligence Special Agents (a very specific track within military intelligence). These technical warrant officers allow for a soldier with subject matter expertise (like non-commissioned officers), but with the authority of a commissioned officer. Both technical and aviation warrant officers go through initial training and branch assignment at the Army Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS), followed by branch-specific training and education paths. Technical warrant officers are generally selected from the non-commissioned officer ranks (typically E-6 through E-9). Aviation warrant officer candidates can apply from all branches of service, including junior enlisted and non-prior service civilians (aviation warrant officers join through the Warrant Officer Flight Training Program).

The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard discontinued the grade of W-1 in 1975, appointing and commissioning all new entrants as chief warrant officer two (pay grade W-2, with rank abbreviation of CWO2). This was to prevent a pay decrease that an entrant may take since all Navy chief warrant officers are selected strictly from the chief petty officer pay grades (E-7 through E-9). The Coast Guard allows E-6 personnel to apply for chief warrant officer rank, but only after they have displayed their technical ability by earning a placement in the top 50% on the annual eligibility list for advancement to E-7. In 2018, the U.S. Navy expanded the warrant program, re-implementing the W-1 pay grade for cyber warrant officers and accepting three new WO1s in fiscal year 2019. This was further expanded in 2020 when the Navy introduced the Air Vehicle Pilot (AVP) program. Personnel commissioning as AVPs will be awarded the rank of W-1.

Warrant officers in the Army holding the rank of warrant officer 1 (WO1) are formally addressed as &quot;Mr/Ms&quot; [last name]. Upon promotion to chief warrant officer 2, &quot;Chief&quot; becomes an additional authorized term of address. WO1s are informally addressed as &quot;Chief&quot; by many soldiers as well. In the Navy, warrant officers are typically addressed as &quot;Mr/Ms&quot; [last name], &quot;Chief Warrant Officer&quot;, or informally as &quot;Warrant&quot; regardless of their grade.

The U.S. Maritime Service (USMS), which is established at 46 U.S. Code § 51701, falls under the authority of the Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation and is authorized to appoint warrant officers. In accordance with 46 U.S. Code § 51701, the USMS rank structure must be the same as that of the U.S. Coast Guard while uniforms worn are those of the U.S. Navy with distinctive USMS insignia and devices. The USMS has appointed warrant officers, of various specialty fields, during and after World War II.

Warrant officer rank is also occasionally used in law enforcement agencies to grant status and pay to certain senior specialist officers who are not in command, such as senior technicians or helicopter pilots. As in the armed forces, they rank above sergeants, but below lieutenants. For example, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol had several warrant officer helicopter pilot positions from the 1960s until the mid-1980s. The WO insignia was a silver bar with a black square in the center. The WO ranks were abolished when the aviation program expanded and nearly twenty trooper pilot positions were created. The New York State Police rank of technical lieutenant is similar to a warrant officer rank insofar as it is used to grant commissioned officer authority to non-commissioned officers with extensive technical expertise.

<text>Walter Gilbert (born March 21, 1932) is an American biochemist, physicist, molecular biology pioneer, and Nobel laureate.

==Education and early life==
Walter Gilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 21, 1932, into a Jewish family, the son of Emma (Cohen), a child psychologist, and Richard V. Gilbert, an economist.

When Gilbert was seven years old, the family moved to the Washington D.C. area so his father could work under Harry Hopkins on the New Deal brain trust. While living in Washington the family became friends with the family of I.F. Stone and Wally met Stone&#x27;s oldest daughter, Celia, when they were both 8. They later married at age 21.

He was educated at the Sidwell Friends School, and attended Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a baccalaureate in chemistry and physics in 1953 and a master&#x27;s degree in physics in 1954. He studied for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a PhD in physics supervised by the Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in 1957.

==Career and research==
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1956 and was appointed assistant professor of physics in 1959. Gilbert&#x27;s wife Celia worked for James Watson, leading Gilbert to become interested in molecular biology. Watson and Gilbert ran their laboratory jointly through most of the 1960s, until Watson left for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. In 1964 he was promoted to associate professor of biophysics and promoted again in 1968 to professor of biochemistry.

Gilbert is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies Biogen, with Kenneth Murray, Phillip Sharp and Charles Weissman and Myriad Genetics with Dr. Mark Skolnick and Kevin Kimberlin where he was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors. Gilbert left his position at Harvard to run Biogen as CEO, but was later asked to resign by the company&#x27;s board of directors. He is a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. Gilbert has served as the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.

In 1996, Gilbert and Stuart B. Levy founded Paratek Pharmaceuticals. Gilbert served as chairman until 2014.

Gilbert was an early proponent of sequencing the human genome. At a March 1986 meeting in Santa Fe New Mexico he proclaimed &quot;The total human sequence is the grail of human genetics&quot;. In 1987, he proposed starting a company called Genome Corporation to sequence the genome and sell access to the information. In an opinion piece in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1991, he envisioned completion of the human genome sequence transforming biology into a field in which computer databases would be as essential as laboratory reagents

Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1985. Gilbert was an outspoken critic of David Baltimore in the handling of the scientific fraud accusations against Thereza Imanishi-Kari. Gilbert also joined the early controversy over the cause of AIDS.
In 1962, Gilbert&#x27;s physics PhD student Gerald Guralnik extended Gilbert&#x27;s work on massless particles; Guralnik&#x27;s work is widely recognized as an important thread in the discovery of the Higgs Boson.

With his PhD student Benno Müller-Hill, Gilbert was the first to purify the lac repressor, just beating out Mark Ptashne for purifying the first gene regulatory protein.

Together with Allan Maxam, Gilbert developed a new DNA sequencing method, Maxam–Gilbert sequencing, using chemical methods developed by Andrei Mirzabekov. His approach to the first synthesis of insulin via recombinant DNA lost out to Genentech&#x27;s approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources. Gilbert&#x27;s effort was hampered by a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA work in Cambridge, Massachusetts, forcing his group to move their work to an English biological weapons site.

Gilbert first proposed the terms introns (intragenic regions) and exons (expressed regions) in reference to recently discovered phenomenon of splicing and suggested explanation for the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 &quot;News and Views&quot; correspondence to &quot;Nature&quot; titled &quot;why genes in pieces?&quot;. In 1986, Gilbert proposed the RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life, based on a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967.

==Awards and honors==

In 1969, Gilbert was awarded Harvard&#x27;s Ledlie Prize. In 1972 he was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology. In 1979, Gilbert was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Frederick Sanger. That year he was also awarded the Gairdner Prize and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.

Gilbert was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid.

Gilbert has also been honored by the National Academy of Sciences (US Steel Foundation Award, 1968); Massachusetts General Hospital (Warren Triennial Prize, 1977); the New York Academy of Sciences; (Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation Award, 1977), the Académie des Sciences of France (Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer Award, 1977). Gilbert was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987.

In 2002, he received the Biotechnology Heritage Award, from the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) and the Chemical Heritage Foundation.

Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert&#x27;s 1977 paper &quot;A new method for sequencing DNA&quot; was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society for 2017. It was presented to the Department of Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology, Harvard University.

==Personal life==
Gilbert married Celia Stone, the daughter of I. F. Stone, in 1953 and has two children. After retiring from Harvard in 2001, Gilbert has launched an artistic career to combine art and science. His art format is centered on digital photography.

<text>Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (WBEI), commonly known as Warner Bros. (WB), is an American filmed entertainment studio headquartered at the Warner Bros. Studios complex in Burbank, California, and is the flagship subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Founded on April 4, 1923, by four brothers, Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner, the company established itself as a leader in the American film industry before diversifying into animation, television, and video game. It is one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; major American film studios and a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).

The company is known for its film studio division, the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, which includes Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, Castle Rock Entertainment, DC Studios and the Warner Bros. Television Group. Bugs Bunny, a character created for the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series, is the company&#x27;s official mascot.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
The company&#x27;s name originated from the founding Warner brothers (born Wonsal, Woron, and Wonskolaser before Anglicization): Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner. Harry, Albert and Sam emigrated as young children with their Polish-Jewish mother to the United States from Krasnosielc, Poland (then part of Congress Poland within the Russian Empire), in October 1889, a year after their father emigrated to the U.S. and settled in Baltimore, Maryland. As in many other immigrant families, the elder Wonsal children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names: Szmuel Wonsal became Samuel Warner (nicknamed &quot;Sam&quot;), Hirsz Wonsal became Harry Warner, and Aaron Wonsal (although born with a given name common in the Americas) became Albert Warner. Jack, the youngest brother, was born in London, Ontario, during the family&#x27;s two-year residency in Canada.
The three elder brothers began in the movie theater business, having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of Pennsylvania and Ohio. In the beginning, Sam and Albert Warner invested $150 to present &quot;Life of an American Fireman&quot; and &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;. They opened their first theater, the Cascade, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1903. When the original building was in danger of being demolished, the modern Warner Bros. called the current building owners and arranged to save it. The owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance.

In 1904, the Warners founded the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement &amp; Supply Company, to distribute films. In 1912, Harry Warner hired an auditor named Paul Ashley Chase. By the time of World War I, they had begun producing films; in the early 1920s they acquired their first studio facilities on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Sam and Jack produced the pictures, while Harry and Albert, along with their auditor and now-controller Chase, handled finance and distribution in New York City. During World War I their first nationally syndicated film, &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot;, based on a popular book by former ambassador James W. Gerard, was released. On April 4, 1923, with help from money loaned to Harry by his banker Motley Flint, they formally incorporated as Warner Bros. Pictures, Incorporated. (As late as the 1960s, Warner Bros. claimed 1905 as its founding date.)
The first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to Avery Hopwood&#x27;s 1919 Broadway play, &quot;The Gold Diggers&quot;, from theatrical impresario David Belasco. However, Rin Tin Tin, a dog brought from France after World War I by an American soldier, established their reputation. Rin Tin Tin&#x27;s third film was the feature &quot;Where the North Begins&quot;, which was so successful that Jack signed the dog to star in more films for $1,000 per week. Rin Tin Tin became the studio&#x27;s top star. Jack nicknamed him &quot;The Mortgage Lifter&quot; and the success boosted Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s career. Zanuck eventually became a top producer and between 1928 and 1933 served as Jack&#x27;s right-hand man and executive producer, with responsibilities including day-to-day film production. More success came after Ernst Lubitsch was hired as head director; Harry Rapf left the studio to join Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Lubitsch&#x27;s film &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot; was the studio&#x27;s most successful film of 1924, and was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best list for that year.
Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and Lubitsch, Warner&#x27;s remained a lesser studio. Sam and Jack decided to offer Broadway actor John Barrymore the lead role in &quot;Beau Brummel&quot;. The film was so successful that Harry signed Barrymore to a long-term contract; like &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot;, &quot;Beau Brummel&quot; was named one of the ten best films of the year by the &quot;Times&quot;. By the end of 1924, Warner Bros. was arguably Hollywood&#x27;s most successful independent studio, where it competed with &quot;The Big Three&quot; Studios (First National, Paramount Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)). As a result, Harry Warner—while speaking at a convention of 1,500 independent exhibitors in Milwaukee, Wisconsin—was able to convince the filmmakers to spend $500,000 in newspaper advertising, and Harry saw this as an opportunity to establish theaters in places such as New York City and Los Angeles.

As the studio prospered, it gained backing from Wall Street, and in 1924 Goldman Sachs arranged a major loan. With this new money, the Warners bought the pioneer Vitagraph Company which had a nationwide distribution system. In 1925, Warners&#x27; also experimented in radio, establishing a successful radio station, KFWB, in Los Angeles.

=== 1925–1935: Sound, color, style ===
Warner Bros. was a pioneer of films with synchronized sound (then known as &quot;talking pictures&quot; or &quot;talkies&quot;). In 1925, at Sam&#x27;s urging, Warner&#x27;s agreed to add this feature to their productions. By February 1926, the studio reported a net loss of $333,413.
After a long period denying Sam&#x27;s request for sound, Harry agreed to change, as long as the studio&#x27;s use of synchronized sound was for background music purposes only. The Warners signed a contract with the sound engineer company Western Electric and established Vitaphone. In 1926, Vitaphone began making films with music and effects tracks, most notably, in the feature &quot;Don Juan&quot; starring John Barrymore. The film was silent, but it featured a large number of Vitaphone shorts at the beginning. To hype &quot;Don Juan&quot;″s release, Harry acquired the large Piccadilly Theater in Manhattan, New York City, and renamed it Warners&#x27; Theatre.

&quot;Don Juan&quot; premiered at the Warners&#x27; Theatre in New York on August 6, 1926. Throughout the early history of film distribution, theater owners hired orchestras to attend film showings, where they provided soundtracks. Through Vitaphone, Warner Bros. produced eight shorts (which were played at the beginning of every showing of &quot;Don Juan&quot; across the country) in 1926. Many film production companies questioned the necessity. &quot;Don Juan&quot; did not recoup its production cost and Lubitsch left for MGM. By April 1927, the Big Five studios (First National, Paramount, MGM, Universal Pictures, and Producers Distributing) had ruined Warners, and Western Electric renewed Warner&#x27;s Vitaphone contract with terms that allowed other film companies to test sound.

As a result of their financial problems, Warner Bros. took the next step and released &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; starring Al Jolson. This movie, which includes little sound dialogue, but did feature sound segments of Jolson singing, was a sensation. It signaled the beginning of the era of &quot;talking pictures&quot; and the twilight of the silent era. However, Sam died the night before the opening, preventing the brothers from attending the premiere. Jack became sole head of production. Sam&#x27;s death also had a great effect on Jack&#x27;s emotional state, as Sam was arguably Jack&#x27;s inspiration and favorite brother. In the years to come, Jack kept the studio under tight control. Firing employees was common. Among those whom Jack fired were Rin Tin Tin (in 1929) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (in 1933), the latter having served as First National&#x27;s top star since the brothers acquired the studio in 1928.

Thanks to the success of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, the studio was cash-rich. Jolson&#x27;s next film for the company, &quot;The Singing Fool&quot; was also a success. With the success of these first talkies (&quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, &quot;Lights of New York&quot;, &quot;The Singing Fool&quot; and &quot;The Terror&quot;), Warner Bros. became a top studio and the brothers were now able to move out from the Poverty Row section of Hollywood, and acquire a much larger studio lot in Burbank. They expanded by acquiring the Stanley Corporation, a major theater chain. This gave them a share in rival First National Pictures, of which Stanley owned one-third. In a bidding war with William Fox, Warner Bros. bought more First National shares on September 13, 1928; Jack also appointed Zanuck as the manager of First National Pictures.

In 1928, Warner Bros. released &quot;Lights of New York&quot;, the first all-talking feature. Due to its success, the movie industry converted entirely to sound almost overnight. By the end of 1929, all the major studios were exclusively making sound films. In 1929, First National Pictures released their first film with Warner Bros., &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. Despite its expensive budget, &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; was profitable. In 1929, Warner Bros. released &quot;On with the Show!&quot;, the first all-color all-talking feature. This was followed by &quot;Gold Diggers of Broadway&quot; which would play in theaters until 1939. The success of these pictures caused a color revolution. Warner Bros. color films from 1929 to 1931 included &quot;The Show of Shows&quot; (1929), &quot;Sally&quot; (1929), &quot;Bright Lights&quot; (1930), &quot;Golden Dawn&quot; (1930), &quot;Hold Everything&quot; (1930), &quot;Song of the Flame&quot; (1930), &quot;Song of the West&quot; (1930), &quot;The Life of the Party&quot; (1930), &quot;Sweet Kitty Bellairs&quot; (1930), &quot;Under a Texas Moon&quot; (1930), &quot;Bride of the Regiment&quot; (1930), &quot;Viennese Nights&quot; (1931), &quot;Woman Hungry&quot; (1931), &quot;Kiss Me Again&quot; (1931), &quot;50 Million Frenchmen&quot; (1931) and &quot;Manhattan Parade&quot; (1932). In addition to these, scores of features were released with Technicolor sequences, as well as numerous Technicolor Specials short subjects. The majority of these color films were musicals.

In 1929, Warner Bros. bought the St. Louis-based theater chain Skouras Brothers Enterprises. Following this takeover, Spyros Skouras, the driving force of the chain, became general manager of the Warner Brothers Theater Circuit in America. He worked successfully in that post for two years and turned its losses into profits. Harry produced an adaptation of a Cole Porter musical titled &quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen&quot;. Through First National, the studio&#x27;s profit increased substantially. After the success of the studio&#x27;s 1929 First National film &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, Harry agreed to make Michael Curtiz a major director at the Burbank studio. Mort Blumenstock, a First National screenwriter, became a top writer at the brothers&#x27; New York headquarters. In the third quarter, Warner Bros. gained complete control of First National, when Harry purchased the company&#x27;s remaining one-third share from Fox. The Justice Department agreed to allow the purchase if First National was maintained as a separate company. When the Great Depression hit, Warner asked for and got permission to merge the two studios. Soon afterward Warner Bros. moved to the First National lot in Burbank. Though the companies merged, the Justice Department required Warner to release a few films each year under the First National name until 1938. For thirty years, certain Warner productions were identified (mainly for tax purposes) as &#x27;A Warner Bros.–First National Picture.&#x27;

In the latter part of 1929, Jack Warner hired George Arliss to star in &quot;Disraeli&quot;, which was a success. Arliss won an Academy Award for Best Actor and went on to star in nine more movies for the studio. In 1930, Harry acquired more theaters in Atlantic City, despite the beginning of the Great Depression. In July 1930, the studio&#x27;s banker, Motley Flint, was murdered by a disgruntled investor in another company.

Harry acquired a string of music publishers (including M. Witmark &amp; Sons, Remick Music Corp., and T.B. Harms, Inc.) to form Warner Bros. Music. In April 1930, Warner Bros. acquired Brunswick Records. Harry obtained radio companies, foreign sound patents and a lithograph company. After establishing Warner Bros. Music, Harry appointed his son, Lewis, to manage the company.

By 1931, the studio began to feel the effects of the Great Depression, reportedly losing $8 million, and an additional $14 million the following year. In 1931, Warner Bros. Music head Lewis Warner died from an infected wisdom tooth. Around that time, Zanuck hired screenwriter Wilson Mizner, who had little respect for authority and found it difficult to work with Jack, but became an asset. As time passed, Warner became more tolerant of Mizner and helped invest in Mizner&#x27;s Brown Derby restaurant. Mizner died of a heart attack on April 3, 1933.

By 1932, musicals were declining in popularity, and the studio was forced to cut musical numbers from many productions and advertise them as straight comedies. The public had begun to associate musicals with color, and thus studios began to abandon its use. Warner Bros. had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more pictures in that process. As a result, the first horror films in color were produced and released by the studio: &quot;Doctor X&quot; (1932) and &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot; (1933). In the latter part of 1931, Harry Warner rented the Teddington Studios in London, England. The studio focused on making &quot;quota quickies&quot; for the domestic British market and Irving Asher was appointed as the studio&#x27;s head producer. In 1934, Harry officially purchased the Teddington Studios.

In February 1933, Warner Bros. produced &quot;42nd Street&quot;, a very successful musical under the direction of Lloyd Bacon. Warner assigned Bacon to &quot;more expensive productions including &quot;Footlight Parade&quot;, &quot;Wonder Bar&quot;, &quot;Broadway Gondolier&quot;&quot; (which he also starred in), and &quot;Gold Diggers&quot; that saved the company from bankruptcy. In the wake of &quot;42nd Street&quot;&#x27;s success, the studio produced profitable musicals. These starred Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell and were mostly directed by Busby Berkeley. In 1935, the revival was affected by Berkeley&#x27;s arrest for killing three people while driving drunk. By the end of the year, people again tired of Warner Bros. musicals, and the studio — after the huge profits made by 1935 film &quot;Captain Blood&quot; — shifted its focus to Errol Flynn swashbucklers.

=== 1930–1935: Pre-code realistic period ===
With the collapse of the market for musicals, Warner Bros., under Zanuck, turned to more socially realistic storylines. Because of its many films about gangsters, Warner Bros. soon became known as a &quot;gangster studio&quot;. The studio&#x27;s first gangster film, &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, was a great box office success and Edward G. Robinson starred in many of the subsequent Warner gangster films. The studio&#x27;s next effort, &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;, made James Cagney arguably the studio&#x27;s new top star, and Warner Bros. made more gangster films.

Another gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot;, based on a true story and starring Paul Muni, joining Cagney and Robinson as one of the studio&#x27;s top gangster stars after appearing in the successful film, which convinced audiences to question the American legal system. By January 1933, the film&#x27;s protagonist Robert Elliot Burns—still imprisoned in New Jersey—and other chain gang prisoners nationwide appealed and were released. In January 1933, Georgia chain gang warden J. Harold Hardy—who was also made into a character in the film—sued the studio for displaying &quot;vicious, untrue and false attacks&quot; against him in the film. After appearing in the Warner&#x27;s film &quot;The Man Who Played God&quot;, Bette Davis became a top star.

In 1933, relief for the studio came after Franklin D. Roosevelt became president and began the New Deal. This economic rebound allowed Warner Bros. to again become profitable. The same year, Zanuck quit. Harry Warner&#x27;s relationship with Zanuck had become strained after Harry strongly opposed allowing Zanuck&#x27;s film &quot;Baby Face&quot; to step outside Hays Code boundaries. The studio reduced his salary as a result of losses from the Great Depression, and Harry refused to restore it as the company recovered. Zanuck established his own company. Harry thereafter raised salaries for studio employees.

In 1933, Warner was able to link up with newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s Cosmopolitan Films. Hearst had previously worked with MGM, but ended the association after a dispute with head producer Irving Thalberg over the treatment of Hearst&#x27;s longstanding mistress, actress Marion Davies, who was struggling for box office success. Through his partnership with Hearst, Warner signed Davies to a studio contract. Hearst&#x27;s company and Davies&#x27; films, however, did not increase the studio&#x27;s profits.

In 1934, the studio lost over $2.5 million, of which $500,000 was the result of a 1934 fire at the Burbank studio, destroying 20 years&#x27; worth of early Vitagraph, Warner Bros. and First National films. The following year, Hearst&#x27;s film adaption of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1935) failed at the box office and the studio&#x27;s net loss increased. During this time, Harry and six other movie studio figures were indicted for conspiracy to violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, through an attempt to gain a monopoly over St Louis movie theaters. In 1935, Harry was put on trial; after a mistrial, Harry sold the company&#x27;s movie theaters and the case was never reopened. 1935 also saw the studio make a net profit of $674,158.00.
By 1936, contracts of musical and silent stars were not renewed, instead being replaced by tough-talking, working-class types who better fit these pictures. As a result, Dorothy Mackaill, Dolores del Río, Bebe Daniels, Frank Fay, Winnie Lightner, Bernice Claire, Alexander Gray, Alice White, and Jack Mulhall that had characterized the urban, modern, and sophisticated attitude of the 1920s gave way to James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Edward G. Robinson, Warren William and Barbara Stanwyck, who would be more acceptable to the common man. The studio was one of the most prolific producers of Pre-Code pictures and had a lot of trouble with the censors once they started clamping down on what they considered indecency (around 1934). As a result, Warner Bros. turned to historical pictures from around 1935 to avoid confrontations with the Breen office. In 1936, following the success of &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;, Jack signed Humphrey Bogart to a studio contract. Warner, however, did not think Bogart was star material, and cast Bogart in infrequent roles as a villain opposite either James Cagney or Edward Robinson over the next five years.

After Hal B. Wallis succeeded Zanuck in 1933, and the Hays Code began to be enforced in 1935, the studio was forced to abandon this realistic approach in order to produce more moralistic, idealized pictures. The studio&#x27;s historical dramas, melodramas (or &quot;women&#x27;s pictures&quot;), swashbucklers, and adaptations of best-sellers, with stars like Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Paul Muni, and Errol Flynn, avoided the censors. In 1936, Bette Davis, by now arguably the studio&#x27;s top star, was unhappy with her roles. She traveled to England and tried to break her contract. Davis lost the lawsuit and returned to America. Although many of the studio&#x27;s employees had problems with Jack Warner, they considered Albert and Harry fair.

=== Code era ===
In the 1930s many actors and actresses who had characterized the realistic pre-Code era, but who were not suited to the new trend into moral and idealized pictures, disappeared. Warner Bros. remained a top studio in Hollywood, but this changed after 1935 as other studios, notably MGM, quickly overshadowed the prestige and glamor that previously characterized Warner Bros. However, in the late 1930s, Bette Davis became the studio&#x27;s top draw and was even dubbed as &quot;The Fifth Warner Brother&quot;. 

In 1935, Cagney sued Jack Warner for breach of contract. Cagney claimed Warner had forced him to star in more films than his contract required. Cagney eventually dropped his lawsuit after a cash settlement. Nevertheless, Cagney left the studio to establish an independent film company with his brother Bill. The Cagneys released their films though Grand National Films; however, they were not able to get good financing and ran out of money after their third film. Cagney then agreed to return to Warner Bros., after Jack agreed to a contract guaranteeing Cagney would be treated to his own terms. After the success of &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; at the box office, Cagney again questioned if the studio would meet his salary demand and again quit to form his own film production and distribution company with Bill.

Another employee with whom Warner had troubles was studio producer Bryan Foy. In 1936, Wallis hired Foy as a producer for the studio&#x27;s low budget B movies leading to his nickname &quot;the keeper of the B&#x27;s&quot;. Foy was able to garnish arguably more profits than any other B-film producer at the time. During Foy&#x27;s time at the studio, however, Warner fired him seven different times.

During 1936, &quot;The Story of Louis Pasteur&quot; proved a box office success and star Paul Muni won the Oscar for Best Actor in March 1937. The studio&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; gave the studio the first of its seven Best Picture Oscars.

In 1937, the studio hired Midwestern radio announcer Ronald Reagan, who would eventually become the President of the United States. Although Reagan was initially a B-film actor, Warner Bros. was impressed by his performance in the final scene of &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;, and agreed to pair him with Flynn in &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940). Reagan then returned to B-films. After his performance in the studio&#x27;s 1942 &quot;Kings Row&quot;, Warner decided to make Reagan a top star and signed him to a new contract, tripling his salary.

In 1936, Harry&#x27;s daughter Doris read a copy of Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and was interested in making a film adaptation. Doris offered Mitchell $50,000 for screen rights. Jack vetoed the deal, realizing it would be an expensive production.

Major Paramount star George Raft also eventually proved to be a problem for Jack. Warner had signed him in 1939, finally bringing the third top 1930s gangster actor into the Warners fold, knowing that he could carry any gangster picture when either Robinson or Cagney were on suspension. Raft had difficulty working with Bogart and refused to co-star with him. Eventually, Warner agreed to release Raft from his contract in 1943. After Raft had turned the role down, the studio gave Bogart the role of &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Roy Earle in the 1941 film &quot;High Sierra&quot;, which helped establish him as a top star. Following &quot;High Sierra&quot; and after Raft had once again turned the part down, Bogart was given the leading role in John Huston&#x27;s successful 1941 remake of the studio&#x27;s 1931 pre-Code film, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, based upon the Dashiell Hammett novel.

=== Warner&#x27;s cartoons ===
Warner&#x27;s cartoon unit had its roots in the independent Harman and Ising studio. From 1930 to 1933, Walt Disney Studios alumni Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising produced musical cartoons for Leon Schlesinger, who sold them to Warner. Harman and Ising introduced their character Bosko in the first &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon, &quot;Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot;, and created a sister series, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, in 1931.

Harman and Ising broke away from Schlesinger in 1933 due to a contractual dispute, taking Bosko with them to MGM. As a result, Schlesinger started his own studio, Leon Schlesinger Productions, which continued with &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; while starting production on &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; starring Buddy, a Bosko clone. By the end of World War II, a new Schlesinger production team, including directors Friz Freleng (started in 1934), Tex Avery (started in 1935), Frank Tashlin (started in 1936), Bob Clampett (started in 1937), Chuck Jones (started in 1938), and Robert McKimson (started in 1946), was formed. Schlesinger&#x27;s staff developed a fast-paced, irreverent style that made their cartoons globally popular.

In 1935, Avery directed Porky Pig cartoons that established the character as the studio&#x27;s first animated star. In addition to Porky, Daffy Duck (who debuted in 1937&#x27;s &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot;), Elmer Fudd (&quot;Elmer&#x27;s Candid Camera&quot;, 1940), Bugs Bunny (&quot;A Wild Hare&quot;, 1940), and Tweety (&quot;A Tale of Two Kitties&quot;, 1942) would achieve star power. By 1942, the Schlesinger studio had surpassed Walt Disney Studios as the most successful producer of animated shorts.

Warner Bros. bought Schlesinger&#x27;s cartoon unit in 1944 and renamed it Warner Bros. Cartoons. However, senior management treated the unit with indifference, beginning with the installation as senior producer of Edward Selzer, whom the creative staff considered an interfering incompetent. Jack Warner had little regard for the company&#x27;s short film product and reputedly was so ignorant about the studio&#x27;s animation division that he was mistakenly convinced that the unit produced cartoons of Mickey Mouse, the flagship character of Walt Disney Productions. He sold off the unit&#x27;s pre-August 1948 library for $3,000 each, which proved a shortsighted transaction in light of its eventual value.

Warner Bros. Cartoons continued, with intermittent interruptions, until 1969 when it was dissolved as the parent company ceased its production of film shorts entirely. Characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety, Sylvester, and Porky Pig became central to the company&#x27;s image in subsequent decades. Bugs in particular remains a mascot to Warner Bros., its various divisions, and Six Flags (which Time Warner once owned). The success of the compilation film &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot; in 1979, featuring the archived film of these characters, prompted Warner Bros. to organize Warner Bros. Animation as a new production division to restart production of original material.

=== World War II ===
According to Warner&#x27;s autobiography, prior to US entry in World War II, Philip Kauffman, Warner Bros. German sales head, was murdered by the Nazis in Berlin in 1936. Harry produced the successful anti-German film &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; (1937). After that, Harry supervised the production of more anti-German films, including &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot; (1939), &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1940), which made King Philip II an equivalent of Hitler, &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re In The Army Now&quot; (1941). Harry then decided to focus on producing war films. Warners&#x27; cut its film production in half during the war, eliminating its B Pictures unit in 1941. Bryan Foy joined Twentieth Century Fox.

During the war era, the studio made &quot;Casablanca&quot;; &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;; &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (all 1942); &quot;This Is the Army&quot;, and &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; (both 1943). The last of these films became controversial a few years afterwards. At the premieres of &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (in Los Angeles, New York, and London), audiences purchased $15.6 million in war bonds for the governments of England and the United States. By the middle of 1943, however, audiences had tired of war films, but Warner continued to produce them, losing money. In honor of the studio&#x27;s contributions to the cause, the Navy named a Liberty ship after the brothers&#x27; father, Benjamin Warner. Harry christened the ship. By the time the war ended, $20 million in war bonds were purchased through the studio, the Red Cross collected 5,200 pints of blood plasma from studio employees and 763 of the studio&#x27;s employees served in the armed forces, including Harry Warner&#x27;s son-in-law Milton Sperling and Jack&#x27;s son Jack Warner Jr. Following a dispute over ownership of &quot;Casablanca&quot;&#x27;s Oscar for Best Picture, Wallis resigned. After &quot;Casablanca&quot; made Bogart a top star, Bogart&#x27;s relationship with Jack deteriorated.

In 1943, Olivia de Havilland (whom Warner frequently loaned to other studios) sued Warner for breach of contract. De Havilland had refused to portray famed abolitionist Elizabeth Blackwell in an upcoming film for Columbia Pictures. Warner responded by sending 150 telegrams to different film production companies, warning them not to hire her for any role. Afterwards, de Havilland discovered employment contracts in California could only last seven years; de Havilland had been under contract with the studio since 1935. The court ruled in de Havilland&#x27;s favor and she left the studio in favor of RKO Radio Pictures, and, eventually, Paramount. Through de Havilland&#x27;s victory, many of the studio&#x27;s longtime actors were now freed from their contracts, and Harry decided to terminate the studio&#x27;s suspension policy.

The same year, Jack signed newly released MGM actress Joan Crawford, a former top star who found her career fading. Crawford&#x27;s first role with the studio was 1944&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot;. Her first starring role at the studio, in the title role as &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945), revived her career and earned her an Oscar for Best Actress.

=== After World War II: changing hands ===
In the post-war years, Warner Bros. prospered greatly and continued to create new stars, including Lauren Bacall and Doris Day. By 1946, company payroll reached $600,000 a week and net profit topped $19.4million (equivalent to $ million in ). Jack Warner continued to refuse to meet Screen Actors Guild salary demands. In September 1946, employees engaged in a month-long strike. In retaliation, Warner—during his 1947 testimony before Congress about &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot;—accused multiple employees of ties to Communists. By the end of 1947, the studio reached a record net profit of $22million (equivalent to $ million in ).

Warner acquired Pathé News from RKO in 1947. On January 5, 1948, Warner offered the first color newsreel, covering the Tournament of Roses Parade and the Rose Bowl Game. In 1948, Bette Davis, still their top actress and now hostile to Jack, was a big problem for Harry after she and others left the studio after completing the film &quot;Beyond the Forest&quot;.

Warner was a party to the &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; antitrust case of the 1940s. This action, brought by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, claimed the five integrated studio-theater chain combinations restrained competition. The Supreme Court heard the case in 1948, and ruled for the government. As a result, Warner and four other major studios were forced to separate production from the exhibition. In 1949, the studio&#x27;s net profit was only $10million (equivalent to $ million in ).

Warner Bros. had two semi-independent production companies that released films through the studio. One of these was Sperling&#x27;s United States Pictures.
In the early 1950s, the threat of television emerged. In 1953, Jack decided to copy United Artists successful 3D film &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, releasing his own 3D films beginning with &quot;House of Wax&quot;. However, 3D films soon lost their appeal among moviegoers.

3D almost caused the demise of the Warner Bros. cartoon studio. Having completed a 3D Bugs Bunny cartoon, &quot;Lumber Jack-Rabbit&quot;, Jack Warner ordered the animation unit to be closed, erroneously believing that all cartoons hence would be produced in the 3D process. Several months later, Warner relented and reopened the cartoon studio. Warner Bros. had enough of a backlog of cartoons and a healthy reissue program so that there was no noticeable interruption in the release schedule.

In 1952, Warner Bros. made their first film (&quot;Carson City&quot;) in &quot;Warnercolor&quot;, the studio&#x27;s name for Eastmancolor.

After the downfall of 3D films, Harry Warner decided to use CinemaScope in future Warner Bros. films. One of the studio&#x27;s first CinemaScope films, &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (owned by John Wayne&#x27;s company, Batjac Productions), enabled the studio to show a profit.

Early in 1953, Warner&#x27;s theater holdings were spun off as Stanley Warner Theaters; Stanley Warner&#x27;s non-theater holdings were sold to Simon Fabian Enterprises, and its theaters merged with RKO Theatres to become RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres.

By 1956, the studio was losing money, declining from 1953&#x27;s net profit of $2.9million (equivalent to $ million in ) and the next two years of between $2 and $4 million. On February 13, 1956, Jack Warner sold the rights to all of the studio&#x27;s pre-1950 films to Associated Artists Productions (which merged with United Artists Television in 1958, and was subsequently acquired by Turner Broadcasting System in early 1986 as part of a failed takeover of MGM/UA by Ted Turner).

In May 1956, the brothers announced they were putting Warner Bros. on the market. Jack secretly organized a syndicateheaded by Boston banker Serge Semenenkoto purchase 90% of the stock. After the three brothers sold, Jackthrough his under-the-table dealjoined Semenenko&#x27;s syndicate and bought back all his stock. Shortly after the deal was completed in July, Jacknow the company&#x27;s largest stockholderappointed himself its new president. Shortly after the deal closed, Jack announced the company and its subsidiaries would be &quot;directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties, talents, and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible.&quot;

=== Warner Bros. Television and Warner Bros. Records ===
By 1949, with the success of television threatening the film industry more and more, Harry Warner decided to emphasize television production. However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would not permit it. After an unsuccessful attempt to convince other movie studio bosses to switch, Harry abandoned his television efforts.

Jack had problems with Milton Berle&#x27;s unsuccessful film &quot;Always Leave Them Laughing&quot; during the peak of Berle&#x27;s television popularity. Warner felt that Berle was not strong enough to carry a film and that people would not pay to see the man they could see on television for free. However, Jack was pressured into using Berle, who replaced Danny Kaye. Berle&#x27;s outrageous behavior on the set and the film&#x27;s massive failure led to Jack banning television sets from film sets and mentions of television itself from film scripts. In his 1991 autobiography, &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot, It&#x27;s Only Me&quot;, Bob Hope remarked that &quot;when Warners filmed a living room after that, the whole family would just gather around a fireplace&quot;.

On March 21, 1955, the studio was finally able to engage in television through the successful Warner Bros. Television unit run by William T. Orr, Jack Warner&#x27;s son-in-law. Warner Bros. Television provided ABC with a weekly show, &quot;Warner Bros. Presents.&quot; The show featured rotating shows based on three film successes, &quot;Kings Row&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, followed by a promotion for a new film. It was not a success. The studio&#x27;s next effort was to make a weekly series out of &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was television&#x27;s first hour-long Western. Two episodes were placed together for feature film release outside the United States. In the tradition of its B movies, the studio followed up with a series of rapidly produced popular Westerns, such as writer/producer Roy Huggins&#x27; critically lauded &quot;Maverick&quot; as well as &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;, &quot;Bronco&quot;, &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;The Alaskans&quot; and &quot;Colt .45&quot;. The success of these series helped to make up for losses in the film business. As a result, Jack Warner decided to emphasize television production. Warners produced a series of popular private detective shows beginning with &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; (1958–1964) followed by &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; (1959–1963), &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot; (1960) and &quot;Surfside 6&quot; (1960–1962).

Within a few years, the studio provoked hostility among its TV stars such as Clint Walker and James Garner, who sued over a contract dispute and won. Edd Byrnes was not so lucky and bought himself out of his contract. Jack was angered by their perceived ingratitude. Television actors evidently showed more independence than film actors, deepening his contempt for the new medium. Many of Warner&#x27;s television stars appeared in the casts of Warner&#x27;s cinema releases. In 1963, a court decision forced Warner Bros. to end contracts with their television stars and to cease engaging them for specific series or film roles. That year, Jack Webb, best known for originating the role of Sgt. Joe Friday in the &quot;Dragnet&quot; franchise, became the head of the studio&#x27;s TV division.
On March 19, 1958, the studio launched Warner Bros. Records, with its inaugural office based above the studio&#x27;s machine shop on 3701 Warner Boulevard in Burbank. Initially, the label released recordings made by their television stars—whether they could sing or not—and records based on television soundtracks. Warner Bros. was already the owner of extensive music-publishing holdings, whose tunes had appeared in countless cartoons (arranged by Carl Stalling) and television shows (arranged by Max Steiner). In 2004, Time Warner sold the Warner Music Group, along with Warner Bros. Records, to a private equity group led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. In 2019, the since-separated Warner Bros. record division was rechristened Warner Records, as WMG held a short-term license to use the Warner Bros. name and trademarks; as such, the label currently reissues the pre-2019 Warner Bros. back catalog.

In 1963, Warner agreed to a &quot;rescue takeover&quot; of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s Reprise Records. The deal gave Sinatra US$1.5 million and part ownership of Warner Bros. Records, making Reprise a sub-label. Most significantly the deal brought Reprise manager Morris &quot;Mo&quot; Ostin into the company. In 1964, upon seeing the profits record companies made from Warner film music, Warner decided to claim ownership of the studio&#x27;s film soundtracks. In its first eighteen months, Warner Bros. Records lost around $2 million.

=== New owners ===
Warner Bros. rebounded in the late 1950s, specializing in adaptations of popular plays like &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; (1956), &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; (1958), and &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1962).

While he slowly recovered from a car crash that occurred while vacationing in France in 1958, Jack returned to the studio and made sure his name was featured in studio press releases. From 1961 to 1963, the studio&#x27;s annual net profit was a little over $7 million. Warner paid an unprecedented $5.5 million for the film rights to the Broadway musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in February 1962. The previous owner, CBS Chairman William S. Paley, set terms including half the distributor&#x27;s gross profits &quot;plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract.&quot; In 1963, the studio&#x27;s net profit dropped to $3.7 million. By the mid-1960s, motion picture production was in decline, as the industry was in the midst of a painful transition from the Golden Age of Hollywood to the era now known as New Hollywood. Few studio films were made in favor of co-productions (for which Warner provided facilities, money and distribution), and pickups of independent pictures.

With the success of the studio&#x27;s 1964 film of Broadway play &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, as well as its soundtrack, Warner Bros. Records became a profitable subsidiary. The 1966 film &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?&quot; was a huge success.
In November 1966, Jack gave in to advancing age and changing times, selling control of the studio and music business to Seven Arts Productions, run by Canadian investors Eliot and Kenneth Hyman, for $32 million. The company, including the studio, was renamed Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. Warner remained president until the summer of 1967, when &quot;Camelot&quot; failed at the box office and Warner gave up his position to his longtime publicity director, Ben Kalmenson; Warner remained on board as an independent producer and vice-president. With the 1967 success of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, Warner Bros. was again profitable.

Two years later the Hymans were tired and fed-up with Jack Warner and his actions. They accepted a cash-and-stock offer from Kinney National Company for more than $64 million. In 1967, Kinney had previously acquired DC Comics (then officially known as National Periodical Publications), as well as a Hollywood talent agency, Ashley-Famous, whose founder Ted Ashley led Kinney head Steve Ross to purchase Warner Bros. Ashley-Famous was soon spun off due to antitrust laws prohibiting the simultaneous ownership of a film studio and a talent agency. Ashley became the studio head and changed the name to Warner Bros. Inc. once again. Jack Warner was outraged by the Hymans&#x27; sale, and decided to move into independent production (most successfully with &quot;1776&quot; at Columbia). He retired in 1973 and died from serious health complications of heart inflammation in September 1978.
Although movie audiences had shrunk, Warner&#x27;s new management believed in the drawing power of stars, signing co-production deals with several of the biggest names of the day, including Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand, and Clint Eastwood, carrying the studio successfully through the 1970s and 1980s. Its hits in the early 1970s included those starring the aforementioned actors, along with comedian Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Deliverance&quot;, and the Martin Scorsese productions &quot;Mean Streets&quot; and &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. Warner Bros. also made major profits on films and television shows built around the characters of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and The Flash owned by Warner Bros. subsidiary DC Comics. The 1970s also saw Warner Bros. Records become one of the major record labels worldwide, and that company gained sister labels in Elektra Records and Atlantic Records. In 1971, Filmation and Warner Bros. entered into an agreement to produce and distribute cartoons for film and television, with its television subsidiary handling worldwide television rights.

In late 1973, Warner Bros. announced that it had partnered with 20th Century Fox to co-produce a single film: producer Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;. Both studios found themselves owning the rights to books about burning skyscrapers: Warner was attempting to adapt Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Inferno&quot; and Fox was preparing an adaptation of Richard Martin Stern&#x27;s &quot;The Tower&quot;. Allen insisted on a meeting with the heads of both studios and announced that as Fox was already in the lead with their property it would be preferable to lump the two together as a single film, with Fox owning domestic rights and Warner Bros. handling the film&#x27;s foreign distribution. The resulting partnership resulted in the second-highest-grossing film of 1974, turning profits for both studios, and influencing future co-productions between major studios. Although Allen would make further films for Warner Bros., he would not repeat the success he had with &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;.

Abandoning parking lots and funeral homes, the refocused Kinney renamed itself in honor of its best-known holding, Warner Communications. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Warner Communications branched out into other business, such as video game company Atari, Inc. in 1976, and later the Six Flags theme parks.

In 1972, in a cost-cutting move, Warner and Columbia formed a third company called The Burbank Studios (TBS). They would share the Warner lot in Burbank. Both studios technically became production entities, giving TBS day-to-day responsibility for studio grounds and upkeep. The Columbia Ranch (about a mile north of Warner&#x27;s lot) was part of the deal.

The Warner–Columbia relationship was acrimonious, but the reluctance of both studios to approve or spend money on capital upgrades that might only help the other did have the unintended consequence of preserving the Warner lot&#x27;s primary function as a filmmaking facility while it produced relatively little during the 1970s and 1980s. One famous film that was filmed at the Warner lot during this era was &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) by director Ridley Scott. Most films produced after 1968 were filmed on location after the failure of &quot;Camelot&quot; was partially attributed to the fact it was set in England but obviously filmed in Burbank. With control over its own lot tied up in TBS, Warner ultimately retained a significant portion of its backlot, while Fox sold its backlot to create Century City, Universal turned part of its backlot into a theme park and shopping center, and Disney replaced its backlot with office buildings and exiled its animation department to an industrial park in Glendale.

In 1989, a solution to the situation became evident when Warner Bros. acquired Lorimar-Telepictures and gained control of the former MGM studio lot in Culver City, and that same year, Sony bought Columbia Pictures. Sony was flush with cash and Warner Bros. now had two studio lots. In 1990, TBS ended when Sony bought the MGM lot from Warner and moved Columbia to Culver City. However, Warner kept the Columbia Ranch, now known as the Warner Bros. Ranch.

Robert A. Daly joined Warner Bros. on December 1, 1980, taking over from Ted Ashley. His titles were chairman of the board and Co-Chief Executive Officer. One year later, he was named chairman of the board and chief executive officer and appointed Terry Semel President and Chief Operating Officer.

=== Time Warner subsidiary ===

Warner Communications merged in 1989 with white-shoe publishing company Time Inc. Time claimed a higher level of prestige, while Warner Bros. provided the profits. The Time-Warner merger was almost derailed when Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western, later sold to the first incarnation of Viacom), launched a $12.2 billion hostile takeover bid for Time Inc., forcing Time to acquire Warner with a $14.9 billion cash/stock offer. Paramount responded with a lawsuit filed in Delaware court to break up the merger. Paramount lost and the merger proceeded.

In 1992, Warner Bros. Family Entertainment was established to produce various family-oriented films, plus animated films. The Family Entertainment label was dormant in 2011. In 1994, Jon Peters, whose Peters Entertainment company had a non-exclusive deal at Sony Pictures, received another non-exclusive, financing deal at Warner Bros., citing that then president Terry Samel and producer Peters were friends.
In 1995, Warner Bros. and television station owner Tribune Company of Chicago launched The WB Television Network, seeking a large share of the niche market of teenage viewers. The WB&#x27;s early programming included an abundance of teenage fare, such as &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. Two dramas produced by Spelling Television, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; and &quot;Charmed&quot;, helped bring The WB into the spotlight. &quot;Charmed&quot; lasted eight seasons, becoming the longest-running drama with female leads. &quot;7th Heaven&quot; ran for eleven seasons and was the longest-running family drama and longest-running show for the network. In 2006, Warner Bros. and CBS Corporation decided to close The WB and CBS&#x27;s UPN and jointly launch The CW Television Network.

In 1996, Turner Pictures was folded into Warner Bros. via the Turner-Time Warner Entertainment merger. This brought projects such as &quot;City of Angels&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; into the studio. Later that year, Warner Bros. partnered with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment to distribute various movies produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, also brought into Warner Bros. by the Turner deal. Also that same year, Bruce Berman left Warner Bros. to begin Plan B Entertainment, then he subsequently headed Village Roadshow Pictures with a deal at the studio.

In 1998, Time Warner Entertainment sold Six Flags to Premier Parks. The takeover of Time Warner Entertainment in 2001 by then-high-flying America Online (AOL) did not prove a good match, and following the collapse in &quot;dot-com&quot; stocks, the AOL element was banished from the corporate name.

In 1998, Warner Bros. celebrated its 75th anniversary. In 1999, Terry Semel and Robert Daly resigned as studio heads after a career with 13 Oscar-nominated films. Daly and Semel were said to have popularized the modern model of partner financing and profit sharing for film production. In mid-1999, Alan F. Horn and Barry Meyer replaced Daly and Semel as new studio heads, in which the studio had continued success in movies, television shows, cartoons, that the previous studio heads had for the studio. In late 2003, Time Warner reorganized Warner Bros.&#x27; assets under Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., in an effort to distinguish the film studio from its then-sister record label (which since became Warner Records in May 2019) and Warner Music Group.

In the late 1990s, Warner Bros. obtained rights to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels and released feature film adaptations of the first in 2001. Subsequently, they released the second film in 2002, the third in June 2004, the fourth in November 2005, the fifth in July 2007, and the sixth in July 2009. The seventh (and at that time, final) book was released as two movies; &quot;Deathly Hallows — Part 1&quot; in November 2010 and &quot;Deathly Hallows — Part 2&quot; in July 2011.

From 2006, Warner Bros. operated a joint venture with China Film Group Corporation and HG to form Warner China Film HG to produce films in Hong Kong and China, including &quot;Connected&quot;, a remake of the 2004 thriller film &quot;Cellular&quot;.

Warner Bros. played a large part in the discontinuation of the HD DVD format. On January 4, 2008, Warner Bros. announced that they would drop support of HD DVD in favor of Blu-ray Disc. HD DVDs continued to be released through May 2008, but only following Blu-ray and DVD releases.

Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series was the worldwide highest-grossing film series of all time without adjusting for inflation. Its &quot;Batman&quot; film series was one of only two series to have two entries earn more than $1 billion worldwide. &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; was Warner Bros.&#x27; highest-grossing movie ever (surpassing &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;). However, the Harry Potter movies have produced a net loss due to Hollywood accounting. IMAX Corp. signed with Warner Bros. Pictures in April 2010 to release as many as 20 giant-format films through 2013.

On October 21, 2014, Warner Bros. created a short form digital unit, Blue Ribbon Content, under Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series president Sam Register. Warner Bros. Digital Networks announced its acquisition of online video company Machinima, Inc. on November 17, 2016.

As of 2015, Warner Bros. is one of only three studios to have released a pair of billion-dollar films in the same year (along with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and Universal Studios); the distinction was achieved in 2012 with &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;. As of 2016, it is the only studio to cross $1 billion at the domestic box office every year since 2000.

==== AT&amp;T subsidiary ====
In June 2018, Warner Bros. parent company Time Warner was acquired by U.S. telecom company AT&amp;T, and renamed WarnerMedia, the former Time Inc. properties having been sold off to new owners. On October 16, 2018, WarnerMedia shut down DramaFever, affecting 20 percent of Warner Bros.&#x27; digital networks staff.

On March 4, 2019, WarnerMedia announced a planned reorganization that would dissolve Turner Broadcasting System by moving Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Boomerang, their respective production studios (Cartoon Network Studios and Williams Street), as well as Turner Classic Movies and Otter Media, directly under Warner Bros. (Turner&#x27;s remaining television services would be divided into WarnerMedia Entertainment and WarnerMedia News &amp; Sports respectively). Aside from Otter Media, these assets operate under a newly formed Global Kids &amp; Young Adults division, renamed on April 7, 2020, to Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics. On May 31, 2019, Otter Media was transferred from Warner Bros. to WarnerMedia Entertainment to oversee the development of HBO Max, a new streaming service that would feature content from HBO and WarnerMedia brands. Tom Ascheim resigned as president of cable network Freeform to become the president of the Global Kids, Young Adults, and Classics division on July 1, 2020.
On November 13, 2019, Warner Bros. unveiled an updated iteration of its shield logo by Pentagram in anticipation of the company&#x27;s upcoming centennial, which features a streamlined appearance designed to make it better-suited for multi-platform usage and iterations. The company also commissioned a new corporate typeface that is modeled upon the &quot;WB&quot; lettering.

Warner Bros. and HBO Max announced the Warner Max film label on February 5, 2020, which was to produce eight-to-ten mid-budget movies per year for the streaming service starting in 2020. However, the label was ultimately discontinued in October 2020 as part of a consolidation of the Warner Bros. Pictures group.

In February 2022, Village Roadshow Pictures, a co-financier of &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, began a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over the hybrid release of the sci-fi sequel. Like all of Warner Bros.&#x27; 2021 films, the fourth &quot;Matrix&quot; film was given a simultaneous release on both HBO Max and in theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a complaint filed by Village Roadshow, the decision ruined any December box office hopes. In May of that same year, Village Roadshow agreed to arbitration with Warner Bros. over the release of &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;.

=== Warner Bros. Discovery ===
On April 8, 2022, AT&amp;T divested WarnerMedia to its shareholders, and in turn merged with Discovery Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery. The new company is led by Discovery&#x27;s CEO David Zaslav.

In March 2022, Warner Bros. soft launched a campaign for its centennial in 2023, with the tagline &quot;100 Years of Storytelling&quot;. In December 2022, the centennial campaign was launched with the new tagline &quot;Celebrating Every Story&quot;, which will include commemorative initiatives across all Warner Bros. divisions and properties. The campaign utilizes a commemorative logo featuring an updated shield by Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv (first introduced in the Warner Bros. Discovery logo), which was revised with a softer appearance, thicker outlines, and a return to using blue and gold as its corporate colors (if not rendered in different colors or textures to suit a specific property). The updated shield is used as a secondary logo, and is used concurrently with the 2019 logo (which is the main and primary logo) since May 2023. As part of the 100th anniversary campaign, the studio will release new short features for the Max streaming service that recreates Warner Bros. classics with a focus on diversity. In November 2022, James Gunn and Peter Safran became the co-chairpersons and CEOs of DC Films, which was renamed to &quot;DC Studios&quot;.

== International distribution arrangements ==
From 1971 until the end of 1987, Warner&#x27;s international distribution operations were a joint venture with Columbia Pictures. In some countries, this joint venture distributed films from other companies (such as EMI Films and Cannon Films in the UK). Warner ended the venture in 1988.

On May 4, 1987, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution signed a theatrical distribution agreement with Warner Bros. International for the release of Disney, Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures films in overseas markets, with Disney retaining full control of all distribution and marketing decisions on their product. In 1992, Disney opted to end their joint venture with Warner Bros. to start autonomously distributing their films in the aforementioned markets.

On February 6, 2014, Columbia TriStar Warner Filmes de Portugal Ltda., a joint venture with Sony Pictures which distributed both companies&#x27; films in Portugal, announced that it would close its doors on March 31, 2014. NOS Audiovisuais handles distribution of Warner Bros. films in Portugal since then, while the distribution duties for Sony Pictures films in the country were taken over by Big Picture Films.

Warner Bros. still handles the distribution of Sony Pictures films in Italy.

Since January 1, 2021, Warner Bros. films are distributed through Universal Pictures in Hong Kong, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand citing WarnerMedia&#x27;s closure of its Hong Kong theatrical office with the Universal Pictures International logo appearing before the Warner Bros. Pictures logo starting with &quot;The Batman&quot;. As of 2024, Warner Bros. currently handles theatrical distribution of Universal Pictures films in Brazil, India and the Philippines.

In August 2022, Warner Bros. Pictures entered into a multi-year deal for distributing MGM films outside the United States, including on home entertainment. The contract included joint participation of both companies for marketing, advertising, publicity, film distribution, and relationship with exhibitors for future MGM titles.

== Film library ==

=== Acquired libraries ===
Mergers and acquisitions have helped Warner Bros. accumulate a diverse collection of films, cartoons and television programs. As of 2022, Warner Bros. owned more than 145,000 hours of programming, including 12,500 feature films and 2,400 television programs comprising more than tens of thousands of individual episodes.

In the aftermath of the 1948 antitrust suit, uncertain times led Warner Bros. in 1956 to sell most of its pre-1950 films and cartoons to Associated Artists Productions (a.a.p.). In addition, a.a.p. also obtained the Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons, originally from Paramount Pictures. Two years later, a.a.p. was sold to United Artists (UA), which owned the company until 1981, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) acquired United Artists.

In 1982, during their independent years, Turner Broadcasting System acquired Brut Productions, the film production arm of France-based then-struggling personal-care company Faberge Inc.

In 1986, Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM. Finding itself in debt, Turner Entertainment kept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries and a small portion of the United Artists library (including the a.a.p. library and North American rights to the RKO Radio Pictures library) while spinning off the rest of MGM.

In 1989, Warner Communications acquired Lorimar-Telepictures Corporation. Lorimar&#x27;s catalogue included the post-1974 library of Rankin/Bass Productions, and the post-1947 library of Monogram Pictures/Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.

In 1991, Turner Broadcasting System acquired animation studio Hanna-Barbera and the Ruby-Spears library from Great American Broadcasting, and years later, Turner Broadcasting System acquired Castle Rock Entertainment on December 22, 1993, and New Line Cinema on January 28, 1994. On October 10, 1996, Time Warner acquired Turner Broadcasting System, thus bringing Warner Bros.&#x27; pre-1950 library back home to the studio after 46 years. In addition, Warner Bros. owns pre-2010 libraries produced by Castle Rock Entertainment with few exceptions. 

In 2008, Time Warner integrated New Line Cinema into Warner Bros. Pictures.

== The Warner Bros. Archives ==
The University of Southern California Warner Bros. Archives is the largest single studio collection in the world. Donated in 1977 to USC&#x27;s School of Cinema-Television by Warner Communications, the WBA houses departmental records that detail Warner Bros. activities from the studio&#x27;s first major feature, &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot; (1918), to its sale to Seven Arts in 1968. It presents a complete view of the production process during the Golden Age of Hollywood. UA donated pre-1950 Warner Bros. nitrate negatives to the Library of Congress and post-1951 negatives to the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Most of the company&#x27;s legal files, scripts, and production materials were donated to the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research.
