<doc id="37969" wikidata="Q234646" url="?curid=37969" title="Ramen">
<text>is a Japanese noodle dish. It includes served in a broth. Common flavors are soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including , nori (dried seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes and is a part of Japanese Chinese cuisine. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the &quot;tonkotsu&quot; (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the &quot;miso&quot; ramen of Hokkaido.

The origins of ramen can be traced back to Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century. The word &quot;ramen&quot; is a Japanese borrowing of the Chinese word &quot;lāmiàn&quot; (拉麵), meaning &quot;pulled noodles&quot;, but is not derived from the northern Chinese dish of lamian. Instead, the dish evolved from southern Chinese noodle dishes from regions such as Guangzhou, reflecting the demographics of Chinese settlers in Yokohama. Ramen gained popularity in Japan, especially during food shortages following World War II. In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, further popularizing the dish.

Today, ramen is a cultural icon in Japan, with many regional varieties and a wide range of toppings. Examples include Sapporo&#x27;s rich miso ramen, Hakodate&#x27;s salt-flavored ramen, Kitakata&#x27;s thick, flat noodles in pork-and-niboshi broth, Tokyo-style ramen with soy-flavored chicken broth, Yokohama&#x27;s Iekei Ramen with soy flavored pork broth, Wakayama&#x27;s soy sauce and pork bone broth, and Hakata&#x27;s milky &quot;tonkotsu&quot; (pork bone) broth. Ramen is offered in various establishments and locations, with the best quality usually found in specialist ramen shops called &quot;rāmen&#x27;ya&quot; (ラーメン屋).

Ramen&#x27;s popularity has spread outside of Japan. In Korea, ramen is also known as its original name (라멘), having their own variation of the dish, ramyeon (라면). In China, ramen is called &quot;rìshì lāmiàn&quot; (日式拉面/日式拉麵 &quot;Japanese-style lamian&quot;). Ramen has also made its way into Western restaurant chains. Instant ramen was exported from Japan in 1971 and has since gained international recognition.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;ramen&quot; is a Japanese borrowing of the Mandarin Chinese &quot;lamian&quot; (, &#x27;pulled noodles&#x27;).

The word first appeared in Japan in Seiichi Yoshida&#x27;s &quot;How to Prepare Delicious and Economical Chinese Dishes&quot; (1928). In the book, Yoshida describes how to make &quot;ramen&quot; using flour and &quot;kansui&quot;, kneading it by hand, and stretching it with an illustration. He also states that &quot;ramen&quot; is better suited for soup or cold noodles than for baked noodles. In this case, however, &quot;ramen&quot; refers to Chinese noodles, not the dish. The first mention of &quot;ramen&quot; as a dish appears in Hatsuko Kuroda&#x27;s &quot;Enjoyable Home Cooking&quot; (1947).

Early ramen or ramen-like dishes went by different names, such as , or . For example, in 1903, in Yokohama Chinatown (then known as Nanjing Town), there was a .

Until the 1950s, ramen was most commonly called , but today or just () are more common, as the word (, meaning &#x27;China&#x27;) has acquired a pejorative connotation through its association with anti-Chinese racism and Japanese imperialism.

==History==
===Origin===
Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodle soups. It is first recorded to have appeared in Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century. Although ramen takes its name from &quot;lamian,&quot; it did not originate from the hand-pulled lamian noodles of northern China, since the noodles used in ramen are cut, not pulled. Rather, ramen is derived from southern Chinese noodle dishes such as &quot;char siu tangmian&quot; (roast pork noodle soup) from Guangdong, and &quot;rousi tangmian&quot; (sliced meat noodle soup) from Jiangnan. This is reflective of Yokohama Chinatown&#x27;s demographics, as most Chinese settlers there were Cantonese or Shanghainese.

Sōmen is another type of noodle of Chinese origin made from wheat flour, but in Japan it is distinguished from the noodles used in ramen. The noodles used for ramen today are called and are made with &quot;kansui&quot; (, alkaline salt water).

The official diary of Shōkoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, , mentions eating , noodles with &quot;kansui&quot;, in 1488. &quot;Jīngdàimiàn&quot; is the noodle of the Yuan dynasty. This is the earliest record of &quot;kansui&quot; noodles being eaten in Japan.

One theory says that ramen was introduced to Japan during the 1660s by the neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui, who served as an advisor to Tokugawa Mitsukuni after he became a refugee in Japan to escape Manchu rule. Mitsukuni became the first Japanese person to eat ramen. However, the noodles Mitsukuni ate were a mixture of starch made from lotus root and wheat flour, which is different from &quot;chūkamen&quot; with &quot;kansui&quot;.

According to historians, the more plausible theory is that ramen was introduced to Japan in the late 19th or early 20th centuries by Chinese immigrants living in Yokohama Chinatown. By 1884, lamian noodles had grown popular in Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, and Hakodate, however, this popularity was mostly concentrated among Chinese immigrants and was called &quot;Nankin soba (&#x27;Nanjing noodles&#x27;)&quot;. The Japanese government passed a law in 1899 allowing resident aliens to own businesses outside their designated settlements. This development, in addition to the increased labor demands led to a spread of Chinese immigrants throughout Japan. By 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Guangzhou and Shanghai offered a simple dish of noodles, a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen and gyōza dumplings to workers. By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a &quot;charumera&quot; (, from the Portuguese ) to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording. By the early Shōwa period, ramen had become a popular dish when eating out.

====First store====
According to ramen expert Hiroshi Osaki, the first specialized ramen shop was &quot;&quot; (), which opened in 1910 in Asakusa, Tokyo. The Japanese founder, Kan&#x27;ichi Ozaki (尾崎貫一), employed twelve Cantonese cooks from Yokohama&#x27;s Chinatown and served the ramen arranged for Japanese customers. Early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped with char siu. The store also served standard Chinese fare like wontons and shumai, and is sometimes regarded as the origin of Japanese-Chinese fusion dishes like &quot;chūkadon&quot; and &quot;tenshindon&quot;.

&quot;Rairaiken&quot;&#x27;s original store closed in 1976, but related stores with the same name currently exist in other places, and have connections to the first store.

In 1933, Fu Xinglei (傅興雷), one of the twelve original chefs, opened a second &quot;Rairaiken&quot; in Yūtenji, Meguro Ward, Tokyo.

In 1968, one of Kan&#x27;ichi Ozaki&#x27;s apprentices opened a store named &quot;Shinraiken&quot; (&quot;New Raiken&quot;) in Chiba Prefecture.

In 2020, Ozaki&#x27;s grandson and great-great-grandson re-opened the original &quot;Rairaiken&quot; as a store inside Shin-Yokohama Rāmen Museum.

===Popularization and modernization===

After Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the American military occupied the country from 1945 to 1952. In December 1945, Japan recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years, which caused food shortages as Japan had drastically reduced rice production during the war as production shifted to colonies in China and Formosa island. The US flooded the market with cheap wheat flour to deal with food shortages. From 1948 to 1951, bread consumption in Japan increased from 262,121 tons to 611,784 tons, but wheat also found its way into ramen, which most Japanese ate at black market food vendors to survive as the government food distribution system ran about 20 days behind schedule. Although the Americans maintained Japan&#x27;s wartime ban on outdoor food vending, flour was secretly diverted from commercial mills into the black markets, where nearly 90 percent of stalls were under the control of gangsters related to the &quot;yakuza&quot; who extorted vendors for protection money. Thousands of ramen vendors were arrested during the occupation.
In the same period, millions of Japanese troops returned from China and continental East Asia from their posts in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Some of them would have been familiar with wheat noodles. By 1950 wheat flour exchange controls were removed and restrictions on food vending loosened, which further boosted the number of ramen vendors: private companies even rented out &quot;yatai&quot; starter kits consisting of noodles, toppings, bowls, and chopsticks. Ramen provided a rare opportunity for small-scale postwar entrepreneurship. The Americans also aggressively advertised the nutritional benefits of wheat and animal protein. The combination of these factors caused wheat noodles to gain prominence in Japan&#x27;s rice-based culture. Gradually, ramen became associated with urban life.
In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-Japanese founder and chairman of Nissin Foods. Named the greatest Japanese invention of the 20th century in a Japanese poll, instant ramen allowed anyone to make an approximation of this dish simply by adding boiling water.

Beginning in the 1980s, ramen became a Japanese cultural icon and was studied around the world. At the same time, local varieties of ramen were hitting the national market and could even be ordered by their regional names. A ramen museum opened in Yokohama in 1994.

Today ramen is one of Japan&#x27;s most popular foods, with Tokyo alone containing around 5,000 ramen shops, and more than 24,000 ramen shops across Japan. &quot;Tsuta&quot;, a ramen restaurant in Tokyo&#x27;s Sugamo district, received a Michelin star in December 2015.

==Types==
A wide variety of ramen exists in Japan, with geographical and vendor-specific differences even in varieties that share the same name. Usually varieties of ramen are differentiated by the type of broth and tare used. There are five components to a bowl of ramen: tare, aroma oil, broth, noodles, and toppings.

===Noodles===

The type of noodles used in ramen are called , which are derived from traditional Chinese alkaline noodles known as (). Most are made from four basic ingredients: wheat flour, salt, water, and &quot;&quot;, derived from the Chinese (), a type of alkaline mineral water containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid. Ramen is not to be confused with different kinds of noodle such as soba, udon, or somen.

The is the distinguishing ingredient in , and originated in Inner Mongolia, where some lakes contain large amounts of these minerals and whose water is said to be perfect for making these noodles. Making noodles with lends them a yellowish hue as well as a firm texture. But since there is no natural or &quot;kansui&quot; in Japan, it was difficult to make or &quot;chūkamen&quot; before the Meiji Restoration (1868).

Ramen comes in various shapes and lengths. It may be thick, thin, or even ribbon-like, as well as straight or wrinkled.

Traditionally, ramen noodles were made by hand, but with growing popularity, many ramen restaurants prefer to use noodle-making machines to meet the increased demand and improve quality. Automatic ramen-making machines imitating manual production methods have been available since the mid-20th century produced by such Japanese manufacturers as Yamato MFG. and others.

===Soup===

Similar to Chinese soup bases, ramen soup is generally made from chicken or pork, though vegetable and fish stock is also used. This base stock is often combined with dashi stock components such as katsuobushi (skipjack tuna flakes), niboshi (dried baby sardines), saba bushi (mackerel flakes), shiitake, and kombu (kelp). Ramen stock is usually divided into two categories: chintan and paitan.
* Chintan (清湯), derived from the Chinese &quot;qīngtāng&quot; (清湯), is a clear stock, made by simmering ingredients and frequently skimming foam and scum off the top of the pot. Chintan stocks are the most common kind, and can be made from chicken, pork, vegetables and/or niboshi.
* (), derived from the Chinese &quot;baitang&quot; (), is a broth with an opaque white colored appearance and a creamy consistency that rivals milk, melted butter or gravy (depending on the shop). Paitan stock is made by boiling pork or chicken bones at a high heat for hours at a time, allowing the bones to emulsify into the soup. The most well-known and common paitan stock is (, &#x27;pork bone&#x27;; not to be confused with &quot;tonkatsu&quot;). Although is merely a kind of broth, some people consider &quot;tonkotsu&quot; ramen (specialty of Kyushu, its birthplace) a distinct flavor category. When chicken bones are used to make a paitan stock, the resulting soup is called &quot;tori paitan&quot; (鶏白湯).

===Tare===


Tare sauce is a sauce that is used to flavor the broth. The main purpose of tare is to provide salt to the broth, but tare also usually adds other flavors, such as umami. There are three main kinds of tare.
* (, &#x27;salt&#x27;) ramen is the oldest of the four types. This tare is made from cooking alcohols like mirin and sake, umami ingredients like kombu, niboshi and MSG, and salt. Occasionally pork bones are also used, but they are not boiled as long as they are for ramen, so the soup remains light and clear. In shio ramen, &quot;chāshū&quot; is sometimes swapped for lean chicken meatballs, and pickled plums and &quot;kamaboko&quot; (a slice of processed fish roll sometimes served as a frilly white circle with a pink or red spiral called &quot;narutomaki&quot;) are popular toppings as well. Noodle texture and thickness varies among ramen, but they are usually straight rather than curly. &quot;Hakodate ramen&quot; is a well-known version of ramen in Japan.
* (, &#x27;soy sauce&#x27;) tare is similar to shio tare, but with the addition of soy sauce, which boosts the salty and umami flavor even further. ramen usually has curly noodles rather than straight ones, although this is not always the case. It is often adorned with marinated bamboo shoots or &quot;menma&quot;, scallions, (&#x27;carrot&#x27;), (&#x27;fish cakes&#x27;), (&#x27;seaweed&#x27;), boiled eggs, bean sprouts or black pepper; occasionally the soup will also contain chili oil or Chinese spices, and some shops serve sliced beef instead of the usual &quot;chāshū&quot;.
* () ramen reached national prominence around 1965. This uniquely Japanese ramen, which was developed in Sapporo Hokkaido, features a broth that combines copious miso and is blended with oily chicken or fish broth – and sometimes with or lard – to create a thick, nutty, slightly sweet and very hearty soup. ramen broth tends to have a robust, tangy flavor, so it stands up to a variety of flavorful toppings: spicy bean paste or &quot;tōbanjan&quot; (), butter and corn, leeks, onions, bean sprouts, ground pork, cabbage, sesame seeds, white pepper, chilli and chopped garlic are common. The noodles are typically thick, curly, and slightly chewy.

===Toppings===

After basic preparation, ramen can be adorned with any number of toppings, including but not limited to:
* &quot;Chāshū&quot; (sliced barbecued or braised pork)
* &quot;Negi&quot; (green onion)
* (Pickled and seasoned mustard leaves)
* Seasoned (usually salted) boiled egg (soy egg, or &quot;ajitama&quot;)

* &quot;Kakuni&quot; (braised pork cubes or squares)
* (wood ear mushroom)
* Nori (dried seaweed)
* &quot;Kamaboko&quot; (formed fish paste, often in a pink and white spiral called &quot;narutomaki&quot;)
* Squid
* &quot;Umeboshi&quot; (pickled plum)
* Corn
* Butter
* Wakame (a type of seaweed)
* Olive oil
* Sesame oil
* &quot;Mayu&quot; (black garlic oil)
* Other types of vegetables

===Preference===
Seasonings commonly added to ramen are white pepper, black pepper, butter, chili pepper, sesame seeds, and crushed garlic. Soup recipes and methods of preparation tend to be closely guarded secrets.

Most ramen restaurants offer a system known as (), where customers who have finished their noodles can request a &quot;refill&quot; (for a few hundred yen more) to be put into their remaining soup.

==Regional variations==
While standard versions of ramen are available throughout Japan since the Taishō period, the last few decades have shown a proliferation of regional variations, commonly referred to as &quot;ramen&quot; ( &quot;regional ramen&quot;). Some of these which have gone on to national prominence are:

* Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido, is especially famous for its ramen. Most people in Japan associate Sapporo with its rich ramen, which was invented there and which is ideal for Hokkaido&#x27;s harsh, snowy winters. Sapporo ramen is typically topped with sweetcorn, butter, bean sprouts, finely chopped pork, and garlic, and sometimes local seafood such as scallop, squid, and crab. Hakodate, another city of Hokkaido, is famous for its salt-flavored ramen, while Asahikawa in the north of the island offers a soy sauce-flavored variation. In Muroran, many ramen restaurants offer Muroran curry ramen.
* Kitakata ramen is known for its rather thick, flat, curly noodles served in a pork-and-&quot;niboshi&quot; broth. The area within the former city limits has the highest per-capita number of ramen establishments. Ramen has such prominence in the region that locally, the word usually refers to ramen, and not to actual soba which is referred to as (&#x27;Japanese soba&#x27;).
* Tokyo-style ramen consists of slightly thin, curly noodles served in a soy-flavored chicken broth. The Tokyo-style broth typically has a touch of &quot;dashi&quot;, as old ramen establishments in Tokyo often originate from soba eateries. Standard toppings are chopped scallion, menma, sliced pork, kamaboko, egg, nori, and spinach. Ikebukuro, Ogikubo and Ebisu are three areas in Tokyo known for their ramen.
* Yokohama ramen specialty is called Ie-kei (). It consists of thick, straight noodles served in a soy flavored pork broth similar to , sometimes referred to as, . The standard toppings are roasted pork (chāshū), boiled spinach, sheets of nori, often with shredded Welsh onion () and a soft- or hard-boiled egg. It is traditional for customers to customize the softness of the noodles, the richness of the broth and the amount of oil they want.
* Wakayama ramen in the Kansai region has a broth made from soy sauce and pork bones.
* Hakata ramen originates from Hakata district of Fukuoka city in Kyushu. It has a rich, milky, pork-bone broth and rather thin, non-curly and resilient noodles. Often, distinctive toppings such as crushed garlic, &quot;beni shōga&quot; (pickled ginger), sesame seeds, and spicy pickled mustard greens () are left on tables for customers to serve themselves. Ramen stalls in Hakata and Tenjin are well known within Japan. Recent trends have made Hakataramen one of the most popular types in Japan, and several chain restaurants specializing in Hakata ramen can be found all over the country.
*Tofu ramen is a specialty of Iwatsuki ward in Saitama City.
* Nabeyaki ramen is a specialty of Susaki City, as well as other cities in western Kōchi Prefecture. Nabeyaki ramen is made with a chicken based broth, thin noodles and a soy tare, all served boiling hot in an enamelled pot. Toppings vary, but mainstays include a raw egg that poaches in the bowl, sliced spring onions and chikuwa fish cakes. 
* Nagoya ramen specialties include &quot;Taiwan ramen&quot;, which despite its name originated in Nagoya and features a very spicy broth. It became famous in the 1980s during a fad for super hot food. It bears some resemblance to danzai noodles but has both a spicy broth and spicy minced meat resulting in an extremely spicy dish.
==Related dishes==
There are many related, Chinese-influenced noodle dishes in Japan. The following are often served alongside ramen in ramen establishments. They do not include noodle dishes considered traditionally Japanese, such as soba or udon, which are almost never served in the same establishments as ramen.
* Nagasaki &quot;champon&quot;. The noodles are thicker than ramen but thinner than udon. is topped with a variety of ingredients, mostly seafood, stir-fried and dressed in a starchy sauce. The stir-fried ingredients are poured directly over the cooked noodles, with the sauce acting as a soup.

==Restaurants in Japan==

Ramen is offered in various types of restaurants and locations including ramen shops, &quot;izakaya&quot; drinking establishments, lunch cafeterias, karaoke halls, and amusement parks. Many ramen restaurants only have a counter and a chef. In these shops, the meals are paid for in advance at a ticket machine to streamline the process.

However, the best quality ramen is usually only available in specialist restaurants. Some restaurants also provide &quot;Halal&quot; ramen (using chicken) in Osaka and Kyoto. As restaurants offer mainly ramen dishes, they tend to lack variety in the menu. Besides ramen, some of the dishes generally available in a restaurant include other dishes from Japanese Chinese cuisine such as fried rice (called or ), &quot;gyoza&quot; (Chinese dumplings), and beer. interiors are often filled with Chinese-inspired decorations.

From January 2020 to September 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, many ramen restaurants were temporarily closed, with 34 chains filing for bankruptcy by September 2020. Ramen restaurants are typically narrow and seat customers closely, making social distancing difficult.

==Outside Japan==
Ramen became popular in China where it is known as (, ). Restaurant chains serve ramen alongside Japanese dishes, such as tempura and yakitori. In Japan, these dishes are not traditionally served with ramen, but gyoza, &quot;kara-age&quot;, and others from Japanese Chinese cuisine.

In Korea, there is a variation of ramen called &quot;ramyeon&quot; (), made much spicier than ramen. There are different varieties, such as kimchi-flavored . While usually served with egg or vegetables such as carrots and scallions, some restaurants serve variations of containing additional ingredients such as dumplings, &quot;tteok&quot;, or cheese as toppings. Famous ramyeon brands include Shin Ramyeon and Buldak Ramyeon.

Outside of Asia, particularly in areas with a large demand for Asian cuisine, there are restaurants specializing in Japanese-style foods such as ramen noodles. For example, Wagamama, a UK-based restaurant chain serving pan-Asian food, serves a ramen noodle soup and in the United States and Canada, Jinya Ramen Bar serves ramen.

==Instant ramen==
Instant ramen noodles were exported from Japan by Nissin Foods starting in 1971, bearing the name &quot;Oodles of Noodles&quot;. One year later, it was re-branded &quot;Nissin Cup Noodles&quot;, packaged in a foam food container (It is referred to as Cup Ramen in Japan), and subsequently saw a growth in international sales. Over time, the term &quot;ramen&quot; became used in North America to refer to other instant noodles.

While some research has claimed that consuming instant ramen two or more times a week increases the likelihood of developing heart disease and other conditions, including diabetes and stroke, especially in women, those claims have not been reproduced and no study has isolated instant ramen consumption as an aggravating factor. However, instant ramen noodles, known to have a serving of 43 g, consist of very high sodium. At least 1,760 mg of sodium are found in one packet alone. It consists of 385 kilocalories, 55.7 g of carbohydrates, 14.5 g of total fat, 6.5 g of saturated fat, 7.9 g of protein, and 0.6 mg of thiamine.

<doc id="37973" wikidata="Q9317" url="?curid=37973" title="John Maynard Keynes">
<text>John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes ( ; 5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946), was an English economist and philosopher whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. Originally trained in mathematics, he built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles. One of the most influential economists of the 20th century, he produced writings that are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, and its various offshoots. His ideas, reformulated as New Keynesianism, are fundamental to mainstream macroeconomics. He is known as the &quot;father of macroeconomics&quot;.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He argued that aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment, and since wages and labour costs are rigid downwards the economy will not automatically rebound to full employment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. After the 1929 crisis, Keynes also turned away from a fundamental pillar of neoclassical economics: free trade. He criticized Ricardian comparative advantage theory (the foundation of free trade), considering the theory&#x27;s initial assumptions unrealistic, and became definitively protectionist. He detailed these ideas in his magnum opus, &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, published in early 1936. By the late 1930s, leading Western economies had begun adopting Keynes&#x27;s policy recommendations. Almost all capitalist governments had done so by the end of the two decades following Keynes&#x27;s death in 1946. As a leader of the British delegation, Keynes participated in the design of the international economic institutions established after the end of World War II but was overruled by the American delegation on several aspects.

Keynes&#x27;s influence started to wane in the 1970s, partly as a result of the stagflation that plagued the British and American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists, who disputed the ability of government to favourably regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy. The 2007–2008 financial crisis sparked the 2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence. Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the 2007–2008 financial crisis by President Barack Obama of the United States, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.

When &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Keynes among its Most Important People of the Century in 1999, it reported that &quot;his radical idea that governments should spend money they don&#x27;t have may have saved capitalism&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; has described Keynes as &quot;Britain&#x27;s most famous 20th-century economist&quot;. In addition to being an economist, Keynes was also a civil servant, a director of the Bank of England, and a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals.

==Early life and education==

John Maynard Keynes was born in Cambridge, England, in June 1883 to an upper-middle-class family. His father, John Neville Keynes, was an economist and a lecturer in moral sciences at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Florence Ada Keynes, a local social reformer. Keynes was the firstborn and was followed by two more childrenMargaret Neville Keynes in 1885 and Geoffrey Keynes in 1887. Geoffrey became a surgeon and Margaret married the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Archibald Hill.

According to the reminiscences of his brother Geoffrey, their parents were loving and attentive. They attended a Congregational Church and remained in the same house throughout their lives, where the children were always welcome to return. Keynes received considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of Great Depression in 1929. Keynes&#x27;s mother made her children&#x27;s interests her own, and according to Skidelsky, &quot;because she could grow up with her children, they never outgrew home&quot;.

In January 1889, at the age of five and a half, Keynes started at the kindergarten of the Perse School for Girls for five mornings a week. He quickly showed a talent for arithmetic, but his health was poor leading to several long absences. He was tutored at home by a governess, Beatrice Mackintosh, and his mother. In January 1892, at eight and a half, he started as a day pupil at St Faith&#x27;s preparatory school. By 1894, Keynes was top of his class and excelling at mathematics. In 1896, St Faith&#x27;s headmaster, Ralph Goodchild, wrote that Keynes was &quot;head and shoulders above all the other boys in the school&quot; and was confident that Keynes could get a scholarship to Eton.

In 1897, Keynes won a King&#x27;s Scholarship to Eton College, where he displayed talent in a wide range of subjects, particularly mathematics, classics and history: in 1901, he was awarded the Tomline Prize for mathematics. At Eton, Keynes experienced the first &quot;love of his life&quot; in Dan Macmillan, older brother of the future Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. Despite his middle-class background, Keynes mixed easily with upper-class pupils.

In 1902, Keynes left Eton for King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, after receiving a scholarship for this also, to read mathematics. Alfred Marshall begged Keynes to become an economist, although Keynes&#x27;s own inclinations drew him towards philosophy, especially the ethical system of G. E. Moore. Keynes was elected to the University Pitt Club and was an active member of the semi-secretive Cambridge Apostles society, a debating club largely reserved for the brightest students. Like many members, Keynes retained a bond to the club after graduating and continued to attend occasional meetings throughout his life. Before leaving Cambridge, Keynes became the president of the Cambridge Union Society and Cambridge University Liberal Club. He was said to be an atheist.

In May 1904, he received a first-class BA in mathematics. Aside from a few months spent on holidays with family and friends, Keynes continued to involve himself with the university over the next two years. He took part in debates, further studied philosophy and attended economics lectures informally as a graduate student for one term, which constituted his only formal education in the subject. He took civil service exams in 1906.

The economist Harry Johnson wrote that the optimism imparted by Keynes&#x27;s early life is a key to understanding his later thinking.
Keynes was always confident he could find a solution to whatever problem he turned his attention to and retained a lasting faith in the ability of government officials to do good.
Keynes&#x27;s optimism was also cultural, in two senses: he was of the last generation raised by an empire still at the height of its power and was also of the last generation who felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to Skidelsky, the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation to each other and life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.

==Career==
In October 1906 Keynes began his Civil Service career as a clerk in the India Office. He enjoyed his work at first, but by 1908 had become bored and resigned his position to return to Cambridge and work on probability theory, through a lectureship in economics at first funded personally by economists Alfred Marshall and Arthur Pigou; he became a fellow of King&#x27;s College in 1909.

By 1909 Keynes had also published his first professional economics article in &quot;The Economic Journal&quot;, about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India. He founded the Political Economy Club, a weekly discussion group. Keynes&#x27;s earnings rose further as he began to take on pupils for private tuition.

In 1911 Keynes was made the editor of &quot;The Economic Journal&quot;. By 1913 he had published his first book, &quot;Indian Currency and Finance&quot;. He was then appointed to the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Financethe same topic as his bookwhere Keynes showed considerable talent at applying economic theory to practical problems. His written work was published under the name &quot;J M Keynes&quot;, though to his family and friends he was known as Maynard. (His father, John Neville Keynes, was also always known by his middle name).

===First World War===

The British Government called on Keynes&#x27;s expertise during the First World War. While he did not formally rejoin the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government&#x27;s request a few days before hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie paymentsthe gold equivalent of banknotesbut with Keynes&#x27;s help, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded that this would be a bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was necessary.

In January 1915 Keynes took up an official government position at the Treasury. Among his responsibilities were the design of terms of credit between Britain and its continental allies during the war and the acquisition of scarce currencies. According to economist Robert Lekachman, Keynes&#x27;s &quot;nerve and mastery became legendary&quot; because of his performance of these duties, as in the case where he managed to assemble a supply of Spanish pesetas.

The secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government. But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive.

On the introduction of military conscription in 1916, he applied for exemption as a conscientious objector, which was effectively granted conditional upon continuing his government work.

In the 1917 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Keynes was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath for his wartime work, and his success led to the appointment that had a huge effect on Keynes&#x27;s life and career; Keynes was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 Versailles peace conference. He was also appointed Officer of the Belgian Order of Leopold.

===Versailles peace conference===


Keynes&#x27;s experience at Versailles was influential in shaping his future outlook, yet it was not a successful one. Keynes&#x27;s main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany&#x27;s compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation&#x27;s ability to pay and sharply limit its ability to buy exports from other countriesthus hurting not just Germany&#x27;s economy but that of the wider world.

Unfortunately for Keynes, conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the 1918 coupon election were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high-level talks concerning reparations. Their place was taken by the Heavenly Twinsthe judge Lord Sumner and the banker Lord Cunliffe, whose nickname derived from the &quot;astronomically&quot; high war compensation they wanted to demand from Germany. Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes.

The three principal players at the Paris conferences were Britain&#x27;s Lloyd George, France&#x27;s Georges Clemenceau and America&#x27;s President Woodrow Wilson.
It was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes&#x27;s view but while campaigning had found his speeches were well received by the public only if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments.

Lloyd George did, however, win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though not as high as those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain.

Wilson initially favoured relatively lenient treatment of Germanyhe feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes&#x27;s dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.

Towards the end of the conference, Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole. It involved the radical writing down of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time thrown over two-thirds of the cost of European reconstruction on the United States.

Lloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds and led to his resignation from the Treasury.

In June 1919 he turned down an offer to become chairman of the British Bank of Northern Commerce, a job that promised a salary of £2,000 in return for a morning per week of work.

Keynes&#x27;s analysis on the predicted damaging effects of the treaty appeared in the highly influential book, &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot;, published in 1919. This work has been described as Keynes&#x27;s best book, where he was able to bring all his gifts to bearhis passion as well as his skill as an economist. In addition to economic analysis, the book contained appeals to the reader&#x27;s sense of compassion:

Also present was striking imagery such as &quot;year by year Germany must be kept impoverished and her children starved and crippled&quot; along with bold predictions which were later justified by events:

Keynes&#x27;s followers assert that his predictions of disaster were borne out when the German economy suffered the hyperinflation of 1923, and again by the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the outbreak of the Second World War. However, historian Ruth Henig claims that &quot;most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out&quot;.

Only a small fraction of reparations was ever paid. In fact, historian Stephen A. Schuker demonstrates in &quot;American &#x27;Reparations&#x27; to Germany, 1919–33&quot;, that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German out payments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan.

Schuker also shows that, in the years after Versailles, Keynes became an informal reparations adviser to the German government, wrote one of the major German reparation notes, and supported hyperinflation on political grounds. Nevertheless, &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot; gained Keynes international fame, even though it also caused him to be regarded as anti-establishmentit was not until after the outbreak of the Second World War that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job. However, Keynes was still able to influence government policy-making through his network of contacts, his published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant.

===In the 1920s===

Keynes had completed his &quot;A Treatise on Probability&quot; before the war but published it in 1921. The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of probability theory, championing the important view that &quot;probabilities&quot; were no more or less than truth values intermediate between simple truth and falsity. Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic interval approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, &quot;c&quot;, in chapter 26. In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor Alfred Marshall which Joseph Schumpeter called &quot;the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read&quot;. Mary Paley Marshall was &quot;entranced&quot; by the memorial, while Lytton Strachey rated it as one of Keynes&#x27;s &quot;best works&quot;.

In 1922 Keynes continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with &quot;A Revision of the Treaty&quot;. He attacked the post-World War I deflation policies with &quot;A Tract on Monetary Reform&quot; in 1923a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of sterling to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works. During the 1920s Keynes&#x27;s pro-stimulus views had only limited effect on policymakers and mainstream academic opinionaccording to Hyman Minsky one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was &quot;muddled&quot;. The &quot;Tract&quot; had also called for an end to the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the gold standard, as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor Winston Churchill to re-establish it, which had a depressing effect on British industry. Keynes responded by writing &quot;The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill&quot; and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931.

===During the Great Depression===

Keynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. The work, &quot;Treatise on Money&quot;, was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being investedwhich can happen if interest rates are too highthen unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial indices for representing an accurateor indeed meaningfulindication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular, he criticised the justification of Britain&#x27;s return to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the wholesale price index. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and labour.

Keynes was deeply critical of the British government&#x27;s austerity measures during the Great Depression. He believed that budget deficits during recessions were a good thing and a natural product of an economic slump. He wrote, &quot;For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature&#x27;s remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as the present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill.&quot;

At the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes published &quot;The Means to Prosperity&quot;, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. &quot;The Means to Prosperity&quot; contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.

Keynesian-like policies were adopted by Sweden and Germany, but Sweden was seen as too small to command much attention, and Keynes was deliberately silent about the successful efforts of Germany as he was dismayed by its imperialist ambitions and its treatment of Jews. Apart from Great Britain, Keynes&#x27;s attention was primarily focused on the United States. In 1931, he received considerable support for his views on counter-cyclical public spending in Chicago, then America&#x27;s foremost center for economic views alternative to the mainstream. However, orthodox economic opinion remained generally hostile regarding fiscal intervention to mitigate the depression, until just before the outbreak of war. In late 1933 Keynes was persuaded by Felix Frankfurter to address President Roosevelt directly, which he did by letters and face-to-face in 1934, after which the two men spoke highly of each other. However, according to Skidelsky, the consensus is that Keynes&#x27;s efforts began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy only after 1939.

Keynes&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; was published in 1936.It was researched and indexed by one of Keynes&#x27;s favourite students, and later economist, David Bensusan-Butt. The work served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. Although Keynes stated in his preface that his General Theory was only secondarily concerned with the &quot;applications of this theory to practice&quot;, the circumstances of its publication were such that his suggestions shaped the course of the 1930s. In addition, Keynes introduced the world to a new interpretation of taxation: since the legal tender is now defined by the state, inflation becomes &quot;taxation by currency depreciation&quot;. This hidden tax meant a) that the standard of value should be governed by deliberate decision; and (b) that it was possible to maintain a middle course between deflation and inflation. This novel interpretation was inspired by the desperate search for control over the economy which permeated the academic world after the Depression. The &quot;General Theory&quot; challenged the earlier neoclassical economic paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish full employment equilibrium. In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou. Keynes believed the classical theory was a &quot;special case&quot; that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his theory being the general one. Classical economists had believed in Say&#x27;s law, which, simply put, states that &quot;supply creates its demand&quot;, and that in a free-market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs.

An innovation from Keynes was the concept of price stickinessthe recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue that it is rational for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of &quot;aggregate demand&quot; and &quot;aggregate supply&quot; may lead to stable unemployment equilibriaand in those cases, it is on the state, not the market, that economies must depend for their salvation. In contrast, Keynes argued that demand is what creates supply and not the other way around. He questioned Say&#x27;s Law by asking what would happen if the money that is being given to individuals is not finding its way back into the economy and is saved instead. He suggested the result would be a recession. To tackle the fear of a recession Say&#x27;s Law suggests government intervention. This government intervention can be used to prevent any further increase in savings in the form of a decreased interest rate. Decreasing the interest rate will encourage people to start spending and investing again, or so it is stated by Say&#x27;s Law. The reason behind this is that when there is little investing, savings start to accumulate and reach a stopping point in the flow of money. During the normal economic activity, it would be justified to have savings because they can be given out as loans but in this case, there is little demand for them, so they are doing no good for the economy. The supply of savings then exceeds the demand for loans and the result is lower prices or lower interest rates. Thus, the idea is that the money that was once saved is now re-invested or spent, assuming lower interest rates appeal to consumers. To Keynes, however, this was not always the case, and it couldn&#x27;t be assumed that lower interest rates would automatically encourage investment and spending again since there is no proven link between the two.

The &quot;General Theory&quot; argues that demand, not supply, is the key variable governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, is defined by the sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can enhance employment and total income &quot;only&quot; by &quot;first&quot; increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low-employment equilibrium. The demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.
The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. &quot;Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth,&quot; he wrote in 1928. &quot;With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them.&quot;

The &quot;General Theory&quot; is often viewed as the foundation of modern macroeconomics. Few senior American economists agreed with Keynes through most of the 1930s.
Yet his ideas were soon to achieve widespread acceptance, with eminent American professors such as Alvin Hansen agreeing with the &quot;General Theory&quot; before the outbreak of World War II.

Keynes himself had only limited participation in the theoretical debates that followed the publication of the &quot;General Theory&quot; as he suffered a heart attack in 1937, requiring him to take long periods of rest. Among others, Hyman Minsky and Post-Keynesian economists have argued that as a result, Keynes&#x27;s ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the IS–LM model (which, they argue, distort Keynes&#x27;s ideas). Keynes began to recover in 1939, but for the rest of his life his professional energies were directed largely towards the practical side of economics: the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at the Bretton Woods Conference.

In the &quot;General Theory&quot; and later, Keynes responded to the socialists who argued, especially during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against one another, and a high degree of freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later to the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.

Although Keynes has been widely criticisedespecially by members of the Chicago school of economicsfor advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programmes of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances.

===Second World War===

During the Second World War, Keynes argued in &quot;How to Pay for the War&quot;, published in 1940, that the war effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than deficit spending, to avoid inflation. Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channelling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post-war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings. In September 1941 he was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the Bank of England, and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April. In June 1942, Keynes was rewarded for his service with a hereditary peerage in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours. On 7 July his title was gazetted as &quot;Baron Keynes, of Tilton, in the County of Sussex&quot; and he took his seat in the House of Lords on the Liberal Party benches.

As the Allied victory began to look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, as leader of the British delegation and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor and new global institutionsa world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions as managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA&#x27;s greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proven correct by events.

The two new institutions, later known as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), were founded as a compromise that primarily reflected the American vision. There would be no incentives for states to avoid a large trade surplus; instead, the burden for correcting a trade imbalance would continue to fall only on the deficit countries, which Keynes had argued were least able to address the problem without inflicting economic hardship on their populations. Yet, Keynes was still pleased when accepting the final agreement, saying that if the institutions stayed true to their founding principles, &quot;the brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase.&quot;

===Postwar===
After the war, Keynes continued to represent the United Kingdom in international negotiations despite his deteriorating health. He succeeded in obtaining preferential terms from the United States for new and outstanding debts to facilitate the rebuilding of the British economy.

Just before his death in 1946, Keynes told Henry Clay, a professor of social economics and advisor to the Bank of England, of his hopes that Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;invisible hand&quot; could help Britain out of the economic hole it was in: &quot;I find myself more and more relying for a solution of our problems on the invisible hand which I tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago.&quot;

==Economic viewpoint==
===Views on free trade and protectionism===
====Turning point of the Great Depression====
According to Keynesian theory, trade deficits are harmful.The countries that import more than they export weaken their economies. When the trade deficit increases, unemployment rises and gross domestic product (GDP) slows down. Furthermore, surplus countries exert a &quot;negative externality&quot; on their trading partners. They get richer at the expense of others and destroy the output of their trading partners. John Maynard Keynes believed that the products of surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalances.

At the beginning of his career, Keynes was an economist close to Alfred Marshall, deeply convinced of the benefits of free trade. From the crisis of 1929 onwards, noting the commitment of the British authorities to defend the gold parity of the pound sterling and the rigidity of nominal wages, he gradually adhered to protectionist measures.

On 5 November 1929, when heard by the Macmillan Committee to bring the British economy out of the crisis, Keynes indicated that the introduction of tariffs on imports would help to rebalance the trade balance. The committee&#x27;s report states in a section entitled &quot;import control and export aid&quot;, that in an economy where there is not full employment, the introduction of tariffs can improve production and employment. Thus, the reduction of the trade deficit favours the country&#x27;s growth.

In January 1930, in the Economic Advisory Council, Keynes proposed the introduction of a system of protection to reduce imports. In the autumn of 1930, he proposed a uniform tariff of 10% on all imports and subsidies of the same rate for all exports. In the &quot;Treatise on Money&quot;, published in the autumn of 1930, he took up the idea of tariffs or other trade restrictions with the aim of reducing the volume of imports and rebalancing the balance of trade.

On 7 March 1931, in the &quot;New Statesman and Nation&quot;, he wrote an article entitled &quot;Proposal for a Tariff Revenue&quot;. He pointed out that the reduction in wages led to a reduction in national demand which constrained markets. Instead, he proposed the idea of an expansionary policy combined with a tariff system to neutralise the effects on the balance of trade. The application of customs tariffs seemed to him &quot;unavoidable, whoever the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be&quot;. Thus, for Keynes, an economic recovery policy is only fully effective if the trade deficit is eliminated. He proposed a 15% tax on manufactured and semi-manufactured goods and 5% on certain foodstuffs and raw materials, with others needed for exports exempted (wool, cotton).

In 1932, in an article entitled &quot;The Pro- and Anti-Tariffs&quot;, published in &quot;The Listener&quot;, he envisaged the protection of farmers and certain sectors such as the automobile and iron and steel industries, considering them indispensable to Britain.

====Critique of the theory of comparative advantage====
In the post-crisis situation of 1929, Keynes judged the assumptions of the free trade model unrealistic. He criticised, for example, the neoclassical assumption of wage adjustment.

As early as 1930, in a note to the Economic Advisory Council, he doubted the intensity of the gain from specialisation in the case of manufactured goods. While participating in the MacMillan Committee, he admitted that he no longer &quot;believed in a very high degree of national specialisation&quot; and refused to &quot;abandon any industry which is unable, for the moment, to survive&quot;. He also criticised the static dimension of the theory of comparative advantage, which, in his view, by fixing comparative advantages definitively, led in practice to a waste of national resources.

In the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; of 13 March 1931, he called the assumption of perfect sectoral labour mobility &quot;nonsense&quot; since it states that a person made unemployed contributes to a reduction in the wage rate until he finds a job. But for Keynes, this change of job may involve costs (job search, training) and is not always possible. Generally speaking, for Keynes, the assumptions of full employment and automatic return to equilibrium discredit the theory of comparative advantage.

In July 1933, he published an article in the &quot;New Statesman and Nation&quot; entitled &quot;National Self-Sufficiency&quot;, in which he criticised the argument of the specialisation of economies, which is the basis of free trade. He thus proposed the search for a certain degree of self-sufficiency. Instead of the specialisation of economies advocated by the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage, he prefers the maintenance of a diversity of activities for nations. In it he refutes the principle of peacemaking trade. His vision of trade became that of a system where foreign capitalists compete for new markets. He defends the idea of producing on national soil when possible and reasonable and expresses sympathy for the advocates of protectionism.
He notes in &quot;National Self-Sufficiency&quot;:
He also writes in &quot;National Self-Sufficiency&quot;:

Later, Keynes had a written correspondence with James Meade centred on the issue of import restrictions. Keynes and Meade discussed the best choice between quota and tariff. In March 1944 Keynes began a discussion with Marcus Fleming after the latter had written an article entitled &quot;Quotas versus depreciation&quot;. On this occasion, we see that he has definitely taken a protectionist stance after the Great Depression. He considered that quotas could be more effective than currency depreciation in dealing with external imbalances. Thus, for Keynes, currency depreciation was no longer sufficient and protectionist measures became necessary to avoid trade deficits. To avoid the return of crises due to a self-regulating economic system, it seemed essential to him to regulate trade and stop free trade (deregulation of foreign trade).

===Views on trade imbalances===
Keynes was the principal author of a proposalthe so-called Keynes Planfor an International Clearing Union. The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by &quot;creating&quot; additional &quot;international money&quot;, and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because &quot;American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships&quot;.

The new system is not founded on free-trade (liberalisation of foreign trade) but rather on the regulation of international trade, to eliminate trade imbalances: the nations with a surplus would have an incentive to reduce it, and in doing so they would automatically clear other nations deficits. He proposed a global bank that would issue its currencythe bancorwhich was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country&#x27;s trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demandcountries running surpluses exert a &quot;negative externality&quot; on trading partners, and pose, far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity.

In his 1933 &quot;Yale Review&quot; article &quot;National Self-Sufficiency&quot;, he already highlighted the problems created by free trade. His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, then editor of &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.&quot;

These ideas were informed by events prior to the Great Depression whenin the opinion of Keynes and othersinternational lending, primarily by the US, exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.

Influenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, &quot;An Outline of Money&quot;, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the &quot;problem of balance&quot;. However, in more recent years, since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concernsand particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluseshave largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes&#x27;s insights have slipped from view. They received some attention again after the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

===Views on inflation===
Keynes has been characterised as being indifferent or even positive about mild inflation. He had expressed a preference for inflation over deflation, saying that if one has to choose between the two evils, it is &quot;better to disappoint the rentier&quot; than to inflict pain on working-class families. Keynes was also aware of the dangers of inflation. In &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot;, he wrote: 

==Influence and legacy==
===Keynesian ascendancy 1939–79===
From the end of the Great Depression to the mid-1970s, Keynes provided the main inspiration for economic policymakers in Europe, America and much of the rest of the world. While economists and policymakers had become increasingly won over to Keynes&#x27;s way of thinking in the mid and late 1930s, it was only after the outbreak of World War II that governments started to borrow money for spending on a scale sufficient to eliminate unemployment. According to the economist John Kenneth Galbraith (then a US government official charged with controlling inflation), in the rebound of the economy from wartime spending, &quot;one could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas&quot;.

The Keynesian Revolution was associated with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee, whose government&#x27;s economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes&#x27;s ideas.

====Neo-Keynesian economics====

In the late 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani and Paul Samuelson) attempted to interpret and formalise Keynes&#x27;s writings in terms of formal mathematical models. In what had become known as the neoclassical synthesis, they combined Keynesian analysis with neoclassical economics to produce neo-Keynesian economics, which came to dominate mainstream macroeconomic thought for the next 40 years.

By the 1950s, Keynesian policies were adopted by almost the entire developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes&#x27;s views on the economy had become mainstream in the world&#x27;s universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes&#x27;s influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.

In late 1965 &quot;Time&quot; magazine ran a cover article with a title comment from Milton Friedman (later echoed by US President Richard Nixon), &quot;We are all Keynesians now&quot;. The article described the exceptionally favourable economic conditions then prevailing and reported that &quot;Washington&#x27;s economic managers scaled these heights by their adherence to Keynes&#x27;s central theme: the modern capitalist economy does not automatically work at top efficiency, but can be raised to that level by the intervention and influence of the government.&quot; The article also states that Keynes was one of the three most important economists who ever lived, and that his &quot;General Theory&quot; was more influential than the &quot;magna opera&quot; of other famous economists, such as Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;.

==== Multiplier ====
The concept of the multiplier was first developed by R. F. Kahn in his article &quot;The relation of home investment to unemployment&quot; in &quot;The Economic Journal&quot; of June 1931. The Kahn multiplier was the employment multiplier; Keynes took the idea from Kahn and formulated the investment multiplier.

===Keynesian economics out of favour 1979–2007===

Keynesian economics were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but forces had begun to gather against Keynes&#x27;s ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then-young Milton Friedman. Initially, the society had little impact on the wider worldaccording to Hayek it was as if Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.
Friedman, however, began to emerge as a formidable critic of Keynesian economics from the mid-1950s, and especially after his 1963 publication of &quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot;.

On the practical side of economic life, &quot;big government&quot; had appeared to be firmly entrenched in the 1950s, but the balance began to shift towards the power of private interests in the 1960s. Keynes had written against the folly of allowing &quot;decadent and selfish&quot; speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I. For two decades after World War II public opinion was strongly against private speculators, the disparaging label &quot;Gnomes of Zurich&quot; being typical of how they were described during this period. International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods. According to the journalists Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, 1968 was the pivotal year when power shifted in favour of private agents such as currency speculators. As the key 1968 event Elliott and Atkinson picked out America&#x27;s suspension of the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments, which they identified as the beginning of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.

Criticisms of Keynes&#x27;s ideas had begun to gain significant acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then able to make a credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his &quot;General Theory&quot;. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes&#x27;s limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968, Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.
Friedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at oncea phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek&#x27;s Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.

Keynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economicsby 1979 they had been displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy. However, many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy-making.
Not all academics accepted the criticism against KeynesMinsky has argued that Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, and that it was unfortunate that this branch of economics had even continued to be called &quot;Keynesian&quot;. Writing in &quot;The American Prospect&quot;, Robert Kuttner argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of capital controls, which allowed capital flight from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to Gresham&#x27;s law phenomenon (where weak currencies undermine strong ones).
Historian Peter Pugh has stated that a key cause of the economic problems afflicting America in the 1970s was the refusal to raise taxes to finance the Vietnam War, which was against Keynesian advice.

A more typical response was to accept some elements of the criticisms while refining Keynesian economic theories to defend them against arguments that would invalidate the whole Keynesian frameworkthe resulting body of work largely composing New Keynesian economics. In 1992 Alan Blinder wrote about a &quot;Keynesian Restoration&quot;, as work based on Keynes&#x27;s ideas had to some extent become fashionable once again in academia, though in the mainstream it was highly synthesised with monetarism and other neoclassical thinking. In the world of policy making, free market influences broadly sympathetic to monetarism have remained very strong at government levelin powerful normative institutions like the World Bank, the IMF and US Treasury, and in prominent opinion-forming media such as the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot;.

===Keynesian resurgence 2008–09===

The 2007–2008 financial crisis led to public skepticism about the free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, announced the death of the dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.
Economist Robert J. Shiller had begun advocating robust government intervention to tackle the financial crises, specifically citing Keynes. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman also actively argued the case for vigorous Keynesian intervention in the economy in his columns for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.
Other prominent economic commentators who have argued for Keynesian government intervention to mitigate the 2007–2008 financial crisis included George Akerlof, J. Bradford DeLong, Robert Reich and Joseph Stiglitz.
Newspapers and other media have also cited work relating to Keynes by Hyman Minsky, Robert Skidelsky, Donald Markwell and Axel Leijonhufvud.

A series of major bailouts were pursued during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, starting on 7 September 2008 with the announcement that the US Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the US subprime mortgage marketFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide. This was in stark contrast to the action imposed on Indonesia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when it was forced by the IMF to close 16 banks at the same time, prompting a bank run.
Much of the post-crisis discussion reflected Keynes&#x27;s advocacy of international coordination of fiscal or monetary stimulus, and of international economic institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank, which many had argued should be reformed as a &quot;new Bretton Woods&quot;, and should have been even before the crises broke out.
The IMF and United Nations economists advocated a coordinated international approach to fiscal stimulus. Donald Markwell argued that in the absence of such an international approach, there would be a risk of worsening international relations and possibly even world war arising from economic factors similar to those present during the depression of the 1930s.

By the end of December 2008, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that &quot;the sudden resurgence of Keynesian policy is a stunning reversal of the orthodoxy of the past several decades.&quot;
In December 2008, Paul Krugman released his book &quot;The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008&quot;, arguing that economic conditions similar to those that existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published &quot;Animal Spirits&quot;, a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as it does not take into account Keynes&#x27;s insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.

In the March 2009 speech entitled &quot;Reform the International Monetary System&quot;, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People&#x27;s Bank of China, came out in favour of Keynes&#x27;s idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that part of the reason for the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes&#x27;s bancor. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs).
Although Zhou&#x27;s ideas had not been broadly accepted, leaders meeting in April at the 2009 G-20 London summit agreed to allow $250 billion of special drawing rights to be created by the IMF, to be distributed globally. Stimulus plans were credited for contributing to a better-than-expected economic outlook by both the OECD
and the IMF, in reports published in June and July 2009. Both organisations warned global leaders that recovery was likely to be slow, so counter-recessionary measures ought not be rolled back too early.

While the need for stimulus measures was broadly accepted among policymakers, there had been much debate over how to fund the spending. Some leaders and institutions, such as Angela Merkel
and the European Central Bank,
expressed concern over the potential impact on inflation, national debt and the risk that a too-large stimulus will create an unsustainable recovery.

Among professional economists the revival of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, there is a growing academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.

===New Keynesian economics===

New Keynesian economics developed in the 1990s and early 2000s as a response to the critique that macroeconomics lacked microeconomic foundations. New Keynesianism developed models to provide microfoundations for Keynesian economics. It incorporated parts of new classical macroeconomics to develop the new neoclassical synthesis, which forms the basis for mainstream macroeconomics today.

Two main assumptions define the New Keynesian approach to macroeconomics. Like the New Classical approach, New Keynesian macroeconomic analysis usually assumes that households and firms have rational expectations. However, the two schools differ in that New Keynesian analysis usually assumes a variety of market failures. In particular, New Keynesians assume that there is imperfect competition in price and wage setting to help explain why prices and wages can become &quot;sticky&quot;, which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.

Wage and price stickiness, and the other market failures present in New Keynesian models, imply that the economy may fail to attain full employment. Therefore, New Keynesians argue that macroeconomic stabilisation by the government (using fiscal policy) and the central bank (using monetary policy) can lead to a more efficient macroeconomic outcome than a &quot;laissez faire&quot; policy would.

==Overall views==

===Praise===
On a personal level, Keynes&#x27;s charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he wenteven those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes&#x27;s speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.

Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek was Keynes&#x27;s most prominent contemporary critic, with sharply opposing views on the economy. Yet after Keynes&#x27;s death, he wrote: &quot;He was the one really great man I ever knew, and for whom I had unbounded admiration. The world will be a very much poorer place without him.&quot; Colleague Nicholas Davenport recalled, &quot;There were deep emotional forces about Maynard ... One could sense his humanity. There was nothing of the cold intellectual about him.&quot;

Lionel Robbins, former head of the economics department at the London School of Economics, who engaged in many heated debates with Keynes in the 1930s, had this to say after observing Keynes in early negotiations with the Americans while drawing up plans for Bretton Woods:

Douglas LePan, an official from the Canadian High Commission, wrote:

Bertrand Russell named Keynes one of the most intelligent people he had ever known, commenting:

Keynes&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; included the comment: &quot;There is the man himselfradiant, brilliant, effervescent, gay, full of impish jokes ... He was a humane man genuinely devoted to the cause of the common good.&quot;

===Critiques===
As a man of the centre described by some as having the greatest impact of any 20th-century economist, Keynes attracted considerable criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. In the 1920s, Keynes was seen as anti-establishment and was mainly attacked from the right. In the &quot;red 1930s&quot;, many young economists favoured Marxist views, even in Cambridge, and while Keynes was engaging principally with the right to try to persuade them of the merits of more progressive policy, the most vociferous criticism against him came from the left, who saw him as a supporter of capitalism. From the 1950s and onwards, most of the attacks against Keynes have again been from the right.

In 1931, Friedrich Hayek extensively critiqued Keynes&#x27;s 1930 &quot;Treatise on Money&quot;. After reading Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, Keynes wrote to Hayek: &quot;Morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it.&quot; He concluded the letter with the recommendation:
On the pressing issue of the time, whether deficit spending could lift a country from depression, Keynes replied to Hayek&#x27;s criticism in the following way:

Asked why Keynes expressed &quot;moral and philosophical&quot; agreement with Hayek&#x27;s &quot;Road to Serfdom&quot;, Hayek stated:

According to some observers, Hayek felt that the post-World War II &quot;Keynesian orthodoxy&quot; gave too much power to the state, and that such policies would lead toward socialism.

While Milton Friedman described &quot;The General Theory&quot; as &quot;a great book&quot;, he argues that its implicit separation of nominal from real magnitudes is neither possible nor desirable. Macroeconomic policy, Friedman argues, can reliably influence only the nominal. He and other monetarists have consequently argued that Keynesian economics can result in stagflation, the combination of low growth and high inflation that developed economies suffered in the early 1970s. More to Friedman&#x27;s taste was the &quot;Tract on Monetary Reform&quot; (1923), which he regarded as Keynes&#x27;s best work because of its focus on maintaining domestic price stability.

Joseph Schumpeter was an economist of the same age as Keynes and one of his main rivals. He was among the first reviewers to argue that Keynes&#x27;s &quot;General Theory&quot; was not a general theory, but a special case. He said the work expressed &quot;the attitude of a decaying civilisation&quot;. After Keynes&#x27;s death Schumpeter wrote a brief biographical piece &quot;Keynes the Economist&quot;on a personal level he was very positive about Keynes as a man, praising his pleasant nature, courtesy and kindness. He assessed some of Keynes&#x27;s biographical and editorial work as among the best he&#x27;d ever seen. Yet Schumpeter remained critical of Keynes&#x27;s economics, linking Keynes&#x27;s childlessness to what Schumpeter saw as an essentially short-term view. He considered Keynes to have a kind of unconscious patriotism that caused him to fail to understand the problems of other nations. For Schumpeter, &quot;Practical Keynesianism is a seedling which cannot be transplanted into foreign soil: it dies there and becomes poisonous as it dies.&quot; He &quot;admired and envied Keynes, but when Keynes died in 1946, Schumpeter&#x27;s obituary gave Keynes this same off-key, perfunctory treatment he would later give Adam Smith in the &quot;History of Economic Analysis&quot;, the &quot;discredit of not adding a single innovation to the techniques of economic analysis.&quot;

Ludwig von Mises, an Austrian economist, describes a Keynesian system as believing it can solve most problems with &quot;more money and credit&quot; which leads to a system of &quot;inflationism&quot; in which &quot;prices (of goods) rise higher and higher.&quot; Murray Rothbard wrote that Keynesian-style governmental regulation of money and credit created a &quot;dismal monetary and banking situation,&quot; since it allows for the central bankers that have the exclusive ability to print money to be &quot;unchecked and out of control.&quot; Rothbard went on to say in an interview that, &quot;There is one good thing about (Karl) Marx: he was not a Keynesian.&quot;

President Harry S. Truman was sceptical of Keynesian theorising. He told Leon Keyserling, a Keynesian economist who chaired Truman&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers: &quot;Nobody can ever convince me that government can spend a dollar that it&#x27;s not got.&quot;

===Views on race===
Some critics have sought to show that Keynes had sympathies towards Nazism, and a number of writers have described him as antisemitic. Keynes&#x27;s private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some of which can be characterised as antisemitic, while others as philosemitic.

Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current at the time that he accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. Keynes was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting the cause.

Allegations that he was racist or had totalitarian beliefs have been rejected by Robert Skidelsky and other biographers. Professor Gordon Fletcher wrote that &quot;the suggestion of a link between Keynes and any support of totalitarianism cannot be sustained&quot;. Once the aggressive tendencies of the Nazis towards Jews and other minorities had become apparent, Keynes made clear his loathing of Nazism. As a lifelong pacifist he had initially favoured peaceful containment of Nazi Germany, yet he began to advocate a forceful resolution while many conservatives were still arguing for appeasement. After the war started, he roundly criticised the Left for losing their nerve to confront Adolf Hitler, saying:

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Keynes&#x27;s early romantic and sexual relationships were exclusively with men. Keynes had been in relationships while at Eton and Cambridge; significant among these early partners were Dilly Knox and Daniel Macmillan. Keynes was open about his affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated his many sexual encounters. Keynes&#x27;s relationship and later close friendship with Macmillan was to be fortunate, as Macmillan&#x27;s company first published his tract &quot;Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot;.

Attitudes in the Bloomsbury Group, in which Keynes was avidly involved, were relaxed about homosexuality. Keynes, together with writer Lytton Strachey, had reshaped the Victorian attitudes of the Cambridge Apostles: &quot;since [their] time, homosexual relations among the members were for a time common&quot;, wrote Bertrand Russell. The artist Duncan Grant has been described as &quot;the supreme male love of Keynes&#x27;s life&quot;, and their sexual relationship lasted from 1908 to 1915. Keynes was also involved with Lytton Strachey, though they were, for the most part, love rivals rather than lovers. Keynes had won the affections of Arthur Hobhouse and, as with Grant, fell out with a jealous Strachey over it. Strachey had previously found himself put off by Keynes, not least because of his manner of &quot;treat[ing] his love affairs statistically&quot;.

Political opponents have used Keynes&#x27;s sexuality to attack his academic work. One line of attack held that he was uninterested in the long-term ramifications of his theories because he had no children. Donald Kagan, in &quot; On the Origins of War&quot;, quotes Sally Marks and Stephen A. Schuker to suggest that &quot;[Keynes&#x27;s] passion for Carl Melchior&quot; distorted his position in favor of Germany.

Keynes&#x27;s friends in the Bloomsbury Group were initially surprised when, in his later years, he began pursuing affairs with women, demonstrating himself to be bisexual. Ray Costelloe (who later married Oliver Strachey) was an early heterosexual interest of Keynes. In 1906, Keynes had written of this infatuation that, &quot;I seem to have fallen in love with Ray a little bit, but as she isn&#x27;t male I haven&#x27;t [been] able to think of any suitable steps to take.&quot;

===Marriage===

In 1921, Keynes wrote that he had fallen &quot;very much in love&quot; with Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s &quot;Ballets Russes&quot;. In the early years of his courtship, he maintained an affair with a younger man, Sebastian Sprott, in tandem with Lopokova, but eventually chose Lopokova exclusively. They were married in 1925, with Keynes&#x27;s former lover Duncan Grant as best man. &quot;What a marriage of beauty and brains, the fair Lopokova and John Maynard Keynes&quot; was said at the time. Keynes later commented to Strachey that beauty and intelligence were rarely found in the same person, and that only in Duncan Grant had he found the combination. The union was happy, with biographer Peter Clarke writing that the marriage gave Keynes &quot;a new focus, a new emotional stability and a sheer delight of which he never wearied&quot;. The couple hoped to have children but this did not happen.

Among Keynes&#x27;s Bloomsbury friends, Lopokova was, at least initially, subjected to criticism for her manners, mode of conversation and supposedly humble social originsthe last of the ostensible causes being particularly noted in the letters of Vanessa and Clive Bell, and Virginia Woolf. In her novel &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; (1925), Woolf bases the character of Rezia Warren Smith on Lopokova. E. M. Forster later wrote in contrition about &quot;Lydia Keynes, whose every word should be recorded&quot;; &quot;How we all used to underestimate her&quot;.

Keynes had no children, and his wife outlived him by 35 years, dying in 1981.

===Support for the arts===
Keynes thought that the pursuit of money for its own sake was a pathological condition, and that the proper aim of work is to provide leisure. He wanted shorter working hours and longer holidays for all.

Keynes was interested in literature in general and drama in particular and supported the Cambridge Arts Theatre financially, which allowed the institution to become one of the major British stages outside London.

Keynes&#x27;s interest in classical opera and dance led him to support the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and the Ballet Company at Sadler&#x27;s Wells. During the war, as a member of CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), Keynes helped secure government funds to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the Arts Council of Great Britain and was its founding chairman in 1946. From the start, the two organisations that received the largest grants from the new body were the Royal Opera House and Sadler&#x27;s Wells.

Keynes built up a substantial collection of fine art, including works by Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso and Georges Seurat (some of which can now be seen at the Fitzwilliam Museum). He enjoyed collecting books; he collected and protected many of Isaac Newton&#x27;s papers. In part on the basis of these papers, Keynes wrote of Newton as &quot;the last of the magicians.&quot;

===Philosophical and spiritual views===
Keynes, like other members of the Bloomsbury Group, was greatly influenced by the philosophy of G. E. Moore, which in 1938 he described as &quot;still my religion under the surface&quot;. According to Moore, states of mind were the only valuable things in themselves, the most important being &quot;the pleasures of human intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects&quot;. Virginia Woolf&#x27;s biographer tells an anecdote of how Virginia Woolf, Keynes and T. S. Eliot discussed religion at a dinner party, in the context of their struggle against Victorian era morality.

Keynes may have been confirmed, but according to Cambridge University he was clearly an agnostic, which he remained until his death. According to one biographer, &quot;he was never able to take religion seriously, regarding it as a strange aberration of the human mind&quot; but also added that he came to &quot;value it for social and moral reasons&quot; later in life. Another biographer writes that he &quot;broke the family faith and became a &#x27;ferocious agnostic during his time at Eton. One Cambridge acquaintance remembered him as &quot;an atheist with a devotion to King&#x27;s chapel&quot;. At Cambridge, he was strongly associated with the Cambridge Heretics Society, an avowed atheist group which promoted secularism and humanism.

===Investments===
Keynes was ultimately a successful investor, building up a private fortune. His assets were nearly wiped out following the Wall Street crash of 1929, which he did not foresee, but he soon recouped. At Keynes&#x27;s death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of £500,000. The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various charities and philanthropies and despite his ethical reluctance to sell on a falling market in cases where he saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.

Keynes managed the endowment of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge starting in the 1920s, initially with an unsuccessful strategy based on market timing but later shifting to focus in the publicly traded stock of small and medium-sized companies that paid large dividends. This was a controversial decision at the time, as stocks were considered high-risk and the centuries-old endowment had traditionally been invested in agricultural land and fixed income assets like bonds. Keynes was granted permission to invest a small minority of assets in stocks, and his adroit management resulted this portion of the endowment growing to become the majority of the endowment&#x27;s assets. The active component of his portfolio outperformed a British equity index by an average of 6% to 8% a year over a quarter century, earning him a favourable mention by later investors such as Warren Buffett and George Soros.

Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments describes Keynes as an early practitioner of value investing, a school of thought formalised in the US by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd at Columbia Business School during the 1920s and 1930s. However, Keynes is believed to have developed his ideas independently. Keynes is also regarded as a pioneer of financial diversification as he recognised the importance of holding assets with &quot;opposed risks&quot; as he wrote &quot;since they are likely to move in opposite directions when there are general fluctuations&quot;; and also as an early international investor who avoided home country bias by investing substantially in stocks outside the United Kingdom. Ken Fisher characterised Keynes as an exception to the rule that economists usually make horrible investors.

Keynes joined the Board of the National Mutual Life Assurance Society in 1919 and served as chairman from 1921 to 1938. Keynes introduced a policy of active trading of fixed interest stocks, coupled with investment in equities. &quot;Keynes was the first to give [investment trading] the seal of respectability and to apply it to a life assurance fund&quot;.

Olivier Accominotti and David Chambers have pointed out that Keynes did not make use of currency trading and the carry trade in his investments. Keynes understood the strategy however, but considered that in his time the separation of the interest rates was not sufficient to pay for the costs of transporting the capital as gold, as he explained to the Macmillan Committee of 1930.

===Political life===
Keynes was a lifelong member of the Liberal Party, which until the 1920s had been one of the two main political parties in the United Kingdom, and as late as 1916 had often been the dominant power in government. Keynes had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from about 1906, yet he always refused to run for office himself, despite being asked to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party&#x27;s economic policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third-party status by the growing workers-oriented Labour Party.

In 1939 Keynes had the option to enter Parliament as an independent MP with the University of Cambridge seat. A by-election for the seat was to be held due to the illness of an elderly Tory, and the master of Magdalene College had obtained agreement that none of the major parties would field a candidate if Keynes chose to stand. Keynes declined the invitation as he felt he would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.

Keynes was a proponent of eugenics. He served as director of the British Eugenics Society from 1937 to 1944. As late as 1946, shortly before his death, Keynes declared eugenics to be &quot;the most important, significant and, I would add, genuine branch of sociology which exists.&quot;

Keynes once remarked that &quot;the youth had no religion save communism and this was worse than nothing.&quot; Marxism &quot;was founded upon nothing better than a misunderstanding of Ricardo&quot;, and, given time, he (Keynes) &quot;would deal thoroughly with the Marxists&quot; and other economists to solve the economic problems their theories &quot;threaten to cause&quot;. In 1925, Keynes said &quot;the class war will find me on the side of the educated bourgeoisie.&quot;

In 1931 Keynes had the following to say on Leninism:
Keynes was a firm supporter of women&#x27;s rights and in 1932 became vice-chairman of the Marie Stopes Society which provided birth control education. He also campaigned against job discrimination against women and unequal pay. He was an outspoken campaigner for reform of the laws against homosexuality.
===Heraldic arms===
===Death===
Throughout his life, Keynes worked energetically for the benefit both of the public and his friends; even when his health was poor, he laboured to sort out the finances of his old college. Helping to set up the Bretton Woods system, he worked to institute an international monetary system that would be beneficial for the world economy. In 1946, Keynes suffered a series of heart attacks, which ultimately proved fatal. They began during negotiations for the Anglo-American loan in Savannah, Georgia, where he was trying to secure favourable terms for the United Kingdom from the United States, a process he described as &quot;absolute hell&quot;. A few weeks after returning from the United States, Keynes died of a heart attack at Tilton, his farmhouse home near Firle, East Sussex, England, on 21 April 1946, at the age of 62. Against his wishes (he wanted his ashes to be deposited in the crypt at King&#x27;s), his ashes were scattered on the Downs above Tilton.

Both of Keynes&#x27;s parents outlived him: his father John Neville Keynes (1852–1949) by three years, and his mother Florence Ada Keynes (1861–1958) by twelve. Keynes&#x27;s brother Sir Geoffrey Keynes (1887–1982) was a distinguished surgeon, scholar and bibliophile. Keynes&#x27;s sister, Margaret Hill (1885–1970) was a prominent social reformer. His nephews include Richard Keynes (1919–2010), a physiologist, and Quentin Keynes (1921–2003), an adventurer and bibliophile. His niece, Polly Hill (1914–2005), was an economic anthropologist and emeritus fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge. 

== Cultural representations ==
In John Buchan&#x27;s novel &quot;Island of Sheep&quot; (1936) the character of the financier Barralty is based on Keynes.

In the film &quot;Wittgenstein&quot; (1993), directed by Derek Jarman, Keynes was played by John Quentin.

The docudrama &quot;Paris 1919&quot;, based around Margaret MacMillan&#x27;s book, featured Paul Bandey as Keynes.

In the BBC series about the Bloomsbury Group, &quot;Life in Squares&quot;, Keynes was portrayed by Edmund Kingsley.

The novel &quot;Mr Keynes&#x27; Revolution&quot; (2020) by E. J. Barnes is about Keynes&#x27;s life in the 1920s.

&quot;Love Letters&quot;, based on the correspondence of Keynes and Lydia Lopokova, was performed by Tobias Menzies and Helena Bonham-Carter at Charleston in 2021.

<text>Belarusians ( ) are an East Slavic ethnic group native to Belarus. They natively speak Belarusian, an East Slavic language. More than 9 million people proclaim Belarusian ethnicity worldwide. Nearly 7.99 million Belarusians reside in Belarus, with the United States and Russia being home to more than 500,000 Belarusians each. The majority of Belarusians adhere to Eastern Orthodoxy.

==Name==
During the Soviet era, Belarusians were referred to as &quot;Byelorussians&quot; or &quot;Belorussians&quot; (from Byelorussia, derived from Russian &quot;Белоруссия&quot;). Before, they were typically known as &quot;White Russians&quot; or &quot;White Ruthenians&quot; (from White Russia or White Ruthenia, based on &quot;Белая Русь&quot;). Upon Belarusian independence in 1991, they became known as &quot;Belarusians&quot; (from Belarus, derived from &quot;Беларусь&quot;), sometimes spelled as &quot;Belarusans&quot;, &quot;Belarussians&quot; or &quot;Belorusians&quot;.

The term &quot;White Rus&#x27;&quot; (), also known as &quot;White Ruthenia&quot; or &quot;White Russia&quot; (as the term &quot;Rus&#x27; &quot; is often conflated with its Latin forms &quot;Russia&quot; and &quot;Ruthenia&quot;), was first used in the Middle Ages to refer to the area of Polotsk. The name &quot;Rus&#x27; &quot; itself is derived from the Rus&#x27; people which gave the name to the territories of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The chronicles of Jan of Czarnków mention the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke Jogaila and his mother at &quot;&quot; in 1381. During the 17th century, the Russian tsars used the term to describe the lands added from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, during the Russian Civil War, the term &quot;White Russian&quot; became associated with the White movement.

==Geographic distribution==
Belarusians are an East Slavic ethnic group, who constitute the majority of Belarus&#x27; population. Belarusian minority populations live in countries neighboring Belarus: Ukraine, Poland (especially in the Podlaskie Voivodeship), the Russian Federation and Lithuania. At the beginning of the 20th century, Belarusians constituted a minority in the regions around the city of Smolensk in Russia.

Significant numbers of Belarusians emigrated to the United States, Brazil and Canada in the early 20th century. During Soviet times (1917–1991), many Belarusians were deported or migrated to various regions of the USSR, including Siberia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.

Since the 1991 breakup of the USSR, several hundred thousand Belarusians have emigrated to the Baltic states, the United States, Canada, Russia, and EU countries.

==Languages==
The two official languages of Belarus are Belarusian and Russian. Russian was made co-official with Belarusian after the 1995 Belarusian referendum, which also established that the flag (with the hammer and sickle removed), anthem, and coat of arms would be those of the BSSR. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly stated that the referendum violated international standards. Members of the opposition claimed that the organization of the referendum involved several serious violations of legislation, including a violation of the constitution.

Belarusians, like most Europeans, largely descend from three distinct lineages: Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from a Cro-Magnon population that arrived in Europe about 45,000 years ago; Neolithic farmers who migrated from Asia Minor during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago; and Yamnaya steppe pastoralists who expanded into Europe from the Pontic–Caspian steppe in the context of Indo-European migrations 5,000 years ago.

==History==
=== The Neolithic and the Bronze Age ===

In the Neolithic most of present-day Belarus was inhabited by Finno-Ugrians. Indo-European population appeared in the Bronze Age.

=== Early Middle Ages ===
In the Iron Age, the south of present-day Belarus was inhabited by tribes belonging to the Milograd culture (7th–3rd century BC) and later Zarubintsy culture. Some considered them to be Balts. Since the beginning of common era, these lands were penetrated by the Slavs, a process that intensified during the migration period (4th century). A peculiar symbiosis of Baltic and Slavic cultures took place in the area, but it was not a fully peaceful process, as evidenced by numerous fires in Balts&#x27; settlements in the 7th-8th centuries. According to Russian archaeologist , it was intensive contacts with the Balts that contributed to the distinctiveness of the Belarusian tribes from the other Eastern Slavs.

The Baltic population gradually became Slavic, undergoing assimilation, a process that for eastern and central Belarus ended around the 12th century. Belarusian lands in the 8th-9th centuries were inhabited by 3 tribal unions: the Krivichs, Dregoviches and Radimichs. Of these, the Krivichs played the most important role; Polotsk, founded by them, was the most important cultural and political center during this period. The principalities formed at that time on the territory of Belarus were part of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The process of the beginning of the East Slavic linguistic community and the separation of Belarusian dialects slowly took place.

=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===

As a result of Lithuanian expansion, the lands of Belarus became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This fact accelerated the Slavicization of the Baltic population. Between the 13th and 16th centuries, a distinct Ruthenian language was formed. It is called &quot;Old Belarusian language&quot; by Belausian researchers and &quot;Old Ukrainian&quot; by the Ukrainian ones. The rulers and the elite of the Grand Duchy adopted elements of Ruthenian culture, primarily Ruthenian language, which became the main language of writing. Belarusians began to emerge as a nationality during the 13th and 14th centuries in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania mostly on the lands of the upper basins of Neman River, Dnieper River, and the Western Dvina River. The Belarusian people trace their distinct culture to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, earlier Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Principality of Polotsk.

Litvin was a term used to describe all residents of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, primarily those belonging to the noble state, without distinction of ethnicity or religion. At the same time, the term Ruthenian (&quot;Rusyn&quot;) was in use, referring primarily to all persons professing Orthodoxy; later since the end of the 16th century it took on a broader meaning, and also referred to all the persons of Eastern Slavic origin, regardless of their religion. At the same time, there was a geographical division within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania between Lithuania proper and Rus&#x27;. However, it did not correspond to an ethnic or confessional division, as Lithuania proper included a large part of central and western Belarus with cities such as Polotsk, Vitebsk, Orsha, Minsk, Barysaw and Slutsk, while the remaining lands inhabited by Slavs were called Rus. From the 17th century onward, the name White Ruthenia () spread, which initially referred to the territory of today&#x27;s Eastern Belarus (Polotsk, Vitebsk). The term &quot;Belarusians&quot;, &quot;Belarusian faith&quot; and &quot;Belarusian speech&quot; also appeared at that time. As stated by historian Andrej Kotljarchuk, the first person who called himself &quot;Belarusian&quot; was Calvinist writer Salomon Rysinski (Solomo Pantherus Leucorussus). According to his words, he was born &quot;in richly endowed with forests and animals Ruthenia near the border to frigid Muscovy&quot; and doctorated at the University of Altdorf.

From the 1630s, Old Belarusian (Ruthenian) started to be replaced by the Polish language, as a result of the Polish high culture acquiring increasing prestige in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1697, Ruthenian was removed as one of the Grand Duchy&#x27;s official languages. By the 17th century, Muscovites began encouraging the use of the word Belarusian and viewed the Belarusians as Russians and their language as a Russian dialect. This was done to legitimize Russian attempts of conquering the eastern lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth under the pretense of unifying all Russian lands. During three partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1772, 1793 and 1795) most of the territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were annexed by the Russian Empire.

=== In the Russian Empire ===
Following the destruction of Poland–Lithuania with the Third Partition in 1795, Empress Catherine of Russia created the Belarusian Governorate from the and Mogilev Governorates. However, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia banned the use of the word Belarus in 1839, replacing it with the designation Northwestern Krai. Due to the ban, various different names were used for naming the inhabitants of those territories. It was part of the Pale of Settlement, which was the region where Jews were allowed permanent residency.

=== 20th century ===
During World War I and the fall of Russian Empire, a short-lived Belarusian Democratic Republic was declared in March 1918. Thereafter, modern Belarus&#x27; territory was split between the Second Polish Republic and Soviet Russia during the Peace of Riga in 1921. The latter created the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was reunited with Western Belarus during World War 2 and lasted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which was ended by the Belovezh Accords in 1991. The modern Republic of Belarus exists since then.

More than two million people were killed in Belarus during the three years of German occupation in 1941–44, around a quarter of the region&#x27;s population, or even as high as three million killed or thirty percent of the population.

<doc id="37977" wikidata="Q259438" url="?curid=37977" title="Millet">
<text>Millets () are a highly varied group of small-seeded grasses, widely grown around the world as cereal crops or grains for fodder and human food. Most millets belong to the tribe Paniceae.

Millets are important crops in the semiarid tropics of Asia and Africa, especially in India, Mali, Nigeria, and Niger, with 97% of production in developing countries. The crop is favoured for its productivity and short growing season under hot dry conditions. The millets are sometimes understood to include the widely cultivated sorghum; apart from that, pearl millet is the most commonly cultivated of the millets. Finger millet, proso millet, and foxtail millet are other important crop species.
Millets may have been consumed by humans for about 7,000 years and potentially had &quot;a pivotal role in the rise of multi-crop agriculture and settled farming societies&quot;.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;millet&quot; is derived via Old French &quot;millet, millot&quot; from Latin &quot;millium&quot;, &#x27;millet&#x27;, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*mele-&quot;, &#x27;to crush&#x27;.

== Description ==

=== Characteristics ===

Millets are small-grained, annual, warm-weather cereals belonging to the grass family. They are highly tolerant of drought and other extreme weather conditions and have a similar nutrient content to other major cereals.

=== Taxonomic history ===

In 1753, Carl Linnaeus described foxtail millet as &quot;Panicum italicum&quot;. In 1812, Palisot de Beauvois grouped several taxa into &quot;Setaria italica&quot;. 

The genus &quot;Pennisetum&quot; was divided by Otto Stapf in 1934 into the section &quot;penicillaria&quot;, with 32 species including all the cultivated ones, and four other sections. In 1977, J. Brunken and colleagues classed the wild &quot;P. violaceum&quot; as part of the cultivated species &quot;P. glaucum&quot; (pearl millet).

Finger millet was described as &quot;Eleusine coracana&quot; by Joseph Gaertner in 1788.

== Evolution ==

=== Phylogeny ===

The millets are closely related to sorghum and maize within the PACMAD clade of grasses, and more distantly to the cereals of the BOP clade such as wheat and barley. 

Within the Panicoideae, sorghum is in the tribe &quot;Andropogoneae&quot;, while pearl millet, proso, foxtail, fonio, little millet, sawa, Japanese barnyard millet and kodo are in the tribe &quot;Paniceae&quot;. Within the Chloridoideae, finger millet is in the tribe &quot;Cynodonteae&quot;, while teff is in the tribe &quot;Eragrostideae&quot;.

=== Taxonomy ===

The different species of millets are not all closely related. All are members of the family Poaceae (the grasses), but they belong to different tribes and subfamilies. Commonly cultivated millets are:

Eragrostideae tribe in the subfamily Chloridoideae:

* &quot;Eleusine coracana&quot;: Finger millet
* &quot;Eragrostis tef&quot;: Teff; often not considered to be a millet

Paniceae tribe in the subfamily Panicoideae:

* Genus &quot;Panicum&quot;:
** &quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot;: Proso millet (common millet, broomcorn millet, hog millet, or white millet, also known as baragu in Kannada, panivaragu in Tamil)
** &quot;Panicum sumatrense&quot;: Little millet
** &quot;Panicum hirticaule&quot;: Sonoran millet, cultivated in the American Southwest
* &quot;Cenchrus americanus&quot;: Pearl millet

* &quot;Setaria italica&quot;: Foxtail millet, Italian millet, panic
* Genus &quot;Digitaria&quot;: of minor importance as crops
** &quot;Digitaria exilis&quot;: known as white fonio, fonio millet, and hungry rice or acha rice
** &quot;Digitaria iburua&quot;: Black fonio
** &quot;Digitaria compacta&quot;: Raishan, cultivated in the Khasi Hills of northeast India
** &quot;Digitaria sanguinalis&quot;: Polish millet
* Genus &quot;Echinochloa&quot;: collectively, the members of this genus are called &quot;barnyard grasses&quot; or &quot;barnyard millets&quot;
** &quot;Echinochloa esculenta&quot;: Japanese barnyard millet
** &quot;Echinochloa frumentacea&quot;: Indian barnyard millet
** &quot;Echinochloa stagnina&quot;: Burgu millet
** &quot;Echinochloa crus-galli&quot;: Common barnyard grass (or cockspur grass)
* &quot;Paspalum scrobiculatum&quot;: Kodo millet

* Genus Urochloa (formerly Brachiaria)
** &quot;Urochloa deflexa&quot;: Guinea millet
** &quot;Urochloa ramosa&quot;: Browntop millet, southern India
* &quot;Spodiopogon formosanus&quot;: Taiwan oil millet, endemic to Taiwan

Andropogoneae tribe, also in the subfamily Panicoideae:

* &quot;Sorghum bicolor&quot;: Sorghum; usually considered a separate cereal, but sometimes known as &quot;great millet&quot;
* &quot;Coix lacryma-jobi&quot;: Job&#x27;s tears, also known as adlay millet

== Domestication and spread ==

Specialized archaeologists called palaeoethnobotanists, relying on data such as the relative abundance of charred grains found in archaeological sites, hypothesize that the cultivation of millets was of greater prevalence in prehistory than rice, especially in northern China and Korea.

The cultivation of common millet as the earliest dry crop in East Asia has been attributed to its resistance to drought, and this has been suggested to have aided its spread. Asian varieties of millet made their way from China to the Black Sea region of Europe by 5000 BC.

Millet was growing wild in Greece as early as 3000 BC, and bulk storage containers for millet have been found from the Late Bronze Age in Macedonia and northern Greece. Hesiod describes that &quot;the beards grow round the millet, which men sow in summer.&quot; Millet is listed along with wheat in the third century BC by Theophrastus in his &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot;.

=== East Asia ===

Proso millet (&quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot;) and foxtail millet (&quot;Setaria italica&quot;) were important crops beginning in the Early Neolithic of China. Some of the earliest evidence of millet cultivation in China was found at Cishan (north), where proso millet husk phytoliths and biomolecular components have been identified around 10,300–8,700 years ago in storage pits along with remains of pit-houses, pottery, and stone tools related to millet cultivation. Evidence at Cishan for foxtail millet dates back to around 8,700 years ago. Noodles made from these two varieties of millet were found under a 4,000-year-old earthenware bowl containing well-preserved noodles at the Lajia archaeological site in north China; this is the oldest evidence of millet noodles in China.

Palaeoethnobotanists have found evidence of the cultivation of millet in the Korean Peninsula dating to the Middle Jeulmun pottery period (around 3500–2000 BC). Millet continued to be an important element in the intensive, multicropping agriculture of the Mumun pottery period (about 1500–300 BC) in Korea. Millets and their wild ancestors, such as barnyard grass and panic grass, were also cultivated in Japan during the Jōmon period sometime after 4000 BC.

In the Zhengluo region of China, two millet species (foxtail millet and proso millet) were grown, enabling the people to survive the cooling of the global climate around 2200 BC. Chinese myths attribute the domestication of millet to Shennong, a legendary Emperor of China, and Hou Ji, whose name means Lord Millet.

=== Indian subcontinent ===

Little millet (&quot;Panicum sumatrense&quot;) is believed to have been domesticated around 5000 BC in Indian subcontinent and Kodo millet (&quot;Paspalum scrobiculatum&quot;) around 3700 BC, also in Indian subcontinent.
Browntop millet (&quot;Urochloa ramosa&quot;) was likely domesticated in the Deccan near the beginning of the third millennium BCE and spread throughout India though was later superseded by other millets. Various millets have been mentioned in some of the Yajurveda texts, identifying foxtail millet (&quot;priyaṅgu&quot;), Barnyard millet (&quot;aṇu&quot;) and black finger millet (&quot;śyāmāka&quot;), indicating that millet cultivation was happening around 1200 BC in India. Upon request by the Indian Government in 2018, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations declared 2023 as International Year of Millets.

=== Africa ===

Pearl millet (&quot;Pennisetum glaucum&quot;) was domesticated in the Sahel region of West Africa from &quot;Pennisetum violaceum&quot;. Early archaeological evidence in Africa includes finds at Birimi in northern Ghana (1740 cal BC) and Dhar Tichitt in Mauritania (1936–1683 cal BC) and the lower Tilemsi valley in Mali (2500 to 2000 cal BC). Studies of isozymes suggest domestication took place north east of the Senegal River in the far west of the Sahel and tentatively around 6000 BC. Pearl millet had arrived in the Indian subcontinent by 2000 BC to 1700 BC.

Finger millet is native to the highlands of East Africa and was domesticated before the third millennium BC. Its cultivation had spread to South India by 1800 BC.

=== Europe ===

Broomcorn or proso millet (&quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot;) came to Europe from East Asia as early as the 17th century BC in Vinogradnyi Sad, Ukraine. At around 1500 BC it reached Italy and southeastern Europe; around 1400 BC it came to central Europe, and from 1200 BC, it arrived in northern Germany.

== Agriculture ==

=== Cultivation ===

Pearl millet is one of the two major crops in the semiarid, impoverished, less fertile agriculture regions of Africa and southeast Asia. Millets are not only adapted to poor, dry infertile soils, but they are also more reliable under these conditions than most other grain crops.

Millets, however, do respond to high fertility and moisture. On a per-hectare basis, millet grain production can be 2 to 4 times higher with use of irrigation and soil supplements. Improved breeds of millet with enhanced disease resistance can significantly increase farm yield. There has been cooperation between poor countries to improve millet yields. For example, &#x27;Okashana 1&#x27;, a variety developed in India from a natural-growing millet variety in Burkina Faso, doubled yields. This breed was selected for trials in Zimbabwe. From there it was taken to Namibia, where it was released in 1990 and enthusiastically adopted by farmers. &#x27;Okashana 1&#x27; became the most popular variety in Namibia, the only non-Sahelian country where pearl millet—locally known as &quot;mahangu&quot;—is the dominant food staple for consumers. &#x27;Okashana 1&#x27; was then introduced to Chad. The breed has significantly enhanced yields in Mauritania and Benin.

=== Pests and diseases ===

Millets are subject to damage by many insect pests, including corn borers, stem borers, the caterpillars of numerous moths in the families Erebidae and Noctuidae, the millet midge, many species of flies in the Muscidae, Hemipteran bugs of many families including aphids, and species of thrips, beetles, and grasshoppers.

Among the many diseases of millets are serious fungal infections such as anthracnose, blast, charcoal rot, downy mildew, ergot, grain mould, rust, and sheath rot. Bacterial diseases are generally less serious; they include bacterial leaf spot, leaf stripe and leaf streak. Viral diseases are again generally less serious, except for a few diseases such as maize stripe virus, maize mosaic virus, sorghum red stripe virus, and maize streak virus.

=== Production ===

In 2022, global production of millet was 30.9 million tonnes. India is the top millet producer worldwide, with 11.8 million tonnes grown annually – some 38% of the world total and nearly triple its nearest rival. Eight of the remaining nine nations in the top 10 producers are in Africa, ranging from Niger (at 3.7 million tonnes) to Chad (0.7 million tonnes); the sole exception is China, number three in global production, at 2.7 million tonnes.

=== Research ===

Research on millets is carried out by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and ICAR-Indian Institute of Millets Research in Telangana, India, and by the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Agricultural Research Service at Tifton, Georgia, United States.

== Uses ==

=== As food ===

In Ukraine, millet was historically a common ingredient in the diet of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, in the form of a porridge called &quot;kulish&quot;. This dish, primarily made with millet, served with stewed vegetables and meat, cooked in a cauldron, remains a part of modern Ukrainian cuisine. In Germany, it is eaten sweet, for example with milk and berries for breakfast. 
In Russia, also remains common and is promoted for its health benefits. Millet porridge made with pumpkin is particularly common. In the Lipetsk Oblast ritual and daily meals from millet include (). These are millet fritters.

Millet is the main ingredient in , a Vietnamese sweet snack. It contains a layer of smashed millet and mungbean topped with sliced dried coconut meat wrapped in a crunchy rice cake. In parts of Africa millet is mixed with milk to make a drink, Brukina.

Finger millet is made into &quot;ragi rotti&quot; flatbread and &quot;ragi mudde&quot; dough lumps in Karnataka. Dough lumps are eaten as fura in the Sahel region of West Africa.

=== Alcoholic beverages ===

In the Himalayas, including in Nepal, Sikkim, and Darjeeling, millet is fermented into Tongba, an alcoholic drink.

In India, alcoholic beverages including rakshi are produced from millets.

=== As forage ===

Millet is sometimes used as a forage crop. Compared to forage sorghum, animals including lambs gain weight faster on millet, and it has better hay or silage potential, although it produces less dry matter. Millet does not contain toxic prussic acid, sometimes found in sorghum. The rapid growth of millet as a grazing crop allows flexibility in its use. Farmers can wait until sufficient late spring / summer moisture is present and then make use of it. It is ideally suited to irrigation where livestock finishing is required.

=== Human consumption ===

Per capita consumption of millets as food varies in different parts of the world, with consumption being the highest in Western Africa. In the Sahel region, millet is estimated to account for about 35 percent of total cereal food consumption in Burkina Faso, Chad and the Gambia. In Mali and Senegal, millets constitute roughly 40 percent of total cereal food consumption per capita, while in Niger and arid Namibia it is over 65 percent (see &quot;mahangu&quot;). Other countries in Africa where millets are a significant food source include Ethiopia, Nigeria and Uganda. Millet is also an important food item for the population living in the drier parts of many other countries, especially in eastern and central Africa, and in the northern coastal countries of western Africa. In developing countries outside Africa, millet has local significance as a food in parts of some countries, such as China, India, Burma and North Korea.

People affected by gluten-related disorders, such as coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers, who need a gluten-free diet, can replace gluten-containing cereals in their diets with millet. There remains a risk of contamination with gluten-containing cereals.

<text>Totnes ( or ) is a market town and civil parish at the head of the estuary of the River Dart in Devon, England, within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is about west of Paignton, about west-southwest of Torquay and about east-northeast of Plymouth. It is the administrative centre of the South Hams District Council.

Totnes has a long recorded history, dating back to 907, when its first castle was built. By the twelfth century it was already an important market town, and its former wealth and importance may be seen from the number of merchants&#x27; houses built in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Today, the town has a sizeable alternative and New Age community, known as a place where one can live a bohemian lifestyle, though has in recent times also gained a reputation as being a hotspot for conspiracy theorists within the UK.

The 2021 census recorded a population of 9,214, an increase from the 2011 census which gave a population of 8,076.

==History==

===Totnes in myth and legend===

According to the written by Geoffrey of Monmouth in around 1136, &quot;the coast of Totnes&quot; was where Brutus of Troy, the mythical founder of Britain, first came ashore on the island. Set into the pavement of Fore Street is the Brutus Stone, a small granite boulder onto which, according to local legend, Brutus first stepped from his ship. As he did so, he was supposed to have declaimed:Here I stand and here I rest. And this town shall be called Totnes.

The stone is far above the highest tides and the tradition is not likely to be of great antiquity, being first mentioned in John Prince&#x27;s &quot;Worthies of Devon&quot; in 1697. It is possible that the stone was originally the one from which the town crier, or &quot;bruiter&quot; called out his news; or it may be &quot;le Brodestone&quot;, a boundary stone mentioned in several 15th century disputes: its last-known position in 1471 was below the East Gate.

The Middle English prose &quot;Brut&quot; () places the fight between Brutus&#x27; general Corineus, and the British giant Gogmagog &quot;at Totttenes&quot;, while Cornish antiquary Richard Carew suggested that the fight may have begun near the town, but ended at Plymouth Hoe. The &quot;Historia&quot; has several other landings at the Totness coast: the Roman general Vespasian, Constantine of Brittany at the port of Totnes, Aurelius Ambrosius and his brother Uther Pendragon attempting to win back the throne of Britain from the usurper Vortigern, the Saxons at war with King Arthur, and in one version Cadwallo fighting against the Mercians. The &quot;Historia&quot; also mentions the town in a prophecy of Merlin: &quot;after [the dragon of Worcester] shall succeed the boar of Totness, and oppress the people with grievous tyranny. Gloucester shall send forth a lion, and shall disturb him in his cruelty, in several battles. He shall trample him under his feet, and terrify him with open jaws.&quot;

===Ancient and medieval history===
The first authentic history of Totnes is in AD 907, when it was fortified by King Edward the Elder as part of the defensive ring of burhs built around Devon, replacing one built a few years earlier at nearby Halwell. The site was chosen because it was on an ancient trackway which forded the river at low tide. Between the reigns of Edgar and William II (959–1100) Totnes intermittently minted coins. Some time between the Norman Conquest in 1066 and the compilation of the Domesday Book in 1086, William the Conqueror granted the burh to Juhel of Totnes, who was probably responsible for the first construction of the castle. Juhel did not retain his lordship for long, however, as he was deprived of his lands in 1088 or 1089, for rebelling against William II.

The name &quot;Totnes&quot; (first recorded in AD 979) comes from the Old English personal name &quot;Totta&quot; and &quot;ness&quot; or headland. Before reclamation and development, the low-lying areas around this hill were largely marsh or tidal wetland, giving the hill much more the appearance of a &quot;ness&quot; than today.

By the 12th century, Totnes was already an important market town, due to its position on one of the main roads of the South West, in conjunction with its easy access to its hinterland and the easy navigation of the River Dart.

===Modern history===

By 1523, according to a tax assessment, Totnes was the second-richest town in Devon, and the sixteenth-richest in England, ahead of Worcester, Gloucester and Lincoln.
In 1553, King Edward VI granted Totnes a charter allowing a former Benedictine priory building that had been founded in 1088 to be used as Totnes Guildhall and a school. In 1624, the Guildhall was converted to be a magistrates&#x27; court. Soldiers were billeted here during the English Civil War and Oliver Cromwell visited for discussions with the general and parliamentary commander-in-chief Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1646. Until 1887, the Guildhall was also used as the town prison with the addition of prison cells. It remained a magistrates&#x27; court until 1974. In 1990, a serious fire broke out on the High Street, resulting in the historic Eastgate structure being destroyed and an estimated £10 million in damage.

In 2006 Totnes become the first transition town of the transition initiative.
Permaculture designer Rob Hopkins developed this idea with his students and later with Naresh Giangrande developed the transition model in his home town of Totnes, which has since featured in many articles and films showing this concept. Totnes has adopted an Energy Descent Plan, as a response in answer to the twin problems of greenhouse gas emissions and peak oil. As a result of a series of public gatherings with experts, and the organisation of a number of special interest groups, the community has come together with lecturers and trainers shared with Schumacher College, through a process of participative strategic planning, to hone their skills in project development. As a result of the initiatives in Totnes, a large number of other communities have started &quot;Transition Town&quot; projects, and there are now more than 400 around the world, ranging from small communities to whole cities (e.g. Berlin). Totnes hosts the Sea Change Festival that has been running in the town and neighbouring Dartington since 2016.

==Governance==
Totnes&#x27; borough charter was granted by King John, probably around 1206; at any rate, the 800th anniversary of the charter was celebrated in 2006, although Totnes lost its borough status in local government reorganisation in 1974. Totnes was served by Totnes electoral borough from 1295 until the reform act of 1867, but was restored by the 1884 Franchise Act. The constituency of Totnes was abolished a second time in 1983, and formed part of the South Hams constituency until 1997, when it was restored as the Totnes county constituency: as such it returns one member of parliament (MP) to parliament.

In August 2009, Totnes became the first constituency to select the Conservative&#x27;s Prospective Parliamentary Candidate through an open primary that was organised by the local Conservative Association. Dr Sarah Wollaston won the Totnes primary in August 2009, and went on to be elected to Parliament at the 2010 general election. In 2019, she moved to Change UK, and then to the Liberal Democrats, for whom she contested Totnes in the 2019 general election, coming second when the seat reverted to the Conservatives. In 2024 after a tactical voting primary the Liberal Democrats won the seat and Caroline Voaden became the MP.

Totnes has been represented by the Greens on Devon County Council since 2009.

Totnes has a mayor who is elected by the sixteen town councillors each year. Follaton House, on the outskirts of the town, is the headquarters of the South Hams District Council. The town is twinned with the French town of Vire, after which Vire Island on the River Dart near the &quot;Plains&quot; is named. There is also a longstanding local joke that Totnes is twinned with the fantasy land of Narnia.

==Geography==
The town is built on a hill rising from the west bank of the River Dart, which separates Totnes from the suburb of Bridgetown. It is at the lowest bridging point of the river which here is tidal and forms a winding estuary down to the sea at Dartmouth. The river continues to be tidal for about above the town, until it meets Totnes Weir, built in the 17th century.

Today there are two road bridges, a railway bridge and a footbridge over the river in the town. Totnes Bridge is the nearest bridge to the sea and is a road bridge built in 1826–28 by Charles Fowler. At low tide the foundations of the previous stone bridge are visible just upstream—it was probably built in the early 13th century and widened in 1692. Before the first stone bridge was built there was almost certainly a wooden bridge here, and a tidal ford for heavy vehicles was just downstream. In 1982 a new concrete bridge was built about upstream as part of the Totnes inner relief road. Its name, Brutus Bridge, was chosen by the local residents. A further upstream, the railway bridge carries the National Rail Exeter to Plymouth line over the river. Immediately upstream of the railway bridge is a footbridge, built in 1993 to provide access to the terminus of the South Devon Railway.

==Economy==

Totnes has attracted a sizeable &quot;alternative&quot; community, and the town is known as a place where one can live a &quot;New Age&quot; lifestyle. There are a number of facilities for artists, painters and musicians, and there is a twice-weekly market offering antiques, musical instruments, second-hand books, handmade clothing from across the world, and local organically produced products. In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; magazine declared Totnes the capital of new age chic. In 2005, &quot;Highlife&quot;, the British Airways magazine, declared it one of the world&#x27;s Top 10 Funky Towns.

In March 2007 Totnes was the first town in Britain to introduce its own local alternative currency, the Totnes pound, to support the local economy of the town. Fourteen months later, 70 businesses within the town were trading in the &quot;Totnes Pound,&quot; accepting them as payment and offering them to shoppers as change from their purchases. The initiative was part of the transition town concept, which was pioneered by Rob Hopkins, who had recently moved to Totnes. The Totnes pound was discontinued in 2019.

Emphasising the town&#x27;s continuing history of boatbuilding, between 1998 and 2001 Pete Goss built his revolutionary but ill-fated 120-foot Team Philips catamaran there, which had to be abandoned mid-Atlantic when it started to break up.

Loss of revenue from Dartington College of Arts, which moved to Falmouth in 2010, was partially offset by increased tourism due to interest in Totnes&#x27;s status as a transition town.

==Landmarks==
 Totnes is said to have more listed buildings per head than any other town.
The Norman motte-and-bailey Totnes Castle, now owned by English Heritage, was built during the reign of William I, probably by Juhel of Totnes. The late medieval church of St Mary with its high west tower, visible from afar, is built of rich red Devonian sandstone. A prominent feature of the town is the Eastgate—an arch spanning the middle of the main street. This Elizabethan entrance to the walled town was destroyed in a fire in September 1990, but was rebuilt.
The ancient Leechwell, so named because of the supposed medicinal properties of its water, and apparently where lepers once came to wash, still provides fresh water. The Butterwalk is a Tudor covered walkway that was built to protect the dairy products once sold here from the sun and rain. Totnes Elizabethan House Museum is in one of the many authentic Elizabethan merchant&#x27;s houses in the town, built around 1575.

==Transport==
The A38 passes about to the west of Totnes, connected to the town by the A384 from Buckfastleigh and the A385 which continues to Paignton. The town also lies on the A381 between Newton Abbot and Salcombe.

Totnes railway station is situated on the Exeter to Plymouth line, and has trains direct to London Paddington, Plymouth and Penzance, and as far north as Aberdeen.

Nearby, Totnes (Riverside) railway station is at the southern end of the South Devon Railway Trust which runs tourist steam locomotives along the line that follows the River Dart up to Buckfastleigh.

Bus services are provided by Stagecoach South West, Tally Ho Coaches and County Bus. Totnes also has a town minibus service provided by Bob The Bus. Lomax Tours run coach trips from Totnes.

Since the River Dart is navigable to seagoing boats as far as Totnes, the estuary was used for the import and export of goods from the town until 1995.

==Education==
King Edward VI Community College, more popularly known as KEVICC, is the local secondary school which shares its name with the former grammar school set up by King Edward VI over 450 years ago. At the western edge of the town is the Dartington Hall Estate, which formerly included the Schumacher College and the Dartington College of Arts until their closures in September 2024 and July 2010 respectively. There are also a number of alternative private schools in the Totnes area, providing primary and secondary education.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the nearby Beacon Hill TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon on 104.3 FM, Heart West on 100.5 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Devon on 105.5 FM and Soundart Radio, a community based station which broadcast on 102.5 FM and online through Radioplayer.

The &quot;Totnes Times&quot; is a local newspaper serving the town and the surrounding South Hams area in Devon. It is owned by Tindle Newspapers. Published weekly, it appears on Thursdays. Its first issue dated 7 April 1860 was under the title of &quot;The Totnes Weekly Times&quot;. There have been several title changes over the years. In the 1931 edition of Willing&#x27;s Press Guide it is listed as the &quot;Totnes Times and Devon News&quot;. A microfiche archive of the newspaper is held at Totnes Archive on the Totnes Museum site.

<text>The Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División, commonly known as the Primera División or La Liga and officially known as LaLiga EA Sports for sponsorship reasons, is a professional association football league in Spain and the highest level of the Spanish football league system. It is controlled by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional and it is contested by 20 teams over a 38-matchday period.

Since its inception, 62 teams have competed in La Liga. Nine teams have been crowned champions, with Barcelona winning the inaugural La Liga and Real Madrid winning the title a record 36 times. Real Madrid are also the most recent winners, having won the 2023–24 edition. During the 1940s Valencia, Atlético Madrid and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs, winning several titles. Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the championship in the 1950s, each winning four La Liga titles during the decade. During the 1960s and 1970s, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning fourteen titles, with Atlético Madrid winning four. During the 1980s and 1990s Real Madrid were prominent in La Liga, but the Basque clubs of Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad had their share of success, each winning two Liga titles. From the 1990s onward, Barcelona has dominated La Liga, winning seventeen titles to date. Although Real Madrid has also been prominent, winning eleven titles, La Liga has also seen other champions, including Valencia and Deportivo La Coruña.

According to UEFA&#x27;s league coefficient rankings, La Liga was the top league in Europe in each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019 (calculated using accumulated figures from five preceding seasons) and led Europe for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019, more than any other country. It also has produced the continent&#x27;s top-rated club more times (22) than any other league in that period, more than double that of second-placed Serie A (Italy), including the top club in 10 of the 11 seasons between 2009 and 2019; each of these pinnacles was achieved by either Barcelona or Real Madrid. La Liga clubs have won the most UEFA Champions League (20), UEFA Europa League (14), UEFA Super Cup (16) and FIFA Club World Cup (8) titles, and its players have accumulated the highest number of Ballon d&#x27;Or awards (24), The Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Player awards (19) and UEFA Men&#x27;s Player of the Year awards (12).

La Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues globally, with an average attendance of 26,933 for league matches in the 2018–19 season. This is the eighth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the third-highest of any professional association football league in the world, behind fellow big five leagues Bundesliga and Premier League, and above Serie A and Ligue 1. La Liga is also the seventh wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue, after the NFL, MLB, the NBA, the Premier League, the NHL, and the Bundesliga.

From 2008 to 2016, it was sponsored by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and known as Liga BBVA. Then, from 2016 to 2023, it was sponsored by Banco Santander and known as LaLiga Santander. Since 2023, it has been sponsored by Electronic Arts and is known as LaLiga EA Sports.

==Competition format==
The competition format follows the usual double round-robin format. During the course of a season, which lasts from August to May, each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for 38 matches. Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, with the highest-ranked club crowned champion at the end of the season.

===Promotion and relegation===
A system of promotion and relegation exists between the &quot;Primera División&quot; and the &quot;Segunda División&quot;. The three lowest placed teams in La Liga are relegated to the &quot;Segunda División&quot;, and the top two teams from the &quot;Segunda División&quot; promoted to La Liga, with an additional club promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league&#x27;s history;

===Tie breaker rules===
If points are equal between two or more clubs, the rules are:
* If all clubs involved have played each other twice:
** If the tie is between two clubs, then the tie is broken using the head-to-head goal difference for those clubs (without away goals rule).
** If the tie is between more than two clubs, then the tie is broken using the games the clubs have played against each other:
*** a) head-to-head points
*** b) head-to-head goal difference
* If two legged games between all clubs involved have not been played, or the tie is not broken by the rules above, it is broken using:
** a) total goal difference
** b) total goals scored
* If the tie is still not broken, the winner will be determined by Fair Play scales. These are:
** yellow card, 1 point
** doubled yellow card/ejection, 2 points
** direct red card, 3 points
** suspension or disqualification of coach, executive or other club personnel (outside referees&#x27; decisions), 5 points
** misconduct of the supporters: mild 5 points, serious 6 points, very serious 7 points
** stadium closure, 10 points
** if the Competition Committee removes a penalty, the points are also removed
* If the tie is still not broken, it will be resolved with a tie-break match in a neutral stadium.

===Qualification for European competitions===
====Current criteria====
The top four teams in La Liga qualify for the subsequent season&#x27;s UEFA Champions League league stage. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League also qualify for the subsequent season&#x27;s UEFA Champions League league stage.

The fifth place team in La Liga and the winner of the also qualify for the subsequent season&#x27;s UEFA Europa League group stage. However, if the winner also finished in the top five places in La Liga, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in La Liga. Furthermore, the sixth place (or seventh if sixth already qualifies due to the ) team qualifies for the subsequent season&#x27;s UEFA Conference League play-off round.

The number of places allocated to Spanish clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients, which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous five years. As of the end of the 2023–24 season, the ranking of Spain (and de facto La Liga) is second.

==History==
===Foundation===
In April 1928, José María Acha, a director at Arenas de Getxo, first proposed the idea of a national league in Spain. After much debate about the size of the league and who would take part, the Real Federación Española de Fútbol eventually agreed on the ten teams who would form the first &quot;Primera División&quot; in 1929. Arenas, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Real Unión were all selected as previous winners of the . Atlético Madrid, Espanyol and Europa qualified as runners-up and Racing de Santander qualified through a knockout competition. Only three of the founding clubs (Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Athletic Bilbao) have never been relegated from the &quot;Primera División&quot;.

===1930s: Athletic Bilbao dominion===

Although Barcelona won the first &quot;Liga&quot; in 1929 and Ricardo Zamora&#x27;s Real Madrid won their first titles in 1932 and 1933, it was Athletic Bilbao that set the early pace winning La Liga in 1930, 1931, 1934 and 1936 (in addition to four Copa trophies), and they also achieved the biggest win in La Liga history by beating Barcelona 12–1; This team, coached by Fred Pentland, is known by the nickname &quot;First historic squad&quot;, notably forming an attacking partnership with Bata, Guillermo Gorostiza, José Iraragorri, Chirri II and Lafuente. In 1935, Real Betis, then known as &quot;Betis Balompié&quot;, won their only title to date. &quot;Primera División&quot; was suspended during the Spanish Civil War.

In 1937, the teams in the Republican area of Spain, with the notable exception of the two Madrid clubs, competed in the Mediterranean League and Barcelona emerged as champions. Seventy years later, on 28 September 2007, Barcelona requested the Royal Spanish Football Federation (Spanish acronym RFEF) to recognise that title as a &quot;Liga&quot; title. This action was taken after RFEF was asked to recognise Levante&#x27;s Copa de la España Libre win as equivalent to trophy. Nevertheless, the governing body of Spanish football has not made an outright decision yet.

===1940s: Atlético Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia emerge===
When the &quot;Primera División&quot; resumed after the Spanish Civil War, it was Atlético Aviación (nowadays &quot;Atlético Madrid&quot;), Valencia, and Barcelona that emerged as the strongest clubs. Atlético were only awarded a place during the 1939–40 season as a replacement for Real Oviedo, whose ground had been damaged during the war. The club subsequently won its first Liga title and retained it in 1941. While other clubs lost players to exile, execution, and as casualties of the war, the Atlético team was reinforced by a merger. The young, pre-war squad of Valencia had also remained intact and in the post-war years matured into champions, gaining three Liga titles in 1942, 1944, and 1947. They were also runners-up in 1948 and 1949.

Athletic Bilbao was one of the clubs most affected by the war, since many of its players (sympathizers of the Republican faction) went into exile in Latin America and very few returned. But thanks to a search for young talents, they managed to form the well-known &quot;Second historic squad&quot; made up of Rafael Iriondo, Venancio Pérez, José Luis Panizo, Agustín Gaínza and the mythical scorer Telmo Zarra (Spanish top scorer in La Liga history, among other records). They won a La Liga and Copa del Generalísimo double in 1943 and won the Cup again in 1944, 1945 and 1950, in addition to an Copa Eva Duarte (official predecessor of the Supercopa). Sevilla also enjoyed a brief golden era, finishing as runners-up in 1940 and 1942 before winning their only title to date in 1946.

Meanwhile, on the other side of Spain, Barcelona began to emerge as a force under the legendary Josep Samitier. A Spanish footballer for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, Samitier cemented his legacy with Barcelona. During his playing career with Barcelona he scored 133 goals, won the inaugural La Liga title and five Copa Del Rey. In 1944, Samitier returned to Barcelona as a coach and guided them in winning their second La Liga title in 1945. Under Samitier and legendary players César Rodríguez, Josep Escolà, Estanislau Basora and Mariano Gonzalvo, Barcelona dominated La Liga in the late 1940s, winning back to back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949. The 1940s proved to be a successful season for Barcelona, winning three La Liga titles and one Copa Del Rey, but the 1950s proved to be a decade of dominance, not just from Barcelona, but from Real Madrid.

===1950s: FC Barcelona and Real Madrid Dominate ===
Although Atlético Madrid, previously known as &quot;Atlético Aviación&quot;, were champions in 1950 and 1951 under mastermind Helenio Herrera, the 1950s continued the success FC Barcelona had during the late 1940s.

During this decade, FC Barcelona&#x27;s first golden era emerged under coach Ferdinand Daučík, winning back-to-back La Liga and Copa Del Rey doubles in 1951–52 and 1952–53. In 1952, FC Barcelona made history yet again by winning five distinctive trophies in one year. This team, composed of László Kubala, Mariano Gonzalvo, César Rodríguez Álvarez, and Joan Segarra, won La Liga, Copa Del Rey, Copa Eva Duarte (predecessor of Spanish Super Cup), Latin Cup and Copa Martini &amp; Rossi. Their success in winning five trophies in one year earned them the name &#x27;L’equip de les cinc Copes&#x27; or The Team of the Five Cups.

In the latter parts of the 1950s, coached by Helenio Herrera and featuring Luis Suárez, Barcelona won yet again back-to-back La Liga&#x27;s, winning them in 1959 and 1960. In 1959, Barcelona also won another double of La Liga / Copa Del Rey, conquering three doubles in the 1950s.

The 1950s also saw the beginning of the Real Madrid dominance. During the 1930s through the 1950s there were strict limits imposed on foreign players. In most cases, clubs could have only three foreign players in their squads, meaning that at least eight local players had to play in every game. During the 1950s, however, these rules were circumvented by Real Madrid who naturalised Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás. Di Stéfano, Puskás, Raymond Kopa and Francisco Gento formed the nucleus of the Real Madrid team that dominated the second half of the 1950s. Real Madrid won their third La Liga in 1954 — their first since 1933 — and retained their title in 1955. In 1956, Athletic Bilbao won their sixth La Liga title, but Real Madrid won La Liga again in 1957 and 1958.

All in all, Barcelona and Real Madrid won four La Liga titles each in the 1950s, with Atlético Madrid winning two and Athletic Bilbao winning one during this decade.

===1960s–1970s: Real Madrid superiority===
Real Madrid dominated La Liga between 1960 and 1980, being crowned champions 14 times. Real Madrid won five La Liga titles in a row from 1961 to 1965 as well as winning three doubles between 1960 and 1980. During the 1960s and 1970s, only Atlético Madrid offered Real Madrid any serious challenge. Atlético Madrid were crowned La Liga champions four times in 1966, 1970, 1973, and 1977. Atlético Madrid also finished second place in 1961, 1963, and 1965. In 1971, Valencia won their fourth La Liga title in 1971 under Alfredo Di Stéfano, and the Johan Cruyff-inspired Barcelona won their ninth La Liga in 1974.

===1980s: Real Madrid dominate but the Basque Clubs disrupt their monopoly===
Real Madrid&#x27;s monopoly in La Liga was interrupted significantly in the 1980s. Although Real Madrid won another five La Liga titles from 1986 to 1990 under the brilliance of Emilio Butragueño and Hugo Sánchez, the Basque clubs of Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao also dominated the 1980s. Real Sociedad won their first La Liga titles in 1981 and 1982; Luis Arconada, Roberto López Ufarte and Txiki Begiristain stood out from this team. Later, Athletic Bilbao also managed to win two consecutive La Liga titles in 1983 and 1984, also achieving their fifth La Liga and Copa del Rey double in 1984; The stars Andoni Zubizarreta, Santi Urkiaga, Andoni Goikoetxea, Dani, Manuel Sarabia and Estanislao Argote made this success possible. For its part, Barcelona won their tenth La Liga title in 1985 under coach Terry Venables, their first La Liga win since 1974.

===1990s: Barcelona&#x27;s Dream Team===

Johan Cruyff returned to Barcelona as manager in 1988, and assembled the legendary &quot;Dream Team&quot;. When Cruyff took control of his Barcelona side, they had won only two La Liga titles in the past 20 years. Cruyff decided to build a team composed of international stars and La Masia graduates in order to restore Barcelona to their former glory days. This team was formed by international stars Romario, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman. Cruyff&#x27;s Dream Team also consisted of La Masia graduates Pep Guardiola, Albert Ferrer and Guillermo Amor, as well as Basque Andoni Zubizarreta.

Johan Cruyff changed the way modern football was played, and incorporated the principles of Total Football into this team. The success of possession-based football was revolutionary, and Cruyff&#x27;s team won their first European Cup in 1992 and four consecutive La Liga titles between 1991 and 1994. In total, Cruyff won eleven trophies in eight years, making him the most successful manager in Barcelona&#x27;s history, until the record was broken by his protégé Pep Guardiola two decades later.

Barcelona&#x27;s run ended with Real Madrid winning La Liga in 1995. Atlético Madrid won their ninth La Liga title in 1996, as well as their only Liga/Copa Del Rey double, before Real Madrid added another league title to their cabinet in 1997. After the success of Cruyff, another Dutchman – Ajax manager, Louis van Gaal – arrived at the Camp Nou, and with the talents of Luís Figo, Luis Enrique, and Rivaldo, Barcelona won the La Liga title in 1998 and 1999, including their fourth double of Liga and Copa Del Rey in 1998. All in all, Barcelona won six La Liga titles in the 1990s.

===2000s: Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia&#x27;s re-emergence===
The 21st century continued the success Barcelona had in the 1990s under Johan Cruyff, dominating La Liga. Although Real Madrid had been prominent, Barcelona created a hegemony in Spain not seen since the Real Madrid of the 1960s–70s. Since the start of the new century, Barcelona won ten La Ligas, including two trebles and four doubles. This new century however has also seen new challengers being crowned champions. Between 1999–2000 and 2004, Deportivo La Coruña finished in the top three on five occasions, a better record than either Real Madrid or Barcelona, and in 2000, under Javier Irureta, Deportivo became the ninth team to be crowned champions. Valencia were one of the strongest teams in Europe in the early to mid 2000s; they were crowned La Liga champions in 2002 and 2004 under Rafael Benítez, whilst also being runners-up in the UEFA Champions League in 2000 and 2001 under Hector Cuper and winning the UEFA Cup in 2004 and the in 1999.

Real Madrid won their first Liga titles of the century in 2001 and 2003. With world-class players like Raúl, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Gonzalo Higuaín, Real Madrid won back-to-back La Liga titles in 2006–07 and 2007–08. Barcelona won their first title of the new century after Real Madrid and Valencia had shared the last four titles under the brilliance of Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto&#x27;o in the 2004–05 season. Barcelona retained the title to make it back-to-back wins in the 2005–06 season.

===2010s: Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atlético===
In 2009–10, Real Madrid achieved a record 96 points but still finished behind Barcelona, who amassed 99 points. Barcelona then won a third straight La Liga title in the 2010–11 season with 96 points to Real&#x27;s 92, but Real Madrid ended their winning streak in the 2011–12 season under the management of José Mourinho and with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Ángel Di María, Mesut Özil and Karim Benzema. Madrid won their 32nd La Liga title with a record 100 points, a record 121 goals scored and a record +89 goal difference. The following year, in the 2012–13 season, Barcelona won yet another La Liga title under coach Tito Vilanova, replicating the 100 points record Real Madrid achieved the previous year. Atlético Madrid, under the management of Diego Simeone, won their tenth La Liga title in 2013–14, their first since 1996. They became the first team since Valencia in 2004 to win La Liga and break Barcelona and Real Madrid&#x27;s dominion over the league. In the 2014–15 season, under the trio of Messi, Neymar, and Suarez nicknamed &#x27;MSN&#x27;, Barcelona made history by becoming the first team to achieve a second Treble, and winning a sixth Liga/Copa Del Rey double. Barcelona continued their dominance, and in the 2015–16 season they won a back-to-back Liga/Copa Del Rey double, something that had not been achieved since the 1950s. Real Madrid brought back the La Liga title under the management of Zinedine Zidane in 2016–17, but Barcelona won the title again in the 2017–18 season, as well as winning their eighth double, for seven La Liga titles in ten years. Barcelona retained the title yet again and won their 26th La Liga title in the 2018–19 season, for eight La Liga titles in eleven years. Real Madrid reclaimed the title in 2019–20, winning the season that was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

===2020s: present===
The 2020–21 season started on 12 September, and was won by Atlético Madrid, with Real Madrid as runners-up. In August 2021, La Liga clubs approved a €2.7 billion deal to sell 10% of the league to CVC Capital Partners. The 2021–22 season was won by Real Madrid with four games to spare, while the 2022–23 season was won by Barcelona with four games to spare.

In 2023, La Liga rebranded itself with a new logo and new sponsor. EA (Electronic Arts) replaced the Spanish financial services giant Santander that was the title sponsor of the league for seven years. LaLiga EA Sports and LaLiga Hypermotion are the names of the &quot;Primera&quot; and &quot;Segunda&quot; Divisions, starting in the 2023–24 season and for the following four seasons. Following the flash floods disaster that hit Spain at the end of October, claiming the lives of over 200 people, the Spanish league postponed all matches scheduled to be played in the Valencian region on Thursday. The games played after the floods opened in a moment of silence.

==Clubs==
20 teams already contest the league in its current season, including the top 17 sides from the 2023–24 season and three promoted from the 2023–24 Segunda División. Leganés and Real Valladolid were promoted directly, and Espanyol won the promotion play-off.

==La Liga clubs in Europe==

The &quot;Primera División&quot; is currently third in the UEFA rankings of European leagues based on their performances in European competitions over a five-year period, behind England&#x27;s Premier League and Italy&#x27;s Serie A, but ahead of Germany&#x27;s Bundesliga and France&#x27;s Ligue 1.

Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético Madrid have been in the top ten most successful clubs in European football in terms of total European trophies. These three clubs, along with Sevilla and Valencia, are the only Spanish clubs to have won five or more international trophies. Deportivo La Coruña are the joint fifth-most participating Spanish team in the Champions League with Sevilla — after Real Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Atlético Madrid — with five consecutive Champions League appearances, including a semi-finals appearance in 2003–04.

During the 2005–06 European season, La Liga became the first league to have its clubs win both the Champions League and UEFA Cup since 1997, as Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League and Sevilla won the UEFA Cup. This feat was repeated four times in five seasons: during the 2013–14 season Real Madrid won their tenth Champions League title and Sevilla won their third Europa League, during the 2014–15 season Barcelona won their fifth Champions League title and Sevilla won their fourth Europa League, during the 2015–16 season Real Madrid won their eleventh Champions League title and Sevilla won their fifth Europa League (becoming the first team to win the title three times in a row), and during the 2017–18 season Real Madrid won their thirteenth Champions League title and Atlético Madrid won their third Europa League.

In 2015, La Liga became the first league to enter five teams in the Champions League group stage, with Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid and Valencia qualifying via their league position and Sevilla qualifying by virtue of their victory in the Europa League, courtesy of a rule change.

==Champions==
===Performance by club===
==Players==
===Eligibility of non-EU players===
In La Liga in 2020, each club is allowed five non-EU players but are only allowed to name three non-EU players in each matchday squad.

Players can claim citizenship from the nation their ancestors came from. If a player does not have European ancestry, he can claim Spanish citizenship after playing in Spain for five years. Sometimes, this can lead to a triple-citizenship situation; for example, Leo Franco, who was born in Argentina, is of Italian heritage yet can claim a Spanish passport, having played in La Liga for over five years.

In addition, players from the ACP countries—countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement—are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

===Individual awards===
Until the 2008–09 season, no official individual awards existed in La Liga. In the 2008–09 season, the governing body created the LFP Awards (now called La Liga Awards), awarded each season to individual players and coaches. The majority of these awards were discontinued after the 2015–16 season. Additional awards relating to La Liga are distributed, some not sanctioned by the Liga de Futbol Profesional or RFEF and therefore not regarded as official. The most notable of these are four awarded by Spain&#x27;s largest sports paper, &quot;Marca&quot;, namely the Pichichi Trophy, awarded to the top scorer of the season; the Ricardo Zamora Trophy, for the goalkeeper with the fewest goals allowed per game (minimum 28 games); the Alfredo Di Stéfano Trophy, for the player judged to be the best overall player in the division; and the Zarra Trophy, for the top scorer among Spanish domestic players.

Since the 2013–14 season, La Liga has also bestowed the monthly manager of the month and player of the month awards.

===Transfers===
The first La Liga player to be involved in a transfer which broke the world record was Luis Suárez in 1961, who moved from Barcelona to Inter Milan for £152,000 (£ million in ). 12 years later, Johan Cruyff was the first player to join a club in La Liga for a record fee of £922,000 (£ million in ), when he moved from Ajax to Barcelona. In 1982, Barcelona again set the record by signing Diego Maradona from Boca Juniors for £5 million (£ million in ). Real Betis set the world record in 1998 when they signed Denílson from São Paulo for £21.5 million (£ million in ).

Four of the last six world transfer records have been set by Real Madrid, signing Luís Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Cristiano Ronaldo (plus a deal for Kaká days before Ronaldo which fell just below a world record due to the way the fee was calculated) and finally Gareth Bale, who was bought in 2013 for £85.3m (€103.4m or $140m at the time; £m in ) from Tottenham Hotspur.

Brazilian forward Neymar was the subject of an expensive and complicated transfer arrangement when he joined Barcelona from Santos in 2013, and his outgoing transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 set a new world record fee at €222m via his buyout clause. Barcelona soon invested a large amount of the money received from this transfer in a replacement, Ousmane Dembélé, whose deal – €105m – was the second most expensive ever before Philippe Coutinho&#x27;s transfer to Barcelona for €142m in January 2018.

<text>In the history of cryptography, Typex (alternatively, Type X or TypeX) machines were British cipher machines used from 1937. It was an adaptation of the commercial German Enigma with a number of enhancements that greatly increased its security. The cipher machine (and its many revisions) was used until the mid-1950s when other more modern military encryption systems came into use.

==Description==
Like Enigma, Typex was a rotor machine. Typex came in a number of variations, but all contained five rotors, as opposed to three or four in the Enigma. Like the Enigma, the signal was sent through the rotors twice, using a &quot;reflector&quot; at the end of the rotor stack. On a Typex rotor, each electrical contact was doubled to improve reliability.

Of the five rotors, typically the first two were stationary. These provided additional enciphering without adding complexity to the rotor turning mechanisms. Their purpose was similar to the plugboard in the Enigmas, offering additional randomization that could be easily changed. Unlike Enigma&#x27;s plugboard, however, the wiring of those two rotors could not be easily changed day-to-day. Plugboards were added to later versions of Typex.

The major improvement the Typex had over the standard Enigma was that the rotors in the machine contained multiple notches that would turn the neighbouring rotor. This eliminated an entire class of attacks on the system, whereas Enigma&#x27;s fixed notches resulted in certain patterns appearing in the cyphertext that could be seen under certain circumstances.

Some Typex rotors came in two parts, where a &quot;slug&quot; containing the wiring was inserted into a metal casing. Different casings contained different numbers of notches around the rim, such as 5, 7 or 9 notches. Each slug could be inserted into a casing in two different ways by turning it over. In use, all the rotors of the machine would use casings with the same number of notches. Normally five slugs were chosen from a set of ten.

On some models, operators could achieve a speed of 20 words a minute, and the output ciphertext or plaintext was printed on paper tape. For some portable versions, such as the Mark III, a message was typed with the left hand while the right hand turned a handle.

Several Internet Typex articles say that only Vaseline was used to lubricate Typex machines and that no other lubricant was used. Vaseline was used to lubricate the rotor disc contacts. Without this there was a risk of arcing which would burn the insulation between the contacts. For the rest of the machine two grades of oil (Spindle Oils 1 and 2) were used. Regular cleaning and maintenance was essential. 
In particular, the letters/figures cam-cluster balata discs had to be kept lubricated.

==History and development==
By the 1920s, the British Government was seeking a replacement for its book cipher systems, which had been shown to be insecure and which proved to be slow and awkward to use. In 1926, an inter-departmental committee was formed to consider whether they could be replaced with cipher machines. Over a period of several years and at large expense, the committee investigated a number of options but no proposal was decided upon. One suggestion was put forward by Wing Commander Oswyn G. W. G. Lywood to adapt the commercial Enigma by adding a printing unit but the committee decided against pursuing Lywood&#x27;s proposal.

In August 1934, Lywood began work on a machine authorised by the RAF. Lywood worked with J. C. Coulson, Albert P. Lemmon, and Ernest W. Smith at Kidbrooke in Greenwich, with the printing unit provided by Creed &amp; Company. The first prototype was delivered to the Air Ministry on 30 April 1935. In early 1937, around 30 Typex Mark I machines were supplied to the RAF. The machine was initially termed the &quot;RAF Enigma with Type X attachments&quot;.

The design of its successor had begun by February 1937. In June 1938, Typex Mark II was demonstrated to the cipher-machine committee, who approved an order of 350 machines. The Mark II model was bulky, incorporating two printers: one for plaintext and one for ciphertext. As a result, it was significantly larger than the Enigma, weighing around , and measuring × × . After trials, the machine was adopted by the RAF, Army and other government departments. During World War II, a large number of Typex machines were manufactured by the tabulating machine manufacturer Powers-Samas.

Typex Mark III was a more portable variant, using the same drums as the Mark II machines powered by turning a handle (it was also possible to attach a motor drive). The maximum operating speed is around 60 letters a minute, significantly slower than the 300 achievable with the Mark II.

Typex Mark VI was another handle-operated variant, measuring × ×, weighing and consisting of over 700 components.

Plugboards for the reflector were added to the machine from November 1941.

For inter-Allied communications during World War II, the Combined Cipher Machine (CCM) was developed, used in the Royal Navy from November 1943. The CCM was implemented by making modifications to Typex and the United States ECM Mark II machine so that they would be compatible.

Typex Mark VIII was a Mark II fitted with a morse perforator.

Typex 22 (BID/08/2) and Typex 23 (BID/08/3) were late models, that incorporated plugboards for improved security. Mark 23 was a Mark 22 modified for use with the CCM. In New Zealand, Typex Mark II and Mark III were superseded by Mark 22 and Mark 23 on 1 January 1950. The Royal Air Force used a combination of the Creed Teleprinter and Typex until 1960. This amalgamation allowed a single operator to use punch tape and printouts for both sending and receiving encrypted material.

Erskine (2002) estimates that around 12,000 Typex machines were built by the end of World War II.

==Security and use==
Less than a year into the war, the Germans could read all British military encryption other than Typex, which was used by the British armed forces and by Commonwealth countries including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Royal Navy decided to adopt the RAF Type X Mark II in 1940 after trials; eight stations already had Type X machines. Eventually over 600 machines would be required. New Zealand initially got two machines at a cost of £115 (GBP) each for Auckland and Wellington.

From 1943 the Americans and the British agreed upon a Combined Cipher Machine (CCM). The British Typex and American ECM Mark II could be adapted to become interoperable. While the British showed Typex to the Americans, the Americans never permitted the British to see the ECM, which was a more complex design. Instead, attachments were built for both that allowed them to read messages created on the other.

In 1944 the Admiralty decided to supply 2 CCM Mark III machines (the Typex Mark II with adaptors for the American CCM) for each &quot;major&quot; war vessel down to and including corvettes but not submarines; RNZN vessels were the &quot;Achilles&quot;, &quot;Arabis&quot; (then out of action), &quot;Arbutus&quot;, &quot;Gambia&quot; and &quot;Matua&quot;.

Although a British test cryptanalytic attack made considerable progress, the results were not as significant as against the Enigma, due to the increased complexity of the system and the low levels of traffic.

A Typex machine without rotors was captured by German forces at Dunkirk during the Battle of France and more than one German cryptanalytic section proposed attempting to crack Typex; however, the &quot;B-Dienst&quot; codebreaking organisation gave up on it after six weeks, when further time and personnel for such attempts were refused.

One German cryptanalyst stated that the Typex was more secure than the Enigma since it had seven rotors, therefore no major effort was made to crack Typex messages as they believed that even the Enigma&#x27;s messages were unbreakable.

Although the Typex has been attributed as having good security, the historic record is much less clear. There was an ongoing investigation into Typex security that arose out of German POWs in North Africa claiming that Typex traffic was decipherable.

A brief excerpt from the report

&lt;poem&gt;TOP SECRET U [ZIP/SAC/G.34]
THE POSSIBLE EXPLOITATION OF TYPEX BY THE GERMAN SIGINT SERVICES

The following is a summary of information so far received on German attempts to break into the British Typex machine, based on P/W interrogations carried out during and subsequent to the war. It is divided into (a) the North African interrogations, (b) information gathered after the end of the war, and (c) an attempt to sum up the evidence for and against the possibility of German successes.

Apart from an unconfirmed report from an agent in France on 19 July 1942 to the effect that the GAF were using two British machines captured at DUNKIRK for passing their own traffic between BERLIN and GOLDAP, our evidence during the war was based on reports that OKH was exploiting Typex material left behind in TOBRUK in 1942.&lt;/poem&gt;

Typex machines continued in use long after World War II. The New Zealand military used TypeX machines until the early 1970s, disposing of its last machine in about 1973.

==Advantages over Enigma==
All the versions of the Typex had advantages over the German military versions of the Enigma machine. The German equivalent teleprinter machines in World War II (used by higher-level but not field units) were the Lorenz SZ 40/42 and Siemens and Halske T52 using Fish cyphers.

* Most versions of the Enigma required two operators to operate effectively—one operator to input text into the Enigma and the other to copy down the enciphered or deciphered characters—Typex required just one operator.
* Typex avoided operator copying errors, as the enciphered or deciphered text was automatically printed on paper tape.
* Unlike Enigma, Typex I machines were linked to teleprinters while Typex II machines could be if required.
* Enigma messages had to be written, enciphered, transmitted (by Morse), received, deciphered, and written again, while Typex messages were typed and automatically enciphered and transmitted all in one step, with the reverse also true.

<text>The National Guard is a state-based military force that becomes part of the U.S. military&#x27;s reserve components of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force when activated for federal missions. It is a military reserve force composed of National Guard military members or units of each state and the territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico National Guard, and the District of Columbia National Guard, for a total of 54 separate organizations. It is officially created under Congress&#x27;s Article I, Section 8 enumerated power to &quot;raise and support Armies&quot;. All members of the National Guard are also members of the organized militia of the United States as defined by . National Guard units are under the dual control of U.S. state governments and the U.S. federal government.

The majority of National Guard soldiers and airmen hold a civilian job full-time while serving part-time as a National Guard member. These part-time guardsmen are augmented by a full-time cadre of Active Guard &amp; Reserve (AGR) personnel in both the Army National Guard and Air National Guard, plus Army Reserve Technicians in the Army National Guard and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) in the Air National Guard.

The National Guard is a joint activity of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) composed of reserve components of the United States Army and the United States Air Force: the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, respectively.

Colonial militias were formed during the British colonization of the Americas from the 17th century onward. The first colony-wide militia was formed by Massachusetts in 1636 by merging small, older local units, and several National Guard units can be traced back to this militia. The various colonial militias became state militias when the United States became independent. The title &quot;National Guard&quot; was used in 1824 by some New York State militia units, named after the French National Guard in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette. &quot;National Guard&quot; became a standard nationwide militia title in 1903, and has specifically indicated reserve forces under mixed state and federal control since 1933.

== Origins ==

On December 13, 1636, the first militia regiments in North America were organized in Massachusetts. Based upon an order of the Massachusetts Bay Colony&#x27;s General Court, the colony&#x27;s militia was organized into three permanent regiments to better defend the colony. Today, the descendants of these first regiments - the 181st Infantry, the 182nd Infantry, the 101st Field Artillery, and the 101st Engineer Battalion of the Massachusetts Army National Guard – share the distinction of being the oldest units in the U.S. military. December 13, 1636, thus marks the beginning of the organized militia, and the birth of the National Guard&#x27;s oldest organized units is symbolic of the founding of all the state, territory, and District of Columbia militias that collectively make up today&#x27;s National Guard.

Previous to this, unregulated militias were mustered sporadically in Spanish and English colonies. On September 16, 1565, in the newly established Spanish town of St. Augustine, militia were assigned to guard the expedition&#x27;s supplies while their leader, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, took the regular troops north to attack the French settlement at Fort Caroline on the St. Johns River. This Spanish militia tradition and the tradition that was established in England&#x27;s North American colonies provided the basic nucleus for Colonial defense in the New World.

The militia tradition continued with the New World&#x27;s first permanent English settlements. Jamestown Colony (established in 1607) and Plymouth Colony (established in 1620) both had militia forces, which initially consisted of every able-bodied adult male. By the mid-1600s every town had at least one militia company (usually commanded by an officer with the rank of captain), and the militia companies of a county formed a regiment (usually commanded by an officer with the rank of major in the 1600s or a colonel in the 1700s). The first federal laws regulating the militia were the Militia acts of 1792.

From the nation&#x27;s founding through the early 1900s, the United States maintained only a minimal army and relied on state militias, directly related to the earlier Colonial militias to supply the majority of its troops. As a result of the Spanish–American War, Congress was called upon to reform and regulate state militias&#x27; training and qualification.

U.S. Senator Charles W. F. Dick, a Major General in the Ohio National Guard and the chair of the Committee on the Militia, sponsored the 1903 Dick Act towards the end of the 57th U.S. Congress. Under this legislation, passed 21 January 1903, the organized militia of the states were given federal funding and required to conform to Regular Army organization within five years. The act also required National Guard units to attend twenty four drills and five days annual training a year, and, for the first time, provided for pay for annual training. In return for the increased federal funding which the act made available, militia units were subject to inspection by Regular Army officers, and had to meet certain standards.

It required the states to divide their militias into two sections. The law recommended the title &quot;National Guard&quot; for the first section, known as the organized militia, and &quot;Reserve Militia&quot; for all others.

During World War I, Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1916, which required the use of the term &quot;National Guard&quot; for the state militias and further regulated them. Congress also authorized the states to maintain Home Guards, which were reserve forces outside the National Guards deployed by the federal government.

In 1933, with the passage of the National Guard Mobilization Act, Congress finalized the split between the National Guard and the traditional state militias by mandating that all federally funded soldiers take a dual enlistment/commission and thus enter both the state National Guard and the National Guard of the United States, a newly created federal reserve force. The National Defense Act of 1947 created the Air Force as a separate branch of the Armed Forces and concurrently created the Air National Guard of the United States as one of its reserve components, mirroring the Army&#x27;s structure.

== Organization ==

=== Territorial organization ===
The National Guard of the several states, territories, and the District of Columbia serves as part of the first line of defense for the United States. The state National Guard is organized into units stationed in each of the 50 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia, and operates under their respective state or territorial governor, except in the instance of Washington, D.C., where the National Guard operates under the President of the United States or their designee. The governors exercise control through the state adjutants general. Governors may call up the National Guard for active duty to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.

=== National Guard Bureau ===

The National Guard is administered by the National Guard Bureau, a joint activity of the Army and Air Force under the Department of Defense. The National Guard Bureau provides a communication channel for state National Guards to the DoD. The National Guard Bureau also provides policies and requirements for training and funds for state Army National Guard and state Air National Guard units, the allocation of federal funds to the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, and other administrative responsibilities prescribed under . The National Guard Bureau is headed by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB), who is a four-star general in the Army or Air Force and is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The National Guard Bureau is headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia, and is a joint activity of the Department of Defense to conduct all the administrative matters pertaining to the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. The chief is either an Army or an Air Force four-star general officer, and is the senior uniformed National Guard officer, and is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In this capacity, he serves as a military adviser to the President, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council and is the Department of Defense&#x27;s official channel of communication to the Governors and to State Adjutants General on all matters pertaining to the National Guard. He is responsible for ensuring that the more than half a million Army and Air National Guard personnel are accessible, capable, and ready to protect the homeland and to provide combat resources to the Army and the Air Force. He is appointed by the President in his capacity as Commander in Chief.

=== Constitutional basis ===
The respective state National Guards are authorized by the Constitution of the United States. As originally drafted, the Constitution recognized the existing state militias, and gave them vital roles to fill: &quot;to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasion.&quot; (Article I, Section 8, Clause 15). The Constitution distinguished &quot;militias,&quot; which were state entities, from &quot;Troops,&quot; which were unlawful for states to maintain without Congressional approval. (Article I, Section 10, Clause 3). Under current law, the respective state National Guards and the State Defense Forces are authorized by Congress to the states and are referred to as &quot;troops.&quot; .

Although originally state entities, the Constitutional &quot;Militia of the Several States&quot; were not entirely independent because they could be federalized. According to Article I, Section 8; Clause 15, the United States Congress is given the power to pass laws for &quot;calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.&quot; Congress is also empowered to come up with the guidelines &quot;for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress&quot; (clause 16). The President of the United States is the commander-in-chief of the state militias &quot;when called into the actual Service of the United States.&quot; (Article II, Section 2).

The traditional state militias were redefined and recreated as the &quot;organized militia&quot;—the National Guard, via the Militia Act of 1903. They were now subject to an increasing amount of federal control, including having arms and accoutrements supplied by the central government, federal funding, and numerous closer ties to the Regular Army.

===Proposed Space National Guard===

Proposals for the establishment of a National Guard component for the United States Space Force has existed for years, even as early as 2018.

A report by the Congressional Budget Office indicated that the creation of a Space National Guard, as proposed by the National Guard Bureau, would cost an additional $100 million per year in operations and support costs, with a onetime cost of $20 million in the construction of new facilities. This report directly contradicted the statement by the National Guard Bureau that a Space National Guard would only have a onetime cost at creation, and then be cost-neutral.

The report also analyzed the cost of the creation of a larger Space National Guard, which would be ~33% of the Space Force, calculating that the annual operating cost would be $385 million to $490 million per year.

However, several states already have existing National Guard space operations, including Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, New York, Arkansas, and Ohio; there is also a space component in the Guam Air National Guard.

== Standards ==

Both the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are expected to adhere to the same moral and physical standards as their &quot;full-time&quot; active duty and &quot;part-time&quot; reserve federal counterparts. The same ranks and insignia of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force are used by the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, respectively, and National Guard members are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The respective state National Guards also bestow state awards for services rendered both at home and abroad. Under Army and Air Force regulations, these awards may be worn while in state, but not federal, duty status. Regular Army and Army Reserve soldiers are also authorized to accept these awards, but are not authorized to wear them. 


== Other organizations ==

=== State defense forces ===
Many states also maintain their own state defense forces. Although not federal entities like the National Guard of the United States, these forces are components of the state militias like the individual state National Guards.

These forces were created by Congress in 1917 as a result of the state National Guards&#x27; being deployed and were known as Home Guards. In 1940, with the onset of World War II and as a result of its federalizing the National Guard, Congress amended the National Defense Act of 1916, and authorized the states to maintain &quot;military forces other than National Guard.&quot; This law authorized the War Department to train and arm the new military forces that became known as State Guards. In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War and at the urging of the National Guard, Congress reauthorized the separate state military forces for a time period of two years. These state military forces were authorized military training at federal expense, and &quot;arms, ammunition, clothing, and equipment,&quot; as deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Army. In 1956, Congress finally revised the law and authorized &quot;State defense forces&quot; permanently under Title 32, Section 109, of the United States Code.

=== Naval militias ===

Although there are no Naval or Marine Corps components of the National Guard of the United States, there is a Naval Militia authorized under federal law.. Like the soldiers and airmen in the National Guard of the United States, members of the Naval Militia are authorized federal appointments or enlistments at the discretion of the Secretary of the Navy.. To receive federal funding and equipment, a state naval militia must be composed of at least 95% of Navy, Coast Guard, or Marine Corps Reservists. As such, some states maintain such units. Some states also maintain naval components of their State Defense Force. Recently, Alaska, California, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Texas and Ohio have had or currently maintain naval militias. Other states have laws authorizing them but do not currently have them organized. To receive federal funding, as is the case in the National Guard, a state must meet specific requirements such as having a set percentage of its members in the federal reserves..

== Duties and administrative organization ==
National Guard units can be mobilized for federal active duty to supplement regular armed forces during times of war or national emergency declared by Congress, the President or the Secretary of Defense. They can also be activated for service in their respective states upon declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state or territory where they serve, or in the case of Washington, D.C., by the Commanding General. Unlike U.S. Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually, except through voluntary transfers and Temporary Duty Assignments (TDY). The types of activation are as follows:

==National Guard active duty character==
The term &quot;activated&quot; simply means that a unit or individual of the reserve components has been placed on orders. The purpose and authority for that activation determine limitations and duration of the activation. The Army and Air National Guard may be activated in a number of ways as prescribed by public law. Broadly, under federal law, there are two titles in the United States Code under which units and troops may be activated: as federal soldiers or airmen under Title 10 (&quot;Armed Forces&quot;) and as state soldiers or airmen performing a federally-funded mission under Title 32 (&quot;National Guard&quot;). Outside federal activation, the Army and Air National Guard may be activated under state law. This is known as state active duty (SAD).

===State and territory duty===
When National Guard units are not under federal control, the governor is the commander-in-chief of the units of his or her respective state or territory (such as Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands). The President of the United States commands the District of Columbia National Guard, though this command is routinely delegated to the Commanding General of the DC National Guard. States are free to employ their National Guard forces under state control for state purposes and at state expense as provided in the state&#x27;s constitution and statutes. In doing so, governors, as commanders-in-chief, can directly access and utilize the Guard&#x27;s federally assigned aircraft, vehicles and other equipment so long as the federal government is reimbursed for the use of fungible equipment and supplies such as fuel, food stocks, etc. This is the authority under which governors activate and deploy National Guard forces in response to natural disasters. It is also the authority under which governors deploy National Guard forces in response to human-made emergencies such as riots and civil unrest, or terrorist attacks.
* The Governor can activate National Guard personnel to &quot;State Active Duty&quot; in response to natural or human-made disasters or Homeland Defense missions. State Active Duty is based on State statute and policy and on State funds. Soldiers and Airmen remain under the command and control of the Governor. The federal Posse Comitatus Act (PCA) does not apply under state active duty status or Title 32 status.
* Title 32 Full-Time National Guard Duty. (Federally funded, but command and control remains with the State Governor through his Adjutant General.) Title 32 activation can only be done by the President or SECDEF with the approval and consent of the state Governor.

===Federal duty===
Title 10 service means full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. The term used is &quot;federalized&quot;. Federalized National Guard forces have been ordered by the President to active duty either in their reserve component status or by calling them into Federal service in their militia status.
There are several forms:
* Voluntary Order to Active Duty.
:Federalized with the soldier&#x27;s or airman&#x27;s consent and the consent of their Governor.
* Partial Mobilization.
:In time of national emergency declared by the President for any unit or any member for not more than 24 consecutive months.
* Presidential Reserve Call Up.
:When the President determines that it is necessary to augment the active forces for any operational mission for any unit or any member for not more than 270 days.
* Federal Aid for State Governments.
:Whenever an insurrection occurs in any state against its government, the President may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor call into Federal service such of the militia of the other states. This is a statutory exception to the PCA.
* Use of Militia and Armed Forces to Enforce Federal Authority.
:Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, assemblages, or rebellion make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any state or territory, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of any state. This is another statutory exception to the PCA.
* Interference with State and Federal law.
:The President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a state, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.
* Air and Army National Guard.
:Air and Army National Guard can specifically be called into Federal service in case of invasion, rebellion, or inability to execute Federal law with active forces.

In the categories listed above, Army and Air National Guard units or individuals may also be mobilized for non-combat purposes such as the State Partnership Program, humanitarian missions, counter-drug operations, and peacekeeping or peace enforcement missions. An example of a National Guard being federalized was the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in 1963 where the Alabama National Guard was federalized in order to allow black students to enroll at the University of Alabama.

== History ==

=== Colonial history ===

On December 13, 1636, the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony ordered that the Colony&#x27;s scattered militia companies be organized into North, South and East Regiments—with the goal of increasing accountability to the colonial government and responsiveness during conflicts with indigenous Pequot Indians. Under this act, white males between the ages of 16 and 60 were obligated to possess arms and to take part in the defense of their communities by serving in nightly guard details and participating in weekly drills. The modern-day 101st Field Artillery Regiment, 182nd Infantry Regiment, 101st Engineer Battalion and 181st Infantry Regiment of the Massachusetts Army National Guard are directly descended from the original colonial regiments formed in 1636.

===American Revolutionary War===
The Massachusetts militia began the American Revolutionary War at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, The Massachusetts militia units were mobilized either during or shortly after the above battles and used to form, along with units from Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire, the Army of Observation during the Siege of Boston. On July 3, 1775, General George Washington, under the authority of the Continental Congress, assumed command of the Army of Observation and the new organization became the Continental Army from which the United States Army traces its origins.

Throughout the war, militia units were mobilized when British forces entered their geographic areas and participated in most of the battles fought during the war.

===Nineteenth century===
The early United States distrusted a standing army - in emulation of a long-standing British distrust - and kept the number of professional soldiers small. During the Northwest Indian War, the majority of soldiers were provided by state militias. There are nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812.

The Marquis de Lafayette visited the U.S. in 1824–25. The 2nd Battalion, 11th New York Artillery, was one of many militia commands who turned out in welcome. This unit decided to adopt the title &quot;National Guard,&quot; in honor of Lafayette&#x27;s French National Guard. The Battalion, later the 7th Regiment, was prominent in the line of march on the occasion of Lafayette&#x27;s final passage through New York en route home to France. Taking note of the troops named for his old command, Lafayette alighted from his carriage, walked down the line, clasping each officer by the hand as he passed.

Militia units provided 70% of the soldiers that fought in the Mexican–American War, and also provided the majority of soldiers in the early months of the American Civil War The majority of soldiers in the Spanish–American War were from the National Guard.

===Industrialization and labor unrest===
Labor unrest in the industrial and mining sections of the Northeast and Midwest led to demands for a stronger military force within the states.

On July 14, 1877, workers on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) began to stop trains in Martinsburg, West Virginia in response to wage cuts. This protest developed into the national Great Railroad Strike of 1877. West Virginia governor Henry M. Mathews was the first state commander-in-chief to send in troops to break-up the protests, and this action has been viewed in retrospect as an incident that would transform the National Guard.

After the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, calls for military suppression of labor strikes grew louder, and National Guard units proliferated. In many states, large and elaborate armories, often built to resemble medieval castles, were constructed to house militia units. Businessmen and business associations donated monies for the construction of armories and to supplement funds of the local National Guard units. National Guard officers also came from the middle and upper classes.
National Guard troops were deployed to suppress strikers in some of the bloodiest and most significant conflicts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Homestead Strike, the Pullman Strike of 1894, and the Colorado Labor Wars.

===Twentieth century===
Throughout the 19th century the Regular U.S. Army was small, and the state militias provided the majority of the troops during the Mexican–American War, the American Civil War, and the Spanish–American War. With the Militia Act of 1903, the militia was more organized and the name &quot;National Guard&quot; recommended. In 1908, the prohibition on National Guard units serving overseas was dropped. This resulted in constitutional debates within the U.S. government surrounding the legality of the use of the National Guard overseas, culminating in 1912 when U.S. Attorney General George W. Wickersham declared the 1908 amendment to be unconstitutional. The National Defense Act of 1916 contained a provision whereby the president could discharge National Guard members from the militia and draft them into the Army in the event of a war, allowing for their use overseas. This resulted in former National Guard members being discharged from the Army entirely (also losing their status as state troops) when they left service, so the 1920 amendments to the act defined the National Guard&#x27;s dual role as a state and federal reserve force; the &quot;National Guard while in the service of the United States&quot; as a component of the Army of the United States could be ordered to active duty by the president, be deployed overseas if they so wished, and the Guardsmen would then revert to their status as state troops. The dual state and federal status proved confusing, so in 1933, the National Defense Act of 1916 was amended again. It finally severed the National Guard&#x27;s traditional connection with the militia clause of the Constitution, providing for a new component called the &quot;National Guard of the United States&quot; that was to be a reserve component of the Army of the United States at all times. This is the beginning of the present legal basis of the National Guard. In World War I, National Guard soldiers made up 40 percent of the men in U.S. combat divisions in France. In World War II, the National Guard made up 18 divisions. 

One hundred forty thousand Guardsmen were mobilized during the Korean War and over 63,000 for Operation Desert Storm. They have also participated in U.S. peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Kosovo and for natural disasters, strikes, riots and security for the Olympic Games when they have been in the States.

Following World War II, the National Guard aviation units that had previously been part of the U.S. Army Air Corps and its successor organization, the U.S. Army Air Forces, became the Air National Guard (ANG), one of two reserve components of the newly established United States Air Force.
===Domestic affairs===
Within hours of the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fire of April 1906, the California National Guard maintained order, protected lives and property and distributed relief supplies. Its role was controversial and it was withdrawn after 40 days. Federal troops also were used.

On September 24, 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalized the entire Arkansas National Guard to ensure the safe entry of the Little Rock Nine to Little Rock Central High School the following day. Governor Orval Faubus had previously used members of the guard to deny the students entry to the school.

The New York National Guard were ordered by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller to respond to the Rochester 1964 race riot in July of that year. The California Army National Guard were mobilized by the Governor of California Edmund Gerald Brown Sr. during the Watts Riots, in August 1965, to provide security and help restore order.

Elements of the Ohio Army National Guard were ordered to Kent State University by Ohio&#x27;s governor Jim Rhodes to quell anti-Vietnam War protests, culminating in their shooting into a crowd of students on May 4, 1970, killing four and injuring nine. The massacre was followed by the Student strike of 1970.

During the Vietnam War, service in the National Guard was highly sought after, as an enlistment in the Guard generally prevented a person from being sent to combat; only a handful of Guard units were ever deployed to Vietnam. In 1968, the National Guard had only 1.26% black soldiers.

During the Vietnam War, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara created the Selective Reserve Force (SRF) in October 1965. Since funding was not available to train and equip the entire National Guard adequately, the SRF would be a core group of 150,000 National Guardsmen available and ready for immediate overseas deployment if needed. SRF units were supposed to be authorized at 100% strength, receive priority training funds and modern equipment, and have more training and do 58 hours of drills of four hours each a year rather than the standard 48 hours of drills.

The 2nd Battalion 138th Field Artillery of the Kentucky Army National Guard was ordered to service in Vietnam in late 1968. The unit served in support of the regular 101st Airborne Division. The Battalion&#x27;s C Battery lost nine men killed and thirty-two wounded when North Vietnamese troops overran Fire Base Tomahawk on June 19, 1969.

During the early 1980s, the governors of California and Maine refused to allow deployment of their states&#x27; National Guard units to Central America. In 1986, Congress passed the Montgomery Amendment, which prohibited state governors from withholding their consent. In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled against the governor of Minnesota, who had sued over the deployment of the state&#x27;s National Guard units to Central America.

During the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, when portions of south central Los Angeles erupted in chaos, overwhelming the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s ability to contain the violence, the California Army National Guard and selected units of the California Air National Guard were mobilized to help restore order. The National Guard were attributed with five shootings of people suspected of violating the curfew order placed on the city.

During the 1993 Waco siege of the Branch Davidians, elements of the Alabama and Texas Army National Guard were called in to assist the ATF and the follow on effort by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the National Guard&#x27;s involvement was limited to several specific areas; surveillance and reconnaissance, transport, maintenance and repairs, training and instruction, helicopters, unarmed tactical ground vehicles. The Army National Guard helicopters were also used to do photographic reconnaissance work. Training for ATF agents included such subjects as Close Quarters Combat, and combat medical instruction, and a mock up of the Mount Carmel complex was constructed at Fort Hood, Texas for rehearsals. ATF also received several surplus helmets, flack vests, canteens, first aid dressings, empty magazines, and some night-vision equipment, in addition to MREs and diesel fuel. The FBI would request and receive the use of Bradley Armored Fighting Vehicles, and tank retrieval vehicles, as well as overflights by UH-1 and CH-47 helicopters.

===Post Cold War reductions===
As a result of the Bottom Up Review and post-Cold War force cutbacks, the Army National Guard maneuver force was reduced to eight divisions (from ten; the 26th Infantry and 50th Armored were consolidated in the northeastern states) and fifteen &#x27;enhanced brigades,&#x27; which were supposed to be ready for combat operations, augmenting the active force, within 90 days.

===Twenty-first century===
National Guard units played a major role in providing security and assisting recovery efforts in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

In 2005, National Guard members and reservists were said to comprise a larger percentage of frontline fighting forces than in any war in U.S. history (about 43 percent in Iraq and 55 percent in Afghanistan). There were more than 183,366 National Guard members and reservists on active duty nationwide who left behind about 300,000 dependents, according to U.S. Defense Department statistics. In 2011, Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr. stated that &quot;Every Guard brigade has deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, and over 300,000 Guardsmen have deployed in this war.&quot;

In January and February 2007, National Guard troops from 8 states were activated to go help shovel snow, drop hay for starving cattle, deliver food and necessities to stranded people in their houses, and help control traffic and rescue stranded motorists in blizzards dropping feet of snow across the country.

In the first quarter of 2007, United States Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates announced changes to the Guard deployment policy aimed at shorter and more predictable deployments for National Guard troops. &quot;Gates said his goal is for Guard members to serve a one-year deployment no more than every five years... Gates is imposing a one-year limit to the length of deployment for National Guard Soldiers, effective immediately.&quot; Prior to this time, Guard troops deployed for a standard one-year deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan would serve for 18 or more months including training and transit time. During the transition to the new policy for all troops in the pipeline, deployed or soon to be deployed, some will face deployments faster than every five years. &quot;The one-to-five year cycle does not include activations for state emergencies.&quot;


Prior to the attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, the National Guard&#x27;s general policy regarding mobilization was that Guardsmen would be required to serve no more than one year cumulative on active duty (with no more than six months overseas) for each five years of regular drill. Due to strains placed on active duty units following the attacks, the possible mobilization time was increased to 18 months (with no more than one year overseas). Additional strains placed on military units as a result of the invasion of Iraq further increased the amount of time a Guardsman could be mobilized to 24 months. Current Department of Defense policy is that no Guardsman is involuntarily activated for more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six-year enlistment period.

Traditionally, most National Guard personnel serve &quot;One weekend a month, two weeks a year&quot;, although personnel in highly operational or high demand units serve far more frequently. Typical examples are pilots, navigators and aircrewmen in active flying assignments, primarily in the Air National Guard, and to a lesser extent in the Army National Guard, and special operations airmen and soldiers in both. A significant number also serve in a full-time capacity in roles such as Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) or Air Reserve Technician or Army Reserve Technician (ART).

The &quot;One weekend a month, two weeks a year&quot; slogan has lost most of its relevance since the Iraq War, when nearly 28% of total U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan at the end of 2007 consisted of mobilized personnel of the National Guard and other Reserve components. In July 2012, the Army&#x27;s top general stated his intention to increase the annual drill requirement from two weeks per year to up to seven weeks per year.

Prior to 2008, the functions of Agricultural Development Teams were within Provincial Reconstruction Teams of the U.S. government. Today, ADTs consist of soldiers and airmen from the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. Today, ADTs bring &quot;an effective platform for enhanced dialogue, building confidence, sharing interests, and increasing cooperation amongst the disparate peoples and tribes of Afghanistan.&quot; These teams are not only affiliated with the military, they frequently work across agencies, for example with USAID and the Department of State. ADTs provide education and expertise on the ground, while also providing security and order that is traditionally affiliated with the military. These teams have been essential to the counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan as a public diplomacy tool to build relations with the local people in the tribes and provinces of the country.

ADTs provide classroom instruction and teachings to Afghans about how to improve their farming practices during non-seasonal growing months, which allows the farmers to use skills in the winter to prepare for farming in the summer and fall. This enhances agricultural production and the Afghan economy as a whole. Agricultural education also improves lines of communication and builds trust between the people, the U.S. government, and the Host Nation. Additionally, through word of mouth in the provinces ideas are spread that inform others about these farming techniques, that may not have had direct interaction with the ADTs. The National Guard ADTs also introduce their U.S. civilian colleagues to the Afghan University personnel, which further strengthens relations and trust in the U.S. efforts in Afghanistan.

ADTs also enhance public diplomacy in Afghanistan by providing security to the local provinces they are working within. This tool has provided the teams with the civilian-military partnership that is needed to conduct public diplomacy and defeat the insurgents in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama said that the U.S. will enhance agricultural development instead of big reconstruction projects to build Afghanistan&#x27;s economy, to have an immediate impact on the Afghan people. Today, these projects include &quot;...basic gardening practices, to large watershed and irrigation projects. There are also projects that teach bee keeping and livestock production: all of which will have a positive impact on unemployment, hunger, and the ability to sustain future generations.

More and more Afghan tribal leaders have been requesting additional ADTs, which illustrates how important the use of public diplomacy has been in the efforts to win the trust of the Afghan people. The case study from Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan serves as an excellent example. This province is one of the most stable and secure provinces in Afghanistan. For example, over 100,000 Afghans have returned to province; the province has also been declared poppy-free in 2007 by the UN. Additionally, most districts within the province have all-weather paved roads and it is also one of the most productive agricultural regions in Afghanistan.

In 2006, Congress considered giving the president the full authority to mobilize National Guard units within the U.S. without the consent of state governors. However, this was met with resistance from states governors and members of the National Guard. The act was eventually passed, but instead, the president&#x27;s authority was expanded to mobilize the reserve components for domestic operations without the consent of the governor, only during a natural disaster, terrorist attack, epidemic or other public health emergency. The following year, that authority was repealed.

In 2020, the National Guard was activated for 11,000,000 &quot;man days&quot; in support of natural disasters, civil unrest, food distribution at food banks, and COVID-19 testing and vaccination. This was the highest number of activation days since World War II.

==Relevant laws==
The United States Congress has enacted various laws that control the National Guard:

# The Militia Acts of 1792
#: Providing for the authority of the President to call out the Militia, and providing federal standards for the organization of the Militia.
#: For the 111 years that the Militia Act of 1792 remained in effect, it defined the position of the militia in relation to the federal government. The War of 1812 tested this uniquely American defense establishment. To fight the War of 1812, the republic formed a small regular military and trained it to protect the frontiers and coastlines. Although it performed poorly in the offensive against Canada, the small force of regulars backed by a well-armed militia, accomplished its defensive mission well. Generals like Andrew Jackson proved that, just as they had in the Revolution, regulars and militia could be effective when employed as a team.
# The Insurrection Act of 1807
# The Militia Act of 1862
#: Providing for the service of persons of African descent in the Militia, and the emancipation of slaves owned by Confederates.
# Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1385: The Posse Comitatus Act of June 18, 1878
#: Reaction in Congress against the Reconstruction-era suspensions of Southern states&#x27; rights to organize militias led to the passage of the &quot;Posse Comitatus&quot; Act, restricting any person&#x27;s use of the U.S. Army and, as later amended, the U.S. Air Force in domestic law enforcement (use of the Navy and Marine Corps, being uniformed services within the Department of Defense, is similarly restricted by statute). The U.S. Coast Guard, in its peacetime role within the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Guard, when not in Federal Service, are specifically not limited by this act.
# The States revise the military codes 1881 to 1892
# The Militia Act of 1903
#: Established the creation of the National Guard of the United States as the primary organized reserve force for the U.S. armed forces.
# National Defense Act of 1916
#: This act abandoned the idea of an expandable Regular Army and firmly established the traditional concept of the citizens&#x27; army as the keystone of the United States defense forces. It established the concept of merging the National Guard, the Army Reserve, and the Regular Army into the Army of the United States in time of war. The act further expanded the National Guard&#x27;s role, and guaranteed the State militias&#x27; status as the Army&#x27;s primary reserve force. The law mandated use of the term &quot;National Guard&quot; for that force, and the President was given authority, in case of war or national emergency, to mobilize the National Guard for the duration of the emergency. The number of yearly drills increased from 24 to 48 and annual training from five to 15 days. Drill pay was authorized for the first time.
# The National Defense Act Amendments of 1920
#: This act established that the chief of the Militia Bureau (later the National Guard Bureau) would be a National Guard officer, that National Guard officers would be assigned to the general staff and that the divisions, as used by the Guard in World War I, would be reorganized.
# The National Guard Mobilization Act of 1933
#: Made the National Guard a component of the Army.
# The National Security Act of 1947
#: Section 207 (f) established the Air National Guard of the United States, under the National Guard Bureau.
# The Total Force Policy from 1973
#: Requires all active and reserve military organizations be treated as a single force.
# The Montgomery Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987
#: &quot;Provides that a governor cannot withhold consent with regard to active duty outside the United States because of any objection to the location, purpose, type, or schedule of such duty.&quot; This law was challenged and upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1990 in &quot;Perpich v. Department of Defense&quot;.
# The John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 
#: Federal law was changed in section 1076 so that the Governor of a state is no longer the sole commander in chief of their state&#x27;s National Guard during emergencies &quot;within&quot; the state. The President of the United States could then take total control of a state&#x27;s National Guard units without the governor&#x27;s consent. In a letter to Congress, all 50 governors opposed the increase in power of the President over the National Guard.
# The National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 
#: Repeals provisions in section 1076 in Pub.L. 109-364 but still enables the President to call up the National Guard of the United States for active federal military service during Congressionally sanctioned national emergency or war. Places the National Guard Bureau directly under the Department of Defense as a joint activity. Elevated the Chief of the National Guard Bureau from a three-star to a four-star general.
#The National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 
#: Added the Chief, National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
# The National Defense Authorization Act of 2024 
#: Elevated the Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau from a three-star to a four-star general.

==Number of guardsmen by state, territory and D.C.==
A member of the National Guard, often called a &quot;guardsman,&quot; is a person who has signed an Enlistment Contract and has subscribed to an Enlistment Oath, is still alive, or has not yet been discharged. The subscription to the oath (typically a recitation) and the signature must be witnessed by a person, typically a Guard officer, authorized as an official witness. The term of the enlistment, or membership, runs from the date on the contract through the date on the discharge or the death certificate.

The &quot;number of guardsmen&quot; is a statistic generated by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), an agency of the DoD tasked with tracking the identities of all persons in the active military, its reserves, and civilians employed by it. Membership in the Guard may be regarded as an independent variable. It changes constantly. Its value at any instant cannot be known exactly. It can, however, be estimated from the records of the DMDC. Its data and reports are for the most part inaccessible to the general public, but it does make available some reports under the category &quot;DoD Personal, Workforce Reports &amp; Publications.&quot;

The series &quot;Military and Civilian Personnel by Service/Agency by State/Country (Updated Quarterly),&quot; containing the statistics on membership in the National Guard by state, territory, and D.C., is updated every 3rd month at the end of the month. For example, one was generated on June 30, 2017. Like all statistics, these numbers of guardsmen are a sample culled according to a certain method. The report states that it uses the sources: &quot;Active Duty Master File, RCCPDS, APF Civilian Master, CTS Deployment File, Civilian Deployment.&quot; The probabilities of the statistics being accurate to various percentages are not stated.

Below is a sample summary of a profile of National Guard membership as of September 30, 2020. Only the non-total columns come from the source. The totals are calculated from the data.

<text>The boa knot is a modern binding knot invented by weaver Peter Collingwood in 1996. His intention was to develop a knot that would hold well when the constricted object was cut close to the winds of the knot.

The boa knot is related to the strangle knot and the double constrictor knot. It combines both the structure and qualities of these other two knots. The boa knot can be very difficult to untie and is inappropriate when frequent or fast untying is needed. The knotted part needs to lie over a convex surface to hold.

The boa knot is best used for securing objects in cylindrical loads. Said knot is hard to move around.

<doc id="37992" wikidata="Q134990" url="?curid=37992" title="Hippocratic Oath">
<text>The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards. The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today. These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence. As the foundational articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value. It is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions, such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath&#x27;s symbolic nature.

The original oath was written in Ionic Greek, between the fifth and third centuries BC. Although it is traditionally attributed to the Greek doctor Hippocrates and it is usually included in the Hippocratic Corpus, some modern scholars do not regard it as having been written by Hippocrates himself.

==Text of the oath==
===Earliest surviving copy===

The oldest partial fragments of the oath date to circa AD 275. The oldest extant version dates to roughly the 10th–11th century, held in the Vatican Library. A commonly cited version, dated to 1595, appears in Koine Greek with a Latin translation. In this translation, the author translates to the Latin .

Below is the Hippocratic Oath, in Greek, from the 1923 Loeb edition, followed by the English translation:

===&quot;First do no harm&quot;===

It is often said that &quot;First do no harm&quot; () is a part of the original Hippocratic oath. A related phrase is found in Epidemics, Book I, of the Hippocratic school: &quot;Practice two things in your dealings with disease: either help or do not harm the patient&quot;. Although no such phrase from which &quot;First&quot; or &quot;Primum&quot; can be translated appears in any well recognized version of the oath, a similar intention is vowed by, &quot;I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm&quot;. &quot;Primum non nocere&quot; was claimed by the 19th-century English surgeon Thomas Inman to date from the 17th-century English physician Thomas Sydenham, but Sydenham&#x27;s available writings contain no such phrase or equivalent, and it more likely took shape from longstanding popular nonmedical expression.

==Context and interpretation==

The oath is arguably the best known text of the Hippocratic Corpus, although most modern scholars do not attribute it to Hippocrates himself, estimating it to have been written in the fourth or fifth century BC. Alternatively, classical scholar Ludwig Edelstein proposed that the oath was written by the Pythagoreans, an idea that others questioned for lack of evidence for a school of Pythagorean medicine. While Pythagorean philosophy displays a correlation to the Oath&#x27;s values, the proposal of a direct relationship has been mostly discredited in more recent studies.

Its general ethical principles are also found in other works of the Corpus: the Physician mentions the obligation to keep the &quot;holy things&quot; of medicine within the medical community (i.e. not to divulge secrets); it also mentions the special position of the doctor with regard to his patients, especially women and girls. However, several aspects of the oath contradict patterns of practice established elsewhere in the Corpus. Most notable is its ban on the use of the knife, even for small procedures such as lithotomy, even though other works in the Corpus provide guidance on performing surgical procedures.

Providing poisonous drugs would certainly have been viewed as immoral by contemporary physicians if it resulted in murder. However, the absolute ban described in the oath also forbids euthanasia. Several accounts of ancient physicians willingly assisting suicides have survived. Multiple explanations for the prohibition of euthanasia in the oath have been proposed: it is possible that not all physicians swore the oath, or that the oath was seeking to prevent widely held concerns that physicians could be employed as political assassins.

The interpreted AD 275 fragment of the oath contains a prohibition of abortion that is in contradiction to original Hippocratic text &quot;On the Nature of the Child&quot;, which contains a description of an abortion, without any implication that it was morally wrong, and descriptions of abortifacient medications are numerous in the ancient medical literature. The oath&#x27;s stance on abortion was unclear even in the ancient world where physicians debated whether the specification of pessaries was a ban on simply pessaries, or a blanket ban on all abortion methods. Scribonius Largus was adamant in AD 43 (the earliest surviving reference to the oath) that it precluded abortion. In the 1st or 2nd century AD work &quot;Gynaecology&quot;, Soranus of Ephesus wrote that one party of medical practitioners followed the Oath and banished all abortifacients, while the other party—to which he belonged—was willing to prescribe abortions, but only for the sake of the mother&#x27;s health. William Henry Samuel Jones states that &quot;abortion[...] though doctors are forbidden to cause it, was possibly not condemned in all cases&quot;. He believed that the oath prohibited abortions, though not under all circumstances. John M. Riddle argues that because Hippocrates specified pessaries, he only meant pessaries and therefore it was acceptable for a Hippocratic doctor to perform abortions using oral drugs, violent means, a disruption of daily routine or eating habits, and more. Other scholars, most notably Ludwig Edelstein, believe that the author intended to prohibit any and all abortions. Olivia De Brabandere writes that regardless of the author&#x27;s original intention, the vague and polyvalent nature of the relevant line has allowed both professionals and non-professionals to interpret and use the oath in several ways. While many Christian versions of the Hippocratic Oath, particularly from the Middle Ages, explicitly prohibited abortion, the prohibition is often omitted from many oaths taken in US medical schools today, though it remains controversial.

The oath stands out among comparable ancient texts on medical ethics and professionalism through its heavily religious tone, a factor which makes attributing its authorship to Hippocrates particularly difficult. Phrases such as &quot;but I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art&quot; suggest a deep, almost monastic devotion to the art of medicine. He who keeps to the oath is promised &quot;reputation among all men for my life and for my art&quot;. This contrasts heavily with Galenic writings on professional ethics, which employ a far more pragmatic approach, where good practice is defined as effective practice, without reference to deities.

The oath&#x27;s importance among the medical community is nonetheless attested by its appearance on the tombstones of physicians, and by the fourth century AD it had come to stand for the medical profession.

The oath continued to be in use in the Byzantine Christian world with its references to pagan deities replaced by a Christian preamble, as in the 12th-century manuscript pictured in the shape of a cross.

==Modern versions and relevance==

The Hippocratic Oath has been eclipsed as a document of professional ethics by more extensive, regularly updated ethical codes issued by national medical associations, such as the American Medical Association&#x27;s &quot;Code of Medical Ethics&quot; (first adopted in 1847), and the British General Medical Council&#x27;s &quot;Good Medical Practice&quot;. These documents provide a comprehensive overview of the obligations and professional behaviour of a doctor to their patients and wider society. Doctors who violate these codes may be subjected to disciplinary proceedings, including the loss of their license to practice medicine. Nonetheless, the length of these documents has made their distillations into shorter oaths an attractive proposition. In light of this fact, several updates to the oath have been offered in modern times, some facetious.

The oath has been modified numerous times.

One of the most significant revisions was first drafted in 1948 by the World Medical Association (WMA), called the Declaration of Geneva. &quot;During the post World War II and immediately after its foundation, the WMA showed concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world. The WMA took up the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world&#x27;s physicians. It noted that in those years the custom of medical schools to administer an oath to its doctors upon graduation or receiving a license to practice medicine had fallen into disuse or become a mere formality&quot;. In Nazi Germany, medical students did not take the Hippocratic Oath, although they knew the ethic of &quot;nil nocere&quot;—do no harm.

In the 1960s, the Hippocratic Oath was changed to require &quot;utmost respect for human life from its beginning&quot;, making it a more secular obligation, not to be taken in the presence of any gods, but before only other people. When the oath was rewritten in 1964 by Louis Lasagna, Academic Dean of the School of Medicine at Tufts University, the prayer was omitted, and that version has been widely accepted and is still in use today by many US medical schools:

 I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:

I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.

I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.

I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon&#x27;s knife or the chemist&#x27;s drug.

I will not be ashamed to say &quot;I know not&quot;, nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient&#x27;s recovery.

I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.

I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person&#x27;s family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.

I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.
I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.

If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.

In a 1989 survey of 126 US medical schools, only three of them reported use of the original oath, while thirty-three used the Declaration of Geneva, sixty-seven used a modified Hippocratic Oath, four used the Oath of Maimonides, one used a covenant, eight used another oath, one used an unknown oath, and two did not use any kind of oath. Seven medical schools did not reply to the survey.

As of 1993, only 14% of medical oaths prohibited euthanasia, and only 8% prohibited abortion.

In a 2000 survey of US medical schools, all of the then extant medical schools administered some type of professional oath. Among schools of modern medicine, sixty-two of 122 used the Hippocratic Oath, or a modified version of it. The other sixty schools used the original or modified Declaration of Geneva, Oath of Maimonides, or an oath authored by students or faculty or both. All nineteen osteopathic schools in the United States used the Osteopathic Oath, which is taken in place of or in addition to the Hippocratic Oath. The Osteopathic Oath was first used in 1938, and the current version has been in use since 1954.

In France, it is common for new medical graduates to sign a written oath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Letters, BMJ 8/8/1994&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Sir Joseph Rotblat, in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize, suggested a Hippocratic Oath for Scientists.

In November 2005, Saparmurat Niyazov, then leader of Turkmenistan, declared that doctors should swear an oath to him instead of the Hippocratic Oath.

In 2007, US citizen Rafiq Abdus Sabir was convicted for making a pledge to al-Qaeda, thus agreeing to provide medical aid to wounded terrorists.

As of 2018, all US medical school graduates made some form of public oath but none used the original Hippocratic Oath. A modified form or an oath unique to that school is often used. A review of 18 of these oaths was criticized for their wide variability: &quot;Consistency would help society see that physicians are members of a profession that&#x27;s committed to a shared set of essential ethical values.&quot;

==Violations==
There is no direct punishment for breaking the Hippocratic Oath, although an arguable equivalent in modern times is medical malpractice, which carries a wide range of punishments, from imprisonment to civil penalties. Medical professionals may also be subject to other parts of the criminal and civil law for conduct contrary to both an oath taken and to a more general prohibition on, for example, doing physical or other harm to other persons. In the United States, several major judicial decisions have made reference to the classical Hippocratic Oath, either upholding or dismissing its bounds for medical ethics: &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, &quot;Washington v. Harper&quot;, &quot;Compassion in Dying v. State of Washington&quot; (1996), and &quot;Thorburn v. Department of Corrections&quot; (1998). In antiquity, the punishment for breaking the Hippocratic oath could range from a penalty to losing the right to practice medicine.

In 2022, at a college in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, medical students took the Charaka shapath, a Sanskrit oath attributed to ancient sage and physician &quot;Maharishi Charak&quot; instead of the Hippocratic oath. The state government subsequently dismissed the Dean of the Madurai medical college for this act. However, he was reinstated by the Tamil Nadu government and assumed office 4 days later.

<doc id="37993" wikidata="Q5840" url="?curid=37993" title="Toilet paper">
<text>Toilet paper (sometimes called toilet/bath/bathroom tissue, or toilet roll) is a tissue paper product primarily used to clean the anus and surrounding region of feces (after defecation), and to clean the external genitalia and perineal area of urine (after urination).

It is commonly supplied as a long strip of perforated paper wrapped around a cylindrical paperboard core, for storage in a dispenser within arm&#x27;s reach of a toilet. The bundle, or &quot;roll of toilet paper&quot;, is specifically known as a toilet roll, loo roll, or bog roll (in Britain).

There are other uses for toilet paper, as it is a readily available household product. It can be used for blowing the nose or wiping the eyes (or other uses of facial tissue). It can be used to wipe off sweat or absorb it. Some people may use the paper to absorb the bloody discharge that comes out of the vagina during menstruation. Toilet paper can be used in cleaning (like a less abrasive paper towel). As a teenage prank, &quot;toilet papering&quot; is a form of temporary vandalism.

Most modern toilet paper in the developed world is designed to decompose in septic tanks, whereas some other bathroom and facial tissues are not. Wet toilet paper rapidly decomposes in the environment. Toilet paper comes in various numbers of plies (layers of thickness), from one- to six-ply, with more back-to-back plies providing greater strength and absorbency. Most modern domestic toilet paper is white, and patterned or textured. Some people have a preference for whether the orientation of the roll on a dispenser should be &quot;over&quot; or &quot;under&quot;.

The use of paper for hygiene has been recorded in China in the 6th century AD, with specifically manufactured toilet paper being mass-produced in the 14th century. Modern commercial toilet paper originated in the 19th century, with a patent for roll-based dispensers being made in 1883.

==History==
Although paper had been known as a wrapping and padding material in China since the 2nd century BC, a reference to the use of toilet paper dates back as early as when the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531–591) wrote:

During the later Tang dynasty (618–907 AD), an Arab traveller to China in the year 851 AD remarked:

During the early 14th century, it was recorded that in what is now Zhejiang alone, ten million packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets of toilet paper were manufactured annually. During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD), it was recorded in 1393 that an annual supply of 720,000 sheets of toilet paper (approximately ) were produced for the general use of the imperial court at the capital of Nanjing. From the records of the Imperial Bureau of Supplies of that same year, it was also recorded that for the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s imperial family alone, there were 15,000 sheets of special soft-fabric toilet paper made, and each sheet of toilet paper was perfumed.

Elsewhere, wealthy people wiped themselves with wool, lace or hemp, while less wealthy people used their hand when defecating into rivers, or cleaned themselves with various materials such as rags, wood shavings, leaves, grass, hay, stones, sand, moss, water, snow, ferns, plant husks, fruit skins, seashells, or corncobs, depending upon the country and weather conditions or social customs. In Ancient Rome, a sponge on a stick was commonly used, and, after use, placed back in a pail of vinegar. Several talmudic sources indicating ancient Jewish practice refer to the use of small pebbles, often carried in a special bag, and also to the use of dry grass and of the smooth edges of broken pottery jugs (e.g., Shabbat 81a, 82a, Yevamot 59b). These are all cited in the classic &quot;Biblical and Talmudic Medicine&quot; by the German physician Julius Preuss (Eng. trans. Sanhedrin Press, 1978).

The 16th-century French satirical writer François Rabelais, in Chapter XIII of Book 1 of his novel sequence &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, has his character Gargantua investigate a great number of ways of cleansing oneself after defecating. Gargantua dismisses the use of paper as ineffective, rhyming that: &quot;Who his foul tail with paper wipes, Shall at his ballocks leave some chips.&quot; (Sir Thomas Urquhart&#x27;s 1653 English translation). He concludes that &quot;the neck of a goose, that is well downed&quot; provides an optimum cleansing medium.

The rise of publishing by the eighteenth century led to the use of newspapers and cheap editions of popular books for cleansing. Lord Chesterfield, in a letter to his son in 1747, told of a man who purchased

In many parts of the world, especially where toilet paper or the necessary plumbing for disposal may be unavailable or unaffordable, toilet paper is not used. Also, in many parts of the world people consider using water a much cleaner and more sanitary practice than using paper. Cleansing is then performed with other methods or materials, such as water, for example using a bidet, a lota, rags, sand, leaves (including seaweed), corn cobs, animal furs, sticks or hands; afterwards, hands are washed with water and possibly soap.

On 18 July 2024 the sale of ruble-note artwork on toilet paper was banned by a Moscow judge.

===As a commodity===
Joseph Gayetty is widely credited with being the inventor of modern commercially available toilet paper in the United States. Gayetty&#x27;s paper, first introduced in 1857, was available as late as the 1920s. Gayetty&#x27;s Medicated Paper was sold in packages of flat sheets, watermarked with the inventor&#x27;s name. Original advertisements for the product used the tagline &quot;The greatest necessity of the age! Gayetty&#x27;s medicated paper for the water-closet&quot;.

Seth Wheeler of Albany, New York, obtained the earliest United States patents for toilet paper and dispensers, the types of which eventually were in common use in that country, in 1883. Toilet paper dispensed from rolls was popularized when the Scott Paper Company began marketing it in 1890.

The manufacturing of this product had a long period of refinement, considering that as late as the 1930s, a selling point of the Northern Tissue company was that their toilet paper was &quot;splinter free&quot;. The widespread adoption of the flush toilet increased the use of toilet paper, as heavier paper was more prone to clogging the trap that prevents sewer gases from escaping through the toilet.

Softer, two ply toilet roll was introduced in Britain in 1942, by St Andrew Mills in Walthamstow; this became the famous Andrex.

Moist toilet paper, called wet wipes, was first introduced in the United Kingdom by Andrex in the 1990s. It has been promoted as being a better method of cleaning than dry toilet paper after defecation, and may be useful for women during menstruation. It was promoted as a flushable product but it has been implicated in the creation of fatbergs; by 2016 some municipalities had begun education campaigns advising people not to flush used wet wipes.

More than seven billion rolls of toilet paper are sold yearly in the United States where an average of 23.6 rolls per capita per year is used.

In 1973, Johnny Carson joked in his &quot;Tonight Show&quot; monologue about comments made by Wisconsin congressman Harold V. Froehlich about the possibility of a toilet paper shortage. Subsequently, consumers purchased abnormal amounts, causing an actual shortage in the United States for several months.

Toilet paper has been one of the commodities subject to shortages in Venezuela starting in the 2010s; the government seized one toilet paper factory in an effort to resolve the problem.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, toilet paper shortages were reported in March 2020 in multiple countries due to hoarding and panic buying. At first, few believed the pandemic would be serious. Later, people realized they might need to stock up on certain items in case of a shelter-in-place order, or in case they did not know how long such an order would last; suppliers could not assure that they could keep up with demand. However, manufacturers continued to produce even more than they had before. Demand was higher for the types of toilet paper used at home. In some countries the bidet was already seen as a solution, and a survey before the pandemic had indicated an increasing number of Americans would be interested. Amid the panic buying during the pandemic, the Australian toilet paper brand Quilton donated a million of toilet paper rolls to vulnerable Australians who were struggling due to the shortages of toilet paper.

In 2022, British toilet paper packaging started displaying bowel cancer symptoms to raise awareness, following campaigning from blogger and journalist Deborah James, who later died from the disease in June 2022. At the time, half of all Britons could not name any of the main symptoms of bowel cancer. Andrex were the first brand to take the lead on the matter, then various supermarkets followed suit.

==Description==
Toilet paper is available in several types of paper, a variety of patterns, decorations, and textures, and it may be moistened or perfumed, although fragrances sometimes cause problems for users who are allergic to perfumes. The average measures of a modern roll of toilet paper is c. 10 cm (3 in.) wide, and 12 cm (4 in.) in diameter, and weighs between and . An alternative method of packing the sheets uses interleaved sheets in boxes, or in bulk for use in dispensers. &quot;Hard&quot; single-ply paper has been used as well as soft multi-ply.

===Sheet size===
The format of individual sheets of toilet paper, which is given by a perforation line, varies nationally. In Germany, Holland, France, Poland, Switzerland, for example, about postcard size is standard (about 100 × 140 mm), so about DIN format (DIN A6 105 × 148 mm). In England, the usual format is already somewhat wider, about 115 × 135 mm. The most extreme landscape format with 115 × 102 mm exists in Thailand. The most extreme portrait format (not counting toilet paper rolls without any perforation) is 100 × 366 mm; a promotional toilet paper from Schmidt Spiele in Germany. Manufactured toilet paper sheet in the United States was sized × . Since 1999 the size of a sheet has been shrinking; Kimberly-Clark reduced the length of a sheet to . Scott, in 2006, reduced the length of their product to . The width of sheets was later reduced giving a general sheet size of long and wide. Larger sizes remain available.

===Sheet ply===
The ply of a toilet paper refers to the number of layers per sheet. Rolls are typically available in single-ply, 2-ply, 3-ply, and 4-ply.

===Roll length===

Phrases like &quot;single roll&quot;, &quot;double roll&quot;, &quot;triple roll&quot;, &quot;jumbo roll&quot;, and &quot;mega roll&quot; commonly used in retail advertising refer to the number of sheets per roll (though the actual number of sheets is also usually disclosed on packaging). A longer roll needs to be replaced less often, but the very largest sizes do not fit all toilet paper dispensers, especially in older homes.

===Materials===
Toilet paper is usually manufactured from pulpwood trees, but is also sometimes made from sugar cane byproducts or bamboo.

Toilet paper products vary greatly in the distinguishing technical factors, such as size, weight, roughness, softness, chemical residues, &quot;finger-breakthrough&quot; resistance, water-absorption, etc. The larger companies have very detailed, scientific market surveys to determine which marketing sectors require or demand which of the many technical qualities. Modern toilet paper may have a light coating of aloe or lotion or wax worked into the paper to reduce roughness.

Quality is usually determined by the number of plies (stacked sheets), coarseness, and durability. Low grade institutional toilet paper is typically of the lowest grade of paper, has only one or two plies, is very coarse and sometimes contains small amounts of embedded unbleached/unpulped paper; it was typically called &quot;hard&quot; toilet paper. A brand disinfected with carbolic acid was manufactured in Sheffield, United Kingdom under the Izal brand name by Newton Chambers until 1981. Mid-grade two ply is somewhat textured to provide some softness and is somewhat stronger. Premium toilet paper may have lotion and wax and has two to four plies of very finely pulped paper. If it is marketed as &quot;luxury&quot;, it may be quilted or rippled (embossed), perfumed, colored or patterned, medicated (with anti-bacterial chemicals), or treated with aloe or other perfumes.

To advance decomposition of the paper in septic tanks or drainage, the paper used has shorter fibres than facial tissue or writing paper. The manufacturer tries to reach an optimal balance between rapid decomposition (which requires shorter fibres) and sturdiness (which requires longer fibres). Compaction of toilet paper in drain lines, such as in a clog, prevents fibre dispersion and largely halts the breakdown process.

A German quip says that the toilet paper of Nazi Germany was so rough and scratchy that it was almost unusable, so many people used old issues of the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; instead, because the paper was softer.

===Color and design===

Colored toilet paper in colors such as pink, lavender, light blue, light green, purple, green, and light yellow (so that one could choose a color of toilet paper that matched or complemented the color of one&#x27;s bathroom) was commonly sold in the United States from the 1960s. Up until 2004, Scott was one of the last remaining U.S. manufacturers to still produce toilet paper in beige, blue, and pink. However, the company has since cut production of colored paper altogether.

Colored toilet paper remains commonly available in some European countries. Here in solid color toilet paper base, apart from the natural tones between white and gray or beige, pastel shades prevail: pink, apricot, light yellow and light blue. In rare cases, pale purple or pale green can be found. However, rich colors are rarely used, such as black, wine red, neon green, royal blue. Flat printed toilet paper is uncommon. If there is printing, it is often one color. Common print colors are pink and pinkish red, also blue, more rarely purple, orange, brown or green.

=== Design ===

Today, in the United States, plain unpatterned colored toilet paper has been mostly replaced by patterned toilet paper, normally white, with embossed decorative patterns or designs in various colors and different sizes depending on the brand. The patterns are in most cases &quot;scatter patterns&quot;, that is, a motif is distributed (&quot;scattered&quot;) several times (irregularly) over the surface. Stripes and dot patterns are rare. Occasionally, toilet papers have an embossed crocodile, wave, circle or check pattern. Some are additionally printed. Ornaments usually stand on their own as self-contained units. They never go uninterrupted (for example, as a border) from the first to the last sheet.

=== Motifs ===

Predominant is everything that is associated &quot;softness&quot; and &quot;fluffiness&quot;. There are decorations with bears, cats, rabbits, down feathers, clouds. Another motifs are things associated with &quot;lightness&quot;: Clouds, downy feathers, leaves of all kinds, butterflies, flying birds. Another association is anything associated with pleasant fragrance: especially flowers of all kinds. Rare are motifs intended to appear noble, such as the Bourbon lily. Less rare are allusions to water, such as fish, shells and other aquatic creatures.

Toilet papers are also provided with texts (jokes, poems), joke motifs (banknotes) or advertising imprints.

=== Texture ===

Toilet paper is offered in different qualities. The cheapest toilet papers have a texture close to crêpe paper. They are often made of recycled material. Expensive toilet papers are made from particularly absorbent, delicate tissue paper. Toilet paper usually has a smooth surface. With several intentions, it is occasionally embossed. On the one hand, the embossing can serve to stabilize the paper. Furthermore, wiping can become more effective. Thirdly, there are design reasons. In Switzerland, in particular, there are often toilet paper with burls. In Germany, the number of plies is considered a quality feature. In the USA, Great Britain and Japan, the quality feature is that the toilet paper is as delicate and fine as possible.

=== Additives ===
Some toilet papers are perfumed. Popular scents are chamomile, peach or rose. Other toilet papers are impregnated with antibacterial additives.

==Installation==
===Dispensers===

A toilet roll holder, also known as a toilet paper dispenser, is an item that holds a roll of toilet paper. There are at least seven types of holders:

# A horizontal piece of wire mounted on a hinge, hanging from a door or wall.
# A horizontal axle recessed in the wall.
# A vertical axle recessed in the wall
# A horizontal axle mounted on a freestanding frame.
# A freestanding vertical pole on a base.
# A wall mounted dispensing unit, usually containing more than one roll. This is used in the commercial/away-from-home marketplace.
# A wall mounted dispensing unit with tissue interleaved in a &quot;S&quot;-type fold so the user can extract the tissue one sheet at a time.

Some commercial or institutional toilet paper is wrapped around a cylinder to many times the thickness of a standard toilet paper roll.

===Orientation===
There are two choices of orientation when using a holder with a horizontal axle parallel to the wall: the toilet paper may hang &quot;over&quot; or &quot;under&quot; the roll. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by habit. In surveys of American consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60–70% of respondents prefer &quot;over&quot;. Most Americans think it should go over the top, like a waterfall.

===Decoration===

&quot;Toilegami&quot; refers to toilet paper origami. Like table napkins, some fancy Japanese hotels fold the first squares of toilet paper on its dispenser to be presented in a fashionable way.

===Recreational use===

In the United States, toilet paper has been the primary tool in a prank known as &quot;TP-ing&quot; (pronounced &quot;teepeeing&quot;). TP-ing, or &quot;toilet papering&quot;, is often favored by adolescents and is the act of throwing rolls of toilet paper over cars, trees, houses and gardens, causing the toilet paper to unfurl and cover the property, creating an inconvenient mess.

Children and cats may unroll an entire roll of toilet paper by spinning it until it completely unravels on the floor, or as a game by children wadding up one end, putting it in the toilet bowl without tearing it and then using the flushing of the toilet to pull new paper into the toilet, with the objective of flushing the entire roll down the toilet section at a time without the toilet paper breaking. Special toilet paper insert holders with an oblong shape were invented to prevent continuous unrolling without tearing to discourage this practice.

Toilet paper pranks include musical toilet paper holders and inserts that are activated by the unrolling of the toilet paper and will loudly play an embarrassing song calling attention to the person defecating.

Other gags include custom toilet paper printed with jokes, stories or politician&#x27;s images.

==Mechanics==

Alexander Balankin and coauthors have studied the behavior of toilet paper under tensile stress and during wetting and burning.

Toilet paper has been used in physics education to demonstrate the concepts of torque, moment of inertia, and angular momentum; and the conservation of momentum and energy.

==Environmental considerations==

One tree produces about 800 rolls () of toilet paper and about 83 million rolls are produced per day. Global toilet paper production consumes 27,000 trees daily.

More than seven billion rolls of toilet paper are sold yearly in the United States alone. Americans use an average of 141 rolls per capita a year which is equivalent to of tissue paper per year. This figure is about 50% more than the average of other Western countries or Japan. The higher use in the United States may be explained by the fact that other countries people use bidets or spray hoses to clean themselves. Millions of trees are harvested in North and South America leaving ecological footprint concerns.

, between 22% and 48% of the toilet paper used in the United States comes from tree farms in the U.S. and South America, with the rest mostly coming from old, second growth forests, and, some from virgin forests.

===Alternatives to virgin wood pulp===
Toilet paper made from recycled paper avoids the direct environmental impact of cutting down trees, and is commercially available. Recycled newspaper can contain BPA, an endocrine disruptor.

Toilet paper produced from bamboo is commercially available, and is in some ways more environmentally friendly than virgin pulpwood, because bamboo grows faster, taking less land and less water. For North American consumers, the Natural Resources Defense Council recommends recycled tree pulp over bamboo toilet paper, because tree forests promote more biodiversity and bamboo products must be shipped from Asia.

Toilet paper produced from bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane, is commercially available, and avoids cutting down any plants because sugarcane is already grown for sugar production.

The most environmentally friendly alternatives are to rely solely on soap and water for anal hygiene.

<text>Nicotinic acid, or niacin, is an organic compound and a vitamer ofvitamin B3, an essential human nutrient. It is produced by plants and animals from the amino acid tryptophan.

Nicotinic acid is also a prescription medication. Amounts far in excess of the recommended dietary intake for vitamin functions will lower blood triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and raise blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, often referred to as &quot;good&quot; cholesterol). There are two forms: immediate-release and sustained-release nicotinic acid. Initial prescription amounts are 500 mg/day, increased over time until a therapeutic effect is achieved. Immediate-release doses can be as high as 3,000 mg/day; sustained-release as high as 2,000 mg/day. Despite the proven lipid changes, nicotinic acid has not been found useful for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already prescribed a statin drug. A 2010 review had concluded that nicotinic acid was effective as a mono-therapy, but a 2017 review incorporating twice as many trials concluded that prescription nicotinic acid, while affecting lipid levels, did not reduce all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarctions, nor fatal or non-fatal strokes. Prescription nicotinic acid was shown to cause hepatotoxicity and increase risk of type 2 diabetes. nicotinic acid prescriptions in the U.S. had peaked in 2009 at 9.4million, declining to 800thousand by 2020.

Nicotinic acid has the formula and belongs to the group of the pyridinecarboxylic acids. As the precursor for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, it is involved in DNA repair.
==Definition==
The term &quot;niacin&quot; was originally coined from &quot;nicotinic acid vitamin&quot;, with the goal of distancing the nutrient from nicotine from tobacco. As a result, it originally referred to the nutritional entity of vitamin B3. However, in American English, the term has also come to mean &quot;nicotinic acid&quot; in the context of high-dose use as a prescription medicine. In other varieties of English, the medicine is only ever called &quot;nicotinic acid&quot;. The term &quot;nicotinic acid&quot; unambiguously refers to the substance and the prescription medicine containing it, which treats elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. When used as a drug, daily doses range from 500 to 3,000 mg/day. High-dose nicotinamide does not have this medicinal effect.

Vitamin B3 has several vitamers that can act in place of each other, including nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. It is precursor of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). These compounds are coenzymes for many dehydrogenases, participating in many hydrogen transfer processes. NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Vitamin intake recommendations made by several countries are that intakes of 14–18 mg/day are sufficient to meet the needs of healthy adults.
 Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are both used for prevention and treatment of pellagra, a disease caused by lack of the vitamin.

==As a dietary supplement==
In the United States, nicotinic acid is sold as a non-prescription dietary supplement with a range of 100 to 1000 mg per serving. These products often have a Structure/Function health claim allowed by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA). An example would be &quot;Supports a healthy blood lipid profile.&quot; The American Heart Association strongly advises against the substitution of dietary supplement nicotinic acid for prescription nicotinic acid because of potentially serious side effects, which means that nicotinic acid should only be used under the supervision of a health care professional, and because manufacture of dietary supplement nicotinic acid is not as well-regulated by the FDA as prescription nicotinic acid. More than 30 mg nicotinic acid consumed as a dietary supplement can cause skin flushing. Face, arms and chest skin turns a reddish color because of vasodilation of small subcutaneous blood vessels, accompanied by sensations of heat, tingling and itching. These signs and symptoms are typically transient, lasting minutes to hours; they are considered unpleasant rather than toxic.

==As lipid-modifying medication==
Prescription nicotinic acid, commonly labeled as niacin in the United States, is available in immediate-release and slow-release formulations. It is used to treat primary hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia. It is used either as a monotherapy or in combination with other lipid-modifying drugs. Dosages start at 500 mg/day and are often gradually increased to as high as 3000 mg/day for immediate release or 2000 mg/day for slow release (also referred to as sustained release) to achieve the targeted lipid changes (lower LDL-C and triglycerides, and higher HDL-C). Prescriptions in the US peaked in 2009, at 9.4million and had declined to 800thousand by 2020.

Systematic reviews found no effect of prescription nicotinic acid on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarctions, nor fatal or non-fatal strokes despite raising HDL cholesterol in patients already taking statins. Reported side effects include an increased risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes.

===Mechanisms===
Nicotinic acid reduces synthesis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), lipoprotein(a) and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The lipid-therapeutic effects of nicotinic acid are partly mediated through the activation of G protein-coupled receptors, including hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2)and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3 (HCA3), which are highly expressed in body fat. HCA2 and HCA3 inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and thus suppress the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from body fat, reducing their availability to the liver to synthesize the blood-circulating lipids in question. A decrease in free fatty acids also suppresses liver expression of apolipoprotein C3 and PPARg coactivator-1b, thus increasing VLDL-C turnover and reducing its production. Nicotinic acid also directly inhibits the action of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) a key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis.

The mechanism behind nicotinic acid increasing HDL-C is not totally understood, but seems to occur in various ways. Nicotinic acid increases apolipoprotein A1 levels by inhibiting the breakdown of this protein, which is a component of HDL particles. It also inhibits HDL-C hepatic uptake by suppressing production of the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) gene. It stimulates the ABCA1 transporter in monocytes and macrophages and upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, resulting in reverse cholesterol transport.

===Combined with statins===
Extended release nicotinic acid was combined with lovastatin (Advicor), and with simvastatin (Simcor), as prescription drug combinations. The combination niacin/lovastatin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. The combination niacin/simvastatin was approved by the FDA in 2008. Subsequently, large outcome trials using these nicotinic acid and statin therapies were unable to demonstrate incremental benefit of nicotinic acid beyond statin therapy alone. The FDA withdrew approval of both drugs in 2016. The reason given: &quot;Based on the collective evidence from several large cardiovascular outcome trials, the Agency has concluded that the totality of the scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in triglyceride levels and/or increase in HDL-cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events.&quot; The drug company discontinued the drugs.

===Contraindications===
Prescription immediate release (Niacor) and extended release (Niaspan) nicotinic acid are contraindicated for people with either active or a history of liver disease because both, but especially Niaspan, have been associated with instances of serious, on occasion fatal, liver failure. Both products are contraindicated for people with existing peptic ulcer disease, or other bleeding problems because nicotinic acid lowers platelet count and interferes with blood clotting. Both products are also contraindicated for women who are pregnant or expecting to become pregnant because safety during pregnancy has not been evaluated in human trials. These products are contraindicated for women who are lactating because it is known that nicotinic acid is excreted into human milk, but the amount and potential for adverse effects in the nursing infant are not known. Women are advised to either not nurse their child or discontinue the drug. High-dose nicotinic acid has not been tested or approved for use in children under 16 years.

===Adverse effects===
The most common adverse effects of medicinal nicotinic acid () are flushing (e.g., warmth, redness, itching or tingling) of the face, neck and chest, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, pruritus and rash. These can be minimized by initiating therapy at low dosages, increasing dosage gradually, and avoiding administration on an empty stomach.

The acute adverse effects of high-dose nicotinic acid therapy () – which is commonly used in the treatment of hyperlipidemias – can further include hypotension, fatigue, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, heartburn, blurred or impaired vision, and macular edema. With long-term use, the adverse effects of high-dose nicotinic acid therapy (750 mg per day) also include liver failure (associated with fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite), hepatitis, and acute liver failure; these hepatotoxic effects of nicotinic acid occur more often when extended-release dosage forms are used. The long-term use of nicotinic acid at greater than or equal to 2 grams per day also significantly increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, diabetes, dyspepsia, and diarrhea.

====Flushing====
Flushing – a short-term dilatation of skin arterioles, causing reddish skin color – usually lasts for about 15 to 30 minutes, although sometimes can persist for weeks. Typically, the face is affected, but the reaction can extend to neck and upper chest. The cause is blood vessel dilation due to elevation in prostaglandin GD2 (PGD2) and serotonin. Flushing was often thought to involve histamine, but histamine has been shown not to be involved in the reaction. Flushing is sometimes accompanied by a prickly or itching sensation, in particular, in areas covered by clothing.

Prevention of flushing requires altering or blocking the prostaglandin-mediated pathway. Aspirin taken half an hour before the nicotinic acid prevents flushing, as does ibuprofen. Taking nicotinic acid with meals also helps reduce this side effect. Acquired tolerance will also help reduce flushing; after several weeks of a consistent dose, most people no longer experience flushing. Slow- or &quot;sustained&quot;-release forms of nicotinic acid have been developed to lessen these side effects.

====Liver damage====
Nicotinic acid in medicinal doses can cause modest elevations in serum transaminase and unconjugated bilirubin, both biomarkers of liver injury. The increases usually resolve even when drug intake is continued. However, less commonly, the sustained release form of the drug can lead to serious hepatotoxicity, with onset in days to weeks. Early symptoms of serious liver damage include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, followed by jaundice and pruritus. The mechanism is thought to be a direct toxicity of elevated serum niacin. Lowering dose or switching to the immediate release form can resolve symptoms. In rare instances the injury is severe, and progresses to liver failure.

====Diabetes====
The high doses of nicotinic acid used to treat hyperlipidemia have been shown to elevate fasting blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes. Long-term nicotinic acid therapy was also associated with an increase in the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes.

====Other adverse effects====
High doses of nicotinic acid can also cause niacin maculopathy, a thickening of the macula and retina, which leads to blurred vision and blindness. This maculopathy is reversible after niacin intake ceases. Niaspan, the slow-release product, has been associated with a reduction in platelet content and a modest increase in prothrombin time.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Activating HCA2 has effects other than lowering serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations: antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, improved endothelial function and plaque stability, all of which counter development and progression of atherosclerosis.

Nicotinic acid inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Niacin produces a rise in serum unconjugated bilirubin in normal individuals and in those with Gilbert&#x27;s Syndrome. However, in the Gilbert&#x27;s Syndrome, the rise in bilirubin is higher and clearance is delayed longer than in normal people. One test used to aid in diagnosing Gilbert&#x27;s Syndrome involves intravenous administration of nicotinic acid (niacin) in a dose of 50 mg over a period of 30 seconds.
===Pharmacokinetics===
Both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine. Absorption is facilitated by sodium-dependent diffusion, and at higher intakes, via passive diffusion. Unlike some other vitamins, the percent absorbed does not decrease with increasing dose, so that even at amounts of 3-4 grams, absorption is nearly complete. With a one gram dose, peak plasma concentrations of 15 to 30 μg/mL are reached within 30 to 60 minutes. Approximately 88% of an oral pharmacologic dose is eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged nicotinic acid or nicotinuric acid, its primary metabolite. The plasma elimination half-life of nicotinic acid ranges from 20 to 45 minutes.

Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are both converted into the coenzyme NAD. NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation in the presence of the enzyme NAD+ kinase. High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency. In the liver, nicotinamide is converted to storage nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). As needed, liver NAD is hydrolyzed to nicotinamide and nicotinic acid for transport to tissues, there reconverted to NAD to serve as an enzyme cofactor. Excess nicotinic acid is methylated in the liver to N1-methylnicotinamide (NMN) and excreted in urine as such or as the oxidized metabolites N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N1-Methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (2PY and 4PY). Decreased urinary content of these metabolites is a measure of niacin deficiency.

==Production==
===Biosynthesis===

In addition to absorbing niacin from diet, nicotinic acid can be synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan, a five-step process with the penultimate compound being quinolinic acid (see figure). Some bacteria and plants utilize aspartic acid in a pathway that also goes to quinolinic acid. For humans, the efficiency of conversion is estimated as requiring 60mg of tryptophan to make 1mg of niacin. Riboflavin, vitamin B6 and iron are required for the process. Pellagra is a consequence of a corn-dominant diet because the niacin in corn is poorly bioavailable and corn proteins are low in tryptophan compared to wheat and rice proteins.

===Industrial synthesis===
Nicotinic acid was first synthesized in 1867 by oxidative degradation of nicotine with potassium chromate and sulfuric acid — this is the origin of the name. Nicotinic acid is prepared by hydrolysis of nicotinonitrile, which, as described above, is generated by oxidation of 3-picoline. Oxidation can be effected by air, but ammoxidation is more efficient. In the latter process, nicotinonitrile is produced by ammoxidation of 3-methylpyridine. Nitrile hydratase is then used to catalyze nicotinonitrile to nicotinamide, which can be sold directly or converted to nicotinic acid. Alternatively, ammonia, acetic acid and paraldehyde are used to make 5-ethyl-2-methyl-pyridine, which is then oxidized to nicotinic acid. New &quot;greener&quot; catalysts are being tested using manganese-substituted aluminophosphates that use acetyl peroxyborate as non-corrosive oxidant, avoiding producing nitrogen oxides as do traditional ammoxidations.

The demand for commercial production includes for animal feed and for food fortification meant for human consumption. According to &quot;Ullmann&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry&quot;, worldwide 31,000 tons of nicotinamide were sold in 2014.

===Climate impact===
The production of nicotinic acid creates nitrous oxide as a by-product, which is a potent greenhouse gas. In 2018, it was discovered that a nicotinic acid factory in Visp, Switzerland, was responsible for around one percent of the country&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions. Eventually, catalytic scrubbing technology that eliminates most of the emissions was installed in 2021.

==Chemistry==
This colorless, water-soluble solid is a derivative of pyridine, with a carboxyl group (COOH) at the 3-position. Other forms of vitamin B3 include the corresponding amide nicotinamide, where the carboxyl group has been replaced by a carboxamide group ().

==Preparations==
Prescription products can be immediate release (Niacor, 500 mg tablets) or extended release (Niaspan, 500 and 1000 mg tablets). Niaspan has a film coating that delays release of the nicotinic acid, resulting in an absorption over a period of 8–12 hours. This reduces vasodilation and flushing side effects, but increases the risk of hepatotoxicity compared to the immediate release drug.

Prescription nicotinic acid preparations in combination with statin drugs (discontinued) are described above. A combination of niacin and laropiprant had been approved for use in Europe and marketed as Tredaptive. Laropiprant is a prostaglandin D2 binding drug shown to reduce niacin-induced vasodilation and flushing side effects. A clinical trial showed no additional efficacy of Tredaptive in lowering cholesterol when used together with other statin drugs, but did show an increase in other side effects. The study resulted in the withdrawal of Tredaptive from the international market.

==History==
Niacin as a chemical compound was first described by chemist Hugo Weidel in 1873 in his studies of nicotine, but that predated by many years the concept of food components other than protein, fat and carbohydrates that were essential for life. Vitamin nomenclature was initially alphabetical, with Elmer McCollum calling these fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Over time, eight chemically distinct, water-soluble B vitamins were isolated and numbered, with niacin as vitamin B3.
Corn (maize) became a staple food in the southeast United States and in parts of Europe. A disease that was characterized by dermatitis of sunlight-exposed skin was described in Spain in 1735 by Gaspar Casal. He attributed the cause to poor diet. In northern Italy it was named &quot;pellagra&quot; from the Lombard language (&quot;agra&quot; = holly-like or serum-like; &quot;pell&quot; = skin). In time, the disease was more closely linked specifically to corn. In the US, Joseph Goldberger was assigned to study pellagra by the Surgeon General of the United States. His studies confirmed a corn-based diet as the culprit, but he did not identify the root cause.

Nicotinic acid was extracted from liver by biochemist Conrad Elvehjem in 1937. He later identified the active ingredient, referring to it as &quot;pellagra-preventing factor&quot; and the &quot;anti-blacktongue factor.&quot; It was also referred to as &quot;vitamin PP&quot;, &quot;vitamin P-P&quot; and &quot;PP-factor&quot;, all derived from the term &quot;pellagra-preventive factor&quot;. In the late 1930s, studies by Tom Douglas Spies, Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper confirmed that nicotinic acid cured pellagra in humans. The prevalence of the disease was greatly reduced as a result. Nicotinic acid was initially synthesized by oxidizing nicotine with potassium chromate and sulfuric acid. Hence, in 1942, when flour enrichment with nicotinic acid began, a headline in the popular press said &quot;Tobacco in Your Bread.&quot; In response, the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association approved of the Food and Nutrition Board&#x27;s new names &quot;niacin&quot; and &quot;niacin amide&quot; for use primarily by non-scientists. It was thought appropriate to choose a name to dissociate nicotinic acid from nicotine, to avoid the perception that vitamins or niacin-rich food contains nicotine, or that cigarettes contain vitamins. The resulting name &quot;niacin&quot; was derived from &quot;cotinic id&quot; + &quot;vitam&quot;.

Carpenter found in 1951, that niacin in corn is biologically unavailable, and can be released only in very alkaline lime water of pH 11. This explains why a Latin-American culture that used alkali-treated cornmeal to make tortilla was not at risk for niacin deficiency. The modern explanation is that alkali treatment enhances the bioavailability of tryptophan, not directly for any form of the vitamin.

In 1955, Altschul and colleagues described large amounts of nicotinic acid as having a lipid-lowering property. As such, niacin is the oldest known lipid-lowering drug. Lovastatin, the first &#x27;statin&#x27; drug, was first marketed in 1987.

<text>François Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand (26 October 19168 January 1996) was a French politician and statesman who served as President of France from 1981 to 1995, the longest holder of that position in the history of France. As a former Socialist Party First Secretary, he was the first left-wing politician to assume the presidency under the Fifth Republic.

Due to family influences, Mitterrand started his political life on the Catholic nationalist right. He served under the Vichy regime during its earlier years. Subsequently, he joined the Resistance, moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the Fourth Republic. Mitterrand opposed Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s establishment of the Fifth Republic. Although at times a politically isolated figure, he outmanoeuvred rivals to become the left&#x27;s standard bearer in the 1965 and 1974 presidential elections, before being elected president in the 1981 presidential election. He was re-elected in 1988 and remained in office until 1995.

Mitterrand invited the Communist Party into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. However, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support eroded, eventually leaving the cabinet in 1984. 

Early in his first term, Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms and the introduction of the 39-hour work week. He likewise pushed a progressive agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the death penalty, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. He was also a strong promoter of French culture and implemented a range of costly &quot;Grands Projets&quot;. However, faced with economic tensions, he soon abandoned his nationalization programme, in favour of austerity and market liberalization policies. In 1985, he was faced with a major controversy after ordering the bombing of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, a Greenpeace vessel docked in Auckland. Later in 1991, he became the first French President to appoint a female prime minister, Édith Cresson. During his presidency, Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into &quot;cohabitation governments&quot; with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by Jacques Chirac (1986–1988), and Édouard Balladur (1993–1995).

Mitterrand’s foreign and defence policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors, except in regard to their reluctance to support European integration, which he reversed. His partnership with German chancellor Helmut Kohl advanced European integration via the Maastricht Treaty, and he accepted German reunification. 

Less than eight months after leaving office, he died from the prostate cancer he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency. Beyond making the French Left electable, Mitterrand presided over the rise of the Socialist Party to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-dominant Communist Party.

==Family==
François Marie Adrien Maurice Mitterrand was born on 26 October 1916 in Jarnac, Charente, the son of Joseph Mitterrand and Yvonne Lorrain. His family was devoutly Catholic and conservative. His father worked as a stationmaster for the Compagnie Paris Orléans railway. He had three brothers, Robert, Jacques (retired General and head of the French state aircraft company Aerospatiale), and Philippe, and four sisters, Antoinette, Marie-Josèphe, Colette, and Geneviève.

Mitterrand&#x27;s wife, Danielle Mitterrand (&quot;née&quot; Gouze, 1924–2011), came from a socialist background and worked for various left-wing causes. They married on 24 October 1944 and had three sons: Pascal (10 June – 17 September 1945), Jean-Christophe, born in 1946, and Gilbert, born on 4 February 1949. He also had two children as results of extra-marital affairs: an acknowledged daughter, Mazarine (born 1974), with his mistress Anne Pingeot, and an unacknowledged son, Hravn Forsne (born 1988), with Swedish journalist .

François Mitterrand&#x27;s nephew Frédéric Mitterrand was a journalist, Minister of Culture and Communications under Nicolas Sarkozy (and a supporter of Jacques Chirac, former French President), and his wife&#x27;s brother-in-law Roger Hanin was a well-known French actor.

==Early life==
François Mitterrand studied from 1925 to 1934 at the Collège Saint-Paul in Angoulême, where he became a member of the Jeunesse Étudiante Chrétienne, the student organisation of &quot;Action catholique&quot;. Arriving in Paris in the autumn of 1934, he then went to the École Libre des Sciences Politiques until 1937, where he obtained his diploma in July of that year. François Mitterrand took membership for about a year in the &quot;Volontaires nationaux&quot; (National Volunteers), an organisation related to François de la Rocque&#x27;s far-right league, the &quot;Croix de Feu&quot;; the league had just participated in the 6 February 1934 riots which led to the fall of the second &quot;Cartel des Gauches&quot; (Left-Wing Coalition).

Contrary to some reports, Mitterrand never became a formal member of the French Social Party, which was the successor to the Croix de Feu and may be considered the first French right-wing mass party. However, he did write news articles in the &quot;L&#x27;Écho de Paris&quot; newspaper, which was close to the Social Party. He participated in the demonstrations against the &quot;invasion métèque&quot; in February 1935 and then in those against law teacher Gaston Jèze, who had been nominated as juridical counsellor of Ethiopia&#x27;s Negus, in January 1936.

When Mitterrand&#x27;s involvement in these conservative nationalist movements was revealed in the 1990s, he attributed his actions to the milieu of his youth. He furthermore had some personal and family relations with members of the Cagoule, a far-right terrorist group in the 1930s.

Mitterrand then served his conscription from 1937 to 1939 in the 23rd régiment d&#x27;infanterie coloniale. In 1938, he became the best friend of , a Jewish socialist, whom he saved from anti-Semitic aggressions by the national-royalist movement &quot;Action française&quot;. His friendship with Dayan caused Mitterrand to begin to question some of his nationalist ideas. Finishing his law studies, he was sent in September 1939 to the Maginot line near Montmédy, with the rank of Sergeant-chief (infantry sergeant). He became engaged to Marie-Louise Terrasse (future actress and television presenter Catherine Langeais) in May 1940, when she was 16, but she broke it off in January 1942. Following an observation of Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, François Mitterrand became an agnostic.

==Second World War==
François Mitterrand&#x27;s actions during World War II were the cause of much controversy in France during the 1980s and 1990s.

===Prisoner of War: 1940–1941===
Mitterrand was near the end of his national service when the war broke out. He fought as an infantry sergeant and was injured and captured by the Germans on 14 June 1940. He was held prisoner at Stalag IXA near Ziegenhain (today part of Schwalmstadt, a town near Kassel in Hesse). François Mitterrand became involved in the social organisation for the POWs in the camp. He claims this, and the influence of the people he met there, began to change his political ideas, moving him towards the left. He had two failed escape attempts in March and then November 1941 before he finally escaped on 16 December 1941, returning to France on foot. In December 1941 he arrived home in the unoccupied zone controlled by the French. With help from a friend of his mother, he got a job as a mid-level functionary of the Vichy government, looking after the interests of POWs. This was very unusual for an escaped prisoner, and he later claimed to have served as a spy for the Free French Forces.

===Work in France under the Vichy administration: 1941–1943===
Mitterrand worked from January to April 1942 for the &quot;Légion française des combattants et des volontaires de la révolution nationale&quot; (Legion of French combatants and volunteers of the national revolution) as a civil servant on a temporary contract. François Mitterrand worked under Jean-Paul Favre de Thierrens who was a spy for the British secret service. He then moved to the &quot;Commissariat au reclassement des prisonniers de guerre&quot; (Service for the Reorientation of POWs). During this period, François Mitterrand was aware of Thierrens&#x27;s activities and may have helped in his disinformation campaign. At the same time, he published an article detailing his time as a POW in the magazine &quot;France, revue de l&#x27;État nouveau&quot; (the magazine was published as propaganda by the Vichy Regime).
François Mitterrand has been called a &quot;&quot; (an expression used by the historian Jean-Pierre Azéma to describe people who supported Marshal Philippe Pétain, the head of the Vichy Regime, before 1943, but subsequently rejected the Vichy Regime).

From spring 1942, he met other escaped POWs , Max Varenne, and Dr. , under whose influence he became involved with the resistance. In April, François Mitterrand and Fric caused a major disturbance in a public meeting held by the collaborator Georges Claude. From mid-1942, he sent false papers to POWs in Germany and on 12 June and 15 August 1942, he joined meetings at the Château de Montmaur which formed the base of his future network for the resistance. From September, he made contact with Free French Forces, but clashed with , General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s nephew (and de Gaulle&#x27;s candidate to head-up all POW-related resistance organizations). On 15 October 1942, François Mitterrand and Marcel Barrois (a member of the resistance deported in 1944) met Marshal Philippe Pétain along with other members of the &quot;Comité d&#x27;entraide aux prisonniers rapatriés de l&#x27;Allier&quot; (Mutual Assistance Committee for Repatriated POWs of the Allier Department). By the end of 1942, François Mitterrand met Pierre Guillain de Bénouville, an old friend from his days with &quot;La Cagoule&quot;. Bénouville was a member of the resistance groups &quot;Combat&quot; and &quot;Noyautage des administrations publiques&quot; (NAP).

In late 1942, the non-occupied zone was invaded by the Germans. Mitterrand left the Commissariat in January 1943, when his boss , another , was replaced by the collaborator André Masson, but he remained in charge of the &quot;centres d&#x27;entraides&quot;. In the spring of 1943, along with Gabriel Jeantet, a member of Marshal Pétain&#x27;s cabinet, and Simon Arbellot (both former members of La Cagoule), François Mitterrand received the Order of the Francisque (the honorific distinction of the Vichy Regime).

Debate rages in France as to the significance of this. When François Mitterrand&#x27;s Vichy past was exposed in the 1950s, he at first denied having received the Francisque (some sources say he was designated for the award, but never received the medal because he went into hiding before the ceremony took place). Socialist Resistance leader Jean Pierre-Bloch says that Mitterrand was ordered to accept the medal as cover for his work in the resistance. Pierre Moscovici and Jacques Attali remain skeptical of Mitterrand&#x27;s beliefs at this time, accusing him of having at best a &quot;foot in each camp&quot; until he was sure who the winner would be. They noted his friendship with René Bousquet and the wreaths he was said to have placed on Pétain&#x27;s tomb in later years (see below) as examples of his ambivalent attitude.

In 1994, while President of France, Mitterrand maintained that the roundup of Jews who were then deported to death camps during the war was solely the work of &quot;Vichy France&quot;, an entity distinct from France: &quot;The Republic had nothing to do with this. I do not believe France is responsible.&quot; This position was rejected by President Jacques Chirac in 1995 who stated that it was time that France faced up to its past. He acknowledged the role of the state – &quot;4,500 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders [who] obeyed the demands of the Nazis&quot; – in the Holocaust. Chirac added that the &quot;criminal madness of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French State&quot;.

President Emmanuel Macron was even more specific as to the State&#x27;s responsibility for the 1942 Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup of 13,000 Jews for deportation to concentration camps. It was indeed &quot;France that organized the roundup, the deportation, and thus, for almost all, death.&quot; It was done by &quot;French police collaborating with the Nazis&quot;, he said on 16 July 2017. &quot;It is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness. Yes, it’s convenient, but it is false. We cannot build pride upon a lie.&quot;

===Full engagement in resistance: 1943–1945===
Mitterrand built up a resistance network, composed mainly of former POWs. The POWs National Rally (&quot;&quot;, RNPG) was affiliated with General Henri Giraud, a former POW who had escaped from a German prison and made his way across Germany back to the Allied forces. In 1943 Giraud was contesting with de Gaulle for the leadership of the French Resistance.

From the beginning of 1943, Mitterrand had contacts with a powerful resistance group called the &quot;Organisation de résistance de l&#x27;armée&quot; (ORA), organised by former French military personnel. From this time on, François Mitterrand could act as a member of the ORA, moreover he set up his own RNPG network with Pinot in February and he obtained funding for his own network. In March, François Mitterrand met Henri Frenay, who encouraged the resistance in France to support François Mitterrand over Michel Cailliau. 28 May 1943, when François Mitterrand met with Gaullist , is generally taken as the date François Mitterrand split with Vichy. According to Dechartre, the meeting on 28 May 1943 was set up because &quot;there were three movements [of &quot;Résistance&quot;:] […] the Gaullist, the communist, and one from support centers […] hence I was assigned the mission to prepare what would be called afterwards the merger [of the three movements].&quot;

During 1943, the RNPG gradually changed from providing false papers to information-gathering for France libre. Pierre de Bénouville said, &quot;François Mitterrand created a true spy network in the POW camps which gave us information, often decisive, about what was going on behind the German borders.&quot; On 10 July François Mitterrand and Piatzook (a militant communist) interrupted a public meeting in the Salle Wagram in Paris. The meeting was about allowing French POWs to go home if they were replaced by young French men forced to go and work in Germany (in French this was called &quot;&quot;la relève&quot;). When André Masson began to talk about &quot;la trahison des gaullistes&quot; (the Gaullist treason), François Mitterrand stood up in the audience and shouted him down, saying Masson had no right to talk on behalf of POWs and calling &quot;la relève&quot; a &quot;con&quot;&quot; (i.e., something stupid). Mitterrand avoided arrest as Piatzook covered his escape.

In November 1943, the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; raided a flat in Vichy, where they hoped to arrest François Morland, a member of the resistance. &quot;Morland&quot; was François Mitterrand&#x27;s cover name. He also used Purgon, Monnier, Laroche, Captain François, Arnaud et Albre as cover names. The man they arrested was Pol Pilven, a member of the resistance who was to survive the war in a concentration camp. François Mitterrand was in Paris at the time.

Warned by his friends, Mitterrand escaped to London aboard a Lysander plane on 15 November 1943 (piloted by then-Squadron Leader Lewis Hodges). He promoted his movement to the British and American Authorities, but he was sent to Algiers, where he met de Gaulle, by then the uncontested leader of the Free French. The two men clashed, de Gaulle refused to jeopardize the Resistance by including a movement that gathered information from POWs. Later Mitterrand refused to merge his group with other POW movements if de Gaulle&#x27;s nephew Cailliau was to be the leader. Under the influence of Henri Frenay, de Gaulle finally agreed to merge his nephew&#x27;s network and the RNPG with Mitterrand in charge. Thus the RNPG was listed in the French Force organization from spring 1944.

Mitterrand returned to France by boat via England. In Paris, the three Resistance groups made up of POWs (Communists, Gaullists, RNPG) finally merged as the POWs and Deportees National Movement (&quot;&quot;, MNPGD) and Mitterrand took the lead. In his memoirs, he says that he had started this organisation while he was still officially working for the Vichy Regime. From 27 November 1943, Mitterrand worked for the Bureau central de renseignements et d&#x27;action. In December 1943 François Mitterrand ordered the execution of Henri Marlin (who was about to order attacks on the &quot;Maquis&quot;) by Jacques Paris and Jean Munier, who later hid out with François Mitterrand&#x27;s father.

After a second visit to London in February 1944, Mitterrand took part in the liberation of Paris in August; he took over the headquarters of Commissariat général aux prisonniers de guerre (general office for POW, the ministry he was working for), immediately he took up the vacant post of secretary general of POWs. When de Gaulle entered Paris following the Liberation, he was introduced to various men who were to be part of the provisional government. Among them was François Mitterrand, when they came face to face, de Gaulle is said to have muttered: &quot;You again!&quot; He dismissed François Mitterrand 2 weeks later.

In October 1944, Mitterrand and Jacques Foccart developed a plan to liberate the POW and concentration camps. This was called operation &quot;Vicarage&quot;. On the orders of de Gaulle, in April 1945 François Mitterrand accompanied General Lewis as the French representative at the liberation of the camps at Kaufering and Dachau. By chance Mitterrand discovered his friend and member of his network, Robert Antelme, suffering from typhus. Antelme was restricted to the camp to prevent the spread of disease, but François Mitterrand arranged for his &quot;escape&quot; and sent him back to France for treatment.

==Fourth Republic==

===Rise in politics: 1946–1954===
After the war, Mitterrand quickly moved back into politics. At the June 1946 legislative election, he led the list of the Rally of the Republican Lefts (&quot;Rassemblement des gauches républicaines&quot;, RGR) in the Western suburb of Paris, but he was not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed of the Radical Party, the centrist Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (&quot;Union démocratique et socialiste de la Résistance&quot;, UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed the policy of the &quot;Three-parties alliance&quot; (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).

In the November 1946 legislative election, he succeeded in winning a seat as deputy from the Nièvre &quot;département&quot;. To be elected, he had to win a seat at the expense of the French Communist Party (PCF). As leader of the RGR list, he led a very anti-communist campaign. He became a member of the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the Fourth Republic as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a mayor of Château-Chinon from 1959 to 1981.

In May 1948, Mitterrand participated in the Congress of The Hague, together with Konrad Adenauer, Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan, Paul-Henri Spaak, Albert Coppé and Altiero Spinelli. It originated the European Movement.

As Overseas Minister (1950–1951), Mitterrand opposed the colonial lobby to propose a reform program. He connected with the left when he resigned from the cabinet after the arrest of Morocco&#x27;s sultan (1953). As leader of the progressive wing of the UDSR, he took the head of the party in 1953, replacing the conservative René Pleven.

In June 1953, Mitterrand attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Seated next to the elderly Princess Marie Bonaparte, he reported having spent much of the ceremony being psychoanalyzed by her.

===Senior minister during the Algerian War: 1954–1958===

As Interior Minister in Pierre Mendès-France&#x27;s cabinet (1954–1955), Mitterrand had to direct the response to the Algerian War of Independence. He claimed: &quot;Algeria is France.&quot; He was suspected of being the informer of the Communist Party in the cabinet. This rumour was spread by the former Paris police prefect, who had been dismissed by him. The suspicions were dismissed by subsequent investigations.

The UDSR joined the Republican Front, a centre-left coalition, which won the 1956 legislative election. As Justice Minister (1956–1957), François Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mendès-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in Guy Mollet&#x27;s cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he had a role in 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President René Coty to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret. François Mitterrand&#x27;s role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of Theodore Dalrymple) to accuse François Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN rebels in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when this was popular with the French people.

As Minister of Justice, he was an official representative of France during the wedding of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and actress Grace Kelly. Under the Fourth Republic, he was representative of a generation of young ambitious politicians. He appeared as a possible future prime minister.

==Opposition during the Fifth Republic==
===Crossing the desert: 1958–1964===

In 1958, Mitterrand was one of the few to object to the nomination of Charles de Gaulle as head of government and to de Gaulle&#x27;s plan for a Fifth Republic. He justified his opposition by the circumstances of de Gaulle&#x27;s comeback: the 13 May 1958 quasi-putsch and military pressure. In September 1958, determinedly opposed to Charles de Gaulle, François Mitterrand made an appeal to vote &quot;no&quot; in the referendum over the Constitution, which was nevertheless adopted on 4 October 1958. This defeated coalition of the &quot;No&quot; was composed of the PCF and some left-wing republican politicians (such as Pierre Mendès-France and François Mitterrand).

This attitude may have been a factor in Mitterrand&#x27;s losing his seat in the 1958 elections, beginning a long &quot;crossing of the desert&quot; (this term is usually applied to de Gaulle&#x27;s decline in influence for a similar period). Indeed, in the second round of the legislative election, François Mitterrand was supported by the Communists but the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) refused to withdraw its candidate. This division caused the election of the Gaullist candidate. One year later, he was elected to represent Nièvre in the Senate, where he was part of the Group of the Democratic Left. At the same time, he was not admitted to the ranks of the Unified Socialist Party (&quot;Parti socialiste unifié&quot;, PSU) which was created by Mendès-France, former internal opponents of Mollet and reform-minded former members of the Communist Party. The PSU leaders justified their decision by referring to his non-resignation from Mollet&#x27;s cabinet and by his past in Vichy.
Also in that same year, on the Avenue de l&#x27;Observatoire in Paris, Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin&#x27;s bullet by diving behind a hedge, in what became known as the &quot;Observatory Affair&quot;. The incident brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of Mitterrand&#x27;s critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against him. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy Robert Pesquet that he was the target of an &quot;Algérie française&quot; death squad and accused Prime Minister Michel Debré of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against François Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Mitterrand&#x27;s reputation. Years later in 1965, when François Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. &quot;No, and don&#x27;t insist&quot; was the General&#x27;s response, &quot;It would be wrong to demean the office of the Presidency, since one day he [Mitterrand] may have the job.&quot;

Mitterrand visited China in 1961, during the worst of the Great Chinese Famine, but denied the existence of starvation.

===Opposition to De Gaulle: 1964–1971===
In the 1962 election, Mitterrand regained his seat in the National Assembly with the support of the PCF and the SFIO. Practising left unity in Nièvre, he advocated the rallying of left-wing forces at the national level, including the PCF, in order to challenge Gaullist domination. Two years later, he became the president (chairman) of the General Council of Nièvre. While the opposition to De Gaulle organized in clubs, he founded his own group, the Convention of Republican Institutions (&quot;Convention des institutions républicaines&quot;, CIR). He reinforced his position as a left-wing opponent to Charles de Gaulle in publishing &quot;Le Coup d&#x27;État permanent&quot; (The permanent coup, 1964), which criticized de Gaulle&#x27;s personal power, the weaknesses of Parliament and of the government, the President&#x27;s exclusive control of foreign affairs, and defence, etc.

In 1965, Mitterrand was the first left-wing politician who saw the presidential election by universal suffrage as a way to defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO), French Communist Party (PCF), Radical-Socialist Party (PR) and Unified Socialist Party (PSU)). He ended the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader Guy Mollet, Mitterrand&#x27;s candidacy prevented Gaston Defferre, his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, François Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties&#x27; staff members.

De Gaulle was expected to win in the first round, but Mitterrand received 31.7% of the vote, denying De Gaulle a first-round victory. François Mitterrand was supported in the second round by the left and other anti-Gaullists: centrist Jean Monnet, moderate conservative Paul Reynaud and Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, an extreme right-winger and the lawyer who had defended Raoul Salan, one of the four generals who had organized the 1961 Algiers putsch during the Algerian War.

Mitterrand received 44.8% of votes in the second round and de Gaulle, with the majority, was thus elected for another term, but this defeat was regarded as honourable, for no one was really expected to defeat de Gaulle. François Mitterrand took the lead of a centre-left alliance: the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left (&quot;Fédération de la gauche démocrate et socialiste&quot;, FGDS). It was composed of the SFIO, the Radicals and several left-wing republican clubs (such the CIR of François Mitterrand).
In the legislative election of March 1967, the system where all candidates who failed to pass a 10% threshold in the first round were eliminated from the second round favoured the pro-Gaullist majority, which faced a split opposition (PCF, FGDS and centrists of Jacques Duhamel). Nevertheless, the parties of the left managed to gain 63 seats more than previously for a total of 194. The Communists remained the largest left-wing group with 22.5% of votes. The governing coalition won with its majority reduced by only one seat (247 seats out of 487).

In Paris, the Left (FGDS, PSU, PCF) managed to win more votes in the first round than the two governing parties (46% against 42.6%) while the Democratic Centre of Duhamel got 7% of votes. But with 38% of votes, de Gaulle&#x27;s Union for the Fifth Republic remained the leading French party.

During the May 1968 governmental crisis, François Mitterrand held a press conference to announce his candidacy if a new presidential election was held. But after the Gaullist demonstration on the Champs-Élysées, de Gaulle dissolved the Assembly and called for a legislative election instead. In this election, the right-wing won its largest majority since the &quot;Bloc National&quot; in 1919.

Mitterrand was accused of being responsible for this huge legislative defeat and the FGDS split. In 1969, François Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: Guy Mollet refused to give him the support of the SFIO. The left-wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 per cent of the total vote. Georges Pompidou faced the centrist Alain Poher in the second round.

===Socialist Party leader: 1971–1981===
After the FGDS&#x27;s implosion Mitterrand turned to the Socialist Party (&quot;Parti socialiste&quot; or PS). In June 1971, at the time of the Epinay Congress, the CIR joined the PS, which had succeeded the SFIO in 1969. The executive of the PS was then dominated by Guy Mollet&#x27;s supporters. They proposed an &quot;ideological dialogue&quot; with the Communists. For François Mitterrand, an electoral alliance with the Communists was necessary to rise to power. With this in mind, François Mitterrand obtained the support of all the internal opponents to Mollet&#x27;s faction and was elected as the first secretary of the PS. At the 1971 congress, he declared: &quot;Whoever does not accept the break with the established order, with capitalist society, cannot be an adherent of the Socialist Party.&quot;

In June 1972, Mitterrand signed the Common Programme of Government with the Communist Georges Marchais and the Left Radical Robert Fabre. With this programme, he led the 1973 legislative campaign of the &quot;Union of the Left&quot;.
At the 1974 presidential election, François Mitterrand received 43.2% of the vote in the first round, as the common candidate of the left. He faced Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in the second round. During the national TV debate, Giscard d&#x27;Estaing criticised him as being &quot;a man of the past&quot;, due to his long political career. François Mitterrand was narrowly defeated by Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, François Mitterrand receiving 49.19% and Giscard 50.81%.

In 1977, the Communist and Socialist parties failed to update the &quot;Common Programme&quot;, and then lost the 1978 legislative election. While the Socialists took the leading position on the left, by obtaining more votes than the Communists for the first time since 1936, the leadership of François Mitterrand was challenged by an internal opposition led by Michel Rocard who criticized the programme of the PS as being &quot;archaic&quot; and &quot;unrealistic&quot;. The polls indicated Rocard was more popular than François Mitterrand. Nevertheless, François Mitterrand won the vote at the Party&#x27;s Metz Congress (1979) and Rocard renounced his candidacy for the 1981 presidential election.

For his third candidacy for the presidency, Mitterrand was not supported by the PCF but only by the PS. François Mitterrand projected a reassuring image with the slogan &quot;the quiet force&quot;. He campaigned for &quot;another politics&quot;, based on the Socialist programme &quot;110 Propositions for France&quot;, and denounced the performance of the incumbent president. Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate Georges Marchais), then defeated President Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected President of France by universal suffrage.

==Presidency==

===First term: 1981–1988===
In the presidential election of 10 May 1981, François Mitterrand became the first socialist President of the Fifth Republic, and his government became the first left-wing government in 23 years. He named Pierre Mauroy as prime minister and organised a new legislative election. The Socialists obtained an absolute parliamentary majority, and four Communists joined the cabinet.

====Economic policy====
The beginning of his first term was marked by a left-wing economic policy based on the 110 Propositions for France and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the Communist Party and the Left Radical Party. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the &quot;SMIC&quot; (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, the creation of the solidarity tax on wealth, an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers&#x27; rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the Auroux Act). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity (Keynesianism), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained monetary policy implemented by the Bank of France. However, unemployment continued to grow, and the franc was devalued three times.

Old age pensions were raised by 300 francs per month to 1,700 francs for a single person and to 3,700 francs for a couple, while health insurance benefits were made more widely available to unemployed persons and part-time employees. Housing allocations for the low-paid were raised by 25% in 1981, and in the two years following May 1981 family allowances were increased by 44% for families with 3 children and by 81% for families with 2 children. In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982. In addition, the minimum wage (which affected 1.7 million employees) was increased by 15% in real terms between May 1981 and December 1982.

Major efforts were made to improve access to housing and health care, while the government also attempted to tackle working-class under-achievement in schools by reinforcing the comprehensive system, modernising the curriculum and reducing streaming. As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for &quot;solidarity contracts&quot; whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality-promoting measures were taken. In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance. In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been eliminated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.

Mitterrand continued to promote the new technologies initiated by his predecessor Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing: the TGV high-speed train and the Minitel, a pre-World Wide Web interactive network similar to the web. The Minitel and the Paris-Lyon TGV line were inaugurated only a few weeks after the election. In addition, Government grants and loans for capital investment for modernisation were significantly increased.

François Mitterrand passed the first decentralization laws, the Defferre Act.

After two years in office, Mitterrand made a substantial u-turn in economic policies, with the March 1983 adoption of the so-called &quot;tournant de la rigueur&quot; (austerity turn). Priority was given to the struggle against inflation in order to remain competitive in the European Monetary System. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of François Mitterrand&#x27;s presidency from 1983 onwards. Nevertheless, compared to the OECD average, fiscal policy in France remained relatively expansionary during the course of the two François Mitterrand presidencies.

====Social policy====
In 1983, all members of the general pension scheme obtained the right to a full pension at the age of 60 payable at a rate of half the reference wage in return for 37.5 years contribution. The government agreed at the same time to improve the pension position of some public sector employees and to increase the real value of the minimum pension. In addition, later negotiations brought retirement at 60 years into the occupational schemes although the financial terms for doing so could only be agreed for a 7-year period. A comparison between 1981 and 1986 showed that the minimum state pension had increased by 64% for a couple and by 81% for one person. During that same period, family allowances had increased by 71% for three children and by 112% for two children. In addition, the single-parent allowance for mothers or fathers with one child had been increased by 103% and for two or more children by 52% for each child.

In order to mark the importance of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an effort to try to relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy from their point of view and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping the elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.

In the field of health care, some prescription charges were abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers&#x27; rights in the health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers. From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired at the age of 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985. A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and establishing an Immigrants Council in 1984.

Although the income limit for allowances varied according to the position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women’s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life. In addition, a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies. In January 1984, a decree was made granting state aid to companies which implemented equality plans for staff. That same year, a law was passed that gave the regional Caissess des Allocations Familiales the task of collecting unpaid alimony, initially for lone parents and subsequently for remarried or cohabiting mothers.

In the field of education, more resources were devoted to the educational system, with the education budgets of 1982, 1983, and 1984 increasing by approximately 4% to 6% per year above the rate of inflation. From 1981 to 1983, the corps of teachers was increased by 30,000. Authorization was restored for a number of advanced undergraduate and graduate programmes which the previous centre-right minister Alice Saunier-Seité had rejected on grounds of economy and &quot;rationalization&quot; of resources. Numerous initiatives were carried out such as the teaching of civics, the reintroduction of the teaching of French history and geography at the primary level, the introduction of new professional degrees, a partnership between schools and enterprises, and the introduction of computers in classrooms. Priority areas were set up in 1981 as part of a systematic effort to combat underachievement in schools, while technical education was encouraged. In addition, nursery education was expanded, while efforts by the Socialists to promote joint research between industry and the research agencies increased the number of such contracts by half each year between 1982 and 1985, with a 29% increase in joint patents. The baccalauréat professionnel, introduced in 1985, enabled holders of a Brevet d&#x27;études professionnelles (or in some cases of a Certificat d’aptitude professionnelle) to continue for another two years and study for the baccalauréat.

Several measures were taken to put an end to the discrimination of homosexuals and repeal legal practices that repressed them. The Minister of the Interior, Gaston Defferre, put an end to the registration of homosexuals, and the Communist Jack Ralite, Minister of Health, removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders. The government also introduced the passage of the sexual majority to 15 years for all, abolishing the distinction, introduced in 1942, in the age of consent between homosexual and heterosexual relations. Homosexual lifestyle ceased to be a clause for cancellation of a residential lease.

Mitterrand abolished the death penalty as soon as he took office (via the Badinter Act), as well as the &quot;anti-casseurs Act&quot; which instituted collective responsibility for acts of violence during demonstrations. He also dissolved the &quot;Cour de sûreté&quot;, a special high court, and enacted a massive regularization of illegal immigrants. Tighter regulations on the powers of police to stop, search and arrest were introduced, and the &quot;loi sécurité et liberté&quot; (a controversial public order act) was repealed. In addition, the legal aid system was improved.

In 1984, a law was passed to ensure that divorced women who were not in receipt of maintenance would be provided with assistance in recovering the shortfall in their income from their former husband. By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families to get back into employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other’s debts.

Childcare facilities were also expanded, with the number of places in crèches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986. In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased. From 1981 to 1984, the &quot;SMIC&quot; rose by 125%, while prices went up by only 75% during that same period. Various measures were also introduced to mitigate the effects of rising unemployment. Between 1981 and 1986, there had been just over 800,000 young people placed on special work schemes, 800,000 early retirements, 200,000 enterprise allowance successes, and 30,000 retrained workers from declining industrial sectors.

====Cultural policy====
With respect to cultural policies, grants were allocated to non-profit associations and community cultural initiatives, Mitterrand liberalized the media, created the CSA media regulation agency, and authorized pirate radio and the first private TV (Canal+), giving rise to the private broadcasting sector.

In terms of the theatre, some transfer of resources was made from the subsidy of the national theatres to the support for theatre companies which did not necessarily have an institutional home. A significant investment was made in music education with the creation of 5 new music schools in the departments and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris were considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a way that was lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.

The Socialists continued the policies of their predecessors with the Grand Louvre project and the opening of the Picasso Museum at the Hotel Sale, while the museum budget was quadrupled and particular sums were set aside for the first time for large regional projects including the establishment of a number of new museums in the provinces such as the Ecomuseum at Chartres and the Museum of Prehistory at Carnac. A Fonds Regional des Acquisitions was established to assist provincial museums in the purchase of works of art, while the state actively continued an existing policy of encouraging bequests in lieu of death duties.

Libraries and publishing benefited from new thinking and an injection of funds, while aid to authors and publishers was restructured and book prices were fixed once again, with the objective being to assist smaller publishing houses and specialist bookshops. The network of regional lending libraries was significantly reinforced, while financial assistance was provided for the export of French books. In addition, archaeology, ethnography and historical buildings and monuments all benefited from the general increase in resources.

====Domestic difficulties====
The Left lost the 1983 municipal elections and the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same time, the Savary Bill, to limit the financing of private schools by local communities, caused a political crisis. It was abandoned and Mauroy resigned in July 1984. Laurent Fabius succeeded him, and the Communists left the cabinet.

In terms of foreign policy, Mitterrand did not significantly deviate from his predecessors and he continued nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific in spite of protests from various peace and environmentalist organizations. In 1985, French agents sank the Greenpeace-owned ex-trawler &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; while it was docked in Auckland, New Zealand which the group had used in demonstrations against nuclear tests, whaling, and seal hunting. One Greenpeace member was killed, and when news broke of the event, a major scandal erupted that led to the resignation of Defence Minister Charles Hernu. France apologized with a subsequent payment of $8.16m reparations to Greenpeace in damages, NZ$13m to the New Zealand Government and a significant amount to the relatives of the deceased.

====First Cohabitation====
Before the 1986 legislative campaign, proportional representation was instituted in accordance with the 110 Propositions. It did not prevent, however, the victory of the Rally for the Republic/Union for French Democracy (RPR/UDF) coalition. François Mitterrand thus named the RPR leader Jacques Chirac as Prime Minister. This period of government, with a President and a Prime Minister who came from two opposite coalitions, was the first time that such a combination had occurred under the Fifth Republic, and came to be known as &quot;Cohabitation&quot;.

Chirac mostly handled domestic policy while François Mitterrand concentrated on his &quot;reserved domain&quot; of foreign affairs and defence. However, several conflicts erupted between the two. In one example, Mitterrand refused to sign executive decrees of liberalisation, obliging Chirac to pass the measures through parliament instead. François Mitterrand also reportedly gave covert support to some social movements, notably the student revolt against the university reform (Devaquet Bill). Benefiting from the difficulties of Chirac&#x27;s cabinet, the President&#x27;s popularity increased.

With the polls running in his favour, François Mitterrand announced his candidacy in the 1988 presidential election. He proposed a moderate programme (promising &quot;neither nationalisation nor privatization&quot;), advocated a &quot;united France,&quot; and laid out his policy priorities in his &quot;Letter to the French People.&quot; He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes. François Mitterrand thus became the first President to be elected twice by universal suffrage.

===Second term: 1988–1995===

====Domestic policy====
Following his re-election, he named Michel Rocard as prime minister, despite their poor relations. Rocard led the moderate wing of the PS and he was the most popular of the Socialist politicians. François Mitterrand decided to organize a new legislative election. The PS obtained a relative parliamentary majority. Four centre-right politicians joined the cabinet.

The second term was marked by the creation of the Insertion Minimum Revenue (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac&#x27;s cabinet; the institution of the Generalized social tax; the extension of parental leave up to the child&#x27;s third birthday; the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy; the 1990 Gayssot Act on hate speech and Holocaust denial; the Besson law of 1990; the Mermaz Law of 1989; the introduction of a private childcare allowance; the Urban Orientation Law of 1991; the Arpaillange Act on the financing of political parties; the reform of the penal code; the Matignon Agreements concerning New Caledonia; the Evin Act on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990; and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities. Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the Grands Projets of François Mitterrand with the building of the Louvre Pyramid, the Channel Tunnel, the Grande Arche at La Défense, the Bastille Opera, the Finance Ministry in Bercy, and the National Library of France. On 16 February 1993, President François Mitterrand inaugurated in Fréjus a memorial to the wars in Indochina.

But the second term was also marked by rivalries within the PS and the split of the &quot;Mitterrandist&quot; group (at the Rennes Congress, where supporters of Laurent Fabius and Lionel Jospin clashed bitterly for control of the party), the scandals about the financing of the party, the contaminated blood scandal which implicated Laurent Fabius and former ministers Georgina Dufoix and Emond Hervé, and the Elysée wiretaps affairs.

====Second Cohabitation====
Disappointed with Rocard&#x27;s apparent failure to enact the Socialists&#x27; programme, Mitterrand dismissed Michel Rocard in 1991 and appointed Édith Cresson to replace him. She was the first woman to become prime minister in France but proved a costly mistake due to her tendency to make acerbic and racist public remarks. After the Socialists experienced heavy losses in the 1992 regional elections, Cresson resigned from office. Her successor Pierre Bérégovoy promised to fight unemployment and corruption but he could not prevent the catastrophic defeat of the left in the 1993 legislative election. The Socialist Party suffered a crushing defeat with the right-wing parties winning 485 seats to the left&#x27;s 95. He killed himself on 1 May 1993.

Mitterrand named the former RPR Finance Minister Edouard Balladur as Prime Minister. The second &quot;cohabitation&quot; was less contentious than the first, because the two men knew they were not rivals for the next presidential election. By this point, François Mitterrand was nearly 80 years old and suffering from cancer in addition to the shock of his friend François de Grossouvre&#x27;s suicide. His second and last term ended after the 1995 presidential election in May 1995 with the election of Jacques Chirac. Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin lost the presidential election.

Overall, as President, Mitterrand maintained the &quot;basic characteristic of a strong welfare base underpinned by a strong state.&quot; A United Nations Human Development report concluded that, from 1979 to 1989, France was the only country in the OECD (apart from Portugal) in which income inequalities did not get worse. During his second term as president, however, the gap between rich and poor widened in France, with both unemployment and poverty rising in the wake of the economic recession of 1991–1993. According to other studies, though, the percentage of the French population living in poverty (based on various criteria) fell between the mid-Eighties and the mid-Nineties.

===Foreign policy===

According to Wayne Northcutt, certain domestic circumstances helped shape Mitterrand&#x27;s foreign policy in four ways: he needed to maintain a political consensus; he kept an eye on economic conditions; he believed in the nationalistic imperative for French policy; and he tried to exploit Gaullism and its heritage for political advantage.

====East/West relations====
François Mitterrand supported closer European collaboration and the preservation of France&#x27;s unique relationship with its former colonies, which he feared were falling under &quot;Anglo-Saxon influence.&quot; His drive to preserve French power in Africa led to controversies concerning Paris&#x27; role during the Rwandan genocide.

Despite Mitterrand&#x27;s left-wing affiliations, the 1980s saw France becoming more distant from the USSR, especially following events such as the expulsion of 47 Soviet diplomats and their families from the country in 1982 after they were accused of large-scale industrial and military espionage. François Mitterrand also sharply criticized the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan as well as the country&#x27;s nuclear weapons buildup. When François Mitterrand visited the USSR in November 1988, the Soviet media claimed to be &#x27;leaving aside the virtually wasted decade and losing the Soviet-French &#x27;special relationship&#x27; of the Gaullist era&#x27;.

Nevertheless, Mitterrand was worried by the rapidity of the Eastern bloc&#x27;s collapse. He was opposed to German reunification but came to see it as unavoidable. He was opposed to the swift recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, which he thought would lead to the violent implosion of Yugoslavia.

France participated in the Gulf War (1990–1991) with the U.N. coalition.

====European policy====

He initially opposed further membership, fearing the Community was not ready and it would water it down to a free trade area.

Mitterrand supported the enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal (which both joined in January 1986). In February 1986 he helped the &quot;Single European Act&quot; come into effect. He worked well with his friend Helmut Kohl and improved Franco-German relations significantly. Together they fathered the Maastricht Treaty, which was signed on 7 February 1992. It was ratified by referendum, and approved by just over 51% of the voters.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was against a German reunification and also against the then discussed Maastricht Treaty.
When Kohl, then West German Chancellor, asked François Mitterrand to agree to reunification (France was one of the four Allies who had to agree to the Two Plus Four-treaty), François Mitterrand told Kohl he accepted it only in the event Germany would abandon the Deutsche Mark and adopt the Euro. Kohl accepted this package deal (including without talking to Karl Otto Pöhl, then President of the Bundesbank).

That year, he also established the Mitterrand doctrine, a policy of not extraditing convicted far-left terrorists of the years of lead such as Cesare Battisti to Italy, due to the alleged non-conformity of Italian legislation to European standards of rule of law, in particular the anti-terrorism laws passed by Italy in the 1970s and 1980s. When the European Court of Human Rights finally ruled against the François Mitterrand doctrine, the policy had already led to most of the criminals never being punished for their crimes.

====1990 speech at La Baule====
Responding to a democratic movement in Africa after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, he made his La Baule speech in June 1990 which tied development aid to democratic efforts from former French colonies, and during which he opposed the devaluation of the CFA Franc. Seeing an &quot;East wind&quot; blowing in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he stated that a &quot;Southern wind&quot; was also blowing in Africa, and that state leaders had to respond to the populations&#x27; wishes and aspirations by a &quot;democratic opening&quot;, which included a representative system, free elections, multipartyism, freedom of the press, an independent judiciary, and abolition of censorship. Claiming that France was the country making the most important effort concerning development aid, he announced that the least developed countries (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of Third World debt during the 1980s). He likewise limited the interest rate to 5% on French loans to intermediate-income countries (that is, Ivory Coast, Congo, Cameroon and Gabon).

He also criticized interventionism in sovereign matters, which was according to him only another form of &quot;colonialism&quot;. However, according to François Mitterrand, this did not imply lessened concern on the part of Paris for its former colonies. François Mitterrand thus continued with the African policy of de Gaulle inaugurated in 1960, which followed the relative failure of the 1958 creation of the French Community. All in all, François Mitterrand&#x27;s La Baule speech, which marked a relative turning point in France&#x27;s policy concerning its former colonies, has been compared with the 1956 &quot;loi-cadre Defferre&quot; which was responding to anti-colonialist feelings.

African heads of state reacted to François Mitterrand&#x27;s speech at most with indifference. Omar Bongo, President of Gabon, declared that he would rather have &quot;events counsel him;&quot; Abdou Diouf, President of Senegal, said that, according to him, the best solution was a &quot;strong government&quot; and a &quot;good faith opposition;&quot; the President of Chad, Hissène Habré (nicknamed the &quot;African Pinochet&quot;) claimed that it was contradictory to demand that African states should simultaneously carry on a &quot;democratic policy&quot; and &quot;social and economic policies which limited their sovereignty&quot;, in a clear allusion to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank&#x27;s &quot;structural adjustment programs&quot;. Hassan II, the king of Morocco, said for his part that &quot;Africa was too open to the world to remain indifferent to what was happening around it&quot;, but that Western countries should &quot;help young democracies open out, without putting a knife under their throat, without a brutal transition to multipartyism.&quot;

All in all, the La Baule speech has been said to be on one hand &quot;one of the foundations of political renewal in Africa French speaking area&quot;, and on the other hand &quot;cooperation with France&quot;, this despite &quot;incoherence and inconsistency, like any public policy&quot;.

====Discovery of HIV====
The controversy surrounding the discovery of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was intense after American researcher Robert Gallo and French scientist Luc Montagnier both claimed to have discovered it. The two scientists had given the new virus different names. The controversy was eventually settled by an agreement (helped along by the mediation of Dr Jonas Salk) between President Ronald Reagan and François Mitterrand which gave equal credit to both men and their teams.

====Apology to the Huguenots====
In October 1985, to commemorate the tricentenary of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Mitterrand gave a formal apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world. At the same time, a special postage stamp was released in their honour. The stamp states that France &quot;is&quot; the home of the Huguenots (&quot;Accueil des Huguenots&quot;). Hence their rights were finally recognised.

====Co-Prince of Andorra====
On 2 February 1993, in his capacity as co-prince of Andorra, Mitterrand and Joan Martí Alanis, who was Bishop of Urgell and therefore Andorra&#x27;s other co-prince, signed Andorra&#x27;s new constitution, which was later approved by referendum in the principality.

== Death ==
Mitterrand died in Paris on 8 January 1996 at the age of 79 from prostate cancer, a condition he and his doctors had concealed for most of his presidency (see section on &quot;Medical secrecy&quot; below). A few days before his death, he was joined by family members and close friends for a &quot;last meal&quot; that attracted controversy because, in addition to other gourmet dishes, it included the serving of roast ortolan bunting, a small wild songbird that is a protected species whose sale was and remains illegal in France.

=== Funeral ===
The day of the funeral was declared a national day of mourning. A requiem mass was held at Notre-Dame cathedral, celebrated by Cardinal Lustiger in the presence of UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, EU President Jacques Santer and representatives from 171 countries. Daniel Tarschys, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, former President of the European Commission Jacques Delors and Simone Veil were present. Jacques Chirac, President of France, Alain Juppé, Prime Minister of France, former president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and former prime ministers Édouard Balladur, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, Laurent Fabius, Maurice Couve de Murville, Michel Rocard, Pierre Mauroy, Édith Cresson were present. Sixty-one heads of state were presented.

==Prime ministers during presidency==
, François Mitterrand has had the most prime ministers during the regime of the 5th Republic.
==Controversies==

===Medical secrecy===
Following his death, a controversy erupted when his former physician, Claude Gubler, wrote a book called &quot;Le Grand Secret&quot; (&quot;The Grand Secret&quot;) explaining that François Mitterrand had false health reports published since November 1981, hiding his cancer. François Mitterrand&#x27;s family then prosecuted Gubler and his publisher for violating medical confidentiality.

===Urba===
The Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the Socialist Party to advise Socialist-led communes on infrastructure projects and public works. The Urba affair became public in 1989 when two police officers investigating the Marseille regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation&#x27;s contracts, which showed a division of proceeds between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and corrupt payments to politicians, an edict from the office of François Mitterrand (even though he himself was listed as a recipient) prevented further investigation. The François Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by Henri Nallet, who then became Justice Minister and therefore in charge of the investigation at the national level. In 1990 François Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Socialist Party treasurer Henri Emmanuelli was tried in 1997 for corruption offences, for which he received a two-year suspended sentence.

===Wiretaps===
From 1982 to 1986, François Mitterrand established an &quot;anti-terror cell&quot; installed as a service of the President of the Republic. This was an unusual set-up since such law enforcement missions against terrorism are normally left to the National Police and &quot;Gendarmerie&quot;, run under the cabinet and the Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the judiciary. The cell was largely staffed by members of these services, but it bypassed the normal line of command and safeguards. Three thousand conversations concerning 150 people (7 for reasons judged to be contestable by the ensuing court process) were recorded between January 1983 and March 1986 by this anti-terrorist cell at the Elysée Palace. In one of its first actions, the cell was involved in the &quot;Irish of Vincennes&quot; affair, in which it appeared that members of the cell had planted weapons and explosives in the Vincennes apartment of three Irish nationals who were arrested on terrorism charges. Most markedly, it appears that the cell, under illegal presidential orders, obtained wiretaps on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment to François Mitterrand&#x27;s personal life. The illegal wiretapping was revealed in 1993 by &quot;Libération&quot;; the case against members of the cell went to trial in November 2004.

It took 20 years for the &quot;affaire&quot; to come before the courts because the instructing judge Jean-Paul Vallat was at first thwarted by the &quot;affaire&quot; being classed a defence secret, but in December 1999 the &quot;Commission consultative du secret de la défense nationale&quot; declassified part of the files concerned. The judge finished his investigation in 2000, but it still took another four years before coming on 15 November 2004 before the 16th chamber of the &quot;Tribunal correctionnel de Paris&quot;. Twelve people were charged with &quot;atteinte à la vie privée&quot; (breach of privacy) and one with selling computer files. Seven were given suspended sentences and fines and 4 were found not guilty.

The affair finally ended before the &quot;Tribunal correctionnel de Paris&quot; with the court&#x27;s judgement on 9 November 2005. Seven members of the President&#x27;s anti-terrorist unit were convicted and Mitterrand was designated as the &quot;inspirator and essentially the controller of the operation.&quot;

The court&#x27;s judgement revealed that Mitterrand was motivated by keeping elements of his private life secret from the general public, such as the existence of his illegitimate daughter Mazarine Pingeot (which the writer Jean-Edern Hallier, was threatening to reveal), his cancer which had been diagnosed in 1981, and the elements of his past in the Vichy Régime which were not already public knowledge. The court judged that certain people were tapped for &quot;obscure&quot; reasons, such as Carole Bouquet&#x27;s companion, a lawyer with family in the Middle East, Edwy Plenel, a journalist for &quot;Le Monde&quot; who covered the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; story and the Vincennes Three affair, and the lawyer Antoine Comte. The court declared &quot;Les faits avaient été commis sur ordre soit du président de la République, soit des ministres de la Défense successifs qui ont mis à la disposition de (Christian Prouteau) tous les moyens de l&#x27;État afin de les exécuter&quot; (translation: these actions were committed following orders from the French President or his various Defence Ministers who gave Christian Prouteau full access to the state machinery so he could execute the orders) The court stated that François Mitterrand was the principal instigator of the wire taps (l&#x27;inspirateur et le décideur de l&#x27;essentiel) and that he had ordered some of the taps and turned a blind eye to others and that none of the 3000 wiretaps carried out by the cell were legally obtained.

On 13 March 2007 the Court of Appeal in Paris awarded a symbolic €1 in damages to the actress Carole Bouquet and €5000 to Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Michel Beau for breach of privacy.

The case was taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which gave judgement on 7 June 2007 that the rights of free expression of the journalists involved in the case were not respected.

In 2008 the French state was ordered by the courts to give Jean-Edern Hallier&#x27;s family compensation.

===Rwanda===
Paris assisted Rwanda&#x27;s president Juvénal Habyarimana, who was assassinated on 6 April 1994 while travelling in a Dassault Falcon 50 given to him as a personal gift of François Mitterrand. Through the offices of the &#x27;Cellule Africaine&#x27;, a Presidential office headed by François Mitterrand&#x27;s son, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, he provided the Hutu regime with financial and military support in the early 1990s. With French assistance, the Rwandan army grew from a force of 9,000 men in October 1990 to 28,000 in 1991. France also provided training staff, experts and massive quantities of weaponry and facilitated arms contracts with Egypt and South Africa. It also financed, armed and trained Habyrimana&#x27;s Presidential Guard. French troops were deployed under Opération Turquoise, a military operation carried out under a United Nations (UN) mandate. The operation is currently the object of political and historical debate.

===Bombing of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;===
On 10 July 1985, the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, a Greenpeace vessel, was in New Zealand preparing to protest against French nuclear testing in the South Pacific when two explosions sank the ship, resulting in the death of freelance photographer Fernando Pereira. The New Zealand government called the bombing the first terrorist attack in the country. In mid-1985, French Defence Minister Charles Hernu was forced to resign after New Zealand authorities arrested DGSE (French intelligence services) agents who confessed to planting the explosives and later pleaded guilty.

On the twentieth anniversary of the sinking, it was revealed that François Mitterrand had personally authorised the mission. Admiral Pierre Lacoste, the former head of the DGSE, made a statement saying Pereira&#x27;s death weighed heavily on his conscience. Television New Zealand (TVNZ) also sought access to the court video recording hearing where two French agents pleaded guilty, which they .

<doc id="38001" wikidata="Q170545" url="?curid=38001" title="Phenylalanine">
<text>Phenylalanine (symbol Phe or F) is an essential α-amino acid with the formula . It can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The -isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the biological pigment melanin. It is encoded by the messenger RNA codons UUU and UUC.

Phenylalanine is found naturally in the milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement as it is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins.

The one-letter symbol F was assigned to phenylalanine for its phonetic similarity.

==History==
The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula, C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (&quot;Lupinus luteus&quot;) seedlings. In 1882, Erlenmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia.

The genetic codon for phenylalanine was first discovered by J. Heinrich Matthaei and Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1961. They showed that by using mRNA to insert multiple uracil repeats into the genome of the bacterium &quot;E. coli&quot;, they could cause the bacterium to produce a polypeptide consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the coding relationship that links information stored in genomic nucleic acid with protein expression in the living cell.

==Dietary sources==
Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans. Another common source of phenylalanine is anything sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame, such as diet drinks, diet foods and medication; the metabolism of aspartame produces phenylalanine as one of the compound&#x27;s metabolites.

==Dietary recommendations==
The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33 mg/kg body weight/day. In 2005 the DRI is set to 27 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine), the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendation of 2007 is 25 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine).

==Other biological roles==
-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into -tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids. -tyrosine in turn is converted into -DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines.

Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of serotonin and other aromatic amino acids as well as nitric oxide due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, iron or tetrahydrobiopterin. The corresponding enzymes for those compounds are the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family and nitric oxide synthase.

===In plants===
Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the synthesis of flavonoids. Lignan is derived from phenylalanine and from tyrosine. Phenylalanine is converted to cinnamic acid by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase.

==Biosynthesis==
Phenylalanine is biosynthesized via the shikimate pathway.

==Phenylketonuria==

The genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Individuals with this disorder are known as &quot;phenylketonurics&quot; and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood. Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L.

A (rare) &quot;variant form&quot; of phenylketonuria called hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by the inability to synthesize a cofactor called tetrahydrobiopterin, which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood), but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation. Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity.

A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener aspartame. This compound is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: &quot;Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine.&quot; In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of &quot;aspartame or E951&quot; and they must be labeled with a warning &quot;Contains a source of phenylalanine.&quot; In Brazil, the label &quot;Contém Fenilalanina&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Contains Phenylalanine&quot;) is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods.

==-, - and -phenylalanine==
The stereoisomer -phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional organic synthesis, either as a single enantiomer or as a component of the racemic mixture. It does not participate in protein biosynthesis although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been processed. The biological functions of -amino acids remain unclear, although -phenylalanine has pharmacological activity at niacin receptor 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPHAR/BPS-bio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities, which have been supported by clinical trials. -Phenylalanine is a mixture of -phenylalanine and -phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of -phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by -phenylalanine of enkephalin degradation by the enzyme carboxypeptidase A.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPHAR/BPS-clinical&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Enkephalins act as agonists of the mu and delta opioid receptors, and agonists of these receptors are known to produce antidepressant effects. The mechanism of -phenylalanine&#x27;s supposed antidepressant activity may also be accounted for in part by the precursor role of -phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, though clinical trials have not found an antidepressant effect from -phenylalanine alone. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. -Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A small amount of -phenylalanine appears to be converted to -phenylalanine. -Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the blood–brain barrier less efficiently than -phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of -phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system.

-Phenylalanine is an antagonist at α2δ Ca2+ calcium channels with a Ki of 980 nM.

In the brain, -phenylalanine is a competitive antagonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor and at the glutamate binding site of AMPA receptor. At the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor -phenylalanine has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 573 μM estimated by Schild regression which is considerably lower than brain -phenylalanine concentration observed in untreated human phenylketonuria.
-Phenylalanine also inhibits neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex with IC50 of 980 μM, a brain concentration seen in classical phenylketonuria, whereas -phenylalanine has a significantly smaller effect.

==Commercial synthesis==
-Phenylalanine is produced for medical, feed, and nutritional applications, such as aspartame, in large quantities by utilizing the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, which naturally produces aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine. The quantity of -phenylalanine produced commercially has been increased by genetically engineering &quot;E. coli&quot;, such as by altering the regulatory promoters or amplifying the number of genes controlling enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the amino acid.

==Derivatives==
Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, used in neutron capture therapy.

4-Azido--phenylalanine is a protein-incorporated unnatural amino acid used as a tool for bioconjugation in the field of chemical biology.

<text>The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is a tandem-rotor helicopter originally developed by American rotorcraft company Vertol and now manufactured by Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security. The Chinook is a heavy-lift helicopter that is among the heaviest lifting Western helicopters. Its name, Chinook, is from the Native American Chinook people of Oregon and Washington state.

The Chinook was originally designed by Vertol, which had begun work in 1957 on a new tandem-rotor helicopter, designated as the Vertol Model 107 or V-107. Around the same time, the United States Department of the Army announced its intention to replace the piston-engine–powered Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave with a new, gas turbine–powered helicopter. During June 1958, the U.S. Army ordered a small number of V-107s from Vertol under the &quot;YHC-1A&quot; designation; following testing, some Army officials considered it to be too heavy for the assault missions and too light for transport purposes. While the YHC-1A would be improved and adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps as the CH-46 Sea Knight, the Army sought a heavier transport helicopter, and ordered an enlarged derivative of the V-107 with the Vertol designation Model 114. Initially designated as the &quot;YCH-1B&quot;, on 21 September 1961, the preproduction rotorcraft performed its maiden flight. In 1962, the HC-1B was redesignated &quot;CH-47A&quot; under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system.

The Chinook possesses several means of loading various cargoes, including multiple doors across the fuselage, a wide loading ramp located at the rear of the fuselage and a total of three external ventral cargo hooks to carry underslung loads. Capable of a top speed of , upon its introduction to service in 1962, the helicopter was considerably faster than contemporary 1960s utility helicopters and attack helicopters, and is still one of the fastest helicopters in the US inventory. Improved and more powerful versions of the Chinook have also been developed since its introduction; one of the most substantial variants to be produced was the CH-47D, which first entered service in 1982; improvements from the CH-47C standard included upgraded engines, composite rotor blades, a redesigned cockpit to reduce workload, improved and redundant electrical systems and avionics, and the adoption of an advanced flight control system. It remains one of the few aircraft to be developed during the early 1960s – along with the fixed-wing Lockheed C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft – that has remained in both production and frontline service for over 60 years.

The military version of the helicopter has been exported to nations across the world; the U.S. Army and the Royal Air Force (see Boeing Chinook (UK variants)) have been its two largest users. The civilian version of the Chinook is the Boeing Vertol 234. It has been used by civil operators not only for passenger and cargo transport, but also for aerial firefighting and to support logging, construction, and oil extraction industries.

==Design and development==
===Initial development===
During late 1956, the United States Department of the Army announced its intention to replace the Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave, which was powered by piston engines, with a new, gas turbine-powered helicopter. Turbine engines were also a key design feature of the smaller UH-1 &quot;Huey&quot; utility helicopter. Following a design competition, in September 1958, a joint Army–Air Force source selection board recommended that the Army procure the Vertol-built medium transport helicopter. However, funding for full-scale development was not then available, and the Army vacillated on its design requirements. Some officials in Army Aviation thought that the new helicopter should be operated as a light tactical transport aimed at taking over the missions of the old piston-engined Piasecki H-21 and Sikorsky H-34 helicopters, and be consequently capable of carrying about 15 troops (one squad). Another faction in Army Aviation thought that the new helicopter should be much larger, enabling it to airlift large artillery pieces and possess enough internal space to carry the new MGM-31 &quot;Pershing&quot; missile system.
During 1957, Vertol commenced work upon a new tandem-rotor helicopter, designated as the Vertol Model 107 or V-107. During June 1958, the U.S. Army awarded a contract to Vertol for the acquisition of a small number of the rotorcraft, giving it the &quot;YHC-1A&quot; designation. As ordered, the YHC-1A possessed the capacity to carry a maximum of 20 troops. Three underwent testing by the Army for deriving engineering and operational data. However, the YHC-1A was considered by many figures within the Army users to be too heavy for the assault role, while too light for the more general transport role. Accordingly, a decision was made to procure a heavier transport helicopter, and at the same time, upgrade the UH-1 &quot;Huey&quot; to serve as the needed tactical troop transport. The YHC-1A would be improved and adopted by the Marines as the CH-46 Sea Knight in 1962. As a result, the Army issued a new order to Vertol for an enlarged derivative of the V-107, known by internal company designation as the Model 114, which it gave the designation of HC-1B. On 21 September 1961, the preproduction Boeing Vertol YCH-1B made its initial hovering flight. During 1962, the HC-1B was redesignated the CH-47A under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system; it was also named &quot;Chinook&quot; after the Chinook people of the Pacific Northwest.
The CH-47 is powered by two turboshaft engines, mounted on each side of the helicopter&#x27;s rear pylon and connected to the rotors by drive shafts. Initial models were fitted with Lycoming T55 engines rated at each. The counter-rotating rotors eliminate the need for an antitorque vertical rotor, allowing all power to be used for lift and thrust. The ability to adjust lift in either rotor makes it less sensitive to changes in the center of gravity, important for the cargo lifting and dropping. While hovering over a specific location, a twin-rotor helicopter has increased stability over a single rotor when weight is added or removed, for example, when troops drop from or begin climbing up ropes to the aircraft, or when other cargo is dropped. If one engine fails, the other can drive both rotors. The &quot;sizing&quot; of the Chinook was directly related to the growth of the Huey and the Army&#x27;s tacticians&#x27; insistence that initial air assaults be built around the squad. The Army pushed for both the Huey and the Chinook, and this focus was responsible for the acceleration of its air mobility effort.

===Improved and later versions===
Improved and more powerful versions of the CH-47 have been developed since the helicopter entered service. Often the same airframe was upgraded to later standards, or sometimes the airframes were built to the newer upgrade. The U.S. Army&#x27;s first major design leap was the now-common CH-47D, which entered service in 1982. Improvements from the CH-47C included upgraded engines, composite rotor blades, a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload, improved and redundant electrical systems, an advanced flight control system, and improved avionics. The latest mainstream generation is the CH-47F, which features several major upgrades to reduce maintenance, digitized flight controls, and is powered by two Honeywell engines.
An example of a British upgraded version is the HC.4; the first HC.4 first flew on 9 December 2010.
A commercial model of the Chinook, the Boeing-Vertol Model 234, is used worldwide for logging, construction, fighting forest fires, and supporting petroleum extraction operations. In December 2006, Columbia Helicopters Inc purchased the type certificate of the Model 234 from Boeing. The Chinook has also been licensed to be built by companies outside the United States, such as Agusta (now AgustaWestland) in Italy and Kawasaki in Japan.

===CH-47F orders===
In February 2007, the Royal Netherlands Air Force became the first international customer of the CH-47F model, expanding their Chinook fleet to seventeen. On 10 August 2009, Canada signed a contract for fifteen extensively modified and upgraded CH-47Fs for the Canadian Forces, later delivered in 2013–2014 with the Canadian designation CH-147F. On 15 December 2009, Britain announced its Future Helicopter Strategy, including the purchase of twenty-four new CH-47Fs to be delivered from 2012. Australia ordered seven CH-47Fs in March 2010 to replace its six CH-47Ds between 2014 and 2017. In September 2015, India approved purchase of fifteen CH-47F Chinooks. On 7 November 2016, Singapore announced that the CH-47F would replace its older Chinooks, which had been in service since 1994, enabling the Republic of Singapore Air Force to meet its requirements for various operations, including Search and Rescue (SAR), Aeromedical Evacuation (AME), and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations. The German government announced in June 2022 that the CH-47F Block 2 was selected as the winner of its heavy helicopter program to replace its Sikorsky CH-53G Sea Stallion fleet. Germany is planning to buy sixty airframes to boost heavy lift capability.

Spain had seventeen CH-47s which it is planning to upgrade CH-47F standard. By 2023, thirteen CH-47D were upgraded to CH-47F, and additionally, four new build CH-47F were acquired.

==Operational history==

===Vietnam War===
The Army finally settled on the larger Chinook as its standard medium-transport helicopter, and by February 1966, 161 aircraft had been delivered to the Army. The 1st Cavalry Division had brought its organic Chinook battalion (three Chinook companies) when it arrived in 1965 and a separate aviation medium helicopter company, the 147th, had arrived in Vietnam on 29 November 1965. This latter company was initially placed in direct support of the 1st Infantry Division. CH-47 crews quickly learned to mount an M60 machine gun in each of the forward doors. Sometimes they also installed an M2 machine gun to fire from the rear cargo door.

The most spectacular mission in Vietnam for the Chinook was the placing of artillery batteries in perilous mountain positions inaccessible by any other means, and then keeping them resupplied with large quantities of ammunition. The 1st Cavalry Division found that its CH-47s were limited to a payload when operating in the mountains, but could carry an additional when operating near the coast.
As with any new piece of equipment, the Chinook presented a major problem of &quot;customer education&quot;. Commanders and crew chiefs had to be constantly alert that eager soldiers did not overload the temptingly large cargo compartment. It would be some time before troops would be experts at using sling loads. The Chinook soon proved to be such an invaluable aircraft for artillery movement and heavy logistics that it was seldom used as an assault troop carrier. Some of the Chinook fleet was used for casualty evacuation, and due to the very heavy demand for the helicopters, they were usually overburdened with wounded. Perhaps the most cost effective use of the Chinook was the recovery of other downed aircraft.

At the war&#x27;s peak the US Army had 21 Chinook companies in Vietnam. Pilots discovered the CH-47A&#x27;s transmission system could not handle the two gas turbines running at full power, and high humidity and heat reduced the maximum lift by more than 20% in the low lands and 30% in mountain areas. More powerful, improved transmission and strengthened fuselages arrived in 1968 with the CH-47B, followed a few months later by the CH-47C. The CH-47s in Vietnam were generally armed with a single 0.308 in (7.62 mm) M60 machine gun on a pintle mount on either side of the aircraft for self-defense, with stops fitted to keep the gunners from firing into the rotor blades. Dust filters were also added to improve engine reliability. Of the nearly 750 Chinook helicopters in the U.S. and South Vietnam fleets, about 200 were lost in combat or wartime operational accidents. The U.S. Army CH-47s supported the 1st Australian Task Force as required.
Four CH-47s were converted into ACH-47As by adding armor and improved engines. Its armament included two fixed forward firing M24A1 20 mm cannons, one turret with 40 mm automatic grenade launcher on the nose, five .50 in machine guns and two weapon pods on the sides that could carry either XM159B/XM159C 70 mm rocket launchers or 7.62 mm miniguns. They arrived in Vietnam in 1966, and they engaged in six months of operational testing at An Khê Army Airfield. They performed well in combat, but its high maintenance costs and demand for use in troop and cargo transport was stronger. Three ACH-47s were lost. One collided with a CH-47 while taxiing. Another had a retention pin shake loose on a 20 mm cannon and was brought down when its own gun fired through the forward rotor blades. The third was grounded by enemy fire and destroyed by enemy mortar rounds after the crew escaped.

===Iran===
During the 1970s, the U.S. and Iran had a strong relationship, in which the Iranian armed forces began to use many American military aircraft, most notably the F-14 Tomcat, as part of a modernization program. After an agreement signed between Boeing and Agusta, the Imperial Iranian Air Force purchased 20 Agusta-built CH-47Cs in 1971. The Imperial Iranian Army Aviation purchased 70 CH-47Cs from Agusta between 1972 and 1976. In late 1978, Iran placed an order for an additional 50 helicopters with Elicotteri Meridionali, but that order was canceled immediately after the revolution; 11 of them were delivered after multiple requests by Iran.
In the 1978 Iranian Chinook shootdown, four Iranian CH-47Cs penetrated into Soviet airspace in the Turkmenistan Military District. They were intercepted by a MiG-23M which shot down one CH-47, killing eight crew members, and forced a second helicopter to land. Chinook helicopters were used in efforts by the Iranian against Kurdish rebels in 1979.

During the Iran–Iraq War, Iran made heavy use of its US-bought equipment, and lost at least eight CH-47s during the 1980–1988 period, most notably during a clash on 15 July 1983, when an Iraqi Mirage F1 destroyed three Iranian Chinooks transporting troops to the front line, and on 25–26 February 1984, when Iraqi MiG-21 fighters shot down two examples. On 22 March 1982, in Operation Fath ol-Mobin, a key operation of the war, Iranian Chinooks were landed behind Iraqi lines, deployed troops that silenced their artillery, and captured an Iraqi headquarters; the attack took the Iraqi forces by surprise.

Despite the arms embargo in place upon Iran, it has managed to keep its Chinook fleet operational. Some of the Chinooks have been rebuilt by Panha. As of 2015, 20 to 45 Chinooks were operational in Iran.

===Libyan wars===
In 1976, the Libyan Air Force purchased 24 Italian-built CH-47C helicopters, 14 of which were transferred to the Libyan Army during the 1990s. The Libyan Air Force recruited Western pilots and technicians to operate the CH-47 fleet. The Libyan Chinooks flew transport and support missions into Chad to supply Libyan ground forces operating there in the 1980s. Chinooks were occasionally used to transport Libyan special forces in assault missions in northern Chad.

In 2002, Libya sold 16 helicopters to the United Arab Emirates, as due to the Western embargo and lack of funds, maintaining them was difficult. The sale to UAE was a $939 million package that included equipment, parts, and training. The number of CH-47s still in existence or operational during the ongoing Libyan civil wars that started in 2011 is not known.

===Falklands War===
The Chinook was used both by Argentina and the United Kingdom during the Falklands War in 1982.

The Argentine Air Force and the Argentine Army each deployed two CH-47C helicopters, which were widely used in general transport duties. Of the Army&#x27;s aircraft, one was destroyed on the ground by 30 mm cannon fire from an RAF GR3 Harrier, while the other was captured by the British and reused after the war. Both Argentine Air Force helicopters returned to Argentina and remained in service until 2002.

Three British Chinooks were destroyed on 25 May 1982 when &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was struck by an Exocet sea-skimming missile fired by an Argentine Super Étendard. The sole surviving British Chinook, Bravo November, did outstanding service in the Falklands, lifting 81 troops on one occasion. Since April 2022, it has been on display at Royal Air Force Museum Cosford.

===Afghanistan and Iraq wars===
About 163 CH-47Ds of various operators were deployed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq during Operation Desert Shield and the subsequent Operation Desert Storm in 1990–91.

The CH-47D has seen wide use in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. The Chinook is being used in air assault missions, inserting troops into fire bases, and later bringing food, water, and ammunition. It is also the casualty evacuation aircraft of choice in the British Armed Forces. In combat theaters, it is typically escorted by attack helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache for protection. Its lift capacity has been found of particular value in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan, where high altitudes and temperatures limit the use of helicopters such as the UH-60 Black Hawk; reportedly, one Chinook can replace up to five UH-60s in the air assault transport role.
The Chinook helicopters of several nations have participated in the Afghanistan War, including aircraft from Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Canada, and Australia. Despite the age of the Chinook, it is still in heavy demand, in part due its proven versatility and ability to operate in demanding environments such as Afghanistan.

In May 2011, an Australian Army CH-47D crashed during a resupply mission in Zabul Province, resulting in one fatality and five survivors. The helicopter was unable to be recovered and was destroyed in place. To compensate for the loss, the ADF added two ex-U.S. Army CH-47Ds to the fleet which are expected to be in service until the introduction of the CH-47Fs in 2016.
On 6 August 2011, a Chinook crashed near Kabul, killing all of the 38 aboard. The Chinook was reportedly shot down with a rocket-propelled grenade by the Taliban while attempting to assist a group of U.S. Navy SEALs. The 38 were members of NATO and allied forces, including 22 Naval Special Warfare operators, five U.S. Army Aviation soldiers, three U.S. Air Force special operations personnel, and seven Afghan National Army commandos. A civilian translator and a U.S. military working dog were also killed in the crash. The crash was the single deadliest during the entire Operation Enduring Freedom campaign. The previous biggest single-day loss for American forces in Afghanistan involved a Chinook that was shot down near Kabul in Kunar Province in June 2005 with all aboard killed, including a 16-member U.S. Special Operations team.

Chinook helicopters participated in the 2021 Kabul airlift at the close of military operations in Afghanistan.

===Disaster relief===
The Chinook&#x27;s ability to carry large, underslung loads has been of significant value in relief operations in the aftermath of natural disasters. Numerous operators have chosen to deploy their Chinook fleets to support humanitarian efforts in stricken nations overseas. Following the 2004 Asian tsunami, the Republic of Singapore Air Force assisted in the relief operations in neighboring Indonesia using its Chinooks; similarly, after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, the Royal Air Force dispatched several Chinooks to Northern Pakistan to assist in recovery efforts.
In August 1992, six CH-47Ds were deployed from Fort Bragg in North Carolina to provide relief in the wake of Hurricane Andrew in what was one of the first major helicopter disaster relief operations on US soil. Then President George H. W. Bush ordered the military to assist. The Chinooks arrived at Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport, just outside of the disaster zone, one day after the President&#x27;s order; early on, they performed a wide loop over Homestead and Florida City to publicly display their presence, helping to curtail lawlessness and looting. The Chinooks initially flew twelve sorties per day out of Opa Locka, which expanded over time, often supporting distribution operations at Homestead AFB and Opa Locka, as well as delivering relief payloads via internal storage, not using sling loads, supplementing the two dozen distribution centers and trucks, proving essential as trucks could not reach the worst hit areas due to downed trees and power lines. They flew everyday for approximately three weeks, moving supplies and personnel around the disaster zone as well as carrying media and government officials, including then Congressman Bill Nelson. Ultimately, the Chinooks supplied 64 distribution sites throughout the zone and transported 1.2 million pounds of supplies before the urgent relief phase ended.
Three of Japan&#x27;s CH-47s were used to cool Reactors 3 and 4 of the Fukushima Nuclear power plant following the 9.0 earthquake in 2011; they were used to collect sea water from the nearby ocean and drop it over the affected areas. In order to protect the crew from the heightened radiation levels present, a number of lead plates were attached to the floor of each Chinook; even with such measures, pilots had to keep their distance from the reactors while also limiting flight times in the vicinity to a maximum of 45 minutes to avoid excessive radiation exposure.

=== Other operations and roles ===

In April 2023, multiple Chinooks conducted the evacuation of the US Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan with Special Forces. (see also Sudanese civil war (2023–present)) Chinooks have been deployed to Mali for MINUSMA.

Since the type&#x27;s inception, the Chinook has carried out various secondary missions, including medical evacuation, disaster relief, search and rescue, aircraft recovery, fire fighting, and heavy construction assistance.
In February 2020, the Indian Air Force started using Chinooks at theatres such as Ladakh and Siachen Glacier to assist Indian forces deployed at the Indian borders with China and Pakistan. The Indian Space Research Organisation has also enlisted Indian Air Force Chinooks during the development of its Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstration Program, with Chinook helicopters air-dropping two test vehicles during the &quot;RLV-LEX-01&quot; and &quot;RLV-LEX-02&quot; conducted on April 2, 2023, and March 22, 2024, respectively.

==Variants==
There have been many versions of the Chinook over the decades, there are variants that involve major upgrades such as engines and avionics, ones for certain tasks, such as Special Operation missions, and finally there are version for certain countries, such as the J model built by and for Japan.

===HC-1B===
The pre-1962 designation for Model 114 development aircraft that would be redesignated CH-47 Chinook.

===CH-47A===
The all-weather, medium-lift CH-47A Chinook was powered initially by Lycoming T55-L-5 engines rated at , which were replaced by the T55-L-7 rated at engines or T55-L-7C engines rated at . The CH-47A had a maximum gross weight of , with a maximum payload about Delivery of the CH-47A Chinook to the U.S. Army began in August 1962. A total of 354 were built.

===ACH-47A===
The ACH-47A was known as the Armed/Armored CH-47A (or A/ACH-47A) before being designated ACH-47A as a U.S. Army Attack Cargo Helicopter, and unofficially referred to as &quot;Guns A Go-Go&quot;. Four CH-47A helicopters were converted to gunships by Boeing Vertol in late 1965. Three were assigned to the 53rd Aviation Detachment in South Vietnam for testing, with the remaining one retained in the U.S. for weapons testing. By 1966, the 53rd was redesignated the 1st Aviation Detachment (Provisional) and attached to the 228th Assault Support Helicopter Battalion of the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). By 1968, only one gunship remained, and transport demands prevented more conversions. It was returned to the United States, and the program stopped.

The ACH-47A carried five 7.62 × 51 mm M60D machine guns or .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2HB heavy machine guns, provided by the XM32 and XM33 armament subsystems, two 20 mm M24A1 cannons, two 19-tube Folding Fin Aerial Rocket launchers (XM159B/XM159) or sometimes two M18/M18A1 7.62 × 51 mm gun pods, and a single 40 mm M75 grenade launcher in the XM5/M5 armament subsystem (more commonly seen on the UH-1 series of helicopters). Rare newsreel footage shows one of the aircraft in action supporting the 8th Cavalry Regiment during an ambush at Bông Son, South Vietnam. The surviving aircraft, &quot;Easy Money&quot;, has been restored and is on display at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.

===CH-47B===

The CH-47B was an interim upgrade while Boeing worked on a more substantially improved CH-47C. The CH-47B was powered by two Lycoming T55-L-7C engines. It had a blunted rear rotor pylon, redesigned asymmetrical rotor blades, and strakes along the rear ramp and fuselage to improve flying characteristics. It could be equipped with two door-mounted M60D 7.62 mm NATO machine guns on the M24 armament subsystem and a ramp-mounted M60D using the M41 armament subsystem. Some CH-47 &quot;bombers&quot; were equipped to drop tear gas or napalm from the rear cargo ramp onto Viet Cong bunkers. The CH-47B could be equipped with a hoist and cargo hook. The Chinook proved especially valuable in &quot;Pipe Smoke&quot; aircraft recovery missions. The &quot;Hook&quot; recovered about 12,000 aircraft valued at over $3.6 billion during the war; 108 were built.

===CH-47C===
The CH-47C featured more powerful engines and transmissions. Three sub-versions were built, the first with Lycoming T55-L-7C engines delivering . The &quot;Super C&quot; had Lycoming T55-L-11 engines delivering , an upgraded maximum gross weight of , and pitch stability augmentation. The T55-L-11 engines were less reliable, as they had been hurriedly introduced to increase payload; thus, they were temporarily replaced by the more reliable Lycoming T55-L-7C. The Super C was distinguishable from the standard &quot;C&quot; by the uprated maximum gross weight.

The type was not approved by the FAA for civil aviation due to the nonredundant hydraulic flight boost system drive. The hydraulic system was redesigned for the succeeding CH-47D, allowing it to achieve certification as the Boeing Model 234. A total of 233 CH-47Cs were built. Canada bought eight CH-47Cs; deliveries of the type began in 1974. Receiving the Canadian designation &quot;CH-147&quot;, these were fitted with a power hoist above the crew door; other changes included a flight engineer station in the rear cabin: operators referred to the configuration as the &quot;Super C&quot;. The CH-47C was used widely during the Vietnam War, eventually replacing the older Piasecki H-21 Shawnee in the combat assault support role.

===CH-47D===
The CH-47D shares the same airframe as earlier models, with more powerful engines. Early CH-47Ds were powered by two T55-L-712 engines. The most common engine is the later T55-GA-714A. With its triple-hook cargo system, the CH-47D can carry heavy payloads internally and up to (such as containers) externally. It was introduced into service in 1979. In air assault operations, it often serves as the principal mover of the 155 mm M198 howitzer, plus 30 rounds of ammunition, and an 11-man crew. The CH-47D has advanced avionics, including Global Positioning System. Nearly all US Army CH-47Ds were converted from previous A, B, and C models, a total of 472 being converted. The last U.S. Army CH-47D built was delivered to the U.S. Army Reserve, located at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2002.
In 1993, the Netherlands signed an agreement with Canada to acquire seven CH-147Cs that were no longer in use with the RCAF. These airframes where upgraded by Boeing to CH-47D standard and delivery took place between August 1995 and February 1996. Six more new CH-47Ds were delivered by Boeing in 1998 for a total of 13, of which two where lost in 2005 while on duty in Afghanistan. The Dutch CH-47Ds are improved over U.S. Army CH-47Ds, including a long nose for a Bendix weather radar, a &quot;glass cockpit&quot;, and improved T55-L-714 engines. Between 2015 and 2023, the Netherlands replaced all 11 remaining CH-47Ds with 14 newly built CH-47Fs. The six CH-47Fs that where already in service have been upgraded to the same &quot;MYII CAAS&quot; standard as the newly built helicopters.

As of 2011, Singapore has 18 CH-47D/SDs, which includes twelve &quot;Super D&quot; Chinooks, in service.

In 2008, Canada purchased 6 CH-47Ds from the U.S. for the Canadian Helicopter Force Afghanistan for $252 million. With 1 CH-47D lost to an accident, the remaining five were sold in 2011 after the end of Canada&#x27;s Afghanistan mission and replaced with seven CH-147Fs.

The U.S. Army is surplusing many of its CH-47Ds for use in FAA restricted category.

===MH-47D===
The MH-47D was developed for special forces operations and has inflight refueling capability, a fast rope-rappelling system, and other upgrades. The MH-47D was used by U.S. Army 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. Twelve MH-47D helicopters were produced. Six were converted from CH-47As and six were converted from CH-47C models.

===MH-47E===
The MH-47E has been used by U.S. Army Special Operations. Beginning with the E-model prototype manufactured in 1991, a total of 26 Special Operations Aircraft were produced. All aircraft were assigned to 2–160th SOAR(A) &quot;Nightstalkers&quot;, home based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. E models were converted from CH-47C airframes. The MH-47E has similar capabilities as the MH-47D, but with increased fuel capacity similar to the CH-47SD and terrain following/terrain avoidance radar.

In 1995, the Royal Air Force ordered eight Chinook HC3s, effectively a lower cost MH-47E for special operations. They were delivered in 2001, but never became operational due to technical issues with their avionics fit, unique to the HC3. In 2008, work started to revert the HC3s to HC2 standard, to enable them to enter service. they were upgraded to HC5 standard with a digital automated flight control system.

===CH-47F===
In 2001, the CH-47F, an upgraded CH-47D, made its maiden flight. The first production model rolled out at Boeing&#x27;s facility in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, and first flew on 23 October 2006. Upgrades included Honeywell engines and airframe with better integrated construction for lower maintenance requirements. The milled construction reduces vibration, as well as inspection and repair needs, and eliminates flexing points to increase service life. The CH-47F can fly at speeds of over with a payload of more than . New avionics include a Rockwell Collins Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) cockpit, and BAE Systems&#x27; Digital Advanced Flight Control System (DAFCS). AgustaWestland assembles the CH-47F under license, known as the Chinook ICH-47F, for several customers. Boeing delivered 48 CH-47Fs to the U.S. Army through August 2008; at that time Boeing announced a $4.8 billion (~$ in ) contract with the Army for 191 Chinooks.
A CH-47F Block 2 is being implemented . The Block 2 aims for a payload of with and high and hot hover performance, eventually increased up to , to carry the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle; maximum takeoff weight would be raised to . It has 20% more powerful Honeywell T55-715 engines along with an active parallel actuator system (APAS) to enhance the digital advanced flight-control system, providing an exact torque split between the rotors for greater efficiency. A new fuel system combines the three fuel cells in each sponson into one larger fuel cell and eliminates intracell fuel transfer hardware, reducing weight by and increasing fuel capacity. Electrical capacity is increased by three 60 kVA generators. The Advanced Chinook Rotor Blades (ACRB), derived from the cancelled RAH-66 Comanche, were intended to improve lift performance in hot/high altitude conditions by 900 kg (2,000 lb); however, the US Army ultimately decided against implementing the ACRB due to persistent vibration during testing, Boeing denied the assertion that the vibration was a safety risk and believed it could be solved with dampeners. In addition, the aft rotor blade was stalling when in a swept back position.

The U.S. Army plans for a Block 3 upgrade after 2025, which could include a new class engine with boosted power capacity of the transmission and drive train developed under the future affordable turbine engine (FATE) program and a lengthened fuselage. The Future Vertical Lift program plans to begin replacing the Army&#x27;s rotorcraft fleet in the mid-2030s, initially focusing on medium-lift helicopters, thus the CH-47 is planned to be in service beyond 2060, over 100 years after the first entered service.

=== MH-47G ===
The MH-47G Special Operations Aviation (SOA) version is similar to the MH-47E, but features more sophisticated avionics including a digital Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS). The CAAS is a common glass cockpit used by helicopters such as MH-60K/Ls, CH-53E/Ks, and ARH-70As. The MH-47G also incorporates all of the new sections of the CH-47F.
The modernization program improves MH-47D and MH-47E Special Operations Chinooks to the MH-47G design specs. A total of 25 MH-47E and 11 MH-47D aircraft were upgraded by the end of 2003. The final MH-47G was delivered to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) on 10 February 2011. Modernization of MH-47D/Es to the MH-47G standard is due by 2015. On 1 September 2020, Boeing announced the delivery of the first MH-47G Block II to USASOC of an initial order of 24, with a stated ultimate requirement for 69. The MH-47G Block II includes all of the improvements from the CH-47F Block II, as well as inflight refueling capability, a comprehensive defensive aids suite and low-level/adverse weather piloting aids, such as forward-looking infrared and multi-mode/terrain-following radar. It is armed with two 7.62 mm M134 Miniguns and two M240 7.62 mm machine guns.

The British MOD confirmed that while the U.S. does not export the model, the two countries were in discussion regarding the MH-47G . On 19 October 2018, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of a possible sale of 16 H-47 Chinooks (Extended Range) to the UK.

===CH-47J===
The CH-47J is a medium-transport helicopter for the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). The differences between the CH-47J and the CH-47D are the engine, rotor brake and avionics, for use for general transportation, SAR and disaster activity like U.S. forces. The CH-47JA, introduced in 1993, is a long-range version of the CH-47J, fitted with an enlarged fuel tank, an AAQ-16 FLIR in a turret under the nose, and a partial glass cockpit. Both versions are built under license in Japan by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, who produced 61 aircraft by April 2001.

The Japan Defense Agency ordered 54 aircraft of which 39 were for the JGSDF and 15 were for the JASDF. Boeing supplied flyable aircraft, to which Kawasaki added full avionics, interior, and final paint. The CH-47J model Chinook (N7425H) made its first flight in January 1986, and it was sent to Kawasaki in April. Boeing began delivering five CH-47J kits in September 1985 for assembly at Kawasaki.
Over 110 had been produced by the early 21st century, including the CH-47JA model with improved fuel tanks and other upgrades.

===HH-47===
On 9 November 2006, the HH-47, a new variant of the Chinook based on the MH-47G, was selected by the U.S. Air Force as the winner of the Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR-X) competition. Four development HH-47s were to be built, with the first of 141 production aircraft planned to enter service in 2012. However, in February 2007 the contract award was protested and the GAO ordered the CSAR-X project to be re-bid. The CSAR-X program was again terminated in 2009. In February 2010, the USAF announced plans to replace aging HH-60G helicopters, and deferred secondary combat search and rescue requirements calling for a larger helicopter. In a long process the Air Force did not choose the larger Chinook, and the HH-60W entered service by 2020 to replace the older helicopters.

=== Sea Chinook ===
For years the U.S. Navy has been operating different versions of the single-rotor CH-53 helicopter as its heavy-lift helicopter. CH-47s regularly conduct ship-based operations for U.S. Special Forces and other international operators. Due to budget issues, technical problems and delays with CH-53K, the director of the Pentagon&#x27;s cost assessment office directed US Navy to consider maritime versions of CH-47. Naval versions must be protected against the corrosive seaborne environment and be able to operate from aircraft carriers and amphibious ships.

===Other export models===

* The Royal Air Force version of the CH-47C is designated Chinook HC1; its versions of the CH-47D are designated Chinook HC2 and HC2A. Additional types in RAF service include HC3,4,5,6, and 6A. (for further reading see Boeing Chinook (UK variants))
* The export version of the CH-47C Chinook for the Italian Army was designated &quot;CH-47C Plus&quot;.
* The HH-47D is a search and rescue version for the Republic of Korea Air Force. 
* The CH-47DG is an upgraded version of the CH-47C for Greece. 
* While the CH-47SD (also known as the &quot;Super D&quot;) is a modified variant for Singapore of the CH-47D, with extended range fuel tanks and higher payload carrying capacity; the CH-47SD is in use by the Republic of Singapore Air Force, Hellenic Army and the Republic of China Army.

===Civilian models===

===Derivatives===

In 1969, work on the experimental BV-347 was begun. It was a CH-47A with a lengthened fuselage, four-blade rotors, detachable wings mounted on top of the fuselage and other changes. It first flew on 27 May 1970 and was evaluated for a few years.

In 1973, the Army contracted with Boeing to design a &quot;Heavy Lift Helicopter&quot; (HLH), designated XCH-62A. It appeared to be a scaled-up CH-47 without a conventional body, in a configuration similar to the S-64 Skycrane (CH-54 Tarhe), but the project was canceled in 1975. The program was restarted for test flights in the 1980s and was again not funded by Congress. The scaled-up model of the HLH was scrapped in late 2005 at Fort Rucker, Alabama.

== Accidents ==
*On 4 May 1966, a CH-47A crashed near Di Linh, Lâm Đồng Province killing all 20 on board.
* On 26 December 1967, a CH-47A carrying 33 military passengers and crew crashed in a landing descent at Phu Cat AFB, Binh Dinh Province, South Vietnam killing 8 of those on board.
* On 6 May 1969 a CH-47 carrying 83 people crashed southwest of Phước Vĩnh Base Camp, South Vietnam, killing 40 of those on board.
* On 18 August 1971, CH-47A airframe was operated by the 4th Aviation Company, 15th Aviation Group. The helicopter was transporting 33 soldiers of the Heavy Mortar Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment, 56th Field Artillery Brigade from battalion headquarters in Ludwigsburg to Grafenwöhr Training Area for live fire training exercises. Fatigue failure of the rear rotor blade led to its separation causing structural damage resulting in the crash and explosion that killed all 37 on board, including four crew members. A memorial plaque that was placed near the crash site in the forest outside Pegnitz was stolen in 2009.
* On 28 November 1971, a CH-47C carrying five crew and 28 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division on a flight from Da Nang to Phu Bai Combat Base, South Vietnam crashed into high ground killing all on board.
* On 18 October 1974, a CH-47C, US serial 74-22058 assigned 147001 but was never marked with Canadian Forces. The aircraft was lost on its delivery flight to Canada following gear failure in main combining gear box, caused by undetected metal infraction in gear blank before machining. This failure led to drive shaft failure and loss of synchronization and resulted in five fatalities. After a lengthy litigation, it was replaced by 147009.
* On 11 September 1982 at an airshow in Mannheim, Germany, a U.S. Army Chinook (serial number 74-22292) carrying parachutists crashed, killing 46 people.

<doc id="38007" wikidata="Q14267" url="?curid=38007" title="Julian day">
<text>The Julian day is a continuous count of days from the beginning of the Julian period; it is used primarily by astronomers, and in software for easily calculating elapsed days between two events (e.g. food production date and sell by date).

The Julian period is a chronological interval of 7980 years, derived from three multi-year cycles: the Indiction, Solar, and Lunar cycles. The last year that was simultaneously the beginning of all three cycles was , so that is year 1 of the current Julian period, making AD 2025 year 6738 of that Period. The next Julian Period begins in the year AD 3268. Historians used the period to identify Julian calendar years within which an event occurred when no such year was given in the historical record, or when the year given by previous historians was incorrect.

The Julian day number (JDN) shares the epoch of the Julian period, but counts days instead of years. Specifically, Julian day number 0 is assigned to the day starting at noon Universal Time on Monday, January 1, 4713 BC, proleptic Julian calendar (November 24, 4714 BC, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar). For example, the Julian day number for the day starting at 12:00 UT (noon) on January 1, 2000, was .

The Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number plus the fraction of a day since the preceding noon in Universal Time. Julian dates are expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction added. For example, the Julian Date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1, 2013, is . This article was loaded at (UTC) – expressed as a Julian date this is .

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;Julian date&quot; may also refer, outside of astronomy, to the day-of-year number (more properly, the ordinal date) in the Gregorian calendar, especially in computer programming, the military and the food industry, or it may refer to dates in the Julian calendar. For example, if a given &quot;Julian date&quot; is &quot;October 5, 1582&quot;, this means that date in the Julian calendar (which was October 15, 1582, in the Gregorian calendarthe date it was first established). Without an astronomical or historical context, a &quot;Julian date&quot; given as &quot;36&quot; most likely means the 36th day of a given Gregorian year, namely February 5. Other possible meanings of a &quot;Julian date&quot; of &quot;36&quot; include an astronomical Julian Day Number, or the year AD 36 in the Julian calendar, or a duration of 36 astronomical Julian years). This is why the terms &quot;ordinal date&quot; or &quot;day-of-year&quot; are preferred. In contexts where a &quot;Julian date&quot; means simply an ordinal date, calendars of a Gregorian year with formatting for ordinal dates are often called &quot;Julian calendars&quot;, but this could also mean that the calendars are of years in the Julian calendar system.

Historically, Julian dates were recorded relative to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) (later, Ephemeris Time), but since 1997 the International Astronomical Union has recommended that Julian dates be specified in Terrestrial Time. Seidelmann indicates that Julian dates may be used with International Atomic Time (TAI), Terrestrial Time (TT), Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB), or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and that the scale should be indicated when the difference is significant. The fraction of the day is found by converting the number of hours, minutes, and seconds after noon into the equivalent decimal fraction. Time intervals calculated from differences of Julian Dates specified in non-uniform time scales, such as UTC, may need to be corrected for changes in time scales (e.g. leap seconds).

Because the starting point or reference epoch is so long ago, numbers in the Julian day can be quite large and cumbersome. A more recent starting point is sometimes used, for instance by dropping the leading digits, in order to fit into limited computer memory with an adequate amount of precision. In the following table, times are given in 24-hour notation.

In the table below, &quot;Epoch&quot; refers to the point in time used to set the origin (usually zero, but (1) where explicitly indicated) of the alternative convention being discussed in that row. The date given is a Gregorian calendar date unless otherwise specified. JD stands for Julian Date. 0h is 00:00 midnight, 12h is 12:00 noon, UT unless otherwise specified. &quot;Current value is at and may be cached. &quot;

* The Modified Julian Date (MJD) was introduced by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in 1957 to record the orbit of Sputnik via an IBM 704 (36-bit machine) and using only 18 bits until August 7, 2576. MJD is the epoch of VAX/VMS and its successor OpenVMS, using 63-bit date/time, which allows times to be stored up to July 31, 31086, 02:48:05.47. The MJD has a starting point of midnight on November 17, 1858, and is computed by MJD = JD − 2400000.5 
* The Truncated Julian Day (TJD) was introduced by NASA/Goddard in 1979 as part of a parallel grouped binary time code (PB-5) &quot;designed specifically, although not exclusively, for spacecraft applications&quot;. TJD was a 4-digit day count from MJD 40000, which was May 24, 1968, represented as a 14-bit binary number. Since this code was limited to four digits, TJD recycled to zero on MJD 50000, or October 10, 1995, &quot;which gives a long ambiguity period of 27.4 years&quot;. (NASA codes PB-1–PB-4 used a 3-digit day-of-year count.) Only whole days are represented. Time of day is expressed by a count of seconds of a day, plus optional milliseconds, microseconds and nanoseconds in separate fields. Later PB-5J was introduced which increased the TJD field to 16 bits, allowing values up to 65535, which will occur in the year 2147. There are five digits recorded after TJD 9999.
* The Dublin Julian Date (DJD) is the number of days that has elapsed since the epoch of the solar and lunar ephemerides used from 1900 through 1983, Newcomb&#x27;s Tables of the Sun and Ernest W. Brown&#x27;s &quot;Tables of the Motion of the Moon&quot; (1919). This epoch was noon UT on :January 0, 1900, which is the same as noon UT on December 31, 1899. The DJD was defined by the International Astronomical Union at their meeting in Dublin, Ireland, in 1955.
* The Lilian day number is a count of days of the Gregorian calendar and not defined relative to the Julian Date. It is an integer applied to a whole day; day 1 was October 15, 1582, which was the day the Gregorian calendar went into effect. The original paper defining it makes no mention of the time zone, and no mention of time-of-day. It was named for Aloysius Lilius, the principal author of the Gregorian calendar.
* Rata Die is a system used in Rexx, Go and Python. Some implementations or options use Universal Time, others use local time. Day 1 is January 1, 1, that is, the first day of the Christian or Common Era in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. In Rexx, January 1 is Day 0.

* The Heliocentric Julian Day (HJD) is the same as the Julian day, but adjusted to the frame of reference of the Sun, and thus can differ from the Julian day by as much as 8.3 minutes (498 seconds), that being the time it takes light to reach Earth from the Sun.

== History ==
===Julian Period ===
The &quot;Julian day number&quot; is based on the &quot;Julian Period&quot; proposed by Joseph Scaliger, a classical scholar, in 1583 (one year after the Gregorian calendar reform) as it is the product of three calendar cycles used with the Julian calendar:

Its epoch occurs when all three cycles (if they are continued backward far enough) were in their first year together. Years of the Julian Period are counted from this year, , as , which was chosen to be before any historical record.

Scaliger corrected chronology by assigning each year a tricyclic &quot;character&quot;, three numbers indicating that year&#x27;s position in the 28-year solar cycle, the 19-year lunar cycle, and the 15-year indiction cycle. One or more of these numbers often appeared in the historical record alongside other pertinent facts without any mention of the Julian calendar year. The character of every year in the historical record was unique – it could only belong to one year in the 7980-year Julian Period. Scaliger determined that 1 BC or year 0 was Julian Period . He knew that 1 BC or year 0 had the character 9 of the solar cycle, 1 of the lunar cycle, and 3 of the indiction cycle. By inspecting a 532-year Paschal cycle with 19 solar cycles (each of 28 years, each year numbered 1–28) and 28 lunar cycles (each of 19 years, each year numbered 1–19), he determined that the first two numbers, 9 and 1, occurred at its year 457. He then calculated via remainder division that he needed to add eight 532-year Paschal cycles totaling 4256 years before the cycle containing 1 BC or year 0 in order for its year 457 to be indiction 3. The sum was thus JP 4713.

A formula for determining the year of the Julian Period given its character involving three four-digit numbers was published by Jacques de Billy in 1665 in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; (its first year). John F. W. Herschel gave the same formula using slightly different wording in his 1849 &quot;Outlines of Astronomy&quot;.

Carl Friedrich Gauss introduced the modulo operation in 1801, restating de Billy&#x27;s formula as: 

where &quot;a&quot; is the year of the indiction cycle, &quot;b&quot; of the lunar cycle, and &quot;c&quot; of the solar cycle.

John Collins described the details of how these three numbers were calculated in 1666, using many trials. A summary of Collin&#x27;s description is in a footnote.
Reese, Everett and Craun reduced the dividends in the &quot;Try&quot; column from 285, 420, 532 to 5, 2, 7 and changed remainder to modulo, but apparently still required many trials.

The specific cycles used by Scaliger to form his tricyclic Julian Period were, first, the indiction cycle with a first year of 313. Then he chose the dominant 19-year Alexandrian lunar cycle with a first year of 285, the Era of Martyrs and the Diocletian Era epoch, or a first year of 532 according to Dionysius Exiguus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dionysius Exiguus 2003/525&quot;&gt;Dionysius Exiguus 2003/525&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Scaliger chose the post-Bedan solar cycle with a first year of 776, when its first quadrennium of concurrents, , began in sequence. Although not their intended use, the equations of de Billy or Gauss can be used to determined the first year of any 15-, 19-, and 28-year tricyclic period given any first years of their cycles. For those of the Julian Period, the result is AD 3268, because both remainder and modulo usually return the lowest positive result. Thus 7980 years must be subtracted from it to yield the first year of the present Julian Period, −4712 or 4713 BC, when all three of its sub-cycles are in their first years.

Scaliger got the idea of using a tricyclic period from &quot;the Greeks of Constantinople&quot; as Herschel stated in his quotation below in Julian day numbers. Specifically, the monk and priest Georgios wrote in 638/39 that the Byzantine year 6149 AM (640/41) had indiction 14, lunar cycle 12, and solar cycle 17, which places the first year of the Byzantine Era in 5509/08 BC, the Byzantine Creation. Dionysius Exiguus called the Byzantine lunar cycle his &quot;lunar cycle&quot; in argumentum 6, in contrast with the Alexandrian lunar cycle which he called his &quot;nineteen-year cycle&quot; in argumentum 5.

Although many references say that the &quot;Julian&quot; in &quot;Julian Period&quot; refers to Scaliger&#x27;s father, Julius Scaliger, at the beginning of Book V of his &quot;&quot; (&quot;Work on the Emendation of Time&quot;) he states, &quot;&quot;, which Reese, Everett and Craun translate as &quot;We have termed it Julian because it fits the Julian year&quot;. Thus &quot;Julian&quot; refers to the Julian calendar.

===Julian day numbers===
Julian days were first used by Ludwig Ideler for the first days of the Nabonassar and Christian eras in his 1825 &quot;Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie&quot;. John F. W. Herschel then developed them for astronomical use in his 1849 &quot;Outlines of Astronomy&quot;, after acknowledging that Ideler was his guide.

At least one mathematical astronomer adopted Herschel&#x27;s &quot;days of the Julian period&quot; immediately. Benjamin Peirce of Harvard University used over 2,800 Julian days in his &quot;Tables of the Moon&quot;, begun in 1849 but not published until 1853, to calculate the lunar ephemerides in the new &quot;American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac&quot; from 1855 to 1888. The days are specified for &quot;Washington mean noon&quot;, with Greenwich defined as west of Washington (282°57′W, or Washington 77°3′W of Greenwich). A table with 197 Julian days (&quot;Date in Mean Solar Days&quot;, one per century mostly) was included for the years –4713 to 2000 with no year 0, thus &quot;–&quot; means BC, including decimal fractions for hours, minutes, and seconds. The same table appears in &quot;Tables of Mercury&quot; by Joseph Winlock, without any other Julian days.

The national ephemerides started to include a multi-year table of Julian days, under various names, for either every year or every leap year beginning with the French &quot;Connaissance des Temps&quot; in 1870 for 2,620 years, increasing in 1899 to 3,000 years. The British &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; began in 1879 with 2,000 years. The &quot;Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch&quot; began in 1899 with 2,000 years. The &quot;American Ephemeris&quot; was the last to add a multi-year table, in 1925 with 2,000 years. However, it was the first to include any mention of Julian days with one for the year of issue beginning in 1855, as well as later scattered sections with many days in the year of issue. It was also the first to use the name &quot;Julian day number&quot; in 1918. The &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; began in 1866 to include a Julian day for every day in the year of issue. The &quot;Connaissance des Temps&quot; began in 1871 to include a Julian day for every day in the year of issue.

The French mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace first expressed the time of day as a decimal fraction added to calendar dates in his book, , in 1823. Other astronomers added fractions of the day to the Julian day number to create Julian Dates, which are typically used by astronomers to date astronomical observations, thus eliminating the complications resulting from using standard calendar periods like eras, years, or months. They were first introduced into variable star work in 1860 by the English astronomer Norman Pogson, which he stated was at the suggestion of John Herschel. They were popularized for variable stars by Edward Charles Pickering, of the Harvard College Observatory, in 1890.

Julian days begin at noon because when Herschel recommended them, the astronomical day began at noon. The astronomical day had begun at noon ever since Ptolemy chose to begin the days for his astronomical observations at noon. He chose noon because the transit of the Sun across the observer&#x27;s meridian occurs at the same apparent time every day of the year, unlike sunrise or sunset, which vary by several hours. Midnight was not even considered because it could not be accurately determined using water clocks. Nevertheless, he double-dated most nighttime observations with both Egyptian days beginning at sunrise and Babylonian days beginning at sunset. Medieval Muslim astronomers used days beginning at sunset, so astronomical days beginning at noon did produce a single date for an entire night. Later medieval European astronomers used Roman days beginning at midnight so astronomical days beginning at noon also allow observations during an entire night to use a single date. When all astronomers decided to start their astronomical days at midnight to conform to the beginning of the civil day, on , it was decided to keep Julian days continuous with previous practice, beginning at noon.

During this period, usage of Julian day numbers as a neutral intermediary when converting a date in one calendar into a date in another calendar also occurred. An isolated use was by Ebenezer Burgess in his 1860 translation of the &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; wherein he stated that the beginning of the Kali Yuga era occurred at midnight at the meridian of Ujjain at the end of the 588,465th day and the beginning of the 588,466th day (civil reckoning) of the Julian Period, or between JP 1612 or 3102 BC. Robert Schram was notable beginning with his 1882 &quot;Hilfstafeln für Chronologie&quot;. Here he used about 5,370 &quot;days of the Julian Period&quot;. He greatly expanded his usage of Julian days in his 1908 &quot;Kalendariographische und Chronologische Tafeln&quot; containing over 530,000 Julian days, one for the zeroth day of every month over thousands of years in many calendars. He included over 25,000 negative Julian days, given in a positive form by adding 10,000,000 to each. He called them &quot;day of the Julian Period&quot;, &quot;Julian day&quot;, or simply &quot;day&quot; in his discussion, but no name was used in the tables. Continuing this tradition, in his book &quot;Mapping Time: The Calendar and Its History&quot; British physics educator and programmer Edward Graham Richards uses Julian day numbers to convert dates from one calendar into another using algorithms rather than tables.

== Julian day number calculation ==
The Julian day number can be calculated using the following formulas (integer division rounding towards zero is used exclusively, that is, positive values are rounded down and negative values are rounded up):

The months January to December are numbered 1 to 12. For the year, astronomical year numbering is used, thus 1 BC is 0, 2 BC is −1, and 4713 BC is −4712. &quot;JDN&quot; is the Julian Day Number. Use the previous day of the month if trying to find the JDN of an instant before midday UT.

===Converting Gregorian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm is valid for all (possibly proleptic) Gregorian calendar dates after November 23, −4713. Divisions are integer divisions towards zero; fractional parts are ignored.

{100}}{4} + \text{D} - 32075&lt;/math&gt;}}

===Converting Julian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm is valid for all (possibly proleptic) Julian calendar years ≥ −4712, that is, for all JDN ≥ 0. Divisions are integer divisions, fractional parts are ignored.

=== Finding Julian date given Julian day number and time of day ===
For the full Julian Date of a moment after 12:00 UT one can use the following. Divisions are real numbers.

{1440} + \frac{\text{second}}{86400}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;}}

So, for example, January 1, 2000, at 18:00:00 UT corresponds to &quot;JD&quot; = 2451545.25 and January 1, 2000, at 6:00:00 UT corresponds to &quot;JD&quot; = 2451544.75.

=== Finding day of week given Julian day number ===
Because a Julian day starts at noon while a civil day starts at midnight, the Julian day number needs to be adjusted to find the day of week: for a point in time in a given Julian day after midnight UT and before 12:00 UT, add 1 or use the JDN of the next afternoon.

The US day of the week W1 (for an afternoon or evening UT) can be determined from the Julian Day Number J with the expression:


If the moment in time is after midnight UT (and before 12:00 UT), then one is already in the next day of the week.

The ISO day of the week W0 can be determined from the Julian Day Number J with the expression:


=== Julian or Gregorian calendar from Julian day number ===
This is an algorithm by Edward Graham Richards to convert a Julian Day Number, J, to a date in the Gregorian calendar (proleptic, when applicable). Richards states the algorithm is valid for Julian day numbers greater than or equal to 0. All variables are integer values, and the notation &quot;&quot;a&quot; div &quot;b&quot;&quot; indicates integer division, and &quot;mod(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;)&quot; denotes the modulus operator.

For Julian calendar:
# &quot;f &quot;= J + &quot;j&quot;
For Gregorian calendar:
# &quot;f &quot;= J + &quot;j&quot; + (((4 × J + &quot;B&quot;) div 146097) × 3) div 4 + &quot;C&quot;
For Julian or Gregorian, continue:
D, M, and Y are the numbers of the day, month, and year respectively for the afternoon at the beginning of the given Julian day.

=== Julian Period from indiction, Metonic and solar cycles ===

Let Y be the year BC or AD and i, m, and s respectively its positions in the indiction, Metonic and solar cycles. Divide 6916i + 4200m + 4845s by 7980 and call the remainder r.

Example

i = 8, m = 2, s = 8. What is the year?

==Julian date calculation==
As stated above, the Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number for the preceding noon in Universal Time plus the fraction of the day since that instant. Ordinarily calculating the fractional portion of the JD is straightforward; the number of seconds that have elapsed in the day divided by the number of seconds in a day, 86,400. But if the UTC timescale is being used, a day containing a positive leap second contains 86,401 seconds (or in the unlikely event of a negative leap second, 86,399 seconds). One authoritative source, the Standards of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA), deals with this issue by treating days containing a leap second as having a different length (86,401 or 86,399 seconds, as required). SOFA refers to the result of such a calculation as &quot;quasi-JD&quot;.

<doc id="38008" wikidata="Q154106" url="?curid=38008" title="Bell UH-1 Iroquois">
<text>The Bell UH-1 Iroquois (nicknamed &quot;Huey&quot;) is a utility military helicopter designed and produced by the American aerospace company Bell Helicopter. It is the first member of the prolific Huey family, as well as the first turbine-powered helicopter in service with the United States military.

Development of the Iroquois started in the early 1950s, a major impetus being a requirement issued by the United States Army for a new medical evacuation and utility helicopter. The Bell 204, first flown on 20 October 1956, was warmly received, particularly for the performance of its single turboshaft engine over piston engine-powered counterparts. An initial production contract for 100 &quot;HU-1A&quot;s was issued in March 1960. In response to criticisms over the rotorcraft&#x27;s power, Bell quickly developed multiple models furnished with more powerful engines; in comparison to the prototype&#x27;s Lycoming YT53-L-1 (LTC1B-1) engine, producing 700 shp (520 kW), by 1966, the Lycoming T53-L-13, capable of , was being installed on some models. A stretched version of the Iroquois, first flown during August 1961, was also produced in response to Army demands for a version that could accommodate more troops. Further modifications would include the use of all-aluminum construction, the adoption of a rotor brake, and alternative powerplants.

The Iroquois was first used in combat operations during the Vietnam War, the first examples being deployed in March 1962. It was used for various purposes, including conducting general support, air assault, cargo transport, aeromedical evacuation, search and rescue, electronic warfare, and ground attack missions. Armed Iroquois gunships carried a variety of weapons, including rockets, grenade launchers, and machine guns, and were often modified in the field to suit specific operations. The United States Air Force deployed its Iroquois to Vietnam, using them to conduct reconnaissance operations, psychological warfare, and other support roles. Other nations&#x27; armed air services, such as the Royal Australian Air Force, also dispatched their own Iroquois to Vietnam. In total, around 7,000 Iroquois were deployed in the Vietnam theatre, over 3,300 of which were believed to be destroyed. Various other conflicts have seen combat deployments of the Iroquois, such as the Rhodesian Bush War, Falklands War, War in Afghanistan, and the 2007 Lebanon conflict.

The Iroquois was originally designated HU-1, hence the &quot;Huey&quot; nickname, which has remained in common use, despite the official redesignation to UH-1 in 1962. Various derivatives and developments of the Iroquois were produced. A dedicated attack helicopter, the Bell AH-1 Cobra, was derived from the UH-1, and retained a high degree of commonality. The Bell 204 and 205 are Iroquois versions developed for the civilian market. In response to demands from some customers, a twin-engined model, the UH-1N Twin Huey, was also developed during the late 1960s; a further updated four rotor model, the Bell 412, entered service in Canada but not the US. A further updated UH-1 with twin engines and four-bladed derivative, the Bell UH-1Y Venom, was also developed during the early twenty-first century for the USMC. In US Army service, the Iroquois was gradually phased out following the introduction of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and the Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota in the early 21st century. However, hundreds were still in use more than 50 years following the type&#x27;s introduction. In excess of 16,000 Iroquois have been built since 1960. With new orders from Japan and the Czech Republic, the UH-1 remains in production. Several export customers, such as Canada, Germany, Taiwan, Japan, and Italy, opted to produce the type under license. Operators have been located across the world, including the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific region.

==Development==

In 1952, the U.S. Army identified a requirement for a new helicopter to serve as medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), instrument trainer, and general utility aircraft. The Army determined that current helicopters were too large, underpowered, or too complex to maintain easily. During November 1953, revised military requirements were submitted to the Department of the Army. Twenty companies submitted designs in their bid for the contract, including Bell Helicopter with the &quot;Model 204&quot; and Kaman Aircraft with a turbine-powered version of the H-43. On 23 February 1955, the Army announced its decision, selecting Bell to build three copies of the Model 204 for evaluation with the designation &quot;XH-40&quot;.

===Model 204===
Powered by a prototype Lycoming YT53-L-1 (LTC1B-1) engine producing 700 shp (520 kW), the XH-40 first flew on 20 October 1956, at Fort Worth, Texas, with Bell&#x27;s chief test pilot, Floyd Carlson, at the controls. Even prior to the first flight, the Army had placed an order for six &quot;YH-40&quot; service test helicopters. During 1957, a further two prototypes were completed. In 1959, the Army awarded Bell a production contract for 182 aircraft, which was designated &quot;HU-1A&quot; and officially named &quot;Iroquois&quot; after the Native American nations.

The helicopter quickly developed a nickname derived from its HU-1 designation, which came to be pronounced as &quot;Huey&quot;. The reference became so popular that Bell began casting the name on the helicopter&#x27;s anti-torque pedals. The official U.S. Army name was almost never used in practice. Even after September 1962, at which point the designation for all models was changed to UH-1 under a unified Department of Defense (DOD) designation system, yet the nickname persisted.

While glowing in praise for the helicopter&#x27;s advances over piston-engined helicopters, the Army reports from the service tests of the YH-40 found it to be underpowered with the production T53-L-1A powerplant producing a maximum continuous 770 shaft horsepower (570 kilowatts). The Army indicated the need for improved follow-on models even as the first UH-1As were being delivered. In response, Bell proposed the UH-1B, equipped with the Lycoming T53-L-5 engine producing 960 shp (720 kW) and a longer cabin that could accommodate either seven passengers or four stretchers and a medical attendant. Army testing of the UH-1B started in November 1960, with the first production aircraft delivered in March 1961.

Bell commenced development of the UH-1C in 1960 in order to correct aerodynamic deficiencies of the armed UH-1B. Bell fitted the UH-1C with a 1,100 shp (820 kW) T53-L-11 engine to provide the power needed to lift all weapons systems in use or under development. The Army eventually refitted all UH-1B aircraft with the same engine. A new rotor system was developed for the UH-1C to allow higher air speeds and reduce the incidence of retreating blade stall during diving engagements. The improved rotor resulted in better maneuverability and a slight speed increase. The increased power and a larger diameter rotor required Bell&#x27;s engineers to design a new tail boom for the UH-1C. The longer tail boom incorporated a wider chord vertical fin on the tail rotor pylon and larger synchronized elevators.

Bell also introduced a dual hydraulic control system for redundancy as well as an improved inlet filter system for the dusty conditions found in southeast Asia. The UH-1C fuel capacity was increased to 242 US gallons (920 liters), and gross weight was raised to , giving a nominal useful load of . UH-1C production started in June 1966 with a total of 766 aircraft produced, including five for the Royal Australian Navy and five for Norway.

===Model 205===

While earlier short-body Hueys were a success, the Army wanted a version that could carry more troops. Bell&#x27;s solution was to stretch the HU-1B fuselage by and use the extra space to fit four seats next to the transmission, facing out. Seating capacity increased to 15, including crew. The enlarged cabin could also accommodate six stretchers and a medic, two more than the earlier models. In place of the earlier model&#x27;s sliding side doors with a single window, larger doors were fitted which had two windows, plus a small hinged panel with an optional window, providing enhanced access to the cabin. The doors and hinged panels were quickly removable, allowing the Huey to be flown in a doors off configuration.

The Model 205 prototype flew on 16 August 1961. Seven pre-production/prototype aircraft had been delivered for testing at Edwards AFB starting in March 1961. The 205 was initially equipped with a main rotor and a Lycoming T53-L-9 engine with 1,100 shp (820 kW). The rotor was lengthened to with a chord of . The tailboom was also lengthened, in order to accommodate the longer rotor blades. Altogether, the modifications resulted in a gross weight capacity of . The Army ordered production of the 205 in 1963, produced with a T53-L-11 engine for its multi-fuel capability. The prototypes were designated as YUH-1D and the production aircraft was designated as the &quot;UH-1D&quot;.

During 1966, Bell installed the Lycoming T53-L-13 engine to provide more power for the helicopter. The pitot tube was relocated from the nose to the roof of the cockpit to prevent damage during landing. Production models in this configuration were designated as the &quot;UH-1H&quot;.

===Marine Corps===

In 1962, the United States Marine Corps held a competition to choose an assault support helicopter to replace the Cessna O-1 fixed-wing aircraft and the Kaman OH-43D helicopter. The winner was the UH-1B, which was already in service with the Army. The helicopter was designated the &quot;UH-1E&quot; and modified to meet Marine requirements. The major changes included the use of all-aluminum construction for corrosion resistance, radios compatible with Marine Corps ground frequencies, a rotor brake for shipboard use to stop the rotor quickly on shutdown and a roof-mounted rescue hoist.

The UH-1E was first flown on 7 October 1963, and deliveries commenced on 21 February 1964; a total of 192 Iroquois of this model were completed. Due to production line realities at Bell, the UH-1E was produced in two versions, both with the same UH-1E designation. The first 34 built were essentially UH-1B airframes with the Lycoming T53-L-11 engine producing 1,100 shp (820 kW). When Bell switched production to the UH-1C, the UH-1E production benefited from the same changes. The Marine Corps later upgraded UH-1E engines to the Lycoming T53-L-13, which produced 1,400 shp (1,000 kW), after the Army introduced the UH-1M and upgraded their UH-1C helicopters to the same engine.

===Air Force===
The United States Air Force (USAF) held a competition for a helicopter to be used for support on missile bases included a specific requirement to mandate the use of the General Electric T58 turboshaft as a powerplant. The Air Force had a large inventory of these engines on hand for its fleet of HH-3 Jolly Green Giant rescue helicopters and using the same engine for both helicopters would save costs. In response, Bell proposed an upgraded version of the 204B with the T58 engine. Because the T58 output shaft is at the rear, and was thus mounted in front of the transmission on the HH-3, it had to have a separate offset gearbox (SDG or speed decreaser gearbox) at the rear, and shafting to couple to the UH-1 transmission.

===Twin-engine variants===

The single-engine UH-1 variants were followed by the twin-engine UH-1N Twin Huey (Bell 212) and years later the UH-1Y Venom. Bell began development of the UH-1N for Canada in 1968. It changed to the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6T twin-engine set. The US also ordered the helicopter with the USAF receiving it in 1970. Canada&#x27;s military, the U.S. Marine Corps, and the U.S. Navy first received the model in 1971.

In 1996, the USMC launched the H-1 upgrade program via the award of a contract to Bell Helicopter for development of the improved UH-1Y and AH-1Zs variants. The UH-1Y includes a lengthened cabin, four-blade rotor, and two more powerful GE T700 engines. The UH-1Y entered service with the USMC in 2008.

The Bell 412 is an improved 4-rotor version of the twin-engined Bell 212, and while not adopted by the US, was chosen by Canada (CH-146 Griffon), license produced in Italy as the Augusta-Bell AB412, and is going to be made for the Japan Self Defense Force in Japan by Subaru. It is a popular commercial and military helicopter, and it competed in the early 2000s Army Light Utility Helicopter program, but lost to what would be the UH-72 Lakota. That program replaced aging UH-1 and OH-58A/C models being used by the National Guard.

==Design==

The Bell UH-1 Iroquois is a utility helicopter designed for military use. It has a metal fuselage of semi-monocoque construction with tubular landing skids and two rotor blades on the main rotor. Early UH-1 models featured a single Lycoming T53 turboshaft engine in versions with power ratings from . Later UH-1 and related models often featured twin engines and four-blade rotors. All members of the UH-1 family have similar construction. The UH-1H is the most-produced version, and is representative of all types. The main structure consists of two longitudinal main beams that run under the passenger cabin to the nose and back to the tail boom attachment point. The main beams are separated by transverse bulkheads and provide the supporting structure for the cabin, landing gear, under-floor fuel tanks, transmission, engine and tail boom. The main beams are joined at the lift beam, a short aluminum girder structure that is attached to the transmission via a lift link on the top and the cargo hook on the bottom and is located at the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity. The lift beams were changed to steel later in the UH-1H&#x27;s life, due to cracking on high-time airframes. The semi-monocoque tail boom attaches to the fuselage with four bolts.

The UH-1H&#x27;s dynamic components include the engine, transmission, rotor mast, main rotor blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes of the tail rotor. The main rotor transmission consists of a 90 degree bevel gear assembly with a reduction ratio of 2.14:1, followed by a 2-stage planetary gearset with a ratio of 9.53:1 (two stages of 3.087:1 each). This is in addition to the output gearbox of the T53 engine with a reduction ratio of 3.19:1. This combined reduction results in 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a damped stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but at a cost of higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic &#x27;Huey thump&#x27; sound when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail rotor speed approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase tail rotor effectiveness.
The UH-1H also features a synchronized elevator on the tail boom, which is linked to the cyclic control and allows a wider center of gravity range. The standard fuel system consists of five interconnected fuel tanks, three of which are mounted behind the transmission and two of which are under the cabin floor. The landing gear consists of two arched cross tubes joining the skid tubes. The skids have replaceable sacrificial skid shoes to prevent wear of the skid tubes themselves. Skis and inflatable floats may be fitted. While the five main fuel tanks are self-sealing, the UH-1H was not equipped with factory armor, although armored pilot seats were available.

Internal seating is made up of two pilot seats and additional seating for up to 13 passengers or crew in the cabin. The maximum seating arrangement consists of a four-man bench seat facing rearwards behind the pilot seats, facing a five-man bench seat in front of the transmission structure, with two, two-man bench seats facing outwards from the transmission structure on either side of the aircraft. All passenger seats are constructed of aluminum tube frames with canvas material seats, and are quickly removable and reconfigurable. The cabin may also be configured with up to six stretchers, an internal rescue hoist, auxiliary fuel tanks, spotlights, or many other mission kits. Access to the cabin is via two aft-sliding doors and two small, forward-hinged panels. The doors and hinged panels may be removed for flight or the doors may be pinned open. Pilot access is via individual hinged doors.

The UH-1H&#x27;s dual controls are conventional for a helicopter and consist of a single hydraulic system boosting the cyclic stick, collective lever and anti-torque pedals. The collective levers have integral throttles, although these are not used to control rotor rpm, which is automatically governed, but are used for starting and shutting down the engine. The cyclic and collective control the main rotor pitch through push-pull tube linkages to the swashplate, while the anti-torque pedals change the pitch of the tail rotor via a tensioned cable arrangement. Some UH-1Hs have been modified to replace the tail rotor control cables with push-pull tubes similar to the UH-1N Twin Huey.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Army===
The HU-1A (later redesignated UH-1A) first entered service with the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, the 82nd Airborne Division, and the 57th Medical Detachment. Although intended for evaluation only, the Army quickly pressed the new helicopter into operational service, and Hueys with the 57th Medical Detachment arrived in Vietnam in March 1962. The UH-1 has long been a symbol of US involvement in Southeast Asia in general and Vietnam in particular, and as a result of that conflict, has become one of the world&#x27;s most recognized helicopters. In Vietnam primary missions included general support, air assault, cargo transport, aeromedical evacuation, search and rescue, electronic warfare, and later, ground attack. During the conflict, the craft was upgraded, notably to a larger version based on the Model 205. This version was initially designated the UH-1D and flew operationally from 1963.

During its Vietnam War service, the UH-1 was used for various purposes and various terms for each task abounded. UH-1s tasked with ground attack or armed escort were outfitted with rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and machine guns. As early as 1962, UH-1s were modified locally by the companies themselves, who fabricated their own mounting systems. These gunship UH-1s were commonly referred to as &quot;Frogs&quot; or &quot;Hogs&quot; if they carried rockets, and &quot;Cobras&quot; or simply &quot;Guns&quot; if they had guns. UH-1s tasked and configured for troop transport were often called &quot;Slicks&quot; due to an absence of weapons pods. Slicks did have door gunners, but were generally employed in the troop transport and medevac roles.
UH-1s also flew hunter-killer teams with observation helicopters, namely the Bell OH-58A Kiowa and the Hughes OH-6 Cayuse (&quot;Loach&quot;). Towards the end of the conflict, the UH-1 was tested with TOW missiles, and two UH-1B helicopters equipped with the XM26 Armament Subsystem were deployed to help counter the 1972 Easter Invasion. USAF Lieutenant James P. Fleming piloted a UH-1F on a 26 November 1968 mission that earned him the Medal of Honor.

During the course of the conflict, the UH-1 went through several upgrades. The UH-1A, B, and C models (short fuselage, Bell 204) and the UH-1D and H models (stretched-fuselage, Bell 205) each had improved performance and load-carrying capabilities. The UH-1B and C performed the gunship, and some of the transport, duties in the early years of the Vietnam War. UH-1B/C gunships were replaced by the new AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter from 1967 to late 1968. The increasing intensity and sophistication of NVA anti-aircraft defenses made continued use of UH-1 gunships impractical, and after Vietnam the Cobra was adopted as the Army&#x27;s main attack helicopter. Devotees of the UH-1 in the gunship role cite its ability to act as an impromptu Dustoff if the need arose, as well as the superior observational capabilities of the larger Huey cockpit, which allowed return fire from door gunners to the rear and sides of the aircraft. In air cavalry troops (i.e., companies) UH-1s were combined with infantry scouts, OH-6 and OH-58 aero-scout helicopters, and AH-1 attack helicopters to form several color-coded teams (viz., blue, white, red, purple, and pink) to perform various reconnaissance, security, and economy of force missions in fulfilling the traditional cavalry battlefield role.
The Army tested a great variety of experimental weapons on the UH-1; nearly anything that could be carried. The Army desired weapons with large calibers and high rates of fire, which led to the testing of a 20 mm cannon on a large mount bolted to the cabin floor. The size of the weapon allowed very little room for movement. The Army further tested a full-size Vulcan cannon firing out the door of a UH-1. It was capable of firing 2400 rounds per minute, or about 40 rounds per second. Despite this being a significant reduction from the nearly 100 rounds per second fired by a standard Vulcan cannon, the installation proved too kinetic for the UH-1. Podded versions of the M24 20 mm cannon were tested in combat over Vietnam. There was a wide variety of 7.62 mm automatic weapons tested, including different installations of the M60 machine gun. AS-10 and SS-11 missiles were tested in several different configurations. High-capacity rocket launchers were also tested, such as the XM3 launcher, which had 24 launching tubes. Press photos were taken with the XM5 and XM3 installed on the same aircraft, but this arrangement could not be used because it was more than the gross take-off weight of the aircraft.

During the Easter Offensive of 1972 by North Vietnam, experimental models of the TOW-firing XM26 were taken out of storage and sent to South Vietnam in response to the onslaught. The pilots had never fired a TOW missile before, and were given brief crash courses. Despite having little training with the units, the pilots managed to hit targets with 151 of the 162 missiles fired in combat, including a pair of tanks. The airborne TOW launchers were known as &quot;Hawks Claws&quot; and were based at Camp Holloway. During the conflict, 7,013 UH-1s served in Vietnam and of these 3,305 were destroyed. In total, 1,151 pilots were killed, along with 1,231 other crew members (these figures are not including Army of the Republic of Vietnam losses).

Post Vietnam, the US Army continued to operate large numbers of Iroquois; they would see further combat during the US invasion of Grenada in 1983, the US invasion of Panama in 1989, and the Gulf War in 1991. In the latter conflict, in excess of 400 Iroquois performed a variety of missions in the region; over a nine-month period, the fleet cumulatively reached 31,000 flight hours and achieved a stable fully mission capable rate of 70%. The type comprised more than 20% of all rotorcraft across the coalition and recorded 21% of the overall flying hours. Even after the Gulf War, the US Army had more than 2,800 Iroquois in its inventory; in particular, 389 UH-1Vs comprised 76% of the Army&#x27;s medevac aircraft. Nevertheless, plans were mooted as early as 1992 to undertake a slow withdrawal of the aging type in favor of larger and more technologically advanced rotorcraft.

The US Army began phasing out the UH-1 with the introduction of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk starting in the 1980s, although the Army UH-1 Residual Fleet had around 700 UH-1s that were to be retained until 2015, primarily in support of Army Aviation training at Fort Rucker and in selected Army National Guard units. Army support for the craft was intended to end in 2004; The UH-1 was retired from active Army service in early 2005. During 2009, Army National Guard retirements of the UH-1 accelerated with the introduction of the Eurocopter UH-72 Lakota. In 2009 the Army National Guard marked 50 years of service of the Huey in the Army, and 40 with the National Guard and had a ceremonial end to its service at that time; in the coming years many final flights of the Huey in State National Guard took place. The Washington, D.C. Army National Guard had its last flight in 2011, and Pennsylvania in 2010. The final U.S. Army UH-1 was retired in late 2016, and transferred to a State police department. In context, the Huey is still in service with Armed Forces overall, and the Air Force UH-1N were still in service as of 2024, but scheduled for replacement.

===U.S. Air Force===


In October 1965, the United States Air Force (USAF) 20th Helicopter Squadron was formed at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in South Vietnam, equipped initially with CH-3C helicopters. By June 1967, the UH-1F and UH-1P were also added to the unit&#x27;s inventory and, by the end of the year, the entire unit had shifted from Tan Son Nhut to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, with the CH-3s transferring to the 21st Helicopter Squadron. On 1 August 1968, the unit was redesignated the 20th Special Operations Squadron. The 20th SOS&#x27;s UH-1s were known as the &quot;Green Hornets&quot;, stemming from their color, a primarily green two-tone camouflage (green and tan) was carried, and radio call-sign &quot;Hornet&quot;. The main role of these helicopters were to insert and extract reconnaissance teams, provide cover for such operations, conduct psychological warfare, and other support roles for covert operations especially in Laos and Cambodia during the so-called Secret War.

USAF UH-1s were often equipped with automatic grenade launchers in place of the door guns. The XM-94 grenade launcher had been tested on Army rotorcraft prior to its use by the USAF. The unit was capable of firing 400 grenades per minute, up to 1,500 yards effective range.

Into the twenty-first century, the USAF operates the UH-1N for support of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) sites, including transport of security personnel and distinguished visitors. On 24 September 2018, the USAF announced that the Boeing/Leonardo MH-139 (an AW-139 variant) had won a competition to replace the UH-1N fleet. The UH-1N fleet is in service as of 2024, as production of the new type is ramped up.

===U.S. Navy===

The US Navy acquired a number of surplus UH-1B helicopters from the U.S. Army, these rotorcraft were modified into gunships, outfitted with special gun mounts and radar altimeters. They were known as &quot;Seawolves&quot; in service with Navy Helicopter Attack (Light) (HA(L)-3). UH-1C helicopters were also acquired during the 1970s. The Seawolves worked as a team with Navy river patrol operations.

Four years after the disestablishment of HA(L)-3, the Navy determined that it still had a need for gunships, establishing two new Naval Reserve Helicopter Attack (Light) Squadrons as part of the newly formed Commander, Helicopter Wing Reserve (COMHELWINGRES) in 1976. Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) Five (HA(L)-5), nicknamed the &quot;Blue Hawks&quot;, was established at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California on 11 June 1977 and its sister squadron, Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) Four (HA(L)-4), known as the Red Wolves, was formed at Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia on 1 July 1976.

The last regular Navy Huey&#x27;s, HH-1&#x27;s for search and rescue were retired in 2009 and replaced by H-60 Seahawks, and the last Marine Corp UH-1N were retired in 2014.

===Drug Enforcement Administration===
The UH-1H has been used on multiple occasions by the American Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); initially, these were usually borrowed from the U.S. Army to support planned missions, such for Operation Snowcap, a large multi-year counter-narcotics action covering nine countries across Latin America.

During the War in Afghanistan, the DEA made use of a number of UH-1s stationed in the country for the purpose of conducting counter-narcotics raids. Operated by contractors, these Hueys provide transportation, surveillance, and air support for DEA FAST teams. During July 2009, four UH-1Hs and two Mi-17s were used in a raid that led to the arrest of an Afghan Border Police commander on corruption charges.

===Argentina===
Nine Argentine Army Aviation UH-1Hs and two Argentine Air Force Bell 212 were included with the aircraft deployed during the Falklands War. They performed general transport and SAR missions and were based at Port Stanley (BAM Puerto Argentino). Two of the Hueys were destroyed and, after the hostilities had ended, the remainder were captured by the British military. Three captured aircraft survive as museum pieces in England and Falklands.

===Australia===
The Royal Australian Air Force employed the UH-1H until 1989. Iroquois helicopters of No. 9 Squadron RAAF were deployed to South Vietnam in mid 1966 in support of the 1st Australian Task Force. In this role they were armed with single M60 doorguns. In 1969 four of No. 9 Squadron&#x27;s helicopters were converted to gunships (known as &#x27;Bushrangers&#x27;), armed with two fixed forward firing M134 7.62 mm minigun (one each side) and a 7-round rocket pod on each side. Aircrew were armed with twin M60 flexible mounts in each door. UH-1 helicopters were used in many roles including troop transport, medevac and Bushranger gunships for armed support. No. 35 Squadron and No. 5 Squadron also operated the Iroquois in various roles through the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1982 and 1986, the squadron contributed aircraft and aircrew to the Australian helicopter detachment which formed part of the Multinational Force and Observers peacekeeping force in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. During 1988, the RAAF began to re-equip with S-70A Blackhawks.
In 1989 and 1990, the RAAF&#x27;s UH-1H Iroquois were subsequently transferred to the 171st Aviation Squadron in Darwin, Northern Territory and the 5th Aviation Regiment based in Townsville, Queensland following the decision that all battlefield helicopters would be operated by the Australian Army. On 21 September 2007, the Australian Army retired the last of their Bell UH-1s. The last flight occurred in Brisbane on that day with the aircraft replaced by MRH-90 medium helicopters and Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopters.

The Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s 723 Squadron also operated seven UH-1B from 1964 to 1989, with three of these aircraft lost in accidents during that time. 723 Squadron deployed Iroquois aircraft and personnel as part of the Experimental Military Unit during the Vietnam War.

===El Salvador===
Numerous UH-1s were operated by the Salvadoran Air Force; during the 1980s, it became the biggest and most experienced combat helicopter force in Central and South America, fighting for over a decade during the Salvadoran Civil War and having been trained by US Army in tactics developed during the Vietnam War. By the start of 1985, El Salvador had 33 UH-1s in its inventory, some configured as gunships and others as transports; furthermore, in the following years, the country expanded its UH-1 fleet further with assistance from the US government. Several Salvadoran UH-1M and UH-1H helicopters used were modified to carry bombs instead of rocket pods. The UH-1s enabled the military to avoid ground routes vulnerable to guerilla ambushes; the gunships were typically used to suppress hostile forces ahead of troops being inserted by UH-1 transports.

===Germany===

The German aerospace company Dornier constructed 352 UH-1Ds under license between 1967 and 1981 for the West German Bundeswehr. These saw service with both the German Army and German Air Force as utility helicopters, they were also commonly used for search and rescue (SAR) missions. After being replaced by newer twin-engine Eurocopter EC145s, the last UH-1Ds in German service were withdrawn on 12 April 2021.

===Israel===
Israel withdrew its UH-1s from service in 2002, after 33 years of operation. They were replaced by Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters with an initial batch of 10 delivered during 1994. While some were passed on to pro-Israeli militias in Lebanon, eleven other UH-1Ds were reportedly sold to a Singapore-based logging company but were, instead, delivered in October 1978 to the Royal Rhodesian Air Force to skirt a United Nations-endorsed embargo imposed on the country during the Rhodesian Bush War.

===Japan===

In 1960, Subaru made an agreement to produce the HU-1B for Japan, which was renamed the UH-1B in 1962, along with the HU-1H, renamed UH-1H. Bell and Subaru developed the UH-1J.

Entering service starting in 1993, 130 UH-1J were produced by Fuji for the Japanese Self-Defense Force.

In 2005, a pair of Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) UH-1 helicopters were deployed to Pakistan for earthquake disaster relief. During 2010, after floods in Pakistan, UH-1s were again deployed to the country to aid in disaster relief. Japanese UH-1s have also been periodically used to conduct water bombing against fires.

In the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Japan&#x27;s UH-1 fleet was extensively deployed across the country for disaster relief purposes; they also conducted reconnaissance flights over the stricken Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant while carrying radiation detection equipment to help inform planners of the plant&#x27;s condition.

By the early 2020s, Japan&#x27;s Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics Agency was in the process of recapitalising much of the JGSDF&#x27;s rotarywing capability; it is planned for a locally-built model of the twin-engined multirole Bell 412 helicopter to replace the remaining older UH-1s in Japanese service; the new helicopter will be called the H-2 in JSDF service. The first flight of the Subaru UH-2 took place in 2022.

===Lebanon===
During the early 1990s, the Lebanese Air Force (LAF) inducted their first UH-1 helicopters. During the 2007 Lebanon conflict, at the Battle of Nahr el-Bared in North Lebanon, the Lebanese Army, lacking fixed-wing aircraft, modified several UH-1Hs to carry Mark 82 bombs, enabling it to perform helicopter bombing, and used it to strike militant-held positions. Specifically, special mounting points were installed along the sides of each Huey for the carriage of these high explosive bombs. In the aftermath of the 2020 Beirut explosion, UH-1s participated in the disaster response, and were used to extinguish fires.

Typically, the fleet is tasked with performing search and rescue, troop transport, aerial firefighting and utility missions. In the late 2010s, specially modified UH-1Ds participated in the first LIDAR mapping exercise in the country. During February 2021, an additional three Bell UH-1H-IIs were delivered to the LAF by Bell to augment their existing fleet.

===New Zealand===
The Royal New Zealand Air Force had an active fleet of 13 Iroquois serving with No. 3 Squadron RNZAF. The first delivery was five UH-1D in 1966 followed in 1970 by nine UH-1H and one more UH-1H in 1976. All of the UH-1D aircraft were upgraded to 1H specification during the 1970s. Two ex-U.S. Army UH-1H attrition airframes were purchased in 1996. Three aircraft have been lost in accidents.

The RNZAF has retired the Iroquois, with the NHIndustries NH90 as its replacement. Eight active NH90 helicopters plus one spare have been procured. This process was initially expected to be completed by the end of 2013, but was delayed until 2016. Individual aircraft were retired as they reach their next major group servicing intervals; the UH-1H was retired as the NH90 fleet stood up. On 21 May 2015, the remaining UH-1H fleet of six helicopters conducted a final tour of the country ahead of its planned retirement on 1 July. During 49 years of service the type had seen service in areas including the U.K., Southeast Asia, Timor, the Solomon Islands, various South Pacific nations, and the Antarctic.

One was preserved in the New Zealand National museum after its retirement from service in 2013, delivered to the museum in 2015; it had had been in service many decades entering RNZAF service in 1966.

===Philippines===
The Philippine Air Force (PAF) has a long history of acquiring United States Air Force assets, including the Bell UH-1.On 29 March 1969 the PAF received the first UH-1 Hueys and a unit was reorganized into the 205th Tactical Helicopter Wing. The Huey platforms were brand-new equipped with the latest avionics and pilots were provided ballistics helmets. The first four helicopters with tail numbers 290, 291, 292 and 293 came straight out of the factory, the US Army having started commissioning initials productions only two years before.

In PAF service, the type was regularly used to combat local insurgents as well as to conduct disaster relief operations after several earthquakes and typhoons hit the nation. Learning from this experience, the PAF decided to arm the Hueys with machineguns. In February 1971, aircrew members of the unit underwent gunnery training at Fort Magsaysay. The sparkling new M-60 machineguns now enhanced the Hueys’ capability to provide fire support from the air. The new-found fire power was ably demonstrated in punitive operations at Barrio Talbac, San Ildefonso, Bulacan, on 7–8 April 1971. In the ensuing encounter, Huk Commander Beto and his aide named Yoyong were killed.Francis Ford Coppola filmed &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; in the Philippines primarily because President Ferdinand Marcos agreed to let Coppola use Philippine Hueys to film the iconic scene with Robert Duvall as Lt. Colonel Kilgore.

In 2004, the Philippine Air Force (PAF) procured 20 refurbished UH-1H &#x27;Huey&#x27; helicopters from Singapore Technologies Aerospace (ST Aero) in a deal worth US$12 million. In 2013, due to urgent operational requirements the PAF Procured Brand New Bell 412 delivered in 2015. Procured another batch of 21 units refurbished Bell UH-1D now with Nigh Vision Compatible Cockpit with a budget of PHP1.26bn ($28m) contract with Rice Aircraft Services and Eagle Copters joint venture (JV) delivered in 2015. Furthermore, during October 2019, the Philippines made a deal with Japan to acquire some of its spare parts inventory; this reportedly was to facilitate the restoration of 7 units stored UH-1s to flightworthy condition. By January 2021, the PAF had 13 UH-1H and 10 UH-1D helicopters in an operational condition.

On 2021, a plan to retire all of the PAF&#x27;s remaining UH-1 helicopters was raised, following a series of crashes involving the type. On 14 October 2021, the PAF officially decommissioned the remainder of its UH-1D fleet, the retired rotorcraft were stored at Clark Air Base. However airworthy airframes were returned to service due to lack of aircraft. The role of the UH-1 is to be performed by recently delivered Poland Built PZL Mielec (Sikorsky S-70i) helicopters which were acquired through Multi-Year Contractual Authority (MYCA); in January 2022

In 2022, the Philippines said that some of the retired Huey&#x27;s will be reactivated with the help of Turkish company ASFAT. Also, in 2022, Japan planned to donate UH-1s leaving its service to the Philippine Army. Japan is introducing new Huey&#x27;s as replacement. As of December 2024, twenty-three units are in active service.

===Rhodesia===
Very late in the Rhodesian Bush War, the Rhodesian Air Force obtained 11 former Israeli Agusta-Bell 205As in violation of sanctions on the nation, allegedly having used a series of intermediaries to evade them. Locally known as &quot;Cheetahs&quot;, these helicopters were returned to a flightworthy condition and then assigned to No. 8 Squadron, after which they participated in the counter-insurgency effort, usually functioning as armed gunships as well as troop transports. During September 1979, one Cheetah was lost in combat after being hit by an RPG while flying over Mozambique. At least another three other UH-1s were also lost. The surviving helicopters were put up for sale in 1990.

===Yemen===
In July 2009, Yemen received four UH-1Hs. These remained grounded for almost all the time they were in Yemen; at least one helicopter was heavily damaged during Saudi-led airstrikes on Al Daylami and Al Anad Air Bases.

==Notable appearances in media==

The image of American troops disembarking from a Huey has become an iconic image of the Vietnam War, and can be seen in many films, video games and television shows on the subject, as well as more modern settings. The UH-1 is seen in many films about the Vietnam War, including &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Casualties of War&quot;, and &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;. It is prominently featured in &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; as the main helicopter used by the Air Cavalry in the Battle of Ia Drang. Author Robert Mason recounts his career as a UH-1 &quot;Slick&quot; pilot in his memoir, &quot;Chickenhawk&quot;.

The 2002 journey of &quot;Huey 091&quot;, displayed in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, is outlined in the 2004 documentary &quot;In the Shadow of the Blade&quot;.

<doc id="38010" wikidata="Q905892" url="?curid=38010" title="Heliox">
<text>Heliox is a breathing gas mixture of helium (He) and oxygen (O2). It is used as a medical treatment for patients with difficulty breathing because this mixture generates less resistance than atmospheric air when passing through the airways of the lungs, and thus requires less effort by a patient to breathe in and out of the lungs. It is also used as a breathing gas for deep ambient pressure diving as it is not narcotic at high pressure, and for its low work of breathing.

Heliox has been used medically since the 1930s, and although the medical community adopted it initially to alleviate symptoms of upper airway obstruction, its range of medical uses has since expanded greatly, mostly because of the low density of the gas. Heliox is also used in saturation diving and sometimes during the deep phase of technical dives.

== Medical uses ==

There is also some use of heliox in conditions of the medium airways (croup, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). A recent trial has suggested that lower fractions of helium (below 40%) thus allowing a higher fraction of oxygen might also have the same beneficial effect on upper airway obstruction.

Patients with these conditions may develop a range of symptoms including dyspnea (breathlessness), hypoxemia (below-normal oxygen content in the arterial blood) and eventually a weakening of the respiratory muscles due to exhaustion, which can lead to respiratory failure and require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Heliox may reduce all these effects, making it easier for the patient to breathe. Heliox has also found utility in the weaning of patients off mechanical ventilation, and in the nebulization of inhalable drugs, particularly for the elderly. Research has also indicated advantages in using helium–oxygen mixtures in delivery of anaesthesia.

=== Available forms ===
In medicine, heliox may refer to a mixture of 21% O2 (the same as air) and 79% He, although other combinations are available (70/30 and 60/40).

== Mechanism of action ==

Heliox generates less airway resistance than air and thereby requires less mechanical energy to ventilate the lungs. &quot;Work of breathing&quot; (WOB) is reduced by two mechanisms:
# increased tendency to laminar flow;
# reduced resistance in turbulent flow due to lower density.
Heliox 20/80 diffuses 1.8 times faster than oxygen, and the flow of heliox 20/80 from an oxygen flowmeter is 1.8 times the normal flow for oxygen.

Heliox has a similar viscosity to air but a significantly lower density (0.5 g/L versus 1.25 g/L at STP). Flow of gas through the airway comprises laminar flow, transitional flow and turbulent flow. The tendency for each type of flow is described by the Reynolds number. Heliox&#x27;s low density produces a lower Reynolds number and hence higher probability of laminar flow for any given airway. Laminar flow tends to generate less resistance than turbulent flow.

In the small airways where flow is laminar, resistance is proportional to gas viscosity and is not related to density and so heliox has little effect. The Hagen–Poiseuille equation describes laminar resistance. In the large airways where flow is turbulent, resistance is proportional to density, so heliox has a significant effect.

=== History ===
Heliox has been used medically since the early 1930s. It was the mainstay of treatment in acute asthma before the advent of bronchodilators. Currently, heliox is mainly used in conditions of large airway narrowing (upper airway obstruction from tumors or foreign bodies and vocal cord dysfunction).

== Usage in diving ==

Helium diluted breathing gases are used to eliminate or reduce the effects of inert gas narcosis, and to reduce work of breathing due to increased gas density at depth. From the 1960s saturation diving physiology studies were conducted with helium from over several decades by a Hyperbaric Experimental Centre operated by the French company COMEX specializing in engineering and deep diving operations. Owing to the expense of helium, heliox is most likely to be used in deep saturation diving. It is also sometimes used by technical divers, particularly those using rebreathers, which conserve the breathing gas at depth much better than open circuit scuba. Use of heliox mixtures is known as heliox diving, a subs-category of mixed gas diving, also known simply as gas diving.


The proportion of oxygen in a diving mix depends on the maximum depth of the dive plan, but it is often and may be less than 10%. Each mix is custom made using gas blending techniques, which often involve the use of booster pumps to achieve typical diving cylinder pressures of from lower pressure banks of oxygen and helium cylinders.

Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, making divers&#x27; speech very high-pitched and hard to understand to people not used to it. Surface personnel often employ a piece of communications equipment called a &quot;helium de-scrambler&quot;, which electronically lowers the pitch of the diver&#x27;s voice as it is relayed through the communications gear, making it easier to understand.

Trimix is a less expensive alternative to heliox for deep diving, which uses only enough helium to limit narcosis and gas density to tolerable levels for the planned depth. Trimix is often used in technical diving, and is also sometimes used in professional diving.

In 2015, the United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit showed that decompression from bounce dives using trimix is not more efficient than dives on heliox.

<text>A squid (: squid) is a mollusc with an elongated soft body, large eyes, eight arms, and two tentacles in the orders Myopsida, Oegopsida, and Bathyteuthida (though many other molluscs within the broader Neocoleoidea are also called &quot;squid&quot; despite not strictly fitting these criteria). Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, bilateral symmetry, and a mantle. They are mainly soft-bodied, like octopuses, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like gladius or pen, made of chitin.

Squid diverged from other cephalopods during the Jurassic and occupy a similar role to teleost fish as open water predators of similar size and behaviour. They play an important role in the open water food web. The two long tentacles are used to grab prey and the eight arms to hold and control it. The beak then cuts the food into suitable size chunks for swallowing. Squid are rapid swimmers, moving by jet propulsion, and largely locate their prey by sight. They are among the most intelligent of invertebrates, with groups of Humboldt squid having been observed hunting cooperatively. They are preyed on by sharks, other fish, sea birds, seals and cetaceans, particularly sperm whales.

Squid can change colour for camouflage and signalling. Some species are bioluminescent, using their light for counter-illumination camouflage, while many species can eject a cloud of ink to distract predators.

Squid are used for human consumption with commercial fisheries in Japan, the Mediterranean, the southwestern Atlantic, the eastern Pacific and elsewhere. They are used in cuisines around the world, often known as &quot;calamari&quot;. Squid have featured in literature since classical times, especially in tales of giant squid and sea monsters.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
Squid are members of the class Cephalopoda, subclass Coleoidea. The squid orders Myopsida and Oegopsida are in the superorder Decapodiformes (from the Greek for &quot;ten-legged&quot;). Two other orders of decapodiform cephalopods are also called squid, although they are taxonomically distinct from squids and differ recognizably in their gross anatomical features. They are the bobtail squid of order Sepiolida and the ram&#x27;s horn squid of the monotypic order Spirulida. The vampire squid (&quot;Vampyroteuthis infernalis&quot;), however, is more closely related to the octopus than to any squid.

The cladogram, not fully resolved, is based on Sanchez et al., 2018. Their molecular phylogeny used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA marker sequences; they comment that a robust phylogeny &quot;has proven very challenging to obtain&quot;. If it is accepted that Sepiidae cuttlefish are a kind of squid, then the squids, excluding the vampire squid, form a clade as illustrated. Orders are shown in boldface; all the families not included in those orders are in the paraphyletic order &quot;Oegopsida&quot;, except Sepiadariidae and Sepiidae that are in the polyphyletic order &quot;Sepiida&quot;, 

===Evolution===
Crown coleoids (the common ancestor of octopuses and squid) diverged in the late Paleozoic (Mississippian), according to fossils of &quot;Syllipsimopodi&quot;, an early relative of vampire squids and octopuses. True squid diverged during the Jurassic, but many squid families appeared in or after the Cretaceous. Both the coleoids and the teleost fish were involved in much adaptive radiation at this time, and the two modern groups resemble each other in size, ecology, habitat, morphology and behaviour, however some fish moved into fresh water while the coleoids remained in marine environments.

The ancestral coleoid was probably nautiloid-like with a strait septate shell that became immersed in the mantle and was used for buoyancy control. Four lines diverged from this, Spirulida (with one living member), the cuttlefishes, the squids and the octopuses. Squid have differentiated from the ancestral mollusc such that the body plan has been condensed antero-posteriorly and extended dorso-ventrally. What may have been the foot of the ancestor is modified into a complex set of appendages around the mouth. The sense organs are highly developed and include advanced eyes similar to those of vertebrates.

The ancestral shell has been lost, with only an internal gladius, or pen, remaining. The pen, made of a chitin-like material, is a feather-shaped internal structure that supports the squid&#x27;s mantle and serves as a site for muscle attachment. The cuttlebone or sepion of the Sepiidae is calcareous and appears to have evolved afresh in the Tertiary.

==Description==
Squid are soft-bodied molluscs whose forms evolved to adopt an active predatory lifestyle. The head and foot of the squid are at one end of a long body, and this end is functionally anterior, leading the animal as it moves through the water. A set of eight arms and two distinctive tentacles surround the mouth; each appendage takes the form of a muscular hydrostat and is flexible and prehensile, usually bearing disc-like suckers.

The suckers may lie directly on the arm or be stalked. Their rims are stiffened with chitin and may contain minute toothlike denticles. These features, as well as strong musculature, and a small ganglion beneath each sucker to allow individual control, provide a very powerful adhesion to grip prey. Hooks are present on the arms and tentacles in some species, but their function is unclear. The two tentacles are much longer than the arms and are retractile. Suckers are limited to the spatulate tip of the tentacle, known as the manus.

In the mature male, the outer half of one of the left arms is hectocotylised&quot; &quot;– and ends in a copulatory pad rather than suckers. This is used for depositing a spermatophore inside the mantle cavity of a female. A ventral part of the foot has been converted into a funnel through which water exits the mantle cavity.

The main body mass is enclosed in the mantle, which has a swimming fin along each side. These fins are not the main source of locomotion in most species. The mantle wall is heavily muscled and internal. The visceral mass, which is covered by a thin, membranous epidermis, forms a cone-shaped posterior region known as the &quot;visceral hump&quot;. The mollusc shell is reduced to an internal, longitudinal chitinous &quot;pen&quot; in the functionally dorsal part of the animal; the pen acts to stiffen the squid and provides attachments for muscles.

On the functionally ventral part of the body is an opening to the mantle cavity, which contains the gills (ctenidia) and openings from the excretory, digestive and reproductive systems. An inhalant siphon behind the funnel draws water into the mantle cavity via a valve. The squid uses the funnel for locomotion via precise jet propulsion. In this form of locomotion, water is sucked into the mantle cavity and expelled out of the funnel in a fast, strong jet. The direction of travel is varied by the orientation of the funnel. Squid are strong swimmers and certain species can &quot;fly&quot; for short distances out of the water.

===Camouflage===
Squid make use of different kinds of camouflage, namely active camouflage for background matching (in shallow water) and counter-illumination. This helps to protect them from their predators and allows them to approach their prey.

The skin is covered in controllable chromatophores of different colours, enabling the squid to match its coloration to its surroundings. The play of colours may in addition distract prey from the squid&#x27;s approaching tentacles. The skin also contains light reflectors called iridophores and leucophores that, when activated, in milliseconds create changeable skin patterns of polarized light. Such skin camouflage may serve various functions, such as communication with nearby squid, prey detection, navigation, and orientation during hunting or seeking shelter. Neural control of the iridophores enabling rapid changes in skin iridescence appears to be regulated by a cholinergic process affecting reflectin proteins.

Some mesopelagic squid such as the firefly squid (&quot;Watasenia scintillans&quot;) and the midwater squid (&quot;Abralia veranyi&quot;) use counter-illumination camouflage, generating light to match the downwelling light from the ocean surface. This creates the effect of countershading, making the underside lighter than the upperside.

Counter-illumination is also used by the Hawaiian bobtail squid (&quot;Euprymna scolopes&quot;), which has symbiotic bacteria (&quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot;) that produce light to help the squid avoid nocturnal predators. This light shines through the squid&#x27;s skin on its underside and is generated by a large and complex two-lobed light organ inside the squid&#x27;s mantle cavity. From there, it escapes downwards, some of it travelling directly, some coming off a reflector at the top of the organ (dorsal side). Below there is a kind of iris, which has branches (diverticula) of its ink sac, with a lens below that; both the reflector and lens are derived from mesoderm. The squid controls light production by changing the shape of its iris or adjusting the strength of yellow filters on its underside, which presumably change the balance of wavelengths emitted. Light production shows a correlation with intensity of down-welling light, but it is about one third as bright; the squid can track repeated changes in brightness. Because the Hawaiian bobtail squid hides in sand during the day to avoid predators, it does not use counter-illumination during daylight hours.

===Predator distraction with ink===
Squid distract attacking predators by ejecting a cloud of ink, giving themselves an opportunity to escape. The ink gland and its associated ink sac empties into the rectum close to the anus, allowing the squid to rapidly discharge black ink into the mantle cavity and surrounding water. The ink is a suspension of melanin particles and quickly disperses to form a dark cloud that obscures the escape manoeuvres of the squid. Predatory fish may also be deterred by the alkaloid nature of the discharge which may interfere with their chemoreceptors.

===Nervous system and sense organs===
Cephalopods have the most highly developed nervous systems among invertebrates. Squids have a complex brain in the form of a nerve ring encircling the oesophagus, enclosed in a cartilaginous cranium. Paired cerebral ganglia above the oesophagus receive sensory information from the eyes and statocysts, and further ganglia below control the muscles of the mouth, foot, mantle and viscera. Giant axons up to in diameter convey nerve messages with great rapidity to the circular muscles of the mantle wall, allowing a synchronous, powerful contraction and maximum speed in the jet propulsion system.

The paired eyes, on either side of the head, are housed in capsules fused to the cranium. Their structure is very similar to that of a fish eye, with a globular lens that has a depth of focus from to infinity. The image is focused by changing the position of the lens, as in a camera or telescope, rather than changing the shape of the lens, as in the human eye. Squid adjust to changes in light intensity by expanding and contracting the slit-shaped pupil. Deep sea squids in the family Histioteuthidae have eyes of two different types and orientation. The large left eye is tubular in shape and looks upwards, presumably searching for the silhouettes of animals higher in the water column. The normally-shaped right eye points forwards and downwards to detect prey.

The statocysts are involved in maintaining balance and are analogous to the inner ear of fish. They are housed in cartilaginous capsules on either side of the cranium. They provide the squid with information on its body position in relation to gravity, its orientation, acceleration and rotation, and are able to perceive incoming vibrations. Without the statocysts, the squid cannot maintain equilibrium. Squid appear to have limited hearing, but the head and arms bear lines of hair-cells that are weakly sensitive to water movements and changes in pressure, and are analogous in function to the lateral line system of fish.

===Reproductive system===
The sexes are separate in squid, with a single gonad in the posterior part of the body. Fertilisation is external and usually takes place in the mantle cavity of the female. The male has a testis from which sperm pass into a single gonoduct where they are rolled together into a long bundle, or spermatophore. The gonoduct is elongated into a &quot;penis&quot; that extends into the mantle cavity and through which spermatophores are ejected. In shallow water species, the penis is short, and the spermatophore is removed from the mantle cavity by a tentacle of the male, which is specially adapted for the purpose and known as a hectocotylus, and placed inside the mantle cavity of the female during mating.

The female has a large translucent ovary, situated towards the posterior of the visceral mass. From here, eggs travel along the gonocoel, where there are a pair of white nidamental glands, which lie anterior to the gills. Also present are red-spotted accessory nidamental glands containing symbiotic bacteria; both organs are associated with nutrient manufacture and forming shells for the eggs. The gonocoel enters the mantle cavity at the gonopore, and in some species, receptacles for storing spermatophores are located nearby, in the mantle wall.

In shallow-water species of the continental shelf and epipelagic or mesopelagic zones, it is frequently one or both of arm pair IV of males that are modified into hectocotyli. However, most deep-sea squid lack hectocotyl arms and have longer penises; Ancistrocheiridae and Cranchiinae are exceptions. Giant squid of the genus &quot;Architeuthis&quot; are unusual in that they possess both a large penis and modified arm tips, although whether the latter are used for spermatophore transfer is uncertain. Penis elongation has been observed in the deep-water species &quot;Onykia ingens&quot;; when erect, the penis may be as long as the mantle, head, and arms combined. As such, deep-water squid have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals, second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile barnacles.

===Digestive system===
Like all cephalopods, squids are predators and have complex digestive systems. The mouth is equipped with a sharp, horny beak mainly made of chitin and cross-linked proteins, which is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms; the cross-linked proteins are histidine- and glycine-rich and give the beak a stiffness and hardness greater than most equivalent synthetic organic materials. The stomachs of captured whales often have indigestible squid beaks inside. The mouth contains the radula, the rough tongue common to all molluscs except bivalvia, which is equipped with multiple rows of teeth. In some species, toxic saliva helps to control large prey; when subdued, the food can be torn in pieces by the beak, moved to the oesophagus by the radula, and swallowed.

The food bolus is moved along the gut by waves of muscular contractions (peristalsis). The long oesophagus leads to a muscular stomach roughly in the middle of the visceral mass. The digestive gland, which is equivalent to a vertebrate liver, diverticulates here, as does the pancreas, and both of these empty into the caecum, a pouch-shaped sac where most of the absorption of nutrients takes place. Indigestible food can be passed directly from the stomach to the rectum where it joins the flow from the caecum and is voided through the anus into the mantle cavity. Cephalopods are short-lived, and in mature squid, priority is given to reproduction; the female &quot;Onychoteuthis banksii&quot; for example, sheds its feeding tentacles on reaching maturity, and becomes flaccid and weak after spawning.

===Cardiovascular and excretory systems===
The squid mantle cavity is a seawater-filled sac containing three hearts and other organs supporting circulation, respiration, and excretion. Squid have a main systemic heart that pumps blood around the body as part of the general circulatory system, and two branchial hearts. The systemic heart consists of three chambers, a lower ventricle and two upper atria, all of which can contract to propel the blood. The branchial hearts pump blood specifically to the gills for oxygenation, before returning it to the systemic heart. The blood contains the copper-rich protein hemocyanin, which is used for oxygen transport at low ocean temperatures and low oxygen concentrations, and makes the oxygenated blood a deep, blue color. As systemic blood returns via two venae cavae to the branchial hearts, excretion of urine, carbon dioxide, and waste solutes occurs through outpockets (called nephridial appendages) in the venae cavae walls that enable gas exchange and excretion via the mantle cavity seawater.

===Buoyancy===
Unlike nautiloids and cuttlefish which have gas-filled chambers inside their shells which provide buoyancy, and octopuses which live near and rest on the seabed and do not require to be buoyant, many squid have a fluid-filled receptacle, equivalent to the swim bladder of a fish, in the coelom or connective tissue. This reservoir acts as a chemical buoyancy chamber, with the heavy metallic cations typical of seawater replaced by low molecular-weight ammonium ions, a product of excretion. The small difference in density provides a small contribution to buoyancy per unit volume, so the mechanism requires a large buoyancy chamber to be effective. Since the chamber is filled with liquid, it has the advantage over a swim bladder of not changing significantly in volume with pressure. Glass squids in the family Cranchiidae for example, have an enormous transparent coelom containing ammonium ions and occupying about two-thirds the volume of the animal, allowing it to float at the required depth. About half of the 28 families of squid use this mechanism to solve their buoyancy issues. The family Bathyteuthidae get their buoyancy from an oily substance found in their liver and around their mantle and head.

===Largest and smallest===

The majority of squid are no more than long, although the giant squid may reach . The smallest species are probably the benthic pygmy squids &quot;Idiosepius&quot;, which grow to a mantle length of , and have short bodies and stubby arms.

In 1978, sharp, curved claws on the suction cups of squid tentacles cut up the rubber coating on the hull of the USS &quot;Stein&quot;. The size suggested the largest squid known at the time.

In 2003, a large specimen of an abundant but poorly understood species, &quot;Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni&quot; (the colossal squid), was discovered. This species may grow to in length, making it the largest invertebrate. In February 2007, a New Zealand fishing vessel caught the largest squid ever documented, weighing and measuring around off the coast of Antarctica. Dissection showed that the eyes, used to detect prey in the deep Southern Ocean, exceeded the size of footballs; these may be among the largest eyes ever to exist in the animal kingdom.

==Development==
The eggs of squid are large for a mollusc, containing a large amount of yolk to nourish the embryo as it develops directly, without an intervening veliger larval stage. The embryo grows as a disc of cells on top of the yolk. During the gastrulation stage, the margins of the disc grow to surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the animal&#x27;s gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop as part of the foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo grows. Some juvenile squid live higher in the water column than do adults. Squids tend to be short-lived; &quot;Loligo&quot; for example lives from one to three years according to species, typically dying soon after spawning.

In a well-studied bioluminescent species, the Hawaiian bobtail squid, a special light organ in the squid&#x27;s mantle is rapidly colonized with &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot; bacteria within hours of hatching. This light-organ colonization requires this particular bacterial species for a symbiotic relationship; no colonization occurs in the absence of &quot;A. fischeri&quot;. Colonization occurs in a horizontal manner, such that the hosts acquires its bacterial partners from the environment. The symbiosis is obligate for the squid, but facultative for the bacteria. Once the bacteria enter the squid, they colonize interior epithelial cells in the light organ, living in crypts with complex microvilli protrusions. The bacteria also interact with hemocytes, macrophage-like blood cells that migrate between epithelial cells, but the mechanism and function of this process is not well understood. Bioluminescence reaches its highest levels during the early evening hours and bottoms out before dawn; this occurs because at the end of each day, the contents of the squid&#x27;s crypts are expelled into the surrounding environment. Approximately 95% of the bacteria are voided each morning before the bacterial population builds up again by nightfall.

==Behaviour==

===Locomotion===
Squid can move about in several different ways. Slow movement is achieved by a gentle undulation of the muscular lateral fins on either side of the trunk which drives the animal forward. A more common means of locomotion providing sustained movement is achieved using jetting, during which contraction of the muscular wall of the mantle cavity provides jet propulsion.

Slow jetting is used for ordinary locomotion, and ventilation of the gills is achieved at the same time. The circular muscles in the mantle wall contract; this causes the inhalant valve to close, the exhalant valve to open and the mantle edge to lock tightly around the head. Water is forced out through the funnel which is pointed in the opposite direction to the required direction of travel. The inhalant phase is initiated by the relaxation of the circular muscles causes them to stretch, the connective tissue in the mantle wall recoils elastically, the mantle cavity expands causing the inhalant valve to open, the exhalant valve to close and water to flow into the cavity. This cycle of exhalation and inhalation is repeated to provide continuous locomotion.

Fast jetting is an escape response. In this form of locomotion, radial muscles in the mantle wall are involved as well as circular ones, making it possible to hyper-inflate the mantle cavity with a larger volume of water than during slow jetting. On contraction, water flows out with great force, the funnel always being pointed anteriorly, and travel is backwards. During this means of locomotion, some squid exit the water in a similar way to flying fish, gliding through the air for up to , and occasionally ending up on the decks of ships.

===Feeding===
Squid are carnivores, and, with their strong arms and suckers, can overwhelm relatively large animals efficiently. Prey is identified by sight or by touch, grabbed by the tentacles which can be shot out with great rapidity, brought back to within reach of the arms, and held by the hooks and suckers on their surface. In some species, the squid&#x27;s saliva contains toxins which act to subdue the prey. These are injected into its bloodstream when the prey is bitten, along with vasodilators and chemicals to stimulate the heart, and quickly circulate to all parts of its body. The deep sea squid &quot;Taningia danae&quot; has been filmed releasing blinding flashes of light from large photophores on its arms to illuminate and disorientate potential prey.

Although squid can catch large prey, the mouth is relatively small, and the food must be cut into pieces by the chitinous beak with its powerful muscles before being swallowed. The radula is located in the buccal cavity and has multiple rows of tiny teeth that draw the food backwards and grind it in pieces. The deep sea squid &quot;Mastigoteuthis&quot; has the whole length of its whip-like tentacles covered with tiny suckers; it probably catches small organisms in the same way that flypaper traps flies. The tentacles of some bathypelagic squids bear photophores which may bring food within its reach by attracting prey.

Squid are among the most intelligent invertebrates. For example, groups of Humboldt squid hunt cooperatively, spiralling up through the water at night and coordinating their vertical and horizontal movements while foraging.

===Reproduction===
Courtship in squid takes place in the open water and involves the male selecting a female, the female responding, and the transfer by the male of spermatophores to the female. In many instances, the male may display to identify himself to the female and drive off any potential competitors. Elaborate changes in body patterning take place in some species in both agonistic and courtship behaviour. The Caribbean reef squid (&quot;Sepioteuthis sepioidea&quot;), for example, employs a complex array of colour changes during courtship and social interactions and has a range of about 16 body patterns in its repertoire.

The pair adopt a head-to-head position, and &quot;jaw locking&quot; may take place, in a similar manner to that adopted by some cichlid fish. The heterodactylus of the male is used to transfer the spermatophore and deposit it in the female&#x27;s mantle cavity in the position appropriate for the species; this may be adjacent to the gonopore or in a seminal receptacle.

The sperm may be used immediately or may be stored. As the eggs pass down the oviduct, they are wrapped in a gelatinous coating, before continuing to the mantle cavity, where they are fertilised. In &quot;Loligo&quot;, further coatings are added by the nidimental glands in the walls of the cavity and the eggs leave through a funnel formed by the arms. The female attaches them to the substrate in strings or groups, the coating layers swelling and hardening after contact with sea water. &quot;Loligo&quot; sometimes forms breeding aggregations which may create a &quot;community pile&quot; of egg strings. Some pelagic and deep sea squid do not attach their egg masses, which float freely.

==Ecology==
Squid mostly have an annual life cycle, growing fast and dying soon after spawning. The diet changes as they grow but mostly consists of large zooplankton and small nekton. In Antarctica for example, krill is the main constituent of the diet, with other food items being amphipods, other small crustaceans, and large arrow worms. Fish are also eaten, and some squid are cannibalistic.

As well as occupying a key role in the food chain, squid are an important prey for predators including sharks, sea birds, seals and whales. Juvenile squid provide part of the diet for worms and small fish. When researchers studied the contents of the stomachs of elephant seals in South Georgia, they found 96% squid by weight. In a single day, a sperm whale can eat 700 to 800 squid, and a Risso&#x27;s dolphin entangled in a net in the Mediterranean was found to have eaten angel clubhook squid, umbrella squid, reverse jewel squid and European flying squid, all identifiable from their indigestible beaks. &quot;Ornithoteuthis volatilis&quot;, a common squid from the tropical Indo-Pacific, is predated by yellowfin tuna, longnose lancetfish, common dolphinfish and swordfish, the tiger shark, the scalloped hammerhead shark and the smooth hammerhead shark. Sperm whales also hunt this species extensively as does the brown fur seal. In the Southern Ocean, penguins and wandering albatrosses are major predators of &quot;Gonatus antarcticus&quot;.

==Human uses==
===In literature and art===
Giant squid have featured as monsters of the deep since classical times. Giant squid were described by Aristotle (4th century BC) in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; and Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) in his &quot;Natural History&quot;. The Gorgon of Greek mythology may have been inspired by squid or octopus, the animal itself representing the severed head of Medusa, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes. The six-headed sea monster of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Scylla, may have had a similar origin. The Nordic legend of the kraken may also have derived from sightings of large cephalopods.

In literature, H. G. Wells&#x27; short story &quot;The Sea Raiders&quot; featured a man-eating squid species &quot;Haploteuthis ferox&quot;. The science fiction writer Jules Verne told a tale of a kraken-like monster in his 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;.

===As food===

Squid form a major food resource and are used in cuisines around the world, notably in Japan where it is eaten as ika sōmen, sliced into vermicelli-like strips; as sashimi; and as tempura. Three species of &quot;Loligo&quot; are used in large quantities: &quot;L. vulgaris&quot; in the Mediterranean (known as in Spanish, in Italian); &quot;L. forbesii&quot; in the Northeast Atlantic; and &quot;L. pealei&quot; on the American East Coast. Among the Ommastrephidae, &quot;Todarodes pacificus&quot; is the main commercial species, harvested in large quantities across the North Pacific in Canada, Japan and China.

In English-speaking countries, squid as food is often called &quot;calamari&quot;, adopted from Italian into English in the 17th century. Squid are found abundantly in certain areas, and provide large catches for fisheries. The body can be stuffed whole, cut into flat pieces, or sliced into rings. The arms, tentacles, and ink are also edible; the only parts not eaten are the beak and gladius (pen). Squid is a good food source for zinc and manganese, and high in copper, selenium, vitamin B12, and riboflavin.

===Commercial fishing===
According to the FAO, the cephalopod catch for 2002 was . Of this, 2,189,206 tonnes, or 75.8 percent, was squid. The following table lists squid species fishery catches that exceeded in 2002.

===In biomimicry===
Prototype chromatophores that mimic the squid&#x27;s adaptive camouflage have been made by Bristol University researchers using an electroactive dielectric elastomer, a flexible &quot;smart&quot; material that changes its colour and texture in response to electrical signals. The researchers state that their goal is to create an artificial skin that provides rapid active camouflage.

The squid giant axon inspired Otto Schmitt to develop a comparator circuit with hysteresis now called the Schmitt trigger, replicating the axon&#x27;s propagation of nerve impulses.
