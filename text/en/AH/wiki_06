<text>Xenon is a chemical element; it has symbol Xe and atomic number 54. It is a dense, colorless, odorless noble gas found in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, it can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be synthesized.

Xenon is used in flash lamps and arc lamps, and as a general anesthetic. The first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule (Xe2) as the lasing medium, and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps. Xenon is also used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as a propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft.

Naturally occurring xenon consists of seven stable isotopes and two long-lived radioactive isotopes. More than 40 unstable xenon isotopes undergo radioactive decay, and the isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the Solar System. Radioactive xenon-135 is produced by beta decay from iodine-135 (a product of nuclear fission), and is the most significant (and unwanted) neutron absorber in nuclear reactors.

== History ==
Xenon was discovered in England by the Scottish chemist William Ramsay and English chemist Morris Travers on July 12, 1898, shortly after their discovery of the elements krypton and neon. They found xenon in the residue left over from evaporating components of liquid air. Ramsay suggested the name &quot;xenon&quot; for this gas from the Greek word ξένον &quot;xénon&quot;, neuter singular form of ξένος &quot;xénos&quot;, meaning &#x27;foreign(er)&#x27;, &#x27;strange(r)&#x27;, or &#x27;guest&#x27;. In 1902, Ramsay estimated the proportion of xenon in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to be one part in 20 million.

During the 1930s, American engineer Harold Edgerton began exploring strobe light technology for high speed photography. This led him to the invention of the xenon flash lamp in which light is generated by passing brief electric current through a tube filled with xenon gas. In 1934, Edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one microsecond with this method.

In 1939, American physician Albert R. Behnke Jr. began exploring the causes of &quot;drunkenness&quot; in deep-sea divers. He tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects, and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth. From his results, he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an anesthetic. Although Russian toxicologist Nikolay V. Lazarev apparently studied xenon anesthesia in 1941, the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in 1946 by American medical researcher John H. Lawrence, who experimented on mice. Xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by American anesthesiologist Stuart C. Cullen, who successfully used it with two patients.

Xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form compounds. However, while teaching at the University of British Columbia, Neil Bartlett discovered that the gas platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) was a powerful oxidizing agent that could oxidize oxygen gas (O2) to form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate (). Since O2 (1165 kJ/mol) and xenon (1170 kJ/mol) have almost the same first ionization potential, Bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also be able to oxidize xenon. On March 23, 1962, he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas, xenon hexafluoroplatinate.

Bartlett thought its composition to be Xe+[PtF6]−, but later work revealed that it was probably a mixture of various xenon-containing salts. Since then, many other xenon compounds have been discovered, in addition to some compounds of the noble gases argon, krypton, and radon, including argon fluorohydride (HArF), krypton difluoride (KrF2), and radon fluoride. By 1971, more than 80 xenon compounds were known.

In November 1989, IBM scientists demonstrated a technology capable of manipulating individual atoms. The program, called IBM in atoms, used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel to spell out the three-letter company initialism. It was the first-time atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface.

== Characteristics ==
Xenon has atomic number 54; that is, its nucleus contains 54 protons. At standard temperature and pressure, pure xenon gas has a density of 5.894 kg/m3, about 4.5 times the density of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at sea level, 1.217 kg/m3. As a liquid, xenon has a density of up to 3.100 g/mL, with the density maximum occurring at the triple point. Liquid xenon has a high polarizability due to its large atomic volume, and thus is an excellent solvent. It can dissolve hydrocarbons, biological molecules, and even water. Under the same conditions, the density of solid xenon, 3.640 g/cm3, is greater than the average density of granite, 2.75 g/cm3. Under gigapascals of pressure, xenon forms a metallic phase.

Solid xenon changes from Face-centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140 GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155 GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.
Liquid or solid xenon nanoparticles can be formed at room temperature by implanting Xe+ ions into a solid matrix. Many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid Xe. This results in compression of the implanted Xe to pressures that may be sufficient for its liquefaction or solidification.

Xenon is a member of the zero-valence elements that are called noble or inert gases. It is inert to most common chemical reactions (such as combustion, for example) because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.

In a gas-filled tube, xenon emits a blue or lavenderish glow when excited by electrical discharge. Xenon emits a band of emission lines that span the visual spectrum, but the most intense lines occur in the region of blue light, producing the coloration.

== Occurrence and production ==
Xenon is a trace gas in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, occurring at a volume fraction of (parts per billion), or approximately 1 part per 11.5 million. It is also found as a component of gases emitted from some mineral springs. Given a total mass of the atmosphere of , the atmosphere contains on the order of of xenon in total when taking the average molar mass of the atmosphere as 28.96 g/mol which is equivalent to some 394-mass ppb.

=== Commercial ===
Xenon is obtained commercially as a by-product of the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by adsorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further distillation.

Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at . At a density of this is equivalent to roughly . Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10 €/L (=~€1.7/g) for xenon, 1 €/L (=~€0.27/g) for krypton, and 0.20 €/L (=~€0.22/g) for neon, while the much more plentiful argon, which makes up over 1% by volume of earth&#x27;s atmosphere, costs less than a cent per liter.

=== Solar System ===
Within the Solar System, the nucleon fraction of xenon is , for an abundance of approximately one part in 630 thousand of the total mass. Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere, on Earth, and in asteroids and comets. The abundance of xenon in the atmosphere of planet Jupiter is unusually high, about 2.6 times that of the Sun. This abundance remains unexplained, but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals—small, sub-planetary bodies—before the heating of the presolar disk; otherwise, xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices. The problem of the low terrestrial xenon may be explained by covalent bonding of xenon to oxygen within quartz, reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere.

=== Stellar ===
Unlike the lower-mass noble gases, the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside a star does not form xenon. Nucleosynthesis consumes energy to produce nuclides more massive than iron-56, and thus the synthesis of xenon represents no energy gain for a star. Instead, xenon is formed during supernova explosions during the r-process, by the slow neutron-capture process (s-process) in red giant stars that have exhausted their core hydrogen and entered the asymptotic giant branch, and from radioactive decay, for example by beta decay of extinct iodine-129 and spontaneous fission of thorium, uranium, and plutonium.

=== Nuclear fission ===
Xenon-135 is a notable neutron poison with a high fission product yield. As it is relatively short lived, it decays at the same rate it is produced during &quot;steady&quot; operation of a nuclear reactor. However, if power is reduced or the reactor is scrammed, less xenon is destroyed than is produced from the beta decay of its parent nuclides. This phenomenon called xenon poisoning can cause significant problems in restarting a reactor after a scram or increasing power after it had been reduced and it was one of several contributing factors in the Chernobyl nuclear accident.

Stable or extremely long lived isotopes of xenon are also produced in appreciable quantities in nuclear fission. Xenon-136 is produced when xenon-135 undergoes neutron capture before it can decay. The ratio of xenon-136 to xenon-135 (or its decay products) can give hints as to the power history of a given reactor and the absence of xenon-136 is a &quot;fingerprint&quot; for nuclear explosions, as xenon-135 is not produced directly but as a product of successive beta decays and thus it cannot absorb any neutrons in a nuclear explosion which occurs in fractions of a second.

The stable isotope xenon-132 has a fission product yield of over 4% in the thermal neutron fission of which means that stable or nearly stable xenon isotopes have a higher mass fraction in spent nuclear fuel (which is about 3% fission products) than it does in air. However, there is as of 2022 no commercial effort to extract xenon from spent fuel during nuclear reprocessing.

== Isotopes ==

Naturally occurring xenon is composed of seven stable isotopes: 126Xe, 128–132Xe, and 134Xe. The isotopes 126Xe and 134Xe are predicted by theory to undergo double beta decay, but this has never been observed so they are considered stable. In addition, more than 40 unstable isotopes have been studied. The longest-lived of these isotopes are the primordial 124Xe, which undergoes double electron capture with a half-life of , and 136Xe, which undergoes double beta decay with a half-life of . 129Xe is produced by beta decay of 129I, which has a half-life of 16 million years. 131mXe, 133Xe, 133mXe, and 135Xe are some of the fission products of 235U and 239Pu, and are used to detect and monitor nuclear explosions.

=== Nuclear spin ===
Nuclei of two of the stable isotopes of xenon, 129Xe and 131Xe (both stable isotopes with odd mass numbers), have non-zero intrinsic angular momenta (nuclear spins, suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance). The nuclear spins can be aligned beyond ordinary polarization levels by means of circularly polarized light and rubidium vapor. The resulting spin polarization of xenon nuclei can surpass 50% of its maximum possible value, greatly exceeding the thermal equilibrium value dictated by paramagnetic statistics (typically 0.001% of the maximum value at room temperature, even in the strongest magnets). Such non-equilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition, and is called &quot;hyperpolarization&quot;. The process of hyperpolarizing the xenon is called &quot;optical pumping&quot; (although the process is different from pumping a laser).

Because a 129Xe nucleus has a spin of 1/2, and therefore a zero electric quadrupole moment, the 129Xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms, and the hyperpolarization persists for long periods even after the engendering light and vapor have been removed. Spin polarization of 129Xe can persist from several seconds for xenon atoms dissolved in blood to several hours in the gas phase and several days in deeply frozen solid xenon. In contrast, 131Xe has a nuclear spin value of and a nonzero quadrupole moment, and has t1 relaxation times in the millisecond and second ranges.

=== From fission ===
Some radioactive isotopes of xenon (for example, 133Xe and 135Xe) are produced by neutron irradiation of fissionable material within nuclear reactors. 135Xe is of considerable significance in the operation of nuclear fission reactors. 135Xe has a huge cross section for thermal neutrons, 2.6×106 barns, and operates as a neutron absorber or &quot;poison&quot; that can slow or stop the chain reaction after a period of operation. This was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the American Manhattan Project for plutonium production. However, the designers had made provisions in the design to increase the reactor&#x27;s reactivity (the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of nuclear fuel).

135Xe reactor poisoning was a major factor in the Chernobyl disaster. A shutdown or decrease of power of a reactor can result in buildup of 135Xe, with reactor operation going into a condition known as the iodine pit. Under adverse conditions, relatively high concentrations of radioactive xenon isotopes may emanate from cracked fuel rods, or fissioning of uranium in cooling water.

Isotope ratios of xenon produced in natural nuclear fission reactors at Oklo in Gabon reveal the reactor properties during chain reaction that took place about 2 billion years ago.

=== Cosmic processes ===
Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a powerful tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions.

Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.

In a similar way, xenon isotopic ratios such as 129Xe/130Xe and 136Xe/130Xe are a powerful tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing. For example, the atmosphere of Mars shows a xenon abundance similar to that of Earth (0.08 parts per million) but Mars shows a greater abundance of 129Xe than the Earth or the Sun. Since this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the result may indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. In another example, excess 129Xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from New Mexico is believed to be from the decay of mantle-derived gases from soon after Earth&#x27;s formation.

== Compounds ==

After Neil Bartlett&#x27;s discovery in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, a large number of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen. The chemistry of xenon in each oxidation state is analogous to that of the neighboring element iodine in the immediately lower oxidation state.

=== Halides ===

Three fluorides are known: , , and . XeF is theorized to be unstable. These are the starting points for the synthesis of almost all xenon compounds.

The solid, crystalline difluoride is formed when a mixture of fluorine and xenon gases is exposed to ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet component of ordinary daylight is sufficient. Long-term heating of at high temperatures under an catalyst yields . Pyrolysis of in the presence of NaF yields high-purity .

The xenon fluorides behave as both fluoride acceptors and fluoride donors, forming salts that contain such cations as and , and anions such as , , and . The green, paramagnetic is formed by the reduction of by xenon gas.

 also forms coordination complexes with transition metal ions. More than 30 such complexes have been synthesized and characterized.

Whereas the xenon fluorides are well characterized, the other halides are not. Xenon dichloride, formed by the high-frequency irradiation of a mixture of xenon, fluorine, and silicon or carbon tetrachloride, is reported to be an endothermic, colorless, crystalline compound that decomposes into the elements at 80 °C. However, may be merely a van der Waals molecule of weakly bound Xe atoms and molecules and not a real compound. Theoretical calculations indicate that the linear molecule is less stable than the van der Waals complex. Xenon tetrachloride and xenon dibromide are even more unstable and they cannot be synthesized by chemical reactions. They were created by radioactive decay of and , respectively.

=== Oxides and oxohalides ===
Three oxides of xenon are known: xenon trioxide () and xenon tetroxide (), both of which are dangerously explosive and powerful oxidizing agents, and xenon dioxide (XeO2), which was reported in 2011 with a coordination number of four. XeO2 forms when xenon tetrafluoride is poured over ice. Its crystal structure may allow it to replace silicon in silicate minerals. The XeOO+ cation has been identified by infrared spectroscopy in solid argon.

Xenon does not react with oxygen directly; the trioxide is formed by the hydrolysis of :
: + 3 → + 6 HF

 is weakly acidic, dissolving in alkali to form unstable &quot;xenate&quot; salts containing the anion. These unstable salts easily disproportionate into xenon gas and perxenate salts, containing the anion.

Barium perxenate, when treated with concentrated sulfuric acid, yields gaseous xenon tetroxide:
: + 2 → 2 + 2 + 

To prevent decomposition, the xenon tetroxide thus formed is quickly cooled into a pale-yellow solid. It explodes above −35.9 °C into xenon and oxygen gas, but is otherwise stable.

A number of xenon oxyfluorides are known, including , , , and . is formed by reacting  with xenon gas at low temperatures. It may also be obtained by partial hydrolysis of . It disproportionates at −20 °C into and . is formed by the partial hydrolysis of ...
: + → + 2 
...or the reaction of with sodium perxenate, . The latter reaction also produces a small amount of .

 is also formed by partial hydrolysis of .
: + 2 → + 4 
 reacts with CsF to form the anion, while XeOF3 reacts with the alkali metal fluorides KF, RbF and CsF to form the anion.

=== Other compounds ===
Xenon can be directly bonded to a less electronegative element than fluorine or oxygen, particularly carbon. Electron-withdrawing groups, such as groups with fluorine substitution, are necessary to stabilize these compounds. Numerous such compounds have been characterized, including:
* , where C6F5 is the pentafluorophenyl group.
* 
* 
* 
* 

Other compounds containing xenon bonded to a less electronegative element include and . The latter is synthesized from dioxygenyl tetrafluoroborate, , at −100 °C.

An unusual ion containing xenon is the tetraxenonogold(II) cation, , which contains Xe–Au bonds. This ion occurs in the compound , and is remarkable in having direct chemical bonds between two notoriously unreactive atoms, xenon and gold, with xenon acting as a transition metal ligand. A similar mercury complex (HgXe)(Sb3F17) (formulated as [HgXe2+][Sb2F11–][SbF6–]) is also known.

The compound contains a Xe–Xe bond, the longest element-element bond known (308.71 pm = 3.0871 Å).

In 1995, M. Räsänen and co-workers, scientists at the University of Helsinki in Finland, announced the preparation of xenon dihydride (HXeH), and later xenon hydride-hydroxide (HXeOH), hydroxenoacetylene (HXeCCH), and other Xe-containing molecules. In 2008, Khriachtchev &quot;et al.&quot; reported the preparation of HXeOXeH by the photolysis of water within a cryogenic xenon matrix. Deuterated molecules, HXeOD and DXeOH, have also been produced.

=== Clathrates and excimers ===

In addition to compounds where xenon forms a chemical bond, xenon can form clathrates—substances where xenon atoms or pairs are trapped by the crystalline lattice of another compound. One example is xenon hydrate (Xe·H2O), where xenon atoms occupy vacancies in a lattice of water molecules. This clathrate has a melting point of 24 °C. The deuterated version of this hydrate has also been produced. Another example is xenon hydride (Xe(H2)8), in which xenon pairs (dimers) are trapped inside solid hydrogen. Such clathrate hydrates can occur naturally under conditions of high pressure, such as in Lake Vostok underneath the Antarctic ice sheet. Clathrate formation can be used to fractionally distill xenon, argon and krypton.

Xenon can also form endohedral fullerene compounds, where a xenon atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. The xenon atom trapped in the fullerene can be observed by 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the sensitive chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed. These observations are not without caveat, however, because the xenon atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.

When xenon atoms are in the ground energy state, they repel each other and will not form a bond. When xenon atoms becomes energized, however, they can form an excimer (excited dimer) until the electrons return to the ground state. This entity is formed because the xenon atom tends to complete the outermost electronic shell by adding an electron from a neighboring xenon atom. The typical lifetime of a xenon excimer is 1–5 nanoseconds, and the decay releases photons with wavelengths of about 150 and 173 nm. Xenon can also form excimers with other elements, such as the halogens bromine, chlorine, and fluorine.

== Applications ==
Although xenon is rare and relatively expensive to extract from the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, it has a number of applications.

=== Illumination and optics ===

==== Gas-discharge lamps ====

Xenon is used in light-emitting devices called xenon flash lamps, used in photographic flashes and stroboscopic lamps; to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, occasionally, in bactericidal lamps. The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon flash lamp, and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.

Continuous, short-arc, high pressure xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight and are used in solar simulators. That is, the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator at the temperature of the Sun. First introduced in the 1940s, these lamps replaced the shorter-lived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors. They are also employed in typical 35mm, IMAX, and digital film projection systems. They are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and have intense emissions in the near infrared used in some night vision systems. Xenon is used as a starter gas in metal halide lamps for automotive HID headlights, and high-end &quot;tactical&quot; flashlights.

The individual cells in a plasma display contain a mixture of xenon and neon ionized with electrodes. The interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet photons, which then excite the phosphor coating on the front of the display.

Xenon is used as a &quot;starter gas&quot; in high pressure sodium lamps. It has the lowest thermal conductivity and lowest ionization potential of all the non-radioactive noble gases. As a noble gas, it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp. The low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state, and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state, which allows the lamp to be more easily started.

==== Lasers ====
In 1962, a group of researchers at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first excimer laser used a xenon dimer (Xe2) energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm.
Xenon chloride and xenon fluoride have also been used in excimer (or, more accurately, exciplex) lasers.

=== Medical ===
==== Anesthesia ====
Xenon has been used as a general anesthetic, but it is more expensive than conventional anesthetics.

Xenon interacts with many different receptors and ion channels, and like many theoretically multi-modal inhalation anesthetics, these interactions are likely complementary. Xenon is a high-affinity glycine-site NMDA receptor antagonist. However, xenon is different from certain other NMDA receptor antagonists in that it is not neurotoxic and it inhibits the neurotoxicity of ketamine and nitrous oxide (N2O), while actually producing neuroprotective effects. Unlike ketamine and nitrous oxide, xenon does not stimulate a dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens.

Like nitrous oxide and cyclopropane, xenon activates the two-pore domain potassium channel TREK-1. A related channel TASK-3 also implicated in the actions of inhalation anesthetics is insensitive to xenon. Xenon inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine α4β2 receptors which contribute to spinally mediated analgesia. Xenon is an effective inhibitor of plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase. Xenon inhibits Ca2+ ATPase by binding to a hydrophobic pore within the enzyme and preventing the enzyme from assuming active conformations.

Xenon is a competitive inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. While neither anesthetic nor antinociceptive, this reduces anesthesia-emergent nausea and vomiting.

Xenon has a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, it can be used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide, xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.

==== Neuroprotectant ====
Xenon induces robust cardioprotection and neuroprotection through a variety of mechanisms. Through its influence on Ca2+, K+, KATP\HIF, and NMDA antagonism, xenon is neuroprotective when administered before, during and after ischemic insults. Xenon is a high affinity antagonist at the NMDA receptor glycine site. Xenon is cardioprotective in ischemia-reperfusion conditions by inducing pharmacologic non-ischemic preconditioning. Xenon is cardioprotective by activating PKC-epsilon and downstream p38-MAPK. Xenon mimics neuronal ischemic preconditioning by activating ATP sensitive potassium channels. Xenon allosterically reduces ATP mediated channel activation inhibition independently of the sulfonylurea receptor1 subunit, increasing KATP open-channel time and frequency.

==== Sports doping ====
Inhaling a xenon/oxygen mixture activates production of the transcription factor HIF-1-alpha, which may lead to increased production of erythropoietin. The latter hormone is known to increase red blood cell production and athletic performance. Reportedly, doping with xenon inhalation has been used in Russia since 2004 and perhaps earlier. On August 31, 2014, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) added xenon (and argon) to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although no reliable doping tests for these gases have yet been developed. In addition, effects of xenon on erythropoietin production in humans have not been demonstrated, so far.

==== Imaging ====

Gamma emission from the radioisotope 133Xe of xenon can be used to image the heart, lungs, and brain, for example, by means of single photon emission computed tomography. 133Xe has also been used to measure blood flow.

Xenon, particularly hyperpolarized 129Xe, is a useful contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the gas phase, it can image cavities in a porous sample, alveoli in lungs, or the flow of gases within the lungs. Because xenon is soluble both in water and in hydrophobic solvents, it can image various soft living tissues.

Xenon-129 is currently being used as a visualization agent in MRI scans. When a patient inhales hyperpolarized xenon-129 ventilation and gas exchange in the lungs can be imaged and quantified. Unlike xenon-133, xenon-129 is non-ionizing and is safe to be inhaled with no adverse effects.

==== Surgery ====
The xenon chloride excimer laser has certain dermatological uses.

=== NMR spectroscopy ===
Because of the xenon atom&#x27;s large, flexible outer electron shell, the NMR spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions and can be used to monitor the surrounding chemical circumstances. For instance, xenon dissolved in water, xenon dissolved in hydrophobic solvent, and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by NMR.

Hyperpolarized xenon can be used by surface chemists. Normally, it is difficult to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which are much more numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.

=== Other ===

In nuclear energy studies, xenon is used in bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a high molecular weight and inert chemistry is desirable. A by-product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135. These isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, and to confirm nuclear tests by states such as North Korea.

Liquid xenon is used in calorimeters to measure gamma rays, and as a detector of hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, theory predicts it will impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation. Liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self-shielding.

Xenon is the preferred propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because it has low ionization potential per atomic weight and can be stored as a liquid at near room temperature (under high pressure), yet easily evaporated to feed the engine. Xenon is inert, environmentally friendly, and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or cesium. Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s. It was later employed as a propellant for JPL&#x27;s Deep Space 1 probe, Europe&#x27;s SMART-1 spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on NASA&#x27;s Dawn Spacecraft.

Chemically, the perxenate compounds are used as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry. Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly in the production of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil. Xenon is also used in protein crystallography. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5 MPa (5 to 50 atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative that can be used for solving the phase problem.
== Precautions ==
Xenon gas can be safely kept in normal sealed glass or metal containers at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials. Xenon is non-toxic, although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to a select group of substances that penetrate the blood–brain barrier, causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.

The speed of sound in xenon gas (169 m/s) is less than that in air because the average velocity of the heavy xenon atoms is less than that of nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones (low-frequency-enhanced sounds, but the fundamental frequency or pitch does not change), an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Specifically, when the vocal tract is filled with xenon gas, its natural resonant frequency becomes lower than when it is filled with air. Thus, the low frequencies of the sound wave produced by the same direct vibration of the vocal cords would be enhanced, resulting in a change of the timbre of the sound amplified by the vocal tract. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body&#x27;s need for oxygen, and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.

Dense gases such as xenon and sulfur hexafluoride can be breathed safely when mixed with at least 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% concentration along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia. Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.

Water-soluble xenon compounds such as monosodium xenate are moderately toxic, but have a very short half-life of the body – intravenously injected xenate is reduced to elemental xenon in about a minute.

<doc id="34141" wikidata="Q166005" url="?curid=34141" title="Xenophobia">
<text>Xenophobia (from (), &#x27;strange, foreign, or alien&#x27;, and (), &#x27;fear&#x27;) is the fear or dislike of anything that is perceived as being foreign or strange. It is an expression that is based on the perception that a conflict exists between an in-group and an out-group and it may manifest itself in suspicion of one group&#x27;s activities by members of the other group, a desire to eliminate the presence of the group that is the target of suspicion, and fear of losing a national, ethnic, or racial identity.

== Alternative definitions ==
A 1997 review article on xenophobia holds that it is &quot;an element of a political struggle about who has the right to be cared for by the state and society: a fight for the collective good of the modern state.&quot;

According to Italian sociologist Guido Bolaffi, xenophobia can also be exhibited as an &quot;uncritical exaltation of another culture&quot; which is ascribed &quot;an unreal, stereotyped and exotic quality&quot;.

== History ==

===Ancient Africa===
In Ancient Egypt, foreigners were conceived of through a complex xenophobic discourse. Given ancient Egypt&#x27;s long history, Egyptians encountered a number of different peoples. Peoples living in present-day Greece, Sudan, and Turkey, for instance, were referred to by various names in Egyptian. According to one source, &quot;...all the names have at the end the same hieroglyphic sign– a determinative or taxogram– indicating the word-group. This is the hieroglyph for a hilly country or the desert– indicating &#x27;foreign land&#x27; (khaset)...By contrast, Egypt (Kemet/Black land) is written with the determinative for a town. This indicates that Egyptians regarded their part of the world as cultivated, ordered and civilized, while the other countries were not.&quot; This indicates an early example of a xenophobic attitude towards other peoples. In addition, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics indicate xenophobic ideas about a necessity to conquer non-Egyptians, with Hittites in particular being referred to as &quot;vile&quot;.

===Ancient Europe===

An early example of xenophobic sentiment in Western culture is the Ancient Greek denigration of foreigners as &quot;barbarians&quot;, the belief that the Greek people and culture were superior to all other peoples and cultures, and the subsequent conclusion that barbarians were naturally meant to be enslaved.

Ancient Romans also held notions of superiority over other peoples. such as in a speech attributed to Manius Acilius:
Black Africans were considered especially exotic, and perhaps they were considered threateningly alien, so they are seldom if ever mentioned in Roman literature without some negative connotations. The historian Appian claims that the military commander Marcus Junius Brutus, before the battle of Philippi in 42BC, met an &#x27;Ethiopian&#x27; outside the gates of his camp: his soldiers instantly hacked the man to pieces, taking his appearance for a bad omen—to the superstitious Roman, black was the colour of death.&quot;

=== COVID-19 ===

The COVID-19 pandemic, which was first reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, led to an increase in acts and displays of Sinophobia, as well as prejudice, xenophobia, discrimination, violence, and racism against people of East Asian and Southeast Asian descent and appearance around the world. With the spread of the pandemic and the formation of COVID-19 hotspots, such as those in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, discrimination against people from these hotspots was reported.

== Regional manifestations ==

=== Americas ===
==== Brazil ====

Despite the majority of the country&#x27;s population being of mixed (Pardo), African, or indigenous heritage, depictions of non-European Brazilians on the programming of most national television networks is scarce and typically relegated for musicians/their shows. In the case of telenovelas, Brazilians of darker skin tone are typically depicted as housekeepers or in positions of lower socioeconomic standing.

==== Canada ====

Muslim and Sikh Canadians have faced racism and discrimination in recent years, especially since the 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. and the spillover effect of the United States&#x27; War on Terror. An increase in hate crimes targeting Ontario Muslims was reported after ISIS took responsibility for the November 2015 Paris attacks.

A 2016 survey from The Environics Institute, which was a follow-up to a study conducted 10 years prior, found that there may be discriminating attitudes that may be a residual of the effects of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. A poll in 2009 by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; revealed that 28% of Canadians viewed Islam favourably, and 30% viewed the Sikh religion favourably. 45% of respondents believed Islam encourages violence. In Quebec in particular, only 17% of respondents had a favourable view of Islam.

====Colombia====

According to the UNHCR, by June 2019, 1.3 million of the 4 million Venezuelan refugees were in Colombia. Because of their urgent situation, many migrants from Venezuela crossed the border illegally, indicating they had few opportunities to gain &quot;access to legal and other rights or basic services and are exposed to exploitation, abuse, manipulation and a wide range of other protection risks, including racism, discrimination and xenophobia&quot;. Since the start of the migrant crisis, media outlets and state officials have raised concerns about increasing discrimination against migrants in the country, especially xenophobia and violence against the migrants.

==== Guyana ====
There have been racial tension between the Indo-Guyanese people and the Afro-Guyanese.

==== Mexico ====

Racism in Mexico has a long history. Historically, Mexicans with light skin tones had absolute control over dark skinned Amerindians due to the structure of the Spanish colonial caste system. When a Mexican of a darker-skinned tone marries one of a lighter skinned-tone, it is common for them say that they are &#x27;making the race better&#x27; (&quot;mejorando la raza&quot;)&quot;. This can be interpreted as a self-attack on their ethnicity. Despite improving economic and social conditions of indigenous Mexicans, discrimination against them continues to this day and there are few laws to protect indigenous Mexicans from discrimination. Violent attacks against indigenous Mexicans are moderately common and many times go unpunished.

On 15 March 1911, a band of Maderista soldiers entered Torreón, Mexico, and massacred 303 Chinese and five Japanese. Historian Larissa Schwartz argues that Kang Youwei had successfully organized the prosperous Chinese businessmen there, making them a visible target for class antagonism made extreme by xenophobia.

The Chinese were easy to identify in northern cities and were frequent targets especially in Sonora in the 1930s. Systematic persecution resulted from economic, political, and psychological fears of the Chinese, and the government showed little interest in protecting them.

Theresa Alfaro-Velcamp argues that the Porfiriato, 1876–1910 promoted immigration from the Middle East. However the revolution of 1910–20 saw a surge in xenophobia and nationalism based on &quot;mestizaje.&quot; The community divided into the economically prosperous Lebanese Mexicans who took pride in a distinct Lebanese-Mexican identity, while the downscale remainder often merged into the mestizo community.

Racism against indigenous people has been a current problem in Mexico. Domestic workers, many of whom are indigenous women who have moved from rural villages to cities, often face discrimination including verbal, physical or sexual abuse.

==== Panama ====

Peter Szok argues that when the United States brought in large numbers of laborers from the Caribbean—called &quot;Afro-Panamanians&quot;—to build the Panama Canal (1905–1914), xenophobia emerged. The local elite in Panama felt its culture was threatened: they cried out, &quot;La Patria es el Recuerdo.&quot; (&quot;The Homeland is the Memory&quot;) and developed a Hispanophile elitist identity through an artistic literary movement known as &quot;Hispanismo.&quot; Another result was the election of the &quot;overtly nationalist and anti-imperialist&quot; Arnulfo Arias as president in 1940.

==== Venezuela ====
In Venezuela, like other South American countries, economic inequality often breaks along ethnic and racial lines. A 2013 Swedish academic study stated that Venezuela was the most racist country in the Americas, followed by the Dominican Republic.

==== United States ====
In a 2010 report, a network of more than 300 US-based civil rights and human rights organizations stated that &quot;Discrimination permeates all aspects of life in the United States, and it extends to all communities of color.&quot; Discrimination against racial, ethnic, and religious minorities is widely acknowledged, especially in the case of African Americans and African Diasporic peoples in the United States, as well as other ethnic groups.

Members of every major American ethnic and religious minority group have perceived discrimination in their dealings with members of other minority racial and religious groups. Philosopher Cornel West has argued that &quot;racism is an integral element within the very fabric of American culture and society. It is embedded in the country&#x27;s first collective definition, enunciated in its subsequent laws, and imbued in its dominant way of life.&quot;

A 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center suggested that 76% of black and Asian respondents had experienced some form of discrimination, at least from time to time. Studies which have been conducted by the &quot;PNAS&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot; have found that during traffic stops, officers spoke to black men in a less respectful tone than they spoke to white men and those same studies have also found that black drivers are more likely to be pulled over and searched by police than white drivers. Black people are also reportedly overrepresented as criminals in the media. In 2020 the COVID-19 epidemic was often blamed on China, leading to attacks on Chinese Americans. This represents a continuation of xenophobic attacks on Chinese Americans for 150 years.

=== Asia ===
==== Bhutan ====

In 1991–92, Bhutan is said to have deported between 10,000 and 100,000 ethnic Nepalis (Lhotshampa). The actual number of refugees who were initially deported is debated by both sides. In March 2008, this population began a multiyear resettlement in third countries including the U.S, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia.

==== China ====
=====The Boxers=====

The Boxer Rebellion was a violent anti-foreign, anti-Christian, and anti-imperialist uprising which occurred in China between 1899 and 1901. It was led by a new group, the ‘Militia United in Righteousness&#x27;, the group was popularly known as the &quot;Boxers&quot; because many of its members had practiced Chinese martial arts, at the time, these martial arts were popularly referred to as Chinese Boxing. After China&#x27;s defeat in war by Japan in 1895, villagers in North China feared the expansion of foreign spheres of influence and resented the extension of privileges to Christian missionaries. In a severe drought, Boxer violence spread across Shandong and the North China Plain, destroying foreign property, attacking or murdering Christian missionaries and Chinese Christians. In June 1900, Boxer fighters, convinced that they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on Beijing, and their slogan was &quot;Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners.&quot; Diplomats, missionaries, soldiers and some Chinese Christians took refuge in the diplomatic Legation Quarter. They were besieged for 55 days by the Imperial Army of the Chinese government and the Boxers. George Makari says that the Boxers, &quot;promoted a violent hatred of all those from other lands and made no effort to distinguish the beneficent from the rapacious ones... They were unabashedly xenophobic.&quot; The Boxers were overthrown by an Eight Nation Alliance of American, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Russian troops—20,000 in all—that invaded China to lift the siege in August 1900. The allies imposed the Boxer Protocol in 1901, with a massive annual cash indemnity to be paid by the Chinese government. The episode generated worldwide attention and denunciation of xenophobia.

===== Chinese nationalism and xenophobia =====
Historian Mary C. Wright has argued that the combination of Chinese nationalism and xenophobia had a major impact on the Chinese worldview in the first half of the 20th century. Examining the bitterness and hatred which existed towards Americans and Europeans in the decades before the Communist takeover in 1949, she argues:The crude fear of the white peril that the last imperial dynasty had been able to exploit in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 had been submerged but not overcome, and expanding special privileges of foreigners were irritants in increasingly wide spheres of Chinese life. These fears and irritations provided a mass sounding board for what otherwise might have been rather arid denunciations of imperialists. It is well to remember that both Nationalists and Communists have struck this note.

=====COVID-19=====
In China, xenophobia against non-Chinese residents has been inflamed by the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China, with foreigners being described as &quot;foreign garbage&quot; and targeted for &quot;disposal&quot;. Some black people in China were evicted from their homes by police and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus. Expressions of Chinese xenophobia and discriminatory practices, such as the exclusion of black customers from restaurants, were criticized by foreign governments and members of the diplomatic corps.

===== Hong Kong =====
Black people in Hong Kong have experienced negative comments and instances of discrimination in the job market and on public transport. Expats and South Asian minorities have faced increased xenophobia during the COVID-19 pandemic.

===== Persecution of Uighurs =====
Since 2017, China has come under intense international criticism for its treatment of one million Muslims (the majority of them are Uyghurs, a Turkic ethnic minority mostly in Xinjiang) who are being held in detention camps without any legal process. Critics of the policy have described it as the Sinicization of Xinjiang and some have also called it an ethnocide or a cultural genocide.

==== Indonesia ====
A number of discriminatory laws against Chinese Indonesians were enacted by the government of Indonesia. In 1959, President Sukarno approved PP 10/1959 that forced Chinese Indonesians to close their businesses in rural areas and relocate into urban areas. Moreover, political pressures in the 1970s and 1980s restricted the role of the Chinese Indonesian in politics, academics, and the military. As a result, they were thereafter constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In 1998, Indonesia riots over higher food prices and rumors of hoarding by merchants and shopkeepers often degenerated into anti-Chinese attacks.

Native Papuans in the country have faced racism, and several reports have accused Indonesia of committing a &quot;slow-motion genocide&quot; in West Papua. Hostility towards the LGBT community has been recently reported, especially in Aceh.

==== Japan ====
Japan had successfully isolated itself from the outside world, allowing anti-foreign sentiments and myths to multiply unchecked by actual observation. In 2005, a United Nations report expressed concerns about racism in Japan and it also stated that the government&#x27;s recognition of the depth of the problem was not total. The author of the report, Doudou Diène (Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights), concluded after a nine-day investigation that racial discrimination and xenophobia in Japan primarily affected three groups: national minorities, Latin Americans of Japanese descent, mainly Japanese Brazilians, and foreigners from poor countries. Surveys conducted in 2017 and 2019 have shown that 40 to nearly 50% of the foreigners who were surveyed have experienced some form of discrimination. Another report has also noted differences in how the media and some Japanese treat visitors from the West as compared to those from East Asia, with the latter being viewed much less positively than the former.

Japan accepted just 16 refugees in 1999, while the United States took in 85,010 for resettlement, according to the UNHCR. New Zealand, which is 30 times smaller than Japan, accepted 1,140 refugees in 1999. Just 305 persons were recognized as refugees by Japan from 1981, when Japan ratified the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, to 2002. Former Prime Minister Taro Aso called Japan a &quot;one race&quot; nation. A 2019 Ipsos poll also suggested that Japanese respondents had a relatively lower sympathy for refugees compared to most other countries in the survey.

Sharon Yoon and Yuki Asahina argue that Zaitokukai, a right-wing organization, succeeded in framing Korean minorities as undeserving recipients of Japanese welfare benefits. Even as Zaitokukai declined, the perceptions of a Korean internal threat powerfully influences public fears.

==== Malaysia ====

The racial tension between the dominant poor Malay Muslims and the minority wealthier Chinese has long characterized Malaysia. It was a major factor in the separation of Singapore in 1965 to become an independent, primarily Chinese nation. Amy L. Freedman points to the electoral system, the centrality of ethnic parties, gerrymandering, and systematic discrimination against the Chinese in education and jobs as critical factors in xenophobia. Recently the goal of creating a more inclusive national identity has been emphasized.

In Malaysia, xenophobia occurs regardless of race. Most xenophobia is towards foreign labourers, who normally came from Indonesia, Bangladesh and Africa. There is also a significant degree of xenophobia towards neighbouring Singaporeans and Indonesians.

==== South Korea ====

Xenophobia in South Korea has been recognized by scholars and the United Nations as a widespread social problem. An increase in immigration to South Korea since the 2000s catalyzed more overt expressions of racism, as well as criticism of those expressions. Newspapers have frequently reported on and criticized discrimination against immigrants, in forms such as being paid lower than the minimum wage, having their wages withheld, unsafe work conditions, physical abuse, or general denigration.

After 2010, xenophobia became increasingly prevalent in the widely used social media. Jiyeon Kang reports a common pattern scapegoating dark-skinned migrants by gender, race and class. They are presented as accomplices and beneficiaries of the elite coalition allegedly taking traditional rights away from South Korean male citizens.

In a 2010–2014 World Values Survey, 44.2% of South Koreans reported they would not want an immigrant or foreign worker as a neighbor. Racist attitudes are more commonly expressed towards immigrants from other Asian countries and Africa, and less so towards European and white North American immigrants who can occasionally receive what has been described as &quot;overly kind treatment&quot;. Related discrimination have also been reported with regards to mixed-race children, Chinese Korean, and North Korean immigrants.

==== Philippines ====

==== Thailand ====
There are no laws within the Kingdom of Thailand which criminalize racial discrimination and the use of racist cliches. Unlike neighboring nations which were colonized, Thailand&#x27;s history as an uncolonized state further shaped its existing laws.

Anti-refugee sentiment has been significant in Thailand, with a 2016 Amnesty International survey indicating that 74% of surveyed Thais do not believe (to varying degrees) that people should be able to take refuge in other countries to escape war or persecution.

===Middle East===

In 2008, a Pew Research Center survey found that negative views concerning Jews were most common in the three predominantly Arab nations which were polled, with 97% of Lebanese having an unfavorable opinion of Jews, 95% of Egyptians and 96% of Jordanians.

==== Egypt ====
The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Mahdi Akef has denounced what he called &quot;the myth of the Holocaust&quot; in defense of the former-Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s denial of it. In an article in October 2000 columnist Adel Hammoda alleged in the state-owned Egyptian newspaper &quot;al-Ahram&quot; that Jews make Matza from the blood of non-Jewish children (see Blood libel). Mohammed Salmawy, the editor of &quot;Al-Ahram Hebdo&quot;, &quot;defended the use of old European myths like the blood libel against Jews&quot; in his newspapers.

==== Jordan ====
Jordan does not allow entry to Jews who have visible signs of Judaism or possess personal religious items. The Jordanian ambassador to Israel replied to a complaint by a religious Jew who was denied entry by stating that security concerns required that travelers who are entering the Hashemite Kingdom should not do so with prayer shawls (Tallit) and phylacteries (Tefillin). Jordanian authorities state that the policy is to ensure the Jewish tourists&#x27; safety.

In July 2009, six Breslov Hasidim were deported after attempting to enter Jordan to visit the tomb of Aaron / Sheikh Harun on Mount Hor, near Petra. The group had taken a ferry from Sinai, Egypt because they understood that Jordanian authorities were making it hard for visible Jews to enter their country from Israel.

==== Israel ====

According to the 2004 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, the Israeli government had done &quot;little to reduce institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country&#x27;s Arab citizens.&quot; The 2005 US Department of State report on Israel wrote: &quot;[T]he government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas, including... institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country&#x27;s Arab citizens.&quot; 

The 2010 U.S. State Department Country Report stated that Israeli law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, and the Israeli government effectively enforced these prohibitions. Former Likud MK and Minister of Defense Moshe Arens has criticized the treatment of minorities in Israel, saying that they did not bear the full obligation of Israeli citizenship, nor were they extended the full privileges of citizenship.

The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) published reports which documented racism in Israel, and the 2007 report suggested that anti-Arab racism was increasing in the country. One analysis of the report summarized it thus: &quot;Over two-thirds of Israeli teens believe that Arabs are less intelligent, uncultured and violent. The Israeli government spokesman responded that the Israeli government was &quot;committed to fighting racism whenever it raises its ugly head and is committed to full equality to all Israeli citizens, irrespective of ethnicity, creed or background, as defined by our declaration of independence&quot;. Isi Leibler of the Jerusalem Center for Public affairs argues that Israeli Jews are troubled by &quot;increasingly hostile, even treasonable outbursts by Israeli Arabs against the state&quot; while it is at war with neighboring countries. Khaled Diab of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2012 that demonisation was a two-way street, with Palestinians in Israel reportedly holding negative stereotypes of Israelis as devious, violent, cunning and untrustworthy.

A 2018 poll by Pew Research Center also suggested there to be particularly widespread anti-refugee sentiment among surveyed Israelis compared to the people from other selected countries. Israeli people also have a long history of discrimination towards Palestinians

==== Kuwait ====
In April 2020, an actress said on Kuwaiti TV that migrants should be thrown out &quot;into the desert&quot;, amidst reported exploitation of foreign labourers in the country. Reports of Sierra Leonean, Indonesian and Nepalese workers suffering abuse in Kuwait have prompted the 3 countries&#x27; governments to ban its citizens from being employed as domestic workers there. Expat surveys done by InterNations have ranked the country amongst the most unfriendly for expatriates.

==== Lebanon ====
Hezbollah&#x27;s Al-Manar TV channel has often been accused of airing antisemitic broadcasts, accusing the Jews/Zionists of conspiring against the Arab world, and frequently airing excerpts from &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, which the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes as a &quot;fraudulent document which served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century&quot;. In another incident, an Al-Manar commentator recently referred to &quot;Zionist attempts to transmit AIDS to Arab countries&quot;. Al-Manar officials denied broadcasting any antisemitic incitement and they also stated that their group&#x27;s position is anti-Israeli, not antisemitic. However, Hezbollah has directed strong rhetoric against both Israel and Jews, and it has cooperated in publishing and distributing outright antisemitic literature. The government of Lebanon has not criticized Hezbollah&#x27;s continued broadcast of antisemitic material on television.

There are also substantial accounts of abuses against migrant domestic workers in Lebanon, notably from Ethiopia, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and other countries in Asia and Africa, exacerbated by the Kafala system, or &quot;sponsorship system&quot;. Increases in abuse occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==== Palestine ====
Various Palestinian organizations and individuals have been regularly accused of being antisemitic. Howard Gutman believes that much of Muslim hatred of Jews stems from the ongoing Arab–Israeli conflict and that peace would significantly reduce antisemitism.

Anti-US and anti-Israeli sentiment had led some Palestinians to support the 2001 September 11 attacks in New York. In August 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper &quot;Al-Risala&quot;:It is no longer a secret that the Zionists were behind the Nazis&#x27; murder of many Jews, and agreed to it, with the aim of intimidating them and forcing them to immigrate to Palestine. In August 2009, Hamas refused to allow Palestinian children to learn about the Holocaust, which it called &quot;a lie invented by the Zionists&quot; and referred to Holocaust education as a &quot;war crime&quot;. A 2016 Gallup International poll had roughly 74% of Palestinian respondents agreeing there was religious superiority, 78% agreeing there was racial superiority, and 76% agreeing there was cultural superiority. The percentages were among the highest out of 66 nations surveyed.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
Racism in Saudi Arabia is practiced against labor workers who are foreigners, mostly from developing countries.
Asian maids who work in the country have been victims of racism and other forms of discrimination, foreign workers have been raped, exploited, under- or unpaid, physically abused, overworked and locked in their places of employment. The international organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) describes these conditions as &quot;near-slavery&quot; and attributes them to &quot;deeply rooted gender, religious, and racial discrimination&quot;. In many cases the workers are unwilling to report their employers for fear of losing their jobs or further abuse.

There were several cases of antisemitism in Saudi Arabia and it is common within the country&#x27;s religious circles. The Saudi Arabian media often attacks Jews in books, in news articles, in its Mosques and with what some describe as antisemitic satire. Saudi Arabian government officials and state religious leaders often promote the idea that Jews are conspiring to take over the entire world; as proof of their claims they publish and frequently cite &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; as factual.

=== Europe ===
A study that ran from 2002 to 2015 mapped the countries in Europe with the highest incidents of racial bias towards black people, based on data from 288,076 white Europeans. It used the Implicit-association test (a reaction-based psychological test designed to measure implicit racial bias). The strongest bias was found in Czech Republic, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Malta, Moldova, Bulgaria, Italy, Slovakia, and Portugal. A 2017 report by the University of Oslo Center for Research on Extremism tentatively suggests that &quot;individuals of Muslim background stand out among perpetrators of antisemitic violence in Western Europe&quot;.

Negative views of Muslims have varied across different parts of Europe, and Islamophobic hate crimes have been reported across the region. A 2017 Chatham House poll of more than 10,000 people in 10 European countries had on average 55% agreeing that all further migration from Muslim-majority countries should be stopped, while 20% disagreed. Majority opposition was found in Poland (71%), Austria (65%), Belgium (64%), Hungary (64%), France (61%), Greece (58%), Germany (53%), and Italy (51%).
==== Belgium ====

There were recorded well over a hundred antisemitic attacks in Belgium in 2009. This was a 100% increase from the year before. The perpetrators were usually young males of immigrant background from the Middle East. In 2009, the Belgian city of Antwerp, often referred to as Europe&#x27;s last shtetl, experienced a surge in antisemitic violence. Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam resident and Auschwitz survivor, was quoted in the newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot; in 2010: &quot;The antisemitism now is even worse than before the Holocaust. The antisemitism has become more violent. Now they are threatening to kill us.&quot;

==== France ====
In 2004, France experienced rising levels of Islamic antisemitism and acts that were publicized around the world. In 2006, rising levels of antisemitism were recorded in French schools. Reports related to the tensions between the children of North African Muslim immigrants and North African Jewish children. The climax was reached when Ilan Halimi was tortured to death by the so-called &quot;Barbarians gang&quot;, led by Youssouf Fofana. In 2007, over 7,000 members of the community petitioned for asylum in the United States, citing antisemitism in France.

In the first half of 2009, an estimated 631 recorded acts of antisemitism took place in France, more than the whole of 2008. Speaking to the World Jewish Congress in December 2009, the French Interior Minister Hortefeux described the acts of antisemitism as &quot;a poison to our republic&quot;. He also announced that he would appoint a special coordinator for fighting racism and antisemitism.

==== Germany ====
The period after Germany&#x27;s loss of World War I led to the increased espousal of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the country&#x27;s political discourse, for example, emotions which were initially expressed by members of the right-wing Freikorps finally culminated in the ascent of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in 1933. The Nazi Party&#x27;s racial policy and the Nuremberg Race Laws against Jews and other non-Aryans represented the most explicit racist policies in twentieth century Europe. These laws deprived all Jews (including half-Jews and quarter-Jews) and all other non-Aryans of German citizenship. The official title of Jews became &quot;subjects of the state&quot;. At first, the Nuremberg Race Laws only forbade racially mixed sexual relationships and marriages between Aryans and Jews but later they were extended to &quot;Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring&quot;. Such interracial relationships were known as &quot;racial pollution&quot; Rassenschande, and they became a criminal and punishable offence under the race laws. The Nazi racial theory regarded Poles and other Slavic peoples as racially inferior &quot;Untermenschen&quot;. Nazi Germany&#x27;s Directive No.1306 stated: &quot;Polishness equals subhumanity. Poles, Jews and gypsies are on the same inferior level.&quot;

After the 1950s the steady arrival of Turkish workers led to xenophobia.

According to a 2012 survey, 18% of Turks in Germany believe that Jews are inferior human beings.

==== Hungary ====
Anti-refugee sentiment has been strong in Hungary, and Hungarian authorities along the border have been accused of detaining migrants under harsh conditions with some reported instances of beatings and other violence from the guards. Surveys from Pew Research Center have also suggested that negative views of refugees and Muslims are held by the majority of the country&#x27;s locals.

As in other European countries, the Romani people faced disadvantages, including unequal treatment, discrimination, segregation and harassment. Negative stereotypes are often linked to Romani unemployment and reliance on state benefits. In 2008 and 2009 nine attacks took place against Romani in Hungary, resulting in six deaths and multiple injuries. According to the Hungarian curia (supreme court), these murders were motivated by anti-Romani sentiment and sentenced the perpetrators to life imprisonment.

==== Italy ====
A new party emerged in the 1980s, Lega Nord. According to Gilda Zazzara, it started with identity-based claims and secessionist proposals for the north to break away from southern Italy. It shifted to xenophobia and the demand that job priority be accorded to native Italian workers.

Anti-Romani sentiment in Italy takes the form of hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed at Romani people. There&#x27;s no reliable data for the total number of Roma people living in Italy, but estimates put it between 140,000 and 170,000. Many national and local political leaders engaged in rhetoric during 2007 and 2008 that maintained that the extraordinary rise in crime at the time was mainly a result of uncontrolled immigration of people of Roma origin from recent European Union member state Romania. National and local leaders declared their plans to expel Roma from settlements in and around major cities and to deport illegal immigrants. The mayors of Rome and Milan signed &quot;Security Pacts&quot; in May 2007 that &quot;envisaged the forced eviction of up to 10,000 Romani people&quot;.

According to a May 2008 poll 68% of Italians, wanted to see all of the country&#x27;s approximately 150,000 Gypsies, many of them Italian citizens, expelled. The survey, published as mobs in Naples burned down Gypsy camps that month, revealed that the majority also wanted all Gypsy camps in Italy to be demolished.

==== Netherlands ====

The first example for xenophobic riot in the Netherlands were the riots in Afrikaanderwijk, in which the houses of Turkish people were attacked and windows were smashed.

In early 2012 the Dutch right-wing Party for Freedom established an anti-Slavic (predominantly anti-Polish) and anti-Romani website, where native Dutch people could air their frustration about losing their job because of cheaper workers from Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and other non-Germanic Central and Eastern European countries. This led to commentaries involving hate speech and other racial prejudice mainly against Poles and Roma, but also aimed at other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups. According to a 2015 report by the OECD and EU Commission, 37% of young people born in the country with immigrant parents say they had experienced discrimination in their lives.

In the Netherlands, antisemitic incidents, from verbal abuse to violence, are reported, allegedly connected with Islamic youth, mostly boys of Moroccan descent. A phrase made popular during football matches against the so-called Jewish football club Ajax has been adopted by Muslim youth and is frequently heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations: &quot;Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!&quot; According to the Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel, a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, in 2009, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in Amsterdam, the city that is home to most of the approximately 40,000 Dutch Jews, doubled compared to 2008.

==== Norway ====

In 2010, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among Norwegian Muslims. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often &quot;praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews&quot;, that &quot;Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students,&quot; and &quot;Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the Holocaust.&quot; Additionally that &quot;while some students might protest when some express support for terrorism, none object when students express hate of Jews&quot; and that it says in &quot;the Quran that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews.&quot; Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One Jewish father also told that his child after school had been taken by a Muslim mob (though managed to escape), reportedly &quot;to be taken out to the forest and hanged because he was a Jew&quot;.

==== Russia ====

Lien Verpoest explores the era of the Napoleonic wars to identify the formation of conservative ideas ranging from traditionalism to ardent patriotism and xenophobia. Conservatives generally controlled Russia in the 19th century, and imposed xenophobia in education and the academy. In the late 19th century, especially after nationalistic uprisings in Poland in the 1860s, the government displayed xenophobia in its hostility toward ethnic minorities that did not speak Russian. The decision was to reduce the use of other languages, and insist on Russification.

By the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called Pale of Settlement, the Western frontier of the Russian Empire consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions. Many pogroms accompanied the Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War, an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former Russian Empire; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.

During the civil war era (1917–1922) both the Bolsheviks and the Whites employed nationalism and xenophobia as weapons to delegitimise the opposition.

After World War II official national policy was to bring in students from Communist countries in East Europe and Asia for advanced training in Communist leadership roles. These students encountered severe xenophobia on campus. They survived by sticking together, but developed a hostility toward the Soviet leadership. Even after the fall of Communism foreign students faced hostility on campus.

In the 2000s, &quot;skinheads&quot; were especially visible in attacking anything foreign. Racism against both the Russian citizens (peoples of the Caucasus, indigenous peoples of Siberia and Russian Far East, etc.) and non-Russian citizens of Africans, Central Asians, East Asians (Vietnamese, Chinese, etc.) and Europeans (Ukrainians, etc.) became a significant factor.

Using surveys from 1996, 2004, and 2012, Hannah S. Chapman, et al. reports a steady increase in Russians&#x27; negative attitudes toward seven outgroups. Muscovites especially became more xenophobic. In 2016, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that &quot;Researchers who track xenophobia in Russia have recorded an &quot;impressive&quot; decrease in hate crimes as the authorities appear to have stepped up pressure on far-right groups&quot;. David Barry uses surveys to investigate the particularistic and xenophobic belief that all citizens should join Russia&#x27;s dominant Orthodox religion. It is widespread among ethnic Russians and is increasing.

A 2016 GlobeScan/BBC World Service poll found that 79% of Russian respondents disapproved of accepting Syrian refugees, the highest percentage out of 18 countries surveyed.

==== Sweden ====

A government study in 2006 estimated that 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims &quot;harbour systematic antisemitic views&quot;. The former prime minister Göran Persson described these results as &quot;surprising and terrifying&quot;. However, the rabbi of Stockholm&#x27;s Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said, &quot;It&#x27;s not true to say that the Swedes are antisemitic. Some of them are hostile to Israel because they support the weak side, which they perceive the Palestinians to be.&quot;

In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk told &quot;Die Presse&quot;, an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being &quot;harassed and physically attacked&quot; by &quot;people from the Middle East&quot;, although he added that only a small number of Malmö&#x27;s 40,000 Muslims &quot;exhibit hatred of Jews&quot;. Sieradzk also stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malmö to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment. Also in March, the Swedish newspaper &quot;Skånska Dagbladet&quot; reported that attacks on Jews in Malmö totaled 79 in 2009, about twice as many as the previous year, according to police statistics. In December 2010, the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express &quot;extreme caution&quot; when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens by Muslims in the city of Malmö.

==== Ukraine ====

Israel&#x27;s Antisemitism Report for 2017 stated that &quot;A striking exception in the trend of decrease in antisemitic incidents in Eastern Europe was Ukraine, where the number of recorded antisemitic attacks was doubled from last year and surpassed the tally for all the incidents reported throughout the entire region combined.&quot; Ukrainian state historian, Vladimir Vyatrovich dismissed the Israeli report as anti-Ukrainian propaganda and a researcher of antisemitism from Ukraine, Vyacheslav Likhachev said the Israeli report was flawed and amateurish.
====United Kingdom====
The extent and the targets of xenophobic attitudes in the United Kingdom have varied over time. It has resulted in cases of discrimination, riots and racially motivated murders. Racism and Xenophobia were mitigated by the attitudes and norms of the British class system during the 19th century, in which race and nationality mattered less than social distinction: a black African tribal chief was unquestionably superior to a white English costermonger. Use of the word &quot;racism&quot; became more widespread after 1936, although the term &quot;race hatred&quot; was used in the late 1920s by sociologist Frederick Hertz. Laws, including the Race Relations Act 1965, were passed in the 1960s that specifically prohibited racial discrimination.

At the 1517 Evil May Day riots in London, protestors attacked the prominence of foreigners in London wool and cloth businesses; historians have called the event xenophobic.

Bernard Porter argues that Anti-black and anti-Indian themes waxed strong in the late 19th century, not only because of racism but also because of rebellious episodes in the British Empire in Africa and India, empire. Xenophobia in popular literature targeted Germans in the early 20th centuries, based on fears of militarism and espionage.

According to scholar Julia Lovell, there has been a history of sinophobia dating back to the early 20th century, propagated by writers like Charles Dickens, which has endured to the present day with current media depictions of China.

Racism has been observed as having a correlation between factors such as levels of unemployment and immigration in an area. Some studies suggest Brexit led to a rise in racist incidents, where locals became hostile to foreigners.

Studies published in 2014 and 2015 suggested that racism was on the rise in the UK, with more than one third of those polled admitting they were racially prejudiced. However a 2019 EU survey, &quot;Being Black in the EU&quot;, ranked the UK as the least racist in the 12 Western European countries surveyed.

Sectarianism between Ulster Protestants and Irish Catholics in Northern Ireland has been called a form of racism by some international bodies. It has resulted in widespread discrimination, segregation and serious violence, especially during partition and the Troubles.

During the acrimonious Brexit debate, xenophobia increased in London, especially against French living in the city.

=== Africa ===
==== Ivory Coast ====
Ivory Coast has an history of ethnic tribal hatred and religious intolerance. In addition to the many victims among the various tribes of the northern and southern regions of the country that have perished in the ongoing conflict, white foreigners residing or visiting Ivory Coast have also been subjected to violent attacks. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the Ivory Coast government is guilty of fanning ethnic hatred for its own political ends.

In 2004, the Young Patriots of Abidjan, a strongly nationalist organisation, rallied by the state media, plundered possessions of foreign nationals in Abidjan. Calls for violence against whites and non-Ivorians were broadcast on national radio and TV after the Young Patriots seized control of its offices. Rapes, beatings, and murders of persons of European and Lebanese descent followed. Thousands of expatriates and white or ethnic Lebanese Ivorians fled the country. The attacks drew international condemnation.

==== Mauritania ====
Slavery in Mauritania persists despite its abolition in 1980 and mostly affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into slavery who now live in Mauritania as &quot;black Moors&quot; or &quot;haratin&quot; and who partially still serve the &quot;white Moors&quot;, or &quot;bidhan&quot;, as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the &quot;haratin&quot; lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide remains.

==== Niger ====
In October 2006, Niger announced that it would deport to Chad the &quot;Diffa Arabs&quot;, Arabs living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger. Their population numbered about 150,000. While the government was rounding up Arabs in preparation for the deportation, two girls died, reportedly after fleeing government forces, and three women suffered miscarriages. Niger&#x27;s government eventually suspended their controversial decision to deport the Arabs.

==== South Africa ====

Xenophobia in South Africa has been present in both the apartheid and post–apartheid eras. Hostility between the British and Boers exacerbated by the Second Boer War led to rebellion by poor Afrikaners who looted British-owned shops. South Africa also passed numerous acts intended to keep out Indians, such as the Immigrants Regulation Act of 1913, which provided for the exclusion of &quot;undesirables&quot;, a group of people that included Indians. This effectively halted Indian immigration. The Township Franchise Ordinance of 1924 was intended to &quot;deprive Indians of municipal franchise&quot;. Xenophobic attitudes toward the Chinese have also been present, sometimes in the form of robberies or hijackings, and a hate speech case in 2018 was put to court the year later with 11 offenders on trial.

In 1994 and 1995, gangs of armed youth destroyed the homes of foreign nationals living in Johannesburg, demanding that the police work to repatriate them to their home countries.
In 2008, a widely documented spate of xenophobic attacks occurred in Johannesburg. It is estimated that tens of thousands of migrants were displaced; property, businesses and homes were widely looted. The death toll after the attack stood at 56.

In 2015, another widely documented series of xenophobic attacks occurred in South Africa, mostly against migrant Zimbabweans. This followed remarks by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu stating that the migrants should &quot;pack their bags and leave&quot;. As of 20 April 2015, 7 people had died and more than 2000 foreigners had been displaced.

Following the riots and murders of other Africans from 2008 and 2015, violence again broke out in 2019.

==== Sudan ====
In the Sudan, black African captives in the civil war were often enslaved, and female prisoners were often abused sexually, with their Arab captors claiming that Islamic law grants them permission. According to CBS News, slaves have been sold for US$50 apiece. In September 2000, the U.S. State Department alleged that &quot;the Sudanese government&#x27;s support of slavery and its continued military action which has resulted in numerous deaths are due in part to the victims&#x27; religious beliefs.&quot; Jok Madut Jok, professor of history at Loyola Marymount University, states that the abduction of women and children of the south is slavery by any definition. The government of Sudan insists that the whole matter is no more than the traditional tribal feuding over resources.

==== Uganda ====

Former British colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa have many citizens of South Asian descent. They were brought by the British Empire from British India to do clerical work in imperial service. The most prominent case of anti-Indian racism was the ethnic cleansing of the Indian (called Asian) minority in Uganda by the strongman dictator and human rights violator Idi Amin.

=== Oceania ===
==== Australia ====
The Immigration Restriction Act 1901 (White Australia policy) effectively barred people of non-European descent from immigrating to Australia. There was never any specific policy titled &quot;White Australia.&quot; The term was invented later to encapsulate a collection of policies that were designed to exclude people from Asia (particularly China) and the Pacific Islands (particularly Melanesia) from immigrating to Australia.

The Menzies and Holt governments effectively dismantled the policies between 1949 and 1966 and the Whitlam government passed laws to ensure that race would be totally disregarded as a component for immigration to Australia in 1973.

The 2005 Cronulla riots were a series of race riots and outbreaks of mob violence in Sydney&#x27;s southern suburb Cronulla which resulted from strained relations between Anglo-Celtic and (predominantly Muslim) Lebanese Australians. Travel warnings for Australia were issued by some countries but were later removed. In December 2005, a fight broke out between a group of volunteer surf lifesavers and Lebanese youth. These incidents were considered to be a key factor in a racially motivated confrontation the following weekend. Violence spread to other southern suburbs of Sydney, where more assaults occurred, including two stabbings and attacks on ambulances and police officers.

On 30 May 2009, Indian students protested against what they claimed were racist attacks, blocking streets in central Melbourne. Thousands of students gathered outside the Royal Melbourne Hospital where one of the victims was admitted. In light of this event, the Australian Government started a Helpline for Indian students to report such incidents. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, termed these attacks &quot;disturbing&quot; and called for Australia to investigate the matters further.

<text>X, or x, is the twenty-fourth letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is (pronounced ), plural &quot;exes&quot;.

==History==

The letter , representing , was inherited from the Etruscan alphabet. It perhaps originated in the of the Euboean alphabet or another Western Greek alphabet, which also represented . Its relationship with the of the Eastern Greek alphabets, which represented , is uncertain.

The pronunciation of in the Romance languages underwent sound changes, with various outcomes:
* French: (e.g. &quot;laisser&quot; from &quot;laxare&quot;)
* Italian: (e.g. &quot;asse&quot; from &quot;axem&quot;) and, in some cases, (e.g. &quot;lasciare&quot; from &quot;laxare&quot;)
* Portuguese: (e.g. &quot;eixo&quot; from &quot;axem&quot;)
* Romanian: (e.g. &quot;coapsă&quot; from &quot;coxa&quot;) and (e.g. &quot;lăsa&quot; from &quot;laxare&quot;)
* Old Spanish: 
** Spanish: (e.g. &quot;cuja&quot; from &quot;coxa&quot;)
In Old Spanish, came to represent , which it still represents in most Iberian languages and in the orthographies of other languages influenced by Spanish, such as Nahuatl. In French (with a few exceptions), Italian, Romanian, and modern Spanish, was replaced by other letters.

The use of to represent was reintroduced to the Romance languages via Latin loanwords. In many words, the was voiced as .

== Use in writing systems ==
===English===
In English orthography, is typically pronounced as the voiceless consonant cluster when it follows the stressed vowel (e.g. &quot;ox&quot;), and the voiced consonant when it precedes the stressed vowel (e.g. &quot;exam&quot;). It is also pronounced when it precedes a silent and a stressed vowel (e.g. &quot;exhaust&quot;). Due to yod-coalescence, the sequence before a vowel can be pronounced resulting from earlier , e.g. in &quot;-xion(-)&quot;, &quot;-xious(-)&quot;. Similarly, the sequence can be pronounced with (e.g. &quot;flexure&quot;, &quot;sexual&quot;) or (in &quot;luxury&quot; and its derivatives). Due to NG-coalescence, the sequence can be pronounced in &quot;anxiety&quot;.

When ends a word, it is always (e.g. &quot;fax&quot;), except in loan words such as &quot;faux&quot;. When does start a word, it is usually pronounced &#x27;z&#x27; (e.g. &quot;xylophone&quot;, &quot;xanthan&quot;). When starting in some names or as its own representation, it is pronounced &#x27;eks&#x27;, in rare recent loanwords or foreign proper names, it can also be pronounced (e.g. the obsolete Vietnamese monetary unit &quot;&quot;) or (e.g. Chinese names starting with &quot;Xi&quot;, like Xiaomi or Xinjiang). Many of the words that start with are of Greek origin, standardized trademarks (&quot;Xerox&quot;), or acronyms (&quot;XC&quot;).

In abbreviations, it can represent &quot;trans-&quot; (e.g. &quot;XMIT&quot; for transmit, &quot;XFER&quot; for transfer), &quot;cross-&quot; (e.g. &quot;X-ing&quot; for crossing, &quot;XREF&quot; for cross-reference), &quot;Christ-&quot; (e.g. &quot;Xmas&quot; for Christmas, &quot;Xian&quot; for Christian), the &quot;crys-&quot; in crystal (&quot;XTAL&quot;), &quot;by&quot; (&quot;SXSW&quot; for South by Southwest), or various words starting with &quot;ex-&quot; (e.g. &quot;XL&quot; for extra large, &quot;XOR&quot; for exclusive-or, or the extinction symbol).

X is the third least frequently used letter in English (after and ), with a frequency of about 0.15% in words. There are very few English words that start with (the fewest of any letter).

===Romance languages===
In Latin, stood for . In the Romance languages, as a result of assorted phonetic changes, has other pronunciations:
*In Catalan, has three pronunciations; the most common is ; as in &quot;xarop&quot; (&#x27;syrup&#x27;). Others are: ; &quot;fixar&quot; (&#x27;to fix&#x27;), ; &quot;examen&quot;. In addition, gets voiced to before voiced consonants; &quot;caixmir&quot;. Catalan also has the digraph , pronounced .
*In Galician and Leonese, is pronounced in most cases (often used in place of etymological &quot;g&quot; or &quot;j&quot;). The pronunciation occurs in learned words, such as &#x27;&quot;taxativo&quot;&#x27; (taxing). However, Galician speakers tend to pronounce it , especially when it appears before plosives, such as in &quot;externo&quot; (&#x27;external&#x27;).
*In French, usually represents or (primarily in words beginning with ex- followed by a vowel) . It is pronounced in some city names such as &quot;Bruxelles&quot; (although some people pronounce it &#x27;ks&#x27;) or &quot;Auxerre&quot;; it is nevertheless pronounced in Aix, the name of several towns. At the ends of other words, it is silent (or in liaison if the next word starts with a vowel). Two exceptions are pronounced : &quot;six&quot; (&#x27;six&#x27;) and &quot;dix&quot; (&#x27;ten&#x27;). It is pronounced in &quot;sixième&quot; and &quot;dixième&quot;.
*In Italian, is either pronounced , as in &quot;extra&quot;, &quot;uxorio&quot;, &quot;xilofono&quot;, or , as in &quot;exogamia&quot;, when it is preceded by and followed by a vowel. In several related languages, notably Venetian, it represents the voiced sibilant . It is also used, mainly amongst young people, as a short written form for &quot;per&quot; (meaning &quot;for&quot;); for example, &quot;x sempre&quot; (&quot;forever&quot;). This is because in Italian, the multiplication sign is called &quot;per&quot;. However, is found only in loanwords, as it is not part of the standard Italian alphabet; in most words with , this letter may be replaced with &#x27;s&#x27; or &#x27;ss&#x27; (with different pronunciation: &quot;xilofono&quot;/&quot;silofono&quot;, &quot;taxi&quot;/&quot;tassì&quot;) or, rarely, by &#x27;cs&#x27; (with the same pronunciation: &quot;claxon&quot;/&quot;clacson&quot;).
*In Portuguese, has four main pronunciations; the most common is , as in &quot;xícara&quot; (&#x27;cup&#x27;). The other sounds are: as in &quot;flexão&quot; (&#x27;flexion&#x27;); , when preceded by E and followed by a consonant, as in &quot;contexto&quot; ( in European Portuguese), and in a small number of other words, such as &quot;próximo&quot; (close/next); and (the rarest) , which occurs in the prefix &quot;ex-&quot; before a vowel, as in &quot;exagerado&quot; (&#x27;exaggerated&#x27;). A rare fifth sound is , coexisting with and as acceptable pronunciations in &quot;exantema&quot; and in words with the Greek prefix &#x27;hexa-&#x27;.
*In Sardinian and Ligurian, represents .
*In Old Spanish, was pronounced , as it is still currently in other Iberian Romance languages. Later, the sound evolved to a sound. In modern Spanish, due to a spelling reform, whenever is used for the sound it has been replaced with , including in words that originally had such as &quot;ejemplo&quot; or &quot;ejercicio&quot;, though is still retained for some names (notably &quot;México&quot;, even though &quot;Méjico&quot; may sometimes be used in Spain). Presently, represents the sound (word-initially), or the consonant cluster (e.g. &quot;oxígeno&quot;, &quot;examen&quot;). Rarely, it can be pronounced as in Old Spanish in some proper nouns such as &quot;Raxel&quot; (a variant of &quot;Rachel&quot;) and &quot;Uxmal&quot;.
*In Venetian, represents the voiced alveolar sibilant , much like in Portuguese &#x27;exagerado&#x27;, English &#x27;xylophone&#x27; or in the French &#x27;sixième&#x27;. Examples from medieval texts include &quot;raxon&quot; (&#x27;reason&#x27;), &quot;prexon&quot; (&#x27;prison&#x27;), &quot;dexerto&quot; (&#x27;desert&#x27;), and &quot;chaxa&quot; or &quot;caxa&quot; (&#x27;home&#x27;). Nowadays, the best-known word is &quot;xe&quot; (is/are). The most notable exception to this rule is the name &quot;Venexia&quot;, , in which has evolved from the initial voiced sibilant to the present-day voiceless sibilant .

===Other languages===
In languages which adopted the Latin alphabet later, is used for various sounds, in some cases inspired by Latin or its descendants, but in others for unrelated consonants. Since the various Romance pronunciations of can often be written in other ways, the letter becomes available for other sounds.
*In Albanian, represents while the digraph represents .
*It represents (voiceless velar fricative) in Apache, Azerbaijani, Kurdish (Hawar alphabet), Georgian (when Latinized), Lojban, Pashto (when Latinized), Tatar (Jaꞑalif, Zamanälif, official romanization of 2012), Uzbek, and Uyghur (Latin script).
*In Basque, represents . Additionally, the digraph represents .
*In Hanyu Pinyin, Standard Chinese&#x27;s official transcription system in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan, the letter represents the voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative , for instance in &#x27;Xi&#x27;, .
*In Dutch, usually represents , except in the name of the island of Texel, which is pronounced &quot;Tessel&quot;. This is because of historical sound-changes in Dutch, where all sounds have been replaced by sounds. Words with an in the Dutch language are nowadays usually loanwords. In the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, family names with are not uncommon (e.g. &quot;Dierckxa&quot; and &quot;Hendrickx&quot;).
*In Esperanto, the x-convention replaces , , , , , and with x-suffixes: , , , , , and .
*In German, generally pronounced ; in native words, however, such as &quot;Ochs&quot; or &quot;wachsen&quot;, the cluster is often written .
*In transliterations of Indian languages, primarily Indo-Aryan languages, represents the consonant cluster in alternate spellings of words containing &#x27;क्ष&#x27; (kṣ), especially names such as Laxmi and Dixit. Less frequently, is used to represent &#x27;ख़&#x27; .
*In Lao, based on romanization of Lao consonants, represents , while appears to be homophonous with , it is a &quot;low consonant&quot; and affects the tone of the following vowel, e.g. in Lan Xang.
*In Maltese, is pronounced or, in some cases, (only in loanwords such as &#x27;televixin&#x27;, and not for all speakers).
*In Nahuatl, represents .
*In Nguni languages, represents the alveolar lateral click .
*In Norwegian, is generally pronounced , but since the 19th century, there has been a tendency to spell it out as ; it may still be retained in personal names, though it is fairly rare, and occurs mostly in foreign words and SMS language. Usage in Danish and Finnish is similar (while Swedish, on the other hand, makes frequent use of in native words as well as in loanwords).

This was later replaced by and in almost all words and remained only in a few loanwords as &#x27;xenia&#x27; (&quot;xenien&quot;), surnames as &quot;Axentowicz&quot;, &quot;Rexemowski&quot;, and &quot;Xiężopolski&quot;, names as &quot;Xawery&quot;, and &quot;Xymena&quot;, and abbreviations.

==Other uses==
* X mark has a widely accepted meaning of &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.
* The Roman numeral X represents the number 10.
* In mathematics, &quot;x&quot; is commonly used as the name for an independent variable or unknown value. The modern tradition of using &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; to represent an unknown (&quot;incognita&quot;) was introduced by René Descartes in &quot;La Géométrie&quot; (1637). As a result of its use in algebra, X is often used to represent unknowns in other circumstances (e.g. X-rays, Generation X, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and &quot;The Man from Planet X&quot;).
* On some identification documents, the letter X represents a non-binary gender, where F means female and M means male.
* In the Cartesian coordinate system, &quot;x&quot; is used to refer to the horizontal axis.
* It is also sometimes used as a typographic approximation for the multiplication sign, . In mathematical typesetting, &quot;x&quot; meaning an algebraic variable is normally in italic type (formula_1), partly to avoid confusion with the multiplication symbol. In fonts containing both &quot;x&quot; (the letter) and × (the multiplication sign), the two glyphs are dissimilar.
* It can be used as an abbreviation for &#x27;between&#x27; in the context of historical dating; e.g. &quot;1483 x 1485&quot;.
* Maps and other images sometimes use an X to label a specific location, leading to the expression &quot;X marks the spot&quot;.
* In art or fashion, the use of X indicates a collaboration by two or more artists, e.g. Aaron Koblin x Takashi Kawashima. This application, which originated in Japan, now extends to other kinds of collaboration outside the art world. This usage mimics the use of a similar mark in denoting botanical hybrids, for which scientifically the multiplication × is used, but informally, a lowercase &quot;x&quot; is also used.
* At the end of a letter or other correspondence, &#x27;x&#x27; can mean a kiss; the earliest example of this usage cited by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is from 1878.
* An X rating denotes media, such as movies, that are intended for adults only.
* In the Korean language, a series of Xs is used as a visual bleep censor for subtitles and captions, serving the same role as an asterisk (*).
* In the C programming language, &quot;x&quot; preceded by zero (as in 0x or 0X) is used to denote hexadecimal literal values.
* X is commonly used as a prefix term in nouns related to the X Window System and Unix.

<text>XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972. Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge (vocals, guitars) and Colin Moulding (vocals, bass), the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following. They have since been recognised for their influence on post-punk, Britpop and later power pop acts.

Partridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a glam outfit with drummer Terry Chambers. The band&#x27;s name and line-up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that the band was known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on Virgin Records and were subsequently noted for their energetic live performances and their refusal to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from ska, 1960s pop, dub music and avant-garde. The single &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; (1979) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the reverberating drum sound associated with 1980s popular music.

Between 1979 and 1992, XTC had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40, including &quot;Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)&quot; (1980) and &quot;Senses Working Overtime&quot; (1982). After 1982&#x27;s &quot;English Settlement&quot;, the band stopped concert touring and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding and guitarist Dave Gregory. A spin-off group, the Dukes of Stratosphear, was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style psychedelia, but as XTC&#x27;s music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. XTC continued to produce more progressive records, including the albums &quot;Skylarking&quot; (1986), &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; (1989) and &quot;Nonsuch&quot; (1992). In the US, &quot;Mayor of Simpleton&quot; (1989) was their highest-charting single, while &quot;Dear God&quot; (1986) was controversial for its anti-religious message.

Due to poor management, XTC never received a share of profits from record sales (of which there were millions), nor from touring revenue, forcing them into debt throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, they went on strike against Virgin, citing an unfair recording contract, and soon extricated themselves from the label. Gregory left the band during the making of &quot;Apple Venus Volume 1&quot; (1999), after which the XTC name was used by the duo of Partridge and Moulding. In 2006, Partridge announced that his creative partnership with Moulding had disintegrated, leaving XTC &quot;in the past tense&quot;. Moulding and Chambers briefly reunited as the duo TC&amp;I in the late 2010s. Partridge and Gregory remain musically active. 

==1972–1982: early years and touring==

===Formation===
Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding grew up on Penhill council estate in Swindon. Partridge jokingly characterised the community as being populated almost entirely by people with physical, mental or emotional defects. In the 1960s, he was a fan of contemporary pop groups like the Beatles, but was intimidated by the process of learning guitar. When the Monkees grew popular, he became interested in joining a music group. He recalled watching local guitarist Dave Gregory performing Jimi Hendrix-style songs at churches and youth clubs: &quot;Sort of acid-skiffle. I thought, &#x27;Ah, one day I&#x27;ll play guitar!&#x27; But I didn&#x27;t think I would be in the same band as this kid on the stage.&quot; Partridge eventually obtained a guitar and taught himself how to play it with no formal training. At the age of 15, he wrote his first song, titled &quot;Please Help Me&quot;, and attracted the nickname &quot;Rocky&quot; for his early guitar mastery of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; (1968). By the early 1970s, his music tastes had transitioned &quot;from the Monkees to having a big binge on this Euro-avant-garde stuff. I got really in deep.&quot; One of his first bands was called &quot;Stiff Beach&quot;, formed in August 1970. In early 1972, Partridge&#x27;s constantly evolving group settled into &quot;Star Park&quot;, a four-piece that featured himself with guitarist Dave Cartner, drummer Paul Wilson, and a bassist nicknamed &quot;Nervous Steve&quot;.

In 1972, Partridge became closer acquainted with Gregory, a diabetic then suffering from a bout of depression, while working as an assistant at the Bon Marche record shop in Swindon. Gregory was playing the Mahavishnu Orchestra&#x27;s album &quot;The Inner Mounting Flame&quot; (1971), which he later called &quot;one of the watershed moments in my musical education.&quot; Partridge met Colin Moulding at the Stage Bar on Swindon&#x27;s Old Town&#x27;s Union Row, later known as Long&#x27;s. Moulding had been playing bass since 1970 &quot;because I liked music [and] I thought that playing a bass, with four strings, would be infinitely easier than playing a guitar, with six strings. That was a horrible misconception!&quot; At the end of 1972, Moulding and drummer Terry Chambers joined Partridge&#x27;s band, replacing Nervous Steve and Paul Wilson, and the group was renamed &quot;Star Park (Mark II)&quot;. Other members would frequently join and leave the group.

===Local popularity, rise of punk and label signing===
After Star Park opened for Thin Lizzy in May 1973, the band renamed themselves the Helium Kidz. Partridge&#x27;s musical conceptions were &quot;blown away&quot; upon hearing the New York Dolls: &quot;I suddenly just wanted to play three chords again and get out my mum&#x27;s makeup and stuff.&quot; He subsequently wrote hundreds of songs for the Helium Kidz, and some demo tapes were sent to Decca Records. &quot;NME&quot; ran a small profile on the &quot;up and coming&quot; band, which consisted of Partridge, Moulding, Chambers and guitarist Dave Cartner: &quot;They aspire to attain the impossible dream of being able to throw a TV or two out of the window of an American hotel and have no one complain.&quot; This version of the group lasted until 1975, when the Helium Kidz decided to rebrand themselves and change their music to &quot;three-minute pop songs that were fast and inventive.&quot; Gregory auditioned for the band at this juncture, but did not end up joining. His musicianship was determined to be &quot;too good&quot;.

It was decided that the band have another name change. &quot;The Dukes of Stratosphear&quot; was considered, but Partridge thought it was too &quot;flowery&quot; and &quot;psychedelic&quot;. He derived &quot;XTC&quot; from Jimmy Durante&#x27;s exclamation upon discovering the lost chord: &quot;That&#x27;s it! I&#x27;m in ecstasy!&quot; The name was chosen mainly for its emphatic appearance in print. Meanwhile, owing to creative differences with Partridge, synthesizer player Jonathan Perkins quit the band. In search of his replacement, Partridge found Barry Andrews through a &quot;keyboard player seeks band&quot; advertisement. Instead of a formal audition, the two went out drinking together. Andrews was immediately hired. During the first band rehearsal, Partridge recalled, &quot;He sounded like Jon Lord from Deep Purple; fuzz box, wah wah pedal, bluesy runs. I said, You don&#x27;t have to play like that, you can play like us if you want. The next rehearsal, he was like a maniac, like if Miró had played electric organ. Fantastic.&quot; December 1976 officially marked the beginning of the Partridge–Moulding–Chambers–Andrews line-up. The members cut their long hair and, for a time, wore &quot;kung-fu mechanic&quot; outfits on stage.

Ian Reid, owner of a Swindon club named The Affair, was their third manager and brokered deals for the group to perform at more popular venues such as the Red Cow in Hammersmith, The Nashville Rooms and Islington&#x27;s Hope and Anchor. By this time, the punk rock movement had emerged, which opened an avenue for the group in terms of record label appeal, even though the band did not necessarily fit in the punk dogma. Partridge remembered hearing the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; (1976) and feeling underwhelmed by its similarity to the Monkees or the Ramones: &quot;That sort of spurred me on – watching this stuff that I thought was rather average.&quot; Soon, John Peel saw the band perform at Upstairs at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s and asked them to appear on his BBC Radio 1 block. Partridge credited him as &quot;responsible for us getting a recording contract. ... As soon as we recorded that session for the BBC, suddenly three or four record labels wanted to sign us up.&quot; After declining CBS, Harvest and Island, they signed with Virgin Records.

===&quot;White Music&quot; and &quot;Go 2&quot;===
In August 1977, XTC made their first commercially released studio recordings with producer John Leckie at Abbey Road, which appeared on their debut album &quot;3D EP&quot; in October. Their first full-length record, &quot;White Music&quot;, was then recorded in less than two weeks, and released for January 1978. Partridge characterized the album as &quot;Captain Beefheart meets the Archies&quot; shrouded in 1950s-style retrofuturism. He reflected that the album was the sum of everything the band enjoyed, including the Beatles, Sun Ra, and Atomic Rooster, but dismissed the contents as premature songs &quot;built around this electric wordplay stuff&quot;. &quot;White Music&quot; reached number 38 on the UK Albums Chart. Although the album was well received by the press (&quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Sounds&quot;, and &quot;Record Mirror&quot; all gave positive reviews), none of its singles managed to chart. They rerecorded &quot;This Is Pop&quot; as a lead single. Its follow-up, &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot;, was banned on BBC Radio due to the lyric &quot;I sail beneath her skirt&quot;. With each member placed on a £25 weekly salary, the band toured for the next five years. The group also made appearances on the children&#x27;s television shows &quot;Tiswas&quot; and &quot;Magpie&quot;, which meant they would occasionally play for under-16 crowds on these early tours. Partridge enjoyed these early shows, but would later resent touring as the band&#x27;s audience numbers grew and the performing experience became more impersonal.

By August 1978, XTC were prepared to record their next album. The band had contacted Brian Eno to produce after they learned that he was a fan, but he declined, telling them that they were good enough to produce themselves. Virgin rejected Eno&#x27;s advice, and the group instead returned to Abbey Road with Leckie. Andrews appeared at the sessions with several original songs, but Partridge did not feel they were right for the band. He began taking Moulding and Chambers out for drinks without inviting Partridge, allegedly in an attempt to take over the group. After most of Andrews&#x27; songs were dropped from the final track list, the keyboardist told journalists that he foresaw the band &quot;explod[ing] pretty soon&quot;. &quot;Go 2&quot;, a more experimental venture, was released in October to positive reviews and a number 21 chart peak. Like &quot;White Music&quot;, it was given praise in &quot;Sounds&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, and the &quot;NME&quot;. One of the tracks, &quot;Battery Brides (Andy Paints Brian)&quot;, was written in tribute to Eno. The album also included a bonus EP, &quot;Go+&quot;, which consisted of five dub remixes of XTC songs.

Andrews left the band in December 1978, while they were on their first American tour, and went on to form the League of Gentlemen with Robert Fripp of King Crimson. Partridge said: &quot;He enjoyed undermining what little authority I had in the band. We were bickering quite a lot. But when he left I thought, Oh shit, that&#x27;s the sound of the band gone, this space-cream over everything. And I did enjoy his brain power, the verbal and mental fencing.&quot; XTC went through a &quot;silly half-hearted&quot; process of auditioning another keyboardist. Although Thomas Dolby was rumoured as a replacement, Partridge said that Dolby was never actually considered.

Rather than hiring a replacement keyboardist, Dave Gregory of the covers band Dean Gabber and His Gaberdines was invited to join as a second guitarist. Partridge remembered holding a &quot;pretend audition&quot; where Gregory was asked to play &quot;This Is Pop&quot;, only for Gregory to inquire whether they wanted the album version or the single version: &quot;We thought, &#x27;Bloody oh, a real musician.&#x27; But he was in the band before he even knew.&quot; Gregory was anxious of whether the fans would accept him as a member, characterizing himself as &quot;the archetypal pub-rocker in jeans and long hair. But the fans weren&#x27;t bothered. Nobody was fashionable in XTC, ever.&quot; He grew more comfortable with the group after playing a few shows, he said, &quot;and things got better and better&quot;.

===&quot;Drums and Wires&quot; and &quot;Black Sea&quot;===

XTC were impressed by Steve Lillywhite&#x27;s work on Ultravox&#x27;s 1977 debut, and Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;The Scream&quot;, and he was contacted to produce their third album with a drum sound that would &quot;knock your head off&quot;. With engineer Hugh Padgham, the band embarked to the newly built Townhouse Studios, &quot;with its now world-famous stone room&quot;; Gregory later recalled that Padgham had &quot;yet to develop his trade-mark &#x27;gated ambience&#x27; sound&quot;. Coinciding with Gregory&#x27;s arrival, the band recorded &quot;Life Begins at the Hop&quot; (1979), a Moulding composition. By this time, Moulding &quot;wanted to ditch [our] quirky nonsense and do more straight-ahead pop.&quot; He was surprised to learn that the label chose his song as a single over Partridge&#x27;s. Upon release, it was the first charting single for the band, rising to number 54 on the UK Singles Chart. For a period, most of the group&#x27;s singles were not placed on their albums. Moulding explained that this was because of an industry convention in the 1960s and the 1970s, and that when &quot;we wanted to shift albums later on, that approach got blown out of the water.&quot;

&quot;Drums and Wires&quot;, released in August 1979, was named for its emphasis on guitars and expansive drums. AllMusic reviewer Chris Woodstra wrote that it signalled &quot;a turning point ... with a more subdued set of songs that reflect an increasing songwriting proficiency. The aimless energy of the first two albums is focused into a cohesive statement with a distinctive voice that retains their clever humor, quirky wordplay, and decidedly British flavor. ... driven by the powerful rhythms and angular, mainly minimalistic arrangements.&quot; The distinctive drum pattern of its lead single, Moulding&#x27;s &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot;, was an attempt to invert drum tones and accents in the style of Devo&#x27;s cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. The song became a number 17 hit and helped propel the album to number 37 in the UK. Before &quot;Nigel&quot;, XTC had struggled to fill more than half the seats of the small club circuits they played. Afterward, the single was playlisted at the BBC, which helped the band secure two appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. When touring resumed in November, every date was sold out. In later years, the album became the best-known of XTC&#x27;s discography and Moulding and Partridge would look back on this point as the symbolic start of the band&#x27;s career.

To follow up &quot;Nigel&quot;, the band released &quot;Wait Till Your Boat Goes Down&quot; (1980), a reggae-influenced Partridge song with production by Phil Wainman of Bay City Rollers fame. It was their lowest-selling single to date. Concurrently, Virgin issued Moulding&#x27;s &quot;Ten Feet Tall&quot; as the band&#x27;s first US single. According to Gregory, &quot;Colin began to fancy himself as the &#x27;writer of the singles&#x27;&quot;. In response to &quot;the fuss made over Colin&#x27;s songs&quot;, Partridge attempted to exert more authority in the group: &quot;I thought I was a very benevolent dictator.&quot; Gregory disagreed, recalling that the band was &quot;pretty tired&quot; and that Partridge &quot;could be a little bit of a bully&quot;. Partridge at this point released a side project with &quot;Take Away&quot; / &quot;The Lure of Salvage&quot; in early 1980; a one-off record that appeared without much notice, except in Japan, where it was hailed as a work of &quot;electronic genius&quot; and outsold all other XTC albums.

&quot;Black Sea&quot;, released in September 1980, reunited the group with Lillywhite and Padgham and was well-received critically. Singles &quot;Generals and Majors&quot;, &quot;Towers of London&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)&quot; returned them to the charts at numbers 32, 31 and 16, respectively. &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; provoked feminist hate-mail for the lyric &quot;keep her stood in line&quot;. Partridge regretted the song, calling it &quot;crass but not enjoyably crass&quot;. &quot;Respectable Street&quot; was banned from BBC radio due to its references to abortion and a &quot;Sony Entertainment Centre&quot;. Partridge believed &quot;Black Sea&quot; was the closest the group had come to representing their live sound in the studio. It remains XTC&#x27;s second-highest charting British album, placing at number 16, and the most successful album in the U.S. of their career, peaking at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. That October, the documentary &quot;XTC at the Manor&quot;, which featured the band faking a studio session for &quot;Towers of London&quot;, was broadcast on BBC2.

===&quot;English Settlement&quot; and Partridge&#x27;s breakdown===
From 1980 to 1981, XTC toured Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US in support of &quot;Black Sea&quot; as the opening act for the Police. At this point, they were playing in arena stadiums while Partridge&#x27;s mental state was beginning to deteriorate, and he requested to cease touring, but was opposed by Virgin, his bandmates, and the band&#x27;s management. He would occasionally experience moments of memory lapse to the extent that he would forget who he was. His then-wife Marianne blamed his illness on his longtime dependency on Valium, which he had been prescribed since the age of 12. She threw away the tablets, and over the next year, he experienced intense withdrawal effects that he later described as &quot;brain melt&quot;.

XTC became their own producers for their next album project. Until this point, Partridge had insisted that every part of the band&#x27;s arrangements on record could be replicated live. He believed that &quot;if I wrote an album with a sound less geared towards touring then maybe there would be less pressure to tour.&quot; As such, the new music showcased more complex and intricate arrangements, song lengths were longer, and subject matter covered broader social issues. Much of the new material also featured acoustic instruments. Gregory bought a Rickenbacker 12-string and began contributing to the records as a keyboardist. In February 1982, &quot;English Settlement&quot; was released as the group&#x27;s first double album. The hook of its lead single, &quot;Senses Working Overtime&quot;, was based on Manfred Mann&#x27;s &quot;5-4-3-2-1&quot; (1964), Both the album and single became the highest-charting records they would ever have in the UK, peaking at number five and number 10, respectively. In several territories outside the UK, the album was released as only a single LP.

The group scheduled television appearances and an international tour in support of &quot;English Settlement&quot;. During a live-broadcast gig in Paris on 18 March, Partridge stopped playing and ran off the stage during the opening song &#x27;Respectable Street&#x27;, and afterward, took a flight back to Swindon for treatment, which amounted to hypnotherapy. He described feeling nausea and stomach pains while on stage: &quot;My body and brain said, You&#x27;re hating this experience I&#x27;m going to make it bad for you. When you go on stage I&#x27;m going to give you panic attacks and stomach cramps. You&#x27;re not enjoying this and you haven&#x27;t got the heart to tell anyone you can&#x27;t carry on so I&#x27;m gonna mess you up.&quot; The band&#x27;s remaining tour dates in England were cancelled. After recovering from the episode, Partridge rejoined the group for their first tour of the US as a headlining act. The band played the first date in San Diego. Gregory said that they were &quot;totally unrehearsed&quot; during the performance because &quot;we&#x27;d not played together for two weeks. ... It was obvious that he was ill, but exactly what it was, no-one knew.&quot;

On 4 April 1982, XTC were scheduled to headline a sold-out show at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. Partridge woke up that morning, he said, and &quot;couldn&#x27;t get off the bed. My legs wouldn&#x27;t function. Walked to Ben Frank&#x27;s coffee shop, where we&#x27;d all agreed to meet, in slow motion like I had both legs in plaster, trying not to throw up. I got in there, they knew what I was going to say.&quot; The tour ceased. He continued his hypnotherapy treatment, fearing that he was turning into the archetypal rock burn-out (such as Syd Barrett). &quot;It got to the point where if I touched the front door knob, I wanted to throw up.&quot; For a period afterward, it was rumoured among fans and industry insiders that the group stopped performing because Partridge had died, and some American bands put on XTC tribute shows in his remembrance.

==1982–1992: studio years==

===Financial issues and start of managerial litigation ===

The cancelled American tour saddled XTC with a £20,000 debt, and since it left them unable to record new material, they decided to reexamine their financial affairs. Confused as to where their earnings had gone, the group requested that manager Ian Reid help pay for the debts, but he refused, saying that they had owed him money. They tried distancing themselves from Reid by renegotiating their contract with Virgin. Six more albums were promised to the label in exchange for covering their debts, as well as a guarantee that subsequent royalty and advancement cheques be redirected into the band&#x27;s own deposit account. Royalty rates were still kept relatively low, as the group&#x27;s A&amp;R man Paul Kinder explained, they had &quot;appalling management for a number of years. Usually if a manager has got any kind of business acumen he will renegotiate the contract to get a better royalty. A record company expects this, which is why they keep royalties low initially. It&#x27;s just business really. Nobody addressed the contract for XTC.&quot;

Reid remained XTC&#x27;s manager until January 1983 (according to the book &quot;Chalkhills and Children&quot;) or a couple years afterward (according to Partridge). He legally retained the title of XTC&#x27;s manager until near the end of the decade. In April 1984, the group learned that he had incurred them an outstanding value-added taxes [VAT] bill and that he had significantly mishandled their revenue stream. A lawsuit was filed by the band, while he counter-sued for &quot;unpaid commission on royalties&quot;. Virgin were then &quot;legally required to freeze royalty and advance payments and divert publishing income into a frozen deposit account.&quot; For the next decade, the entirety of the band&#x27;s earnings would be invested in the continued litigation. The group supported themselves mostly through short-term loans from Virgin and royalty payments derived from airplay. At one point, Moulding and Gregory were working at a car rental service for additional income. Partridge was eventually left with &quot;about £300 in the bank&quot;, he said, &quot;which is really heavy when you&#x27;ve got a family and everyone thinks you&#x27;re &#x27;Mr Rich and Famous&#x27;.&quot; A court-enforced gag order restricts the band from speaking publicly on the alleged improprieties. According to Partridge, Reid was &quot;very naughty&quot; and left the band with roughly £300,000 in unpaid VAT. Music journalist Patrick Schabe elaborates:

===&quot;Mummer&quot; and faltered popularity===
During the middle months of 1982, Partridge spent his time in convalescence and writing songs. He later surmised that relinquishing Valium inadvertently gave him a new sense of creative direction: &quot;I was thinking clearer and wanted to know stuff. Life&#x27;s big questions.&quot; In the interim, Chambers moved to Australia and started a family. Feeling dismayed by Partridge&#x27;s decision not to tour, he had to be persuaded to return to Swindon for the next album&#x27;s rehearsals in September. At one rehearsal, Partridge recalled asking Chambers for &quot;tiny, cyclical, nattering clay pots&quot;, which he replied sounded &quot;a bit fucking nancified&quot;. The newly-wed Chambers soon left the band to be with his wife in Australia.

Drummer Pete Phipps, formerly of the Glitter Band, was quickly hired as a session musician to continue the recording sessions—XTC would never again employ a permanent drummer after Chambers&#x27; departure. In the meantime, Virgin released a greatest hits compilation, &quot;&quot;, to underwhelming sales. The group&#x27;s new material was rejected by Virgin executive Jeremy Lascelles, who suggested that they write something more commercial. Partridge remembered, &quot;He asked me to write something a bit more like The Police, with more international flavour, more basic appeal.&quot; Lascelles said that he had actually named Talking Heads, not the Police: &quot;Andy likes to portray us as the strict, stern schoolmasters, but we never wanted him to compromise at anything we thought he was good at. Here were very talented songwriters – surely, surely, surely they can come up with that elusive thing that is a hit single. That was our psyche.&quot;

After some remixing and additional songs at Virgin&#x27;s behest, &quot;Mummer&quot;, the first product of the studio-bound XTC, appeared in August 1983. Virgin did little to promote the album and delayed its release by several months. At number 58, it was their lowest-charting album to date. The one single that did chart, &quot;Love on a Farmboy&#x27;s Wages&quot;, did find significant airplay on BBC Radio 1. It was the first of a handful of XTC songs written over the years that reflected their poor financial state.

Virtually every contemporary review of &quot;Mummer&quot; accused the band of falling out of touch with the contemporary music climate. Journalist Serene Dominic retrospectively wrote that the album was seen as &quot;something of a disappointment at the time of release ... [It was] devoid of silly songs like &#x27;Sgt. Rock&#x27; that had heretofore been the band&#x27;s stock-in-trade and didn&#x27;t rock out until the last song, &#x27;Funk Pop a Roll.&#x27; ... &quot;Mummer&quot; signaled a strange rebirth for XTC.&quot; Moulding thought that &quot;when we came back from America after our aborted tour of 1982 ... people like Spandau Ballet had moved onto the scene; new groups were coming up and there was no place for us.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; journalist Chris Ingham summed up the period: &quot;In 18 months, XTC had gone from Top 10 hits and critical superlatives to being ignorable, arcane eccentrics. Partridge later said &quot;Your average English person probably thinks we split up in 1982&quot;.

===&quot;The Big Express&quot; and &quot;25 O&#x27;Clock&quot;===
XTC released the 1983 holiday single &quot;Thanks for Christmas&quot; under the pseudonym Three Wise Men. It was produced by David Lord, owner of Crescent Studios in Bath, and they subsequently negotiated a deal that allowed them to work as much as they wanted on their next album at his studio. Some of the album was recorded using a Linn LM-1 Drum Computer, and extensive time was spent on its programming. Partridge envisioned the work as &quot;industrial pop&quot; inspired by Swindon, a &quot;railway town&quot;. The result, &quot;The Big Express&quot;, returned the group to a brighter and uptempo sound marked by studio experimentation and denser arrangements, setting a template that they would develop on subsequent albums. He jokingly referred to some parts of the album as the only time the group were befallen with stereotypical 1980s-style production. It was released in October 1984, reaching a higher chart position than &quot;Mummer&quot;, but was &quot;virtually ignored&quot; by critics. Virgin invested £33,000 into the music video for &quot;All You Pretty Girls&quot; to little effect. The band were charged for the sum.

When Gregory joined the band in 1979, Partridge learned that they both shared a longtime enthusiasm for 1960s psychedelic music. An album of songs in that style was immediately put to consideration, but the group could not go through with it due to their commercial obligations to Virgin. In November 1984, one month after &quot;The Big Express&quot;″s release, Partridge and John Leckie traveled to Monmouth to produce the album &quot;Miss America&quot; by singer-songwriter Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, who had recently signed with Virgin. Partridge and Leckie were dismissed due to conflicts related to their religious affiliations or lack thereof (O&#x27;Hara was a devout Catholic). Partridge was feeling inspired by Nick Nicely&#x27;s 1982 psychedelic single &quot;Hilly Fields 1892&quot;, and devised a recording project to fill the newfound gap in his schedule. The rules were as follows: songs must follow the conventions of 1967 and 1968 psychedelia; no more than two takes allowed; use vintage equipment wherever possible. After receiving a £5,000 advance from a skeptical Virgin Records, the group devoted two weeks to the sessions.

Calling themselves &quot;the Dukes of Stratosphear&quot;, the spin-off group consisted of Partridge and Moulding with Dave and his drummer brother Ian. Each adopted a pseudonym: Sir John Johns, The Red Curtain, Lord Cornelius Plum and E.I.E.I. Owen. At the sessions, the band dressed themselves in Paisley outfits and lit scented candles. With &quot;nothing to live up to&quot; as the Dukes, Partridge looked back on the project as the &quot;most fun we ever had in the studio ... We never knew if it would sell ... We could never [subvert everybody&#x27;s expectations] with XTC, as there was too much money involved and we were expected to be mentally honest and &#x27;real.&#x27; Too much financial pressure.&quot; Released on April Fools&#x27; Day 1985, the album was presented as a long-lost collection of recordings by a late 1960s group. When asked about the album in interviews, XTC initially denied having any involvement. In England, the six-track mini-album sold twice as many copies as &quot;The Big Express&quot;, even before the Dukes&#x27; identity was made public. The album also achieved considerable sales in the US.

===&quot;Skylarking&quot; and &quot;Psonic Psunspot&quot;===
During a routine meeting in early 1986, Virgin executives threatened to drop the band from the label if their next album failed to sell more than 70,000 units. One reason why the group was not selling enough records, Virgin reportedly concluded, was that they sounded &quot;too English&quot;. The label forced the group to work with one of their selected American producers. When shown a list of their names, they recognised none except for Todd Rundgren. Gregory was a fan of Rundgren&#x27;s music, particularly since hearing the 1978 album &quot;Hermit of Mink Hollow&quot;. His bandmates were not as familiar with Rundgren, but Gregory urged the group to work with him: &quot;I reminded Andy that Todd had produced one of his favourite New York Dolls records [&quot;New York Dolls&quot;, 1973]. In the absence of any better alternatives, he agreed.&quot; Once contacted, Rundgren offered to handle the album&#x27;s entire recording for a lump sum of $150,000, and the band agreed.

In January 1986, Partridge and Moulding mailed Rundgren a collection of more than 20 demo tapes they had stockpiled in advance. Compared to previous XTC albums, much of the material contrasted significantly with its mellower feel, lush arrangements, and &quot;flowery&quot; aesthetic. Rundgren responded with the idea of a concept album to bridge &quot;Colin&#x27;s &#x27;pastoral&#x27; tunes and subject matter and Andy&#x27;s &#x27;pop anthems&#x27; and sly poetry. ... The album could be about a day, a year, or a lifetime. ... Using this framework, I [Rundgren] came up with a sequence of songs and a justification for their placement and brought it to the band.&quot;

After the group arrived at Utopia Sound recording studio in upstate New York, Rundgren played a large role in the album&#x27;s sound design and drum programming, providing them with string and brass arrangements, as well as an assortment of gear. However, the sessions were fraught with tension, especially between him and Partridge, and disagreements arose over drum patterns, song selections, and other details. Partridge likened the power struggle to &quot;two Hitlers in the same bunker&quot;. He expressed resentment toward Rundgren&#x27;s contributions when sessions concluded, but later softened his view and praised the result. Rundgren said that in spite of all the difficulties, the album &quot;ultimately ... sounds like we were having a great time doing it. And at times we &quot;were&quot; having a good time.&quot;

&quot;Skylarking&quot; spent one week on the UK album charts, reaching number 90 in November 1986, two weeks after its release. Moulding&#x27;s &quot;Grass&quot; was chosen as lead single. It was issued exclusively in the UK with the B-side &quot;Dear God&quot;, an outtake. &quot;Dear God&quot; became so popular with American college radio stations who imported the record that Geffen Records (XTC&#x27;s US distributor) recalled and re-pressed &quot;Skylarking&quot; with the track included. Controversy also broke out over the song&#x27;s anti-religious lyrics, which inspired some violent incidents. In Florida, a radio station received a bomb threat, and in New York, a student forced their school to play the song over its public-address system by holding a faculty member at knife-point. Nonetheless, the commercial success of &quot;Dear God&quot; propelled &quot;Skylarking&quot; to sell more than 250,000 units, and it raised the band&#x27;s profile among American college youth. In the US, the album spent 29 weeks on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and reached its peak position of number 70 in June 1987. The music video for &quot;Dear God&quot; received the 1987 &quot;Billboard&quot; Best Video award and was also nominated for three categories at the MTV Video Music Awards. &quot;Skylarking&quot; ultimately became XTC&#x27;s best-known album and is generally regarded as their finest work.

Partridge was reluctant to make another Dukes album, but to appease requests from his bandmates and Virgin Records, &quot;Psonic Psunspot&quot; (1987) was recorded. This time, 10 songs and a £10,000 budget was supplied, while John Leckie returned as producer. Once again, the Dukes&#x27; record outsold XTC&#x27;s previous album in the UK (&quot;Skylarking&quot; in this case). Partridge felt it was &quot;a bit upsetting to think that people preferred these pretend personalities to our own personalities ... But I don&#x27;t mind because we have turned into the Dukes slowly over the years.&quot; Likewise, Moulding felt that the &quot;psychedelic element was being more ingratiated into the pie&quot; since &quot;25 O&#x27;Clock&quot;. When issued on CD, &quot;Psonic Psunspot&quot; was combined with &quot;25 O&#x27;Clock&quot; and given the title &quot;Chips from the Chocolate Fireball&quot; (1987).

===&quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot; and &quot;Nonsuch&quot;===
For their next album &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot;, XTC traveled to Los Angeles to make use of a cheap studio rate arranged by Paul Fox, who was recruited by the band for his first production gig. Another reason for recording in the US with an American producer, said Gregory, was that &quot;America was our biggest market&quot;. Mr. Mister (and later longtime King Crimson) member Pat Mastelotto was the drummer for the entire album. The album was released in February 1989 with music that was in a similar psychedelic vein as the Dukes. In a retrospective review, &quot;The Quietus&quot;″ Nick Reed notes: &quot;Nearly every instrument is mixed to the forefront; it&#x27;s too well-arranged to be cacophonous, but there&#x27;s a degree of sensory overload, especially given the band&#x27;s newfound tendency to blast synthesizers in our faces. ... whether or not this album holds up for you depends on how much you like the band&#x27;s boisterous side.&quot; It became the highest album they had in the charts since 1982&#x27;s &quot;English Settlement&quot;, rising to number 28 in the UK and number 44 in the US. Additionally, it combined with &quot;Skylarking&quot; for the group&#x27;s best-selling albums to date. &quot;Mayor of Simpleton&quot; reached number 46 in the UK and number 72 in the US, making it their only American single to chart.

To support the album, XTC embarked on an acoustic-guitar American radio tour that lasted for two weeks in May. The shows were carried out without financial compensation for the band. Gregory commented that it was an &quot;interesting&quot; style of promotion, but &quot;incredibly hard work&quot;, as the band performed at about four radio stations a day for three weeks: &quot;We also did a live acoustic set for MTV in front of an audience which worried Andy a bit but he got through it.&quot; This inspired the network to invite more artists to perform stripped-down sets, calling the series &quot;unplugged&quot;. XTC&#x27;s performance of &quot;King for a Day&quot; on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; marked the first time the group played in front of a live audience in seven years. A similar acoustic tour was planned for Europe, but cancelled when Partridge discovered that the Paris date would be broadcast from a sold-out 5,000 seater venue. After an unsuccessful attempt was made to coax Partridge back into regular touring, they took a short break. Partridge produced &quot;And Love for All&quot; (1990), the third album by the Lilac Time, and compered for an unbroadcast children&#x27;s game show named &quot;Matchmakers&quot;. Gregory played for Johnny Hates Jazz, Marc Almond and Francesco Messina whilst producing for Cud. Moulding performed a special event concert with David Marx and the Refugees, a Swindon-based band that reunited him with Barry Andrews.

Tarquin Gotch, who served as XTC&#x27;s manager for a short time, helped the band reach a legal settlement with Ian Reid in 1989. However, they were again left with a six-figure debt. Virgin Records advanced the group enough money to cover their debt in exchange for the promise of four additional albums. Having written more than two dozen songs by 1991, some difficulties prolonged the start of recording sessions for the next album. Initially, the band had issue with the musical director of Virgin, who, after seeing the songs, was convinced the band &quot;could do better&quot; and asked them to write more material. With the band sitting on the material, the director left the label a year later, and his replacement liked the band&#x27;s content, hurrying them to record the album. Gus Dudgeon produced, even though Partridge felt he was the wrong choice, and Fairport Convention&#x27;s Dave Mattacks was brought in as drummer.

&quot;Nonsuch&quot; was received with critical acclaim when released in April 1992, and like &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot;, peaked at number 28 in the UK, becoming their second consecutive and final Top 40 album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Michael Azerrad reviewed: &quot;Emphasizing wonder and wit in opposition to the rage of most college rock, XTC makes alternative music for people who don&#x27;t like &#x27;alternative music&#x27;.&quot; Lead single &quot;The Disappointed&quot; reached number 33 in the UK and was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award. Its follow-up &quot;The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead&quot; reached number 71. &quot;Wrapped in Grey&quot; was intended as the third single, and about 5,000 copies were pressed before being withdrawn from sale. Partridge remembered thinking, &quot;that&#x27;s it, they&#x27;ve suffocated one of our kids in the cot, they&#x27;ve murdered the album, basically through ignorance.&quot; In 1993, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, but lost to Tom Waits&#x27; &quot;Bone Machine&quot;.

==1993–present: legal entanglement, return and breakup==

===Strike period===
In 1993, Partridge conceived XTC&#x27;s next project to be an album of bubblegum pop songs disguising itself as a retrospective compilation featuring 12 different groups from the early 1970s. The lyrics were also heavily sexual, with song titles such as &quot;Lolly (Suck It and See)&quot; and &quot;Visit to the Doctor&quot;. Partridge recalled playing some demos for Virgin agents, and compared their reaction to the &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; scene from the 1967 film &quot;The Producers&quot;. The label rejected his idea. Virgin denied Partridge&#x27;s requests to renegotiate or revoke XTC&#x27;s contract. Paul Kinder believed that the label and the group were &quot;poles apart&quot; and that &quot;the contract was so old it got to the point where Andy wanted the moon and Virgin weren&#x27;t prepared to give it him.&quot;

Whatever new music the band recorded would have been automatically owned by Virgin, and so the band enacted strike action against the label. Prince and George Michael also went on a strike against their respective labels that was heavily publicized at about the same time. XTC&#x27;s strike, however, received little press. In the meantime, Partridge produced Martin Newell&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;The Greatest Living Englishman&quot; and early sessions for Blur&#x27;s second album. &quot;I thought I did sterling work. ... Next day, [David Balfe from the Teardrop Explodes said], &#x27;Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit. Other complications arose; he developed some health issues, and his wife divorced him.

In 1997 (also reported as in late 1994), XTC found themselves freed from financial debt and from Virgin after &quot;making some heavy concessions&quot;. Partridge fantasised that people from the label &quot;met in the dark and thought, &#x27;These blokes are not making a living. We&#x27;ve had &#x27;em all these years and we&#x27;ve got their catalogue and the copyright to their songs for evermore and we&#x27;ve stitched &#x27;em up real good with a rotten deal so, erm, maybe we should let them go.&#x27; I like to think that it was a guilt thing.&quot; One of the group&#x27;s first new recordings since the strike was released for the tribute album &quot;A Testimonial Dinner: The Songs of XTC&quot; (1995). &quot;The Good Things&quot;, a Moulding song originally demoed for &quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot;, was credited under the pseudonym Terry and the Lovemen. In 1998, &quot;Song Stories&quot;, an authorized overview of the band&#x27;s catalog by journalist and longtime friend Neville Farmer was published. Partridge said the book was badly edited and &quot;used the crappiest quotes&quot;.

===&quot;Apple Venus&quot; and &quot;Wasp Star&quot;===
By late 1997, Partridge and Moulding had amassed a large stockpile of material. The former&#x27;s songs were an elaboration on the more orchestral style he developed with &quot;Nonsuch&quot; tracks &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;Wrapped in Grey&quot;, and &quot;Rook&quot;. Moulding felt that &quot;something a bit different&quot; was appropriate for the band at this juncture, and shared Partridge&#x27;s desire for a cohesive LP similar to soundtracks such as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;stuff that Burt Bacharach wrote for various [films]&quot;. Partridge thought the new songs were &quot;some of the best stuff, if not the best stuff, ever. It&#x27;s even more intensely passionate than before.&quot;

The group elected to divide the album into two parts: one of rock songs, and the other of orchestral/acoustic songs augmented by a 40-piece symphony. They found a label, Cooking Vinyl, and a producer, Haydn Bendall, who had engineered XTC&#x27;s debut EP back in 1977 and had significant experience in recording orchestras. Prairie Prince, who drummed on &quot;Skylarking&quot;, returned for the sessions. It soon became apparent that the band did not have the funds to record all the material they had. Gregory, Moulding, and Bendall wanted to reduce the project to one disc, but Partridge insisted on spreading it over two LPs. It was decided that they release one album with the orchestral portions (&quot;volume 1&quot;) and leave the rock songs for its follow-up (&quot;volume 2&quot;). A session was booked at Abbey Road, but the recording was rushed, lasting one day, and had to be edited over a three-month period.

Gregory quit the band whilst in the middle of sessions due to personal issues and discord with his bandmates. Partridge told journalists that Gregory left because he grew impatient with the recording of the orchestral material and wanted to quickly move on to the second project, which would have consisted of rock songs. He attributed Gregory&#x27;s frustration to diabetic mood swings, as did Moulding. Gregory denied that his leaving pertained to &quot;musical differences&quot;, and that it was moreso &quot;personal problems&quot; related to Partridge.

Released in February 1999, &quot;Apple Venus Volume 1&quot; was met with critical acclaim and moderate sales. It had minimal promotion. Comparing the album to the group&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Zach Hooker wrote: &quot;&quot;Apple Venus&quot; finds them picking up pretty much where they left off. Or maybe even a little bit before they left off: this record bridges the gap between the ambitiously poppy &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; and the pastoral &quot;Skylarking&quot;. ... The music is built on simple phrases, but the relationships between those phrases becomes tremendously complex.&quot; In contrast, the companion album &quot;Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2)&quot; (2000), consisting of more guitar-based material, was assumed as one of the band&#x27;s &quot;weakest&quot; albums. Upon release, its British chart peak was higher than &quot;Volume 1&quot;, at number 40 in the UK, while in the US it was lower, at number 108. Partridge believed that some parts of the album was when &quot;the [artistic] slope started to go down&quot;. 

===&quot;Fuzzy Warbles&quot; and disintegrated partnership===
After &quot;Wasp Star&quot;, newly recorded XTC material was released sporadically. The four-disc hits and rarities boxed set &quot;Coat of Many Cupboards&quot; (2002) included &quot;Didn&#x27;t Hurt a Bit&quot;, a rerecording of a &quot;Nonsuch&quot; outtake. The Dukes of Stratosphear—with Dave and Ian Gregory—were reunited for the charity single &quot;Open a Can (of Human Beans)&quot; (2003). Another set, &quot;Apple Box&quot; (2005), included two new tracks: &quot;Spiral&quot;, written by Partridge and &quot;Say It&quot;, by Moulding. These songs were available to purchasers of the box set in digital format only, with the use of a special download code. This followed with a digital-exclusive track, Moulding&#x27;s &quot;Where Did the Ordinary People Go?&quot;, released in December 2005.

From 2002 to 2006, Partridge simultaneously released volumes in the multi-album &quot;Fuzzy Warbles&quot; series, a set dedicated to unreleased solo demos and other material. Moulding was initially attached to the project, but opted out because &quot;I just wouldn&#x27;t have found it very inspiring. Maybe a couple of volumes would&#x27;ve been okay, or just one. But he [Andy] wanted to do twelve, which kind of put the wind up me a little bit. We had a bit of an argument about it.&quot; He felt that such &quot;petty&quot; arguments about XTC&#x27;s finances precipitated the band&#x27;s unofficial break-up, as he said in reference to the &quot;Fuzzy Warbles&quot; collection, &quot;I got the impression he was going for broke ...&quot; Partridge said that the impetus for the project was the proliferation of bootleggers who were selling low-quality copies of the material and that the &quot;Fuzzy Warbles&quot; set earned him more money than XTC&#x27;s back catalog on Virgin. He also did not feel that XTC were a band anymore: &quot;It&#x27;s more of a brand. It&#x27;s more HP Sauce than ever. [Colin and I are] two selfish middle-aged gits who make the music we make.&quot;

In 2006, Partridge recorded an album, &quot;Monstrance&quot;, with Barry Andrews and drummer Martyn Barker. During one of the sessions, some of his hearing was destroyed following a studio mishap, which caused him to develop severe and permanent tinnitus. Near the end of the year, he told an interviewer that Moulding recently (&quot;a couple of months back&quot;) lost interest in writing, performing or even listening to music. He remained hopeful that the situation was temporary and assured that they had &quot;not killed off the XTC head. I mean, we still have the head cryogenically frozen. ... It&#x27;s no good making a record and calling it XTC, certainly, if Colin isn&#x27;t involved.&quot; In November, he stated that he had been forced to regard the group &quot;in the past tense,&quot; with no likelihood of a new project unless Moulding should have a change of heart. Months later, Partridge intimated that Moulding had moved and changed his phone number, effectively ending all contact between the two and reducing their correspondence to emails exchanged via their manager to discuss the division of the band&#x27;s assets. Partridge also said he and Gregory—their differences now resolved—had considered working together again.

In July 2008, Partridge wrote in the &quot;Swindon Advertiser&quot; that he believed his &quot;musical partnership with Colin Moulding has come to an end. For reasons too personal and varied to go into here, but we had a good run as they say and produced some real good work. No, I won&#x27;t be working with him in the future.&quot; In December, Moulding resurfaced for a live radio interview where he confirmed his recent disillusionment with music, but revealed that he was thinking of working on solo material. His given reasons for the break-up were financial discord, disagreement over the extent of the &quot;Fuzzy Warbles&quot; project, and a &quot;change in mindset&quot; between him and Partridge. He also stated that he and Partridge were once again communicating directly by email.

===Reissue programme and TC&amp;I ===
XTC did not technically break up in a legal sense. As of 2014, the group still existed as a trademark controlled by Partridge and Moulding. Throughout the 2010s, selected albums from the band&#x27;s catalog were reissued as deluxe packages centred on new stereo and surround sound mixes by Steven Wilson. Partridge said that he did not &quot;insist on any mastering or messing with XTC 5.1&quot; and that his involvement with Wilson&#x27;s mixes goes only as far as authorizing them. The official XTC Twitter account @xtcfans was originally managed by writer Todd Bernhardt. According to Partridge, after some time, &quot;I sort of took it over, because I thought it was weird that there was another person in the way.&quot; In 2016, Partridge and Bernhardt released a book, &quot;Complicated Game: Inside the Songs of XTC&quot;, that contains discussions between the two about 29 XTC songs, one Partridge solo track, and an overview of his approach to songwriting. It was published by Jawbone Press.

Until 2016, Moulding remained largely inactive as a musician. In October 2017, he and Terry Chambers issued a four-song EP, &quot;Great Aspirations&quot; (credited to &quot;TC&amp;I&quot;). Its release coincided with a televised documentary film of the band&#x27;s career, &quot;&quot;, which premiered on Sky Arts on 7 October. The documentary featured new interviews with Partridge, Gregory, Moulding and Chambers. Moulding praised the film and commented on the possibility of a full-fledged XTC reunion: &quot;They say never say never, don&#x27;t they? It would seem unlikely, put it that way.&quot; As of January 2018, Partridge maintained that the group would &quot;not be recording together again.&quot; From 29 October to 1 November, TC&amp;I performed four sold-out shows at Swindon&#x27;s Art&#x27;s Centre, in Old Town. It was the first time Moulding and Chambers had played a live gig in decades.

In 2021, Moulding told &quot;Mojo&quot; that he and Partridge had recently become on good terms with each other. &quot;[Andy and I] didn&#x27;t speak for a long time, except about business, and then it was quite terse. But we&#x27;re quite cordial with each other now, it&#x27;s probably as good as it&#x27;s been for quite some time. Would we do XTC again? (&quot;laughs&quot;) I don&#x27;t think we would, because I&#x27;m not sure whether I could put up with his dictatorial ways any more, or whether he could put up with me.&quot;

On 13 April 2024, it was announced that original keyboardist Jon Perkins had died at the age of 66.

==Musical style and development==

===Group dynamic===

====Partridge and Moulding====
XTC&#x27;s principal songwriters were guitarist Andy Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding. Partridge, who wrote the majority of XTC&#x27;s songs, was the group&#x27;s frontman and de facto leader. He drove the band&#x27;s image, designed many of their record sleeves, and handled most of their interviews. His involvement with XTC&#x27;s record sleeves stemmed from his disappointment with the sleeve for the &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; single, which depicted a poorly cropped photo of the statue and the XTC logo in red. He was less successful in his attempts to involve himself in the band&#x27;s music videos, as he said, the woman in charge of Virgin&#x27;s video department rebuked all his ideas, some of which other groups later adopted in award-winning videos.

Partridge and Moulding did not write together. Of their partnership, Moulding stated in 1992: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of freedom to do what each of us likes with the other&#x27;s songs, however. ... Each person puts his little prints on them.&quot; They did collaborate on arrangements, with &quot;horn lines and harmonies, that sort of thing.&quot; He also lent praise to Partridge as &quot;a real ideas man, and I love good ideas. It&#x27;s not hard contributing bass parts when you have such good songs to contribute to.&quot;

Discussing Moulding&#x27;s songs, Partridge said that few were included on XTC albums because Moulding was not a prolific writer. Gregory said that all of Moulding&#x27;s proposed songs would be recorded to preserve democracy in the band, and &quot;occasionally at the expense of some of Andy&#x27;s often superior offerings. This didn&#x27;t always go down well, either with Andy or the band, but Colin did have some killer melodies and a sweeter sound to his voice that made a welcome diversion when listening to an album as a whole.&quot; Partridge opined that Moulding&#x27;s songs initially &quot;came out as weird imitations of what I was doing&quot;, but by the time of &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;, &quot;he really started to take off as a songwriter.&quot; He was more effused with Moulding&#x27;s offerings for &quot;Skylarking&quot;, which included the highest ratio of Moulding songs for any XTC album. On Moulding&#x27;s bass-playing, Partridge praised his &quot;old-fashioned&quot; tendency to match notes to the bass drum.

In &quot;Song Stories&quot;, Neville Farmer comments that Partridge &quot;is the boss—erratic but willful [and] runs the band on instinct&quot;, while Moulding &quot;is the voice of calm ... a foil to Andy&#x27;s radical side.&quot; Music journalist Peter Paphides felt that the songwriters&#x27; personalities &quot;couldn&#x27;t seem more different,&quot; with Moulding &quot;phlegmatic, shy, and heartbreakingly pretty&quot; and Partridge an &quot;art-school dropout ... uptight, dominating and extrovert.&quot; In Moulding&#x27;s view, Partridge also typically acted as an &quot;executive producer&quot; for albums while frequently undermining the authority of the actual credited producer. Their recording approaches differed in that Moulding sometimes preferred spontaneous or imperfect performances, whereas Partridge working method was to refine a song through repeated takes. The band occasionally took to the term &quot;Andy-ness&quot; to describe Partridge&#x27;s studio indulgences. Despite this, they rarely found themselves encumbered by serious creative differences. In 1997, Moulding called one dispute over a &quot;Skylarking&quot; bass part the &quot;only real argument&quot; between him and Partridge in the band&#x27;s history.

====Andrews, Gregory and drummers====

Barry Andrews, XTC&#x27;s keyboard player for their first two albums, emerged as a third solo songwriter on the group&#x27;s second album &quot;Go 2&quot;, and left the band shortly thereafter. His replacement, guitarist Dave Gregory, did not contribute songs, but was the only one in the band who could score music, and frequently contributed orchestral arrangements. Moulding said that when Andrews was in the band, Partridge had &quot;no kind of foil&quot; to work with, as both musicians were drawn to dissonant harmonies: &quot;[Andy] used to like the real kind of angular, spiky, upward-thrusting guitar ... if one is angular, the other has to kind of straighten him out ... So when Dave came in, and was a much straighter player, it seemed to make more sense, I think.&quot; Starting in 1982, Gregory extended his talents to keyboards as well, since Partridge and Moulding were not adept with the instrument.

Gregory never presented a completed idea for a song to the band partly because he felt intimidated by Partridge&#x27;s scrutiny. Since he &quot;couldn&#x27;t continue grinding out old blues clichés and power chords,&quot; he decided to &quot;think more in terms of the songs as the masters and the instruments as the servants.&quot; Discussing Gregory&#x27;s contributions to the group, Farmer writes of &quot;a precision and correctness that carries through from his prerehearsal of guitar solos to ... his encyclopedic knowledge of guitars and who-played-what-on-which-instrument-with-which-amplifier-in-which-studio-on-which-record-under-the-influence-of-what-star-sign-or-guru-or-drug.&quot;

Terry Chambers was the band&#x27;s original drummer. He was described by Partridge as &quot;the [drummer] that&#x27;s been the most primitive, but probably the most thrilling for inventiveness, because he would blunder into [different ideas].&quot; One of his characteristic techniques was the use of hi-hat chokes. After he left in 1983, the group employed a succession of session drummers for their studio recordings. This included Pete Phipps (&quot;Mummer&quot; and &quot;The Big Express&quot;), Prairie Prince (&quot;Skylarking&quot; and &quot;Apple Venus&quot;), Pat Mastelotto (&quot;Oranges &amp; Lemons&quot;), and Dave Mattacks (&quot;Nonsuch&quot;). Drum machines also began to be incorporated into the group&#x27;s sound. None of the studio drummers were accepted as official members of the band. Partridge explained that this was because the group did not tour and because &quot;There&#x27;s lots of local, interpersonal language that means nothing to anybody outside the band and is very difficult to bring people into.&quot;

===Genres and influences===
In the mid 1970s, XTC played in London punk scenes and were consistent with music of the new wave, albeit with a heavy ska influence. Partridge felt that their music was pop from the beginning, not punk or new wave as is often suggested, and that the terms in themselves are redundant of &quot;pop&quot;. As they became more of a studio band, their material grew progressively more complex. Later, XTC were sometimes suggested as being a prog band. Partridge did not feel the band were prog and expressed hesitancy with the word &quot;progressive&quot;, saying that he preferred to call the band &quot;exploratory pop&quot; in the same vein as the Beatles or the Kinks. In his words, &quot;Prog is just longer pop songs.&quot;

The band&#x27;s early influences included disco, dub reggae, music hall, the Beatles, Free, the Kinks, Captain Beefheart, the Stooges, the New York Dolls, Cockney Rebel, Motown, Can, David Bowie, the Groundhogs, Black Sabbath, and the organ-dominated records of Johnny and the Hurricanes. The New York Dolls&#x27; single &quot;Jet Boy&quot; was a particular favorite for XTC. Partridge denied in 2019 that the Velvet Underground were an influence, but in 1984 expressed a fondness for &quot;things with pounding piano, everything from Velvet Underground&#x27;s &#x27;I&#x27;m Waiting for My Man&#x27;, to things that people like the Beatles or the Rolling Stones did at any time I just love banana-fingers piano.&quot; Moreso than Partridge, Moulding was fond of heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep, as well as Deep Purple, Cream, and Free.

XTC were not initially public with their influences due to the punk scene&#x27;s anathema toward stating one&#x27;s influences. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Chris Dahlen characterised the band&#x27;s original sound as punk meets &quot;Buddy Holly-on-amphetamines ... danceable enough for the crowds at the clubs, and suspiciously poppy thanks to the catchy hooks and their trademark verse-chorus-verse-chorus-&quot;explode&quot; pattern.&quot; Partridge said that he adopted a vocal style out of &quot;fear that we weren&#x27;t going to make another record ... and people weren&#x27;t going to be left with any impression of the singer&quot;. He described it as a &quot;walrus&quot; or &quot;seal bark&quot; that amalgamated Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;hiccup&quot;, Elvis Presley&#x27;s vibrato, and &quot;the howled mannerisms of Steve Harley.&quot; In reference to the energy of the band&#x27;s performances (which drew comparisons with Talking Heads), Partridge remembered how they &quot;used to fucking kill ourselves. I think it was fear. It was fear manifested in ludicrously high energy music. It was like 1000% whaaahh! All of the songs were run together and it was really uptempo stuff.&quot; According to Moulding, &quot;any kinship [XTC had] with punk&quot; was gone after 1979&#x27;s Motown-influenced &quot;Life Begins at the Hop&quot;.

Of his guitar technique, Partridge said that it evolved from his desire to be a drummer, to &quot;chop and slash and try to work between what the drums were doing, a) so I could be heard, and b) because I liked the funk and I liked working the holes that the drums left.&quot; He was particularly influenced by John French, the drummer for Captain Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band, although he disliked that the drummer&#x27;s groove would change every few bars. Gregory attributed XTC&#x27;s unorthodox drum patterns to Partridge&#x27;s affinity for dub and reggae; &quot;He&#x27;s got a great innate sense of rhythm. He&#x27;ll say &#x27;No, don&#x27;t put that beat there, why don&#x27;t you come down on 3 instead of 2 on this part here?&#x27; ... He never put [cymbal crashes] where you&#x27;d expect to find them.&quot; Producer Chris Hughes likened the band&#x27;s fashion of playing guitar to an automated music sequencer.

Over the next few years, XTC began showcasing their vintage psychedelic influences through the use of Mellotron and backwards tape recordings on the albums &quot;Mummer&quot; and &quot;The Big Express&quot;. In 1987, he acknowledged that the group had &quot;really changed personality. We didn&#x27;t notice it bit by bit but over 10 years, suddenly it seems, wow, we&#x27;re different.&quot;

The Beach Boys&#x27; 1968 rendition of &quot;Bluebirds Over the Mountain&quot; was one of the first records Partridge bought with his own money. Although it is widely assumed that the Beach Boys influenced XTC throughout their career, Partridge stated that he was originally only familiar with singles such as &quot;I Get Around&quot; (1964) and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1967) which were an enormous influence for him. It was not until 1986 that he discovered that the Beach Boys had an album career, when he first heard &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; (1967) in its entirety. Moulding credited the arrival of Dave Gregory with reviving Partridge&#x27;s interest in 1960s bands like the Kinks. However, Partridge similarly only knew of the Kinks through the group&#x27;s 1960s singles, and did not listen to any of their albums until the late 1980s. Partridge also claimed that &quot;the Beatles were the farthest thing from my mind&quot; until 1982; at another time he stated that the opening F chord on XTC&#x27;s 1978 single &quot;This Is Pop&quot; was directly based on the opening chord from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964).

Discussing the recording of the &quot;Mummer&quot; track &quot;Ladybird&quot;, Partridge recalled that he told producer Steve Nye that he was afraid people would think he was copying the Beatles, to which Nye&#x27;s response was &quot;Who gives a fuck?&quot; Partridge said that &quot;from that moment onward, I started to recognise that those songwriters—the Ray Davieses, the Lennons and McCartneys, the Brian Wilsons—had gone into my head really deeply. He later considered &quot;Rook&quot; (1992), &quot;Wrapped in Grey&quot; (1992) and &quot;Easter Theatre&quot; (1999) to be the &quot;perfect songs&quot; of his career, feeling that he had &quot;exorcized a lot of those kind of Lennon-and-McCartney, Bacharach-and-David, Brian Wilson type ghosts out of my system by doing all that.&quot; Reportedly, when Brian Wilson was played the Dukes&#x27; &quot;Pale and Precious&quot;, a pastiche of the Beach Boys, he thought it was styled after Paul McCartney.

==Lyricism and English culture==
XTC are noted for their &quot;Englishness&quot;. Partridge denied that this was conscious on his part: &quot;I don&#x27;t try to be English. I guess because I am English, it comes out English. But I don&#x27;t sit down and think, &quot;Cor blimey, can I put a union jack and a beefeater&#x27;s outfit on, Mary?&quot; British music critic John Harris identified Partridge&#x27;s XTC compositions as within the same &quot;lineage&quot; of small town English songwriting invented by Ray Davies of the Kinks, and followed by the Jam, the Specials, &quot;scores of half-forgotten punk and new wave bands,&quot; the Smiths and mid 1990s Britpop. In Partridge&#x27;s opinion, the band &quot;never got beyond Swindon.&quot; He also felt that XTC being described as &quot;pastoral&quot; was a compliment: &quot;&#x27;Pastoral&#x27; to me means being more in touch with the country than the city, which I think we are. London gives me the willies.&quot; Lyrically, he cited Ray Davies, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney as his biggest influences.

According to biographer Neville Farmer, Partridge and Moulding tended to write about &quot;more general aspects of their lives and their attitudes&quot;. Farmer added that &quot;Colin nor Andy handle political or religious matters with subtlety. If they have an idea about something, they say it straightforwardly. They are no more embarrassed about their view on the world than Andy is about his sex life. That makes them easy targets for criticism.&quot; For Partridge, other popular subject matter included financial shortage, factory work, comic book characters, seafaring, war, and ancient rituals. He described himself as an atheist and said he did not become interested in politics until circa 1979, when he voted for Margaret Thatcher &quot;purely because she was a woman. I was that naive. Now I&#x27;m very left.&quot;

==Recognition and influence==
Writing for AllMusic, music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine recognised the group thusly:
XTC were one of the progenitors of Britpop, were influential to later power pop acts such as Jellyfish and the Apples in Stereo, and anticipated the indie/art pop bands of the 2000s. They also inspired tribute bands, tribute albums, fan conventions, and fansites. Dave Gregory said that he became aware of XTC&#x27;s &quot;huge&quot; influence on American acts through his interactions with musicians in the late 1980s. They Might Be Giants paid tribute to them in their song, &quot;XTC vs. Adam Ant&quot;. XTC also had a significant influence and cult following in Japan. By the late 1980s, they were supported by three dedicated fanzines in as many countries. Between 1979 and 1992, they had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40.

The band are often compared reverentially to 1960s acts such as the Who, the Kinks, and most frequently, the Beatles. In a 1991 article that focused on a resurgence of power pop groups, members of Jellyfish and the Posies reflected that they were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they influenced. As the Posies&#x27; Jon Auer said: &quot;our &#x27;60s-ish-ness is actually early-&#x27;80s-ish-ness, a pop sensibility that came from listening to Squeeze and XTC&quot;. According to Chris Ingham, acts such as Kula Shaker, the Shamen and the Stone Roses recruited engineer John Leckie chiefly because of his productions for the retro-psychedelic Dukes of Stratosphear records. According to Neville Farmer, the name XTC inspired the names of U2, R.E.M., and INXS. Japanese band Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her was named after the XTC song of similar title. Peter Gabriel is quoted: &quot;I&#x27;ve always looked to XTC for inventive songwriting, innovative production, and a sense of humor. It&#x27;s their strong blend of personalities that make them one of the &quot;great&quot; British bands.&quot; Kurt Cobain of Nirvana said in 1991: &quot;There’s a lot of good pop music. I’ve always liked it…bands like the Beatles, XTC, stuff like that.&quot; Minor Threat, Dag Nasty, and Bad Religion veteran Brian Baker has also cited XTC as an influence.

Discussing the band&#x27;s relative obscurity and lack of financial success, Schabe said that &quot;it&#x27;s difficult to justify claims of greatness without trying to understand exactly why they never managed to rise above the status of cult band. Respect and recognition are the real validation of such claims, not financial success&quot;. Andy Partridge characterized the band as &quot;quietly influential&quot; and thought that the decision to quit touring &quot;definitely affected our popularity later on&quot;. Schabe disagreed that the lack of touring had an effect and wrote that &quot;XTC suffered more from the hands of industry forces than they did from failure to find an audience.&quot; Partridge also estimated that XTC&#x27;s fan demographic had a male/female ratio of about 60–40, which was &quot;reassuring&quot; to him, as he thought the band only appealed to &quot;computer nerds&quot;. In the 1981 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s Book of Rock Lists&quot;, XTC were ranked number 15 for its list of the &quot;17 Loudest Bands in the World&quot;, ahead of Queen and Kiss.

XTC were the only group besides the Stranglers to emerge from the punk scene with a keyboardist. Journalist Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club wrote that their style of &quot;post-punk guitar pop&quot; became popular in the early 2000s among bands such as Kaiser Chiefs, Franz Ferdinand, Hot Hot Heat, and Bloc Party. During the decade, there was a reevaluation of post-punk: Shabe wrote that it &quot;led to XTC being revered in association with the groundbreakers of that era.&quot; Musicologist Alex Ogg listed XTC as one of several &quot;unheralded&quot; events in the history of post-punk, while Eric Klinger of &quot;PopMatters&quot; posited: &quot;You might not hear of bands talking about XTC as a big influence the way they talk about, say, Gang of Four, but they were certainly in the mix that became the music that was to come.&quot;

===British reception===
Despite their &quot;Englishness&quot;, the group&#x27;s fanbase has been more concentrated in the US than the UK. They refused to conform to punk&#x27;s simplicity, a point that the British press initially criticised. Partridge believed &quot;we were trying to push music into a new area. And so we had to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous name calling because we refused to just play stupid.&quot; He recalled that when he played at a jam session with punk bands in the late 1970s, the drummer from X-Ray Spex shouted &quot;Oh, you can fucking &quot;play&quot;, can you? Oh, listen to &quot;him&quot;, he can &quot;play&quot;.&quot; In 1988, writer Chris Hunt observed that &quot;XTC have largely not found favour in their homeland. To a nation that judges success in terms of tabloid coverage and appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the retiring bards of rural olde England didn&#x27;t really strike too loud a chord with the record buying public. XTC had just become &#x27;too weird&#x27; for their own good.&quot; Musician and journalist Dominique Leone argued that they &quot;deserved more than they ever got. From the press, the public, their label, and various managers, XTC have been a tragically under-appreciated band in every sense.&quot;

Swindon did not have a respected music scene as other places in Britain. Partridge cited the group&#x27;s origins as the main reason for their ill-repute: &quot;if we came from a big city like London or Manchester, we would have probably have been heralded as more godlike.&quot; In another interview, he suggested that both their small-town origins and the British class system were reasons for a lack of appreciation in their native country: &quot;XTC were clever and came from Swindon, so therefore we were crap ... I was always jealous of bands like Talking Heads, who were doing similar things to us but were from New York, and therefore cool. But the English don&#x27;t like normal people doing intelligent things.&quot; He remembered the group being advised by their early management to change their accents and deny their Swindon origins, but &quot;we thought it was a badge of honour, coming from the comedy town.&quot;

<doc id="34147" wikidata="Q178481" url="?curid=34147" title="X Window System">
<text>The X Window System (X11, or simply X; stylized ) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems.

X originated as part of Project Athena at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1984. The X protocol has been at version 11 (hence &quot;X11&quot;) since September 1987. The X.Org Foundation leads the X project, with the current reference implementation, X.Org Server, available as free and open-source software under the MIT License and similar permissive licenses.

==Purpose and abilities==

X is an architecture-independent system for remote graphical user interfaces and input device capabilities. Each person using a networked terminal has the ability to interact with the display with any type of user input device.

In its standard distribution it is a complete, albeit simple, display and interface solution which delivers a standard toolkit and protocol stack for building graphical user interfaces on most Unix-like operating systems and OpenVMS, and has been ported to many other contemporary general purpose operating systems.

X provides the basic framework, or primitives, for building such GUI environments: drawing and moving windows on the display and interacting with a mouse, keyboard or touchscreen. X does not mandate the user interface; individual client programs handle this. Programs may use X&#x27;s graphical abilities with no user interface. As such, the visual styling of X-based environments varies greatly; different programs may present radically different interfaces.

Unlike most earlier display protocols, X was specifically designed to be used over network connections rather than on an integral or attached display device. X features network transparency, which means an X program running on a computer somewhere on a network (such as the Internet) can display its user interface on an X server running on some other computer on the network. The X server is typically the provider of graphics resources and keyboard/mouse events to X clients, meaning that the X server is usually running on the computer in front of a human user, while the X client applications run anywhere on the network and communicate with the user&#x27;s computer to request the rendering of graphics content and receive events from input devices including keyboards and mice.

The fact that the term &quot;server&quot; is applied to the software in front of the user is often surprising to users accustomed to their programs being clients to services on remote computers. Here, rather than a remote database being the resource for a local app, the user&#x27;s graphic display and input devices become resources made available by the local X server to both local and remotely hosted X client programs who need to share the user&#x27;s graphics and input devices to communicate with the user.

X&#x27;s network protocol is based on X command primitives. This approach allows both 2D and (through extensions like GLX) 3D operations by an X client application which might be running on a different computer to still be fully accelerated on the X server&#x27;s display. For example, in classic OpenGL (before version 3.0), display lists containing large numbers of objects could be constructed and stored entirely in the X server by a remote X client program, and each then rendered by sending a single glCallList(which) across the network.

X provides no native support for audio; several projects exist to fill this niche, some also providing transparent network support.

==Software architecture==


X uses a client–server model: an X server communicates with various &quot;client&quot; programs. The server accepts requests for graphical output (windows) and sends back user input (from keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen). The server may function as:
* an application displaying to a window of another display system
* a system program controlling the video output of a PC
* a dedicated piece of hardware

This client–server terminologythe user&#x27;s terminal being the server and the applications being the clientsoften confuses new X users, because the terms appear reversed. But X takes the perspective of the application, rather than that of the end-user: X provides display and I/O services to applications, so it is a server; applications use these services, thus they are clients.

The communication protocol between server and client operates network-transparently: the client and server may run on the same machine or on different ones, possibly with different architectures and operating systems. A client and server can even communicate securely over the Internet by tunneling the connection over an encrypted network session.

An X client itself may emulate an X server by providing display services to other clients. This is known as &quot;X nesting&quot;. Open-source clients such as Xnest and Xephyr support such X nesting.

=== Remote desktop ===
To run an X client application on a remote machine, the user may do the following:
* on the local machine, open a terminal window
* use command to connect to the remote machine
* request a local display/input service (e.g., export DISPLAY=&quot;[user&#x27;s machine]&quot;:0 if not using SSH with X forwarding enabled)

The remote X client application will then make a connection to the user&#x27;s local X server, providing display and input to the user.

Alternatively, the local machine may run a small program that connects to the remote machine and starts the client application.

Practical examples of remote clients include:
* administering a remote machine graphically (similar to using remote desktop, but with single windows)
* using a client application to join with large numbers of other terminal users in collaborative workgroups
* running a computationally intensive simulation on a remote machine and displaying the results on a local desktop machine
* running graphical software on several machines at once, controlled by a single display, keyboard and mouse

==User interfaces==


X primarily defines protocol and graphics primitivesit deliberately contains no specification for application user-interface design, such as button, menu, or window title-bar styles. Instead, application softwaresuch as window managers, GUI widget toolkits and desktop environments, or application-specific graphical user interfacesdefine and provide such details. As a result, there is no &quot;typical&quot; X interface and several different desktop environments have become popular among users.

A window manager controls the placement and appearance of application windows. This may result in desktop interfaces reminiscent of those of Microsoft Windows or of the Apple Macintosh (examples include GNOME 2, KDE Plasma, Xfce) or have radically different controls (such as a tiling window manager, like wmii or Ratpoison). Some interfaces such as Sugar or ChromeOS eschew the desktop metaphor altogether, simplifying their interfaces for specialized applications. Window managers range in sophistication and complexity from the bare-bones (&quot;e.g.&quot;, twm, the basic window manager supplied with X, or evilwm, an extremely light window manager) to the more comprehensive desktop environments such as Enlightenment and even to application-specific window managers for vertical markets such as point-of-sale.

Many users use X with a desktop environment, which, aside from the window manager, includes various applications using a consistent user interface. Popular desktop environments include GNOME, KDE Plasma and Xfce. The UNIX 98 standard environment is the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). The freedesktop.org initiative addresses interoperability between desktops and the components needed for a competitive X desktop.

==Implementations==
The X.Org implementation is the canonical implementation of X. Owing to liberal licensing, a number of variations, both free and open source and proprietary, have appeared. Commercial Unix vendors have tended to take the reference implementation and adapt it for their hardware, usually customizing it and adding proprietary extensions.

Until 2004, XFree86 provided the most common X variant on free Unix-like systems. XFree86 started as a port of X to 386-compatible PCs and, by the end of the 1990s, had become the greatest source of technical innovation in X and the &quot;de facto&quot; standard of X development. Since 2004, however, the X.Org Server, a fork of XFree86, has become predominant.

While it is common to associate X with Unix, X servers also exist natively within other graphical environments. VMS Software Inc.&#x27;s OpenVMS operating system includes a version of X with Common Desktop Environment (CDE), known as DECwindows, as its standard desktop environment. Apple originally ported X to macOS in the form of X11.app, but that has been deprecated in favor of the XQuartz implementation. Third-party servers under Apple&#x27;s older operating systems in the 1990s, System 7, and Mac OS 8 and 9, included Apple&#x27;s MacX and White Pine Software&#x27;s eXodus.

Microsoft Windows is not shipped with support for X, but many third-party implementations exist, as free and open source software such as Cygwin/X, and proprietary products such as Exceed, MKS X/Server, Reflection X, X-Win32 and Xming.

There are also Java implementations of X servers. WeirdX runs on any platform supporting Swing 1.1, and will run as an applet within most browsers. The Android X Server is an open source Java implementation that runs on Android devices.

When an operating system with a native windowing system hosts X in addition, the X system can either use its own normal desktop in a separate host window or it can run &quot;rootless&quot;, meaning the X desktop is hidden and the host windowing environment manages the geometry and appearance of the hosted X windows within the host screen.

===X terminals===
An &quot;X terminal&quot; is a thin client that only runs an X server. This architecture became popular for building inexpensive terminal parks for many users to simultaneously use the same large computer server to execute application programs as clients of each user&#x27;s X terminal. This use is very much aligned with the original intention of the MIT project.

X terminals explore the network (the local broadcast domain) using the X Display Manager Control Protocol to generate a list of available hosts that are allowed as clients. One of the client hosts should run an X display manager.

A limitation of X terminals and most thin clients is that they are not capable of any input or output other than the keyboard, mouse, and display. All relevant data is assumed to exist solely on the remote server, and the X terminal user has no methods available to save or load data from a local peripheral device.

Dedicated (hardware) X terminals have fallen out of use; a PC or modern thin client with an X server typically provides the same functionality at the same, or lower, cost.

==Limitations and criticism==

&quot;The Unix-Haters Handbook&quot; (1994) devoted a full chapter to the problems of X. &quot;Why X Is Not Our Ideal Window System&quot; (1990) by Gajewska, Manasse and McCormack detailed problems in the protocol with recommendations for improvement.

===User interface issues===
The lack of design guidelines in X has resulted in several vastly different interfaces, and in applications that have not always worked well together. The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM), a specification for client interoperability, has a reputation for being difficult to implement correctly. Further standards efforts such as Motif and CDE did not alleviate problems. This has frustrated users and programmers. Graphics programmers now generally address consistency of application look and feel and communication by coding to a specific desktop environment or to a specific widget toolkit, which also avoids having to deal directly with the ICCCM.

X also lacks native support for user-defined stored procedures on the X server, in the manner of NeWSthere is no Turing-complete scripting facility. Various desktop environments may thus offer their own (usually mutually incompatible) facilities.

===Computer accessibility related issues===
Systems built upon X may have accessibility issues that make utilization of a computer difficult for disabled users, including right click, double click, middle click, mouse-over, and focus stealing. Some X11 clients deal with accessibility issues better than others, so persons with accessibility problems are not locked out of using X11. However, there is no accessibility standard or accessibility guidelines for X11. Within the X11 standards process there is no working group on accessibility; however, accessibility needs are being addressed by software projects to provide these features on top of X.

The Orca project adds accessibility support to the X Window System, including implementing an API (AT-SPI). This is coupled with GNOME&#x27;s ATK to allow for accessibility features to be implemented in X programs using the GNOME/GTK APIs. KDE provides a different set of accessibility software, including a text-to-speech converter and a screen magnifier. The other major desktops (LXDE, Xfce and Enlightenment) attempt to be compatible with ATK.

===Network===
An X client cannot generally be detached from one server and reattached to another unless its code specifically provides for it (Emacs is one of the few common programs with this ability). As such, moving an entire session from one X server to another is generally not possible. However, approaches like Virtual Network Computing (VNC), NX and Xpra allow a virtual session to be reached from different X servers (in a manner similar to GNU Screen in relation to terminals), and other applications and toolkits provide related facilities. Workarounds like x11vnc (&quot;VNC :0 viewers&quot;), Xpra&#x27;s shadow mode and NX&#x27;s nxagent shadow mode also exist to make the current X-server screen available. This ability allows the user interface (mouse, keyboard, monitor) of a running application to be switched from one location to another without stopping and restarting the application.

Network traffic between an X server and remote X clients is not encrypted by default. An attacker with a packet sniffer can intercept it, making it possible to view anything displayed to or sent from the user&#x27;s screen. The most common way to encrypt X traffic is to establish a Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel for communication.

Like all thin clients, when using X across a network, bandwidth limitations can impede the use of bitmap-intensive applications that require rapidly updating large portions of the screen with low latency, such as 3D animation or photo editing. Even a relatively small &quot;uncompressed&quot; 640×480×24 bit 30 fps video stream (~211 Mbit/s) can easily outstrip the bandwidth of a 100 Mbit/s network for a single client. In contrast, modern versions of X generally have extensions such as Mesa allowing local display of a local program&#x27;s graphics to be optimized to bypass the network model and directly control the video card, for use with full-screen video, rendered 3D applications, and other such applications.

===Client–server separation===
X&#x27;s design requires the clients and server to operate separately, and device independence and the separation of client and server incur overhead. Most of the overhead comes from network round-trip delay time between client and server (latency) rather than from the protocol itself: the best solutions to performance issues depend on efficient application design. A common criticism of X is that its network features result in excessive complexity and decreased performance if only used locally.

Modern X implementations use Unix domain sockets for efficient connections on the same host. Additionally shared memory (via the MIT-SHM extension) can be employed for faster client–server communication. However, the programmer must still explicitly activate and use the shared memory extension. It is also necessary to provide fallback paths in order to stay compatible with older implementations, and in order to communicate with non-local X servers.

==Competitors==
Some people have attempted writing alternatives to and replacements for X. Historical alternatives include Sun&#x27;s NeWS and NeXT&#x27;s Display PostScript, both PostScript-based systems supporting user-definable display-side procedures, which X lacked. Current alternatives include:
* macOS (and its mobile counterpart, iOS) implements its windowing system, which is known as Quartz. When Apple Computer bought NeXT, and used NeXTSTEP to construct Mac OS X, it replaced Display PostScript with Quartz. Mike Paquette, one of the authors of Quartz, explained that if Apple had added support for all the features it wanted to include into X11, it would not bear much resemblance to X11 nor be compatible with other servers anyway.
* Wayland is being developed by several X.Org developers as a prospective replacement for X. It works directly with the GPU hardware, via DRI. Wayland can run an X server as a Wayland compositor, which can be rootless. The project reached version 1.0 in 2012. Like Android, Wayland is EGL-based.
* Mir was a project from Canonical Ltd. with goals similar to Wayland. Mir was intended to work with mobile devices using ARM chipsets (a stated goal was compatibility with Android device-drivers) as well as x86 desktops. Like Android, Mir/UnityNext were EGL-based. Backwards compatibility with X client-applications was accomplished via Xmir. The project has since moved to being a Wayland compositor instead of being an alternative display server.
* Other alternatives attempt to avoid the overhead of X by working directly with the hardware; such projects include DirectFB. The Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) provides a kernel-level interface to the framebuffer.

Additional ways to achieve a functional form of the &quot;network transparency&quot; feature of X, via network transmissibility of graphical services, include:
* Virtual Network Computing (VNC), a very low-level system which sends compressed bitmaps across the network; the Unix implementation includes an X server
* Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which is similar to VNC in purpose, but originated on Microsoft Windows before being ported to Unix-like systems, &quot;e.g.&quot; NX
* Citrix XenApp, an X-like protocol and application stack for Microsoft Windows
* Tarantella, which provides a Java-based remote-gui-client for use in web browsers

==History==
===Predecessors===
Several bitmap display systems preceded X. From Xerox came the Alto (1973) and the Star (1981). From Apollo Computer came Display Manager (1981). From Apple came the Lisa (1983) and the Macintosh (1984). The Unix world had the Andrew Project (1982) and Rob Pike&#x27;s Blit terminal (1982).

Carnegie Mellon University produced a remote-access application called Alto Terminal, that displayed overlapping windows on the Xerox Alto, and made remote hosts (typically DEC VAX systems running Unix) responsible for handling window-exposure events and refreshing window contents as necessary.

X derives its name as a successor to a pre-1983 window system called W (the letter preceding X in the English alphabet). W ran under the V operating system. W used a network protocol supporting terminal and graphics windows, the server maintaining display lists.

===Origin and early development===
The original idea of X emerged at MIT in 1984 as a collaboration between Jim Gettys (of Project Athena) and Bob Scheifler (of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science). Scheifler needed a usable display environment for debugging the Argus system. Project Athena (a joint project between DEC, MIT and IBM to provide easy access to computing resources for all students) needed a platform-independent graphics system to link together its heterogeneous multiple-vendor systems; the window system then under development in Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Andrew Project did not make licenses available, and no alternatives existed.

The project solved this by creating a protocol that could both run local applications and call on remote resources. In mid-1983 an initial port of W to Unix ran at one-fifth of its speed under V; in May 1984, Scheifler replaced the synchronous protocol of W with an protocol and the display lists with immediate mode graphics to make X version 1. X became the first windowing system environment to offer true hardware independence and vendor independence.

Scheifler, Gettys and Ron Newman set to work and X progressed rapidly. They released Version 6 in January 1985. DEC, then preparing to release its first Ultrix workstation, judged X the only windowing system likely to become available in time. DEC engineers ported X6 to DEC&#x27;s QVSS display on MicroVAX.

In the second quarter of 1985, X acquired color support to function in the DEC VAXstation-II/GPX, forming what became version 9.

A group at Brown University ported version 9 to the IBM RT PC, but problems with reading unaligned data on the RT forced an incompatible protocol change, leading to version 10 in late 1985. X10R1 was released in 1985. By 1986, outside organizations had begun asking for X. X10R2 was released in January 1986, then X10R3 in February 1986. Although MIT had licensed X6 to some outside groups for a fee, it decided at this time to license X10R3 and future versions under what became known as the MIT License, intending to popularize X further and, in return, hoping that many more applications would become available. X10R3 became the first version to achieve wide deployment, with both DEC and Hewlett-Packard releasing products based on it. Other groups ported X10 to Apollo and to Sun workstations and even to the IBM PC/AT. Demonstrations of the first commercial application for X (a mechanical computer-aided engineering system from Cognition Inc. that ran on VAXes and remotely displayed on PCs running an X server ported by Jim Fulton and Jan Hardenbergh) took place at the Autofact trade show at that time. The last version of X10, X10R4, appeared in December 1986. Attempts were made to enable X servers as real-time collaboration devices, much as Virtual Network Computing (VNC) would later allow a desktop to be shared. One such early effort was Philip J. Gust&#x27;s SharedX tool.

Although X10 offered interesting and powerful functionality, it had become obvious that the X protocol could use a more hardware-neutral redesign before it became too widely deployed, but MIT alone would not have the resources available for such a complete redesign. As it happened, DEC&#x27;s Western Software Laboratory found itself between projects with an experienced team. Smokey Wallace of DEC WSL and Jim Gettys proposed that DEC WSL build X11 and make it freely available under the same terms as X9 and X10. This process started in May 1986, with the protocol finalized in August. Alpha testing of the software started in February 1987, beta-testing in May; the release of X11 finally occurred on 15 September 1987.

The X11 protocol design, led by Scheifler, was extensively discussed on open mailing lists on the nascent Internet that were bridged to USENET newsgroups. Gettys moved to California to help lead the X11 development work at WSL from DEC&#x27;s Systems Research Center, where Phil Karlton and Susan Angebrandt led the X11 sample server design and implementation. X therefore represents one of the first very large-scale distributed free and open source software projects.

===The MIT X Consortium and the X Consortium, Inc.===
By the late 1980s X was, Simson Garfinkel wrote in 1989, &quot;Athena&#x27;s most important single achievement to date&quot;. DEC reportedly believed that its development alone had made the company&#x27;s donation to MIT worthwhile. Gettys joined the design team for the VAXstation 2000 to ensure that X—which DEC called DECwindows—would run on it, and the company assigned 1,200 employees to port X to both Ultrix and VMS. In 1987, with the success of X11 becoming apparent, MIT wished to relinquish the stewardship of X, but at a June 1987 meeting with nine vendors, the vendors told MIT that they believed in the need for a neutral party to keep X from fragmenting in the marketplace. In January 1988, the &quot;MIT X Consortium&quot; formed as a non-profit vendor group, with Scheifler as director, to direct the future development of X in a neutral atmosphere inclusive of commercial and educational interests.

Jim Fulton joined in January 1988 and Keith Packard in March 1988 as senior developers, with Jim focusing on Xlib, fonts, window managers, and utilities; and Keith re-implementing the server. Donna Converse, Chris D. Peterson, and Stephen Gildea joined later that year, focusing on toolkits and widget sets, working closely with Ralph Swick of MIT Project Athena. The MIT X Consortium produced several significant revisions to X11, the first (Release 2X11R2) in February 1988. Jay Hersh joined the staff in January 1991 to work on the PEX and X113D functionality. He was followed soon after by Ralph Mor (who also worked on PEX) and Dave Sternlicht. In 1993, as the MIT X Consortium prepared to depart from MIT, the staff were joined by R. Gary Cutbill, Kaleb Keithley, and David Wiggins.

In 1993, the X Consortium, Inc. (a non-profit corporation) formed as the successor to the MIT X Consortium. It released X11R6 on 16 May 1994. In 1995 it took on the development of the Motif toolkit and of the Common Desktop Environment for Unix systems. The X Consortium dissolved at the end of 1996, producing a final revision, X11R6.3, and a legacy of increasing commercial influence in the development.

===The Open Group===
In January 1997, the X Consortium passed stewardship of X to The Open Group, a vendor group formed in early 1996 by the merger of the Open Software Foundation and X/Open.

The Open Group released X11R6.4 in early 1998. Controversially, X11R6.4 departed from the traditional liberal licensing terms, as the Open Group sought to assure funding for the development of X, and specifically cited XFree86 as not significantly contributing to X. The new terms would have made X no longer free software: zero-cost for noncommercial use, but a fee otherwise. After XFree86 seemed poised to fork, the Open Group relicensed X11R6.4 under the traditional license in September 1998. The Open Group&#x27;s last release came as X11R6.4 patch 3.

===X.Org and XFree86===
XFree86 originated in 1992 from the X386 server for IBM PC compatibles included with X11R5 in 1991, written by Thomas Roell and Mark W. Snitily and donated to the MIT X Consortium by Snitily Graphics Consulting Services (SGCS). XFree86 evolved over time from just one port of X to the leading and most popular implementation and the &quot;de facto&quot; standard of X&#x27;s development.

In May 1999, The Open Group formed X.Org. X.Org supervised the release of versions X11R6.5.1 onward. X development at this time had become moribund; most technical innovation since the X Consortium had dissolved had taken place in the XFree86 project. In 1999, the XFree86 team joined X.Org as an honorary (non-paying) member, encouraged by various hardware companies interested in using XFree86 with Linux and in its status as the most popular version of X.

By 2003, while the popularity of Linux (and hence the installed base of X) surged, X.Org remained inactive, and active development took place largely within XFree86. However, considerable dissent developed within XFree86. The XFree86 project suffered from a perception of a far too cathedral-like development model; developers could not get CVS commit access and vendors had to maintain extensive patch sets. In March 2003, the XFree86 organization expelled Keith Packard, who had joined XFree86 after the end of the original MIT X Consortium, with considerable ill feeling.

X.Org and XFree86 began discussing a reorganisation suited to properly nurturing the development of X. Jim Gettys had been pushing strongly for an open development model since at least 2000. Gettys, Packard and several others began discussing in detail the requirements for the effective governance of X with open development.

Finally, in an echo of the X11R6.4 licensing dispute, XFree86 released version 4.4 in February 2004 under a more restrictive license which many projects relying on X found unacceptable. The added clause to the license was based on the original BSD license&#x27;s advertising clause, which was viewed by the Free Software Foundation and Debian as incompatible with the GNU General Public License. Other groups saw it as against the spirit of the original X. Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD, for instance, threatened to fork XFree86 citing license concerns. The license issue, combined with the difficulties in getting changes in, left many feeling the time was ripe for a fork.

===The X.Org Foundation===
In early 2004, various people from X.Org and freedesktop.org formed the X.Org Foundation, and the Open Group gave it control of the codice_1 domain name. This marked a radical change in the governance of X. Whereas the stewards of X since 1988 (including the prior X.Org) had been vendor organizations, the Foundation was led by software developers and used community development based on the bazaar model, which relies on outside involvement. Membership was opened to individuals, with corporate membership being in the form of sponsorship. Several major corporations such as Hewlett-Packard currently support the X.Org Foundation.

The Foundation takes an oversight role over X development: technical decisions are made on their merits by achieving rough consensus among community members. Technical decisions are not made by the board of directors; in this sense, it is strongly modelled on the technically non-interventionist GNOME Foundation. The Foundation employs no developers.
The Foundation released X11R6.7, the X.Org Server, in April 2004, based on XFree86 4.4RC2 with X11R6.6 changes merged. Gettys and Packard had taken the last version of XFree86 under the old license and, by making a point of an open development model and retaining GPL compatibility, brought many of the old XFree86 developers on board.

While X11 had received extensions such as OpenGL support during the 1990s, its architecture had remained fundamentally unchanged during the decade. In the early part of the 2000s, however, it was overhauled to resolve a number of problems that had surfaced over the years, including a &quot;flawed&quot; font architecture, a 2D graphics system &quot;which had always been intended to be augmented and/or replaced&quot;, and latency issues.
X11R6.8 came out in September 2004. It added significant new features, including preliminary support for translucent windows and other sophisticated visual effects, screen magnifiers and thumbnailers, and facilities to integrate with 3D immersive display systems such as Sun&#x27;s Project Looking Glass and the Croquet project. External applications called &quot;compositing window managers&quot; provide policy for the visual appearance.

On 21 December 2005, X.Org released X11R6.9, the monolithic source tree for legacy users, and X11R7.0, the same source code separated into independent modules, each maintainable in separate projects. The Foundation released X11R7.1 on 22 May 2006, about four months after 7.0, with considerable feature improvements.

XFree86 development continued for a few more years, 4.8.0 being released on 15 December 2008.

==Nomenclature==
The proper names for the system are listed in the manual page as X; X Window System; X Version 11; X Window System, Version 11; or X11.

The term &quot;X-Windows&quot; (in the manner of the subsequently released &quot;Microsoft Windows&quot;) is not officially endorsedwith X Consortium release manager Matt Landau stating in 1993, &quot;There is no such thing as &#x27;X Windows&#x27; or &#x27;X Window&#x27;, despite the repeated misuse of the forms by the trade rags&quot;though it has been in common informal use since early in the history of X and has been used deliberately for provocative effect, for example in the &quot;Unix-Haters Handbook&quot;.

===Key terms===
The X Window System has nuanced usage of a number of terms when compared to common usage, particularly &quot;display&quot; and &quot;screen&quot;, a subset of which is given here for convenience:
; device: A graphics device such as a computer graphics card or a computer motherboard&#x27;s integrated graphics chipset.
; monitor: A physical device such as a CRT or a flat screen computer display.
; screen: An area into which graphics may be rendered, either through software alone into system memory as with VNC, or within a graphics device, some of which can render into more than one screen simultaneously, either viewable simultaneously or interchangeably. Interchangeable screens are often set up to be notionally left and right from one another, flipping from one to the next as the mouse pointer reaches the edge of the monitor.
; virtual screen: Two different meanings are associated with this term:
:* A technique allowing panning a monitor around a screen running at a larger resolution than the monitor is currently displaying.
:* An effect simulated by a window manager by maintaining window position information in a larger coordinate system than the screen and allowing panning by simply moving the windows in response to the user.
; display: A collection of screens, often involving multiple monitors, generally configured to allow the mouse to move the pointer to any position within them. Linux-based workstations are usually capable of having multiple displays, among which the user can switch with a special keyboard combination such as control-alt-&quot;function-key&quot;, simultaneously flipping all the monitors from showing the screens of one display to the screens in another.

The term &quot;display&quot; should not be confused with the more specialized jargon &quot;Zaphod display&quot;. The latter is a rare configuration allowing multiple users of a single computer to each have an independent set of display, mouse, and keyboard, as though they were using separate computers, but at a lower per-seat cost.

<text>Xena is a fictional character from the &quot;&quot; franchise, portrayed by New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless and co-created by Robert Tapert and John Schulian. She first appeared as a villain in the 1995–1999 television series &quot;&quot; before joining forces with Hercules. Xena was popular with fans, so the producers decided to create a spin-off with the character in the starring role. She later appeared in the of the same name, as well as the spin-off animated film &quot;The Battle for Mount Olympus&quot;, and non-canon expanded universe material, such as and .

Xena is the protagonist of the story, and the series depicts her on a quest to redeem herself from her dark past by using her formidable fighting skills to help people. She is joined by the bard Gabrielle, and together they go up against ruthless warlords and gods in the ancient mythological world. Xena was raised as the daughter of Cyrene and Atrius in Amphipolis; though the episode &quot;The Furies&quot; raises the possibility that Ares might be Xena&#x27;s biological father, it is never pursued further. She has two brothers, the younger of whom is dead.

==Creation and production==

Xena was developed in 1995 by John Schulian as a minor character in &quot;&quot;, although Lawless had already appeared as the character Lyla in the episode &quot;As Darkness Falls&quot;. Xena was originally conceived to die at the end of the third episode, &quot;Unchained Heart&quot;, but when the studio decided they wanted to do a spin-off from &quot;Hercules&quot;, producer Robert Tapert said that Xena was the best choice, since she was largely well received by television critics and fans and had a full story to be explored. The studio wanted a spinoff about &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;, but Tapert said that show would be too similar to &quot;Hercules&quot;.

The original choice to play Xena was British actress Vanessa Angel, but she became ill and had to decline the role. Ultimately the role was given to Lawless as she was already a resident of New Zealand. Lawless had several mishaps playing the character due to the stunts (some of which she performed herself), such as getting cut by swords, being struck in the head, and horse-related incidents. In 1996, while rehearsing a sketch for &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,&quot; she broke her hip when she was thrown from a horse. As a result, several episodes of season two were edited to accommodate her recovery, some were changed so Lawless could appear only briefly, and new episodes were written to highlight Gabrielle and supporting characters.

Bruce Campbell, Rose McIver, Hudson Leick, and Ted Raimi also portrayed Xena in various episodes as a result of &quot;body-swap&quot; plotlines.

The name &quot;Xena&quot; derives from the ancient Greek (&quot;xenos&quot;), meaning &quot;stranger&quot;.

==Appearances and development==

===Origins on &quot;Hercules&quot;===
Xena originally appears as a villain in the &quot;Hercules&quot; episode &quot;The Warrior Princess&quot;. Ten years into her career of pillaging and marauding, Xena meets Hercules. Initially, she sets out to kill him. In &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, her army turns against her, believing that she has become weak after she stops her lieutenant, Darphus, from killing a child in a sacked village. Xena runs a gauntlet and survives, becoming the only person ever to survive the gauntlet. She then fights Hercules in the hope that she will regain her army if she can bring back his head. Xena seems to be getting the upper hand until Iolaus intervenes, inadvertently giving Hercules his sword, which allows him to fight Xena on equal ground and defeat her. However, Hercules refuses to kill Xena, telling her, &quot;Killing isn&#x27;t the only way of proving you&#x27;re a warrior&quot;. Inspired by Hercules&#x27; integrity, and by the fact that he too lost family and yet chooses to fight in their honor, she decides to join him and defeat her old army.

In &quot;Unchained Heart&quot;, the two share a brief romantic relationship before Xena decides to leave and start making amends for her past.

===Fictional character history===

====Initial turn to evil====
Several years prior to the series pilot, &quot;Sins of the Past&quot;, Xena commits numerous deeds from terrorism to piracy and murder; at one point, she becomes known as the &quot;Destroyer of Nations&quot;. Her journey down the path of evil arguably begins when her brother is killed during an attack by the warlord Cortese. Xena vows revenge and becomes estranged from her mother as a result.

Later she acts as the captain of a pirate ship, raiding ships and ransoming hostages. It is during one ransom attempt that she encounters a young Roman nobleman named Julius Caesar. Caesar is an experienced warrior and military commander with grand ambitions. He and Xena have a passionate love affair and plan to join forces. Caesar, however, betrays Xena. Caesar has Xena beaten and crucified (with her legs broken) on a beach to die of exposure, but she is saved by an Egyptian slave girl named M&#x27;Lila. M&#x27;Lila had originally stowed away on Xena&#x27;s ship and subsequently befriends her and teaches Xena how to use pressure points. After saving Xena, M&#x27;Lila takes her to a healer who treats her injuries. While the healer is treating Xena, Roman soldiers burst in and try to kill Xena, but M&#x27;Lila shields Xena, takes a fatal shot from a crossbow and dies in Xena&#x27;s arms.

This event drives Xena to the side of evil completely. Despite her injuries, she kills the soldiers but warns the last one before he dies, &quot;Tell Hades to prepare himself; a new Xena is born tonight.&quot;

====First steps towards redemption====
Afterward, Xena becomes the leader of an army and aligns herself with Borias, seducing him away from his family and the two join forces. The two become lovers and Xena eventually becomes pregnant with her son Solan. During her pregnancy, Xena travels with her army to China, where she hopes to build an alliance with the powerful Lao family.

Borias betrays Xena, leading to Xena running for her life and being hunted. While on the run, Xena meets Lao Ma, a woman with special abilities. She scares away the hounds chasing Xena with just a look and can move like a martial artist which awes Xena. Lao Ma cares for Xena, and under her friend&#x27;s guidance, she learns to put aside much of her hatred and pain. Lao Ma heals Xena&#x27;s crippled legs and it is implied that she teaches Xena fighting moves she had not yet developed. Lao Ma gives Xena the metaphorical title &quot;Warrior Princess&quot;, intending that she be a major catalyst for change in the land.

Borias and Xena reconcile and renew their alliance, only to break it a final time and split their forces between them, with Xena proving the stronger of the two. Borias is killed in the ensuing battle, and Xena gives the newborn Solan to the centaurs to raise.

====Encounter with Hercules and subsequent reform====
Xena continues her life as a warlord for many years. She turns against her troops to protect a baby whose family would not pay the ransom she demanded. Her troops try to kill Xena for becoming weak in their eyes. After these events, Xena travels with Hercules for a short time and they share a brief romantic relationship. While their romance does not last long, the two form a special friendship. In &quot;Prometheus&quot;, each acknowledges the positive impact the other had on the world.

====Meeting Gabrielle====
Haunted by her past transgressions, she is about to give up on her life as a warrior completely. In the episode &quot;Sins of the Past&quot;, she strips off her armor and weapons and buries them in the dirt. She sees a group of village girls being attacked by a band of warriors. In the group is Gabrielle. Xena saves the young women and warns an awestruck Gabrielle not to follow her.

Gabrielle follows Xena in a quest to persuade Xena to let her be her traveling companion. Xena returns to her hometown, Amphipolis, and eventually reconciles with her mother, Cyrene. She also visits the grave of her brother Lyceus. When Xena privately confides with Lyceus that it is difficult to be alone, Gabrielle—who is silently standing in the doorway of the crypt—tells her, &quot;You&#x27;re not alone.&quot; Soon, Xena agrees to allow Gabrielle to travel with her. Over time, Gabrielle becomes Xena&#x27;s dearest friend and soulmate.

====Subsequent travels and hardships====
Gabrielle and Xena become best friends, soulmates and constant companions over the many adventures that follow. Each of the women learns from the other; Gabrielle becomes a warrior on behalf of good, while Xena develops a softer and more loving personality to balance her warrior&#x27;s heart. Xena&#x27;s life is marred by many tragedies. Her son Solan, who never came to know her as his mother, is killed by Hope, Gabrielle&#x27;s demonic child, (with the help of Callisto); and Gabrielle nearly dies many times.

The instances where Xena and Gabrielle almost part ways tend to result from the outside manipulations of others. After Gabrielle&#x27;s demonic daughter Hope kills Xena&#x27;s son, Gabrielle, consumed with grief, journeys to stay with the Amazons. Xena locates her and tries to kill Gabrielle by throwing her over a cliff while she is in a weakened state. Xena fails and both women reconcile with the help of Solan&#x27;s spirit. Solan creates the land of Illusia wherein, through music, both women express their grief and anger at each other and the traumas they have endured. Xena confesses that she did indeed kill Ming T&#x27;ien because he killed his mother Lao Ma. Xena admits to Solan that she is his mother and asks his forgiveness.

====Enemies====

Soon after the start of her journeys with Gabrielle, Xena runs into Ares, who has known her since her warlord days and he tries to seduce her into joining him as his Warrior Queen, which she repeatedly thwarts. She also encounters a formidable warrior woman named Callisto, whose family was killed by Xena&#x27;s army years ago and has since vowed her revenge.

====The path to redemption continues====
Marcus, a warrior, close friend and lover from her warlord days, whom she persuades to follow her in choosing good, is killed while doing his first good deed. Later he is allowed to briefly return to the world of the living to help thwart a vicious killer who has escaped from the Underworld. He and Xena spend a night together before Marcus has to return to the other side. Several years after her first meeting with Lao Ma, a messenger is sent by Lao Ma to ask Xena to travel to China to aid in stopping a great evil. She sets out without delay, but insists that she must deal with this alone and that Gabrielle stay behind.

Xena arrives too late to save her mentor and friend Lao Ma from being tortured to death by her own son, the emperor Ming T&#x27;ien and is crushed with the loss. Finally, she and Gabrielle are crucified by the Romans on the Ides of March by her former lover Caesar. Caesar himself is betrayed and killed by Brutus. They are later revived by a mystic named Eli, along with the spiritual aid of Callisto, who became a demon and then an angel after Xena killed her.

====Eve/Livia====
This leads to the birth of Xena&#x27;s daughter, Eve. After Xena lets Callisto die, she is sent to Tartarus but later returns and becomes a god and an even greater enemy of Xena. Finally Xena attempts to save Callisto from her suffering by sacrificing herself. Callisto becomes an angel and Xena a demon. Before Eve is born, Callisto the angel implants her soul in Xena&#x27;s unborn baby as a way to redeem herself from her past. Mother and daughter have little time together, as Eve is prophesied to bring about the Twilight of the Olympian gods and the rise of the One God. To stop the gods from pursuing the infant Eve, Xena and Gabrielle fake their deaths, but their plan goes awry when Ares buries them in an ice cave, where they sleep for 25 years.

During that time, Eve is adopted by the Roman nobleman Octavius. She grows up to become Livia, the Champion of Rome and a ruthless persecutor of Eli&#x27;s followers. In a sense she has become a reincarnation of Callisto. Eve&#x27;s ruthless behavior may be due to the influence of Callisto&#x27;s soul, but this is unclear, particularly since Callisto was purged of all the evil within her when she became an angel. After her return, Xena is able to turn Livia to repentance, and Livia takes back the name Eve and becomes the Messenger of Eli. After Eve&#x27;s cleansing by baptism, Xena is granted the power to kill gods as long as her daughter lives. In a final confrontation, the Twilight comes to pass when Xena kills most of the gods to save her daughter, with the help of God and Archangel Michael, and is herself saved by Ares when he gives up his immortality to heal the badly injured and dying Eve and Gabrielle. Xena later helps him regain his godhood.

====Final redemption and death====
Xena&#x27;s quest for redemption ends when she sacrifices herself to kill the Japanese demon Yodoshi, who is holding the souls of the dead. Xena single-handedly fights the Japanese army and dies. Xena, now a spirit, fights and kills Yodoshi. Xena decides to stay dead so the souls of the 40,000 she accidentally killed years ago can be released into a state of peace. The series ends with Gabrielle on a ship, holding Xena&#x27;s ashes and speaking with Xena&#x27;s spirit.

====Legacy====
According to the darshan, Naiyima, this is only one of many lives Xena will live throughout the ages. One such life is that of Arminestra, an Indian holy mother who leads a movement that preaches peace. Another is a transcriber of ancient languages named Melinda Pappas who uncovers the tomb of Ares during WWII and is possessed by the spirit of Xena to stop the God of War. In many of those lives, she will walk a path together with her soulmate, Gabrielle, furthering the cause of good against evil.

===Skills and abilities===
Xena has many skills that she acquired during her extensive travels across the ancient world throughout the years. She has remarkable skill and prowess in hand-to-hand combat, displaying numerous acrobatic tricks and the ability to disable or otherwise kill multiple opponents at once. She is also skilled in the use of pressure points – being able to cripple or even kill someone if she triggers the appropriate pressure point. Xena has extensive knowledge of first aid and herbal remedies that rivals any professional healer.

Xena&#x27;s signature weapon is the chakram, a razor-edged throwing weapon which she often uses for ranged combat. Xena can skillfully deflect the chakram off the surfaces it strikes, allowing her to hit multiple targets in one throw. She can deflect the chakram back towards her, allowing her to catch it. Besides being a formidable weapon, the chakram has other uses such as distracting enemies or quickly cutting distant ropes. After breaking in half, Xena reforged her chakram with diameter &quot;handles&quot;, called the &quot;Yin-Yang&quot; chakram. These were utilized as daggers, could split in two mid-flight to strike multiple different targets, and allowed for &quot;boomerang&quot; flight capabilities. Along with her sword and chakram, she has also shown great proficiency with other weapons such as staves, daggers, and whips. Xena often utilized a signature war cry, &quot;Alalaes&quot;. Her cry was an alternate pronunciation for &quot;Alale&quot; (or &quot;Alala&quot;), who in Greek mythology was the female personification of the war cry.

Xena is a formidable tactician, inspirational leader, and strategic thinker. She has the ability to analyze her enemy&#x27;s tactics and effectively formulate a response. In responding to her enemies&#x27; attacks, she demonstrates creativity and ingenuity; at times, she has worked with little or no resources and limited time. Xena is well versed in military tactics such as forming a defensive perimeter, building defensive fortifications, organizing and leading troops, and cutting an enemy&#x27;s supply lines. She also repeatedly demonstrates a talent for disguises, infiltration, and cryptography.

Although the majority of her skills are martial and mental, Xena does have some supernatural abilities. On three occasions, she used telekinesis and energy projection thanks to Lao Ma&#x27;s teachings. Xena also once possessed the power to kill gods through her daughter, Eve. Outside of these specific powers, Xena knows the rudiments of most other forms of magic, enough that she can effectively battle or outwit magic-wielding opponents.

==In other media==
Xena has appeared in all of the series spin-offs, usually as the lead character. The animated movie &quot;Hercules and Xena: The Battle for Mount Olympus&quot; marks the first appearance of Xena outside of the television series. She also appears in the comics series &quot;&quot; originally released by Topps and Dark Horse Comics. In 2007, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the rights. This resulted in Dynamite Entertainment&#x27;s spin-off comic book series &quot;Xena: Contest of the Pantheons&quot; and &quot;Dark Xena&quot;. This last takes place after the television series ended.

Xena is a playable character in the videogames &quot;,&quot; and a selectable character in &quot;.&quot; In 1999, Lucy Lawless also appeared in the animated television show &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as Xena during the Treehouse of Horror X. In the video game &quot;League of Legends&quot;, the character Sivir has a skin titled &quot;Warrior Princess&quot; that resembles Xena.

A statue of Xena made an appearance in &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;, confirmed by the film&#x27;s director Sam Raimi. However, the statue did not indicate any bigger relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and only served as a fun easter egg with no narrative subtext.

==Reception and legacy==

===Lesbian subtext and debates===
&quot;Xena&quot; has enjoyed a particular cult status in the lesbian community. Some of the lesbian fanbase see Xena and Gabrielle as a couple and have embraced them as role models and lesbian icons. A group called The Marching Xenas participated in many gay and lesbian pride parades.

A subject of much interest and debate among viewers is the question of whether Xena and Gabrielle are lovers. The issue is left deliberately ambiguous by the writers during most of the show. Jokes, innuendo, and other subtle evidence of a romantic relationship between Xena and Gabrielle are referred to as &quot;lesbian subtext&quot; or simply &quot;subtext&quot; by fans. The issue of the true nature of the Xena/Gabrielle relationship caused intense shipping debates in the fandom, which turned especially impassioned due to spillover from real-life debates about same-sex sexuality and gay rights.

In a 2003 interview with &quot;Lesbian News&quot; magazine, Lawless stated that after the series finale, she had come to believe that Xena and Gabrielle&#x27;s relationship was &quot;Gay. Definitely... There was always a &#x27;Well, she might be or she might not be,&#x27; but when there was that drip of water passing between their lips in the very final scene, that cemented it for me. Now it wasn&#x27;t just that Xena was bisexual and kinda liked her gal pal and they kind of fooled around sometimes, it was &#x27;Nope, they&#x27;re married, man&#x27;.&quot;

The &quot;Xena&quot; fandom also popularized the term Altfic (from &quot;alternative fiction&quot;) to refer to same-sex romantic fan fiction. Many fans felt the term slash fiction carried the connotation of being only about male/male couples and was not a good description for romantic fan fiction about Xena and Gabrielle.

Inspired by episodes that featured Xena and Gabrielle sharing past lives or living in alternate timelines, &quot;Xena&quot; fanfiction writers created an original new genre known as Uberfic.

She was ranked No. 3 in AfterEllen.com&#x27;s Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters.

===Popular culture===
&quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; has been referred to as a pop cultural phenomenon, sex symbol, and feminist and lesbian/bisexual icon. The television series, which employed pop culture references as a humorous device, has itself become a pop culture reference in video games, comics and television shows, and has been frequently parodied and spoofed.

&quot;Xena&quot; has been credited by many, including &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; creator Joss Whedon, with blazing the trail for a new generation of female action heroes such as Buffy, Max of &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, Sydney Bristow of &quot;Alias&quot;, and Beatrix Kiddo a.k.a. the Bride in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. The director Quentin Tarantino is also a fan of Xena. After serving as Lucy Lawless&#x27; stunt double on &quot;Xena&quot;, stunt woman Zoë E. Bell was recruited to be Uma Thurman&#x27;s stunt double in Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. By helping to pave the way for female action heroes in television and film, &quot;Xena&quot; also strengthened the stunt &quot;woman&quot; profession.
David Eick, one of the co-developers of &quot;Xena&quot;, was the executive producer of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, which also features strong female characters and Lucy Lawless in a recurring role.
In 2005, the team that discovered the dwarf planet nicknamed it &quot;Xena&quot; in honor of the TV character. On 1 October 2005, the team announced that had a moon, which they had nicknamed &quot;Gabrielle&quot;. The objects were officially named Eris and Dysnomia by the International Astronomical Union on 13 September 2006. Although the official names have legitimate roots in Greek mythology, &quot;Dysnomia&quot; is also a synonym to the word &quot;anomia&quot;, which means &quot;lawlessness&quot; in Greek, perpetuating the link with Lucy Lawless.

In 2006, Lucy Lawless donated her personal Xena costume to the Museum of American History. In an interview the same year with &quot;Smithsonian&quot;, she was asked the question &quot;Was the Warrior Princess outfit comfortable?&quot; and she responded:

In 2004, Xena was listed at number 100 in Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest TV Characters&quot;.

<text>X-ray crystallography is the experimental science of determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline structure causes a beam of incident X-rays to diffract in specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of the X-ray diffraction, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal and the positions of the atoms, as well as their chemical bonds, crystallographic disorder, and other information.

X-ray crystallography has been fundamental in the development of many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences between various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method has also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the primary method for characterizing the atomic structure of materials and in differentiating materials that appear similar in other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also help explain unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or serve as the basis for designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.

Modern work involves a number of steps all of which are important. The preliminary steps include preparing good quality samples, careful recording of the diffracted intensities, and processing of the data to remove artifacts. A variety of different methods are then used to obtain an estimate of the atomic structure, generically called direct methods. With an initial estimate further computational techniques such as those involving difference maps are used to complete the structure. The final step is a numerical refinement of the atomic positions against the experimental data, sometimes assisted by &quot;ab-initio&quot; calculations. In almost all cases new structures are deposited in databases available to the international community.

==History==

Crystals, though long admired for their regularity and symmetry, were not investigated scientifically until the 17th century. Johannes Kepler hypothesized in his work &quot;Strena seu de Nive Sexangula&quot; (A New Year&#x27;s Gift of Hexagonal Snow) (1611) that the hexagonal symmetry of snowflake crystals was due to a regular packing of spherical water particles. The Danish scientist Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental investigations of crystal symmetry. Steno showed that the angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of a particular type of crystal (law of constancy of interfacial angles). René Just Haüy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size (law of decrements). Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use for identifying crystal faces. Haüy&#x27;s study led to the idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schönflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.

Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1895. Physicists were uncertain of the nature of X-rays, but suspected that they were waves of electromagnetic radiation. The Maxwell theory of electromagnetic radiation was well accepted, and experiments by Charles Glover Barkla showed that X-rays exhibited phenomena associated with electromagnetic waves, including transverse polarization and spectral lines akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Barkla created the x-ray notation for sharp spectral lines, noting in 1909 two separate energies, at first naming them &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and then supposing that there may be lines prior to &quot;A&quot;, he started an alphabet numbering beginning with &quot;K.&quot; Single-slit experiments in the laboratory of Arnold Sommerfeld suggested that X-rays had a wavelength of about 1 angstrom. X-rays are not only waves but also have particle properties causing Sommerfeld to coin the name Bremsstrahlung for the continuous spectra when they were formed when electrons bombarded a material. Albert Einstein introduced the photon concept in 1905, but it was not broadly accepted until 1922, when Arthur Compton confirmed it by the scattering of X-rays from electrons. The particle-like properties of X-rays, such as their ionization of gases, had prompted William Henry Bragg to argue in 1907 that X-rays were &quot;not&quot; electromagnetic radiation. Bragg&#x27;s view proved unpopular and the observation of X-ray diffraction by Max von Laue in 1912 confirmed that X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation. 

The idea that crystals could be used as a diffraction grating for X-rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the English Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed, and suggested that X-rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X-rays through a copper sulfate crystal and record its diffraction on a photographic plate. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam. The results were presented to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in June 1912 as &quot;Interferenz-Erscheinungen bei Röntgenstrahlen&quot; (Interference phenomena in X-rays). Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914.
After Von Laue&#x27;s pioneering research, the field developed rapidly, most notably by physicists William Lawrence Bragg and his father William Henry Bragg. In 1912–1913, the younger Bragg developed Bragg&#x27;s law, which connects the scattering with evenly spaced planes within a crystal. The Braggs, father and son, shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in crystallography. The earliest structures were generally simple; as computational and experimental methods improved over the next decades, it became feasible to deduce reliable atomic positions for more complicated arrangements of atoms.

The earliest structures were simple inorganic crystals and minerals, but even these revealed fundamental laws of physics and chemistry. The first atomic-resolution structure to be &quot;solved&quot; (i.e., determined) in 1914 was that of table salt. The distribution of electrons in the table-salt structure showed that crystals are not necessarily composed of covalently bonded molecules, and proved the existence of ionic compounds. The structure of diamond was solved in the same year, proving the tetrahedral arrangement of its chemical bonds and showing that the length of C–C single bond was about 1.52 angstroms. Other early structures included copper, calcium fluoride (CaF2, also known as &quot;fluorite&quot;), calcite (CaCO3) and pyrite (FeS2) in 1914; spinel (MgAl2O4) in 1915; the rutile and anatase forms of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in 1916; pyrochroite (Mn(OH)2) and, by extension, brucite (Mg(OH)2) in 1919. Also in 1919, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and caesium dichloroiodide (CsICl2) were determined by Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff, and the wurtzite (hexagonal ZnS) structure was determined in 1920.

The structure of graphite was solved in 1916 by the related method of powder diffraction, which was developed by Peter Debye and Paul Scherrer and, independently, by Albert Hull in 1917. The structure of graphite was determined from single-crystal diffraction in 1924 by two groups independently. Hull also used the powder method to determine the structures of various metals, such as iron and magnesium.

==Contributions in different areas==

=== Chemistry ===
X-ray crystallography has led to a better understanding of chemical bonds and non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale&#x27;s 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic C–C bonds and aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led to the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.

The first structure of an organic compound, hexamethylenetetramine, was solved in 1923. This was rapidly followed by several studies of different long-chain fatty acids, which are an important component of biological membranes. In the 1930s, the structures of much larger molecules with two-dimensional complexity began to be solved. A significant advance was the structure of phthalocyanine, a large planar molecule that is closely related to porphyrin molecules important in biology, such as heme, corrin and chlorophyll.

In the 1920s, Victor Moritz Goldschmidt and later Linus Pauling developed rules for eliminating chemically unlikely structures and for determining the relative sizes of atoms. These rules led to the structure of brookite (1928) and an understanding of the relative stability of the rutile, brookite and anatase forms of titanium dioxide.

The distance between two bonded atoms is a sensitive measure of the bond strength and its bond order; thus, X-ray crystallographic studies have led to the discovery of even more exotic types of bonding in inorganic chemistry, such as metal-metal double bonds, metal-metal quadruple bonds, and three-center, two-electron bonds. X-ray crystallography—or, strictly speaking, an inelastic Compton scattering experiment—has also provided evidence for the partly covalent character of hydrogen bonds. In the field of organometallic chemistry, the X-ray structure of ferrocene initiated scientific studies of sandwich compounds, while that of Zeise&#x27;s salt stimulated research into &quot;back bonding&quot; and metal-pi complexes. Finally, X-ray crystallography had a pioneering role in the development of supramolecular chemistry, particularly in clarifying the structures of the crown ethers and the principles of host–guest chemistry.

===Materials science and mineralogy===

The application of X-ray crystallography to mineralogy began with the structure of garnet, which was determined in 1924 by Menzer. A systematic X-ray crystallographic study of the silicates was undertaken in the 1920s. This study showed that, as the Si/O ratio is altered, the silicate crystals exhibit significant changes in their atomic arrangements. Machatschki extended these insights to minerals in which aluminium substitutes for the silicon atoms of the silicates. The first application of X-ray crystallography to metallurgy also occurred in the mid-1920s. Most notably, Linus Pauling&#x27;s structure of the alloy Mg2Sn led to his theory of the stability and structure of complex ionic crystals. Many complicated inorganic and organometallic systems have been analyzed using single-crystal methods, such as fullerenes, metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. Single-crystal diffraction is also used in the pharmaceutical industry. The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 1,000,000 structures as of June 2019; most of these structures were determined by X-ray crystallography.

On October 17, 2012, the Curiosity rover on the planet Mars at &quot;Rocknest&quot; performed the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil. The results from the rover&#x27;s CheMin analyzer revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the &quot;weathered basaltic soils&quot; of Hawaiian volcanoes.

=== Biological macromolecular crystallography ===
X-ray crystallography of biological molecules took off with Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, who solved the structures of cholesterol (1937), penicillin (1946) and vitamin B12 (1956), for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. In 1969, she succeeded in solving the structure of insulin, on which she worked for over thirty years.

Crystal structures of proteins (which are irregular and hundreds of times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 190,000 X-ray crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. The nearest competing method in number of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved less than one tenth as many. Crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is used routinely to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other denaturants to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.

==Methods==

===Overview===
Two limiting cases of X-ray crystallography—&quot;small-molecule&quot; (which includes continuous inorganic solids) and &quot;macromolecular&quot; crystallography—are often used. Small-molecule crystallography typically involves crystals with fewer than 100 atoms in their asymmetric unit; such crystal structures are usually so well resolved that the atoms can be discerned as isolated &quot;blobs&quot; of electron density. In contrast, macromolecular crystallography often involves tens of thousands of atoms in the unit cell. Such crystal structures are generally less well-resolved; the atoms and chemical bonds appear as tubes of electron density, rather than as isolated atoms. In general, small molecules are also easier to crystallize than macromolecules; however, X-ray crystallography has proven possible even for viruses and proteins with hundreds of thousands of atoms, through improved crystallographic imaging and technology.

The technique of single-crystal X-ray crystallography has three basic steps. The first—and often most difficult—step is to obtain an adequate crystal of the material under study. The crystal should be sufficiently large (typically larger than 0.1 mm in all dimensions), pure in composition and regular in structure, with no significant internal imperfections such as cracks or twinning.

In the second step, the crystal is placed in an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single wavelength (&quot;monochromatic X-rays&quot;), producing the regular pattern of reflections. The angles and intensities of diffracted X-rays are measured, with each compound having a unique diffraction pattern. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets may have to be collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.

In the third step, these data are combined computationally with complementary chemical information to produce and refine a model of the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. The final, refined model of the atomic arrangement—now called a &quot;crystal structure&quot;—is usually stored in a public database.

===Crystallization===
Although crystallography can be used to characterize the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals can sometimes be obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.

Small-molecule and macromolecular crystallography differ in the range of possible techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small molecules generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and recrystallization. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.

 Protein crystals are almost always grown in solution. The most common approach is to lower the solubility of its component molecules very gradually; if this is done too quickly, the molecules will precipitate from solution, forming a useless dust or amorphous gel on the bottom of the container. Crystal growth in solution is characterized by two steps: &quot;nucleation&quot; of a microscopic crystallite (possibly having only 100 molecules), followed by &quot;growth&quot; of that crystallite, ideally to a diffraction-quality crystal. The solution conditions that favor the first step (nucleation) are not always the same conditions that favor the second step (subsequent growth). The solution conditions should &quot;disfavor&quot; the first step (nucleation) but &quot;favor&quot; the second (growth), so that only one large crystal forms per droplet. If nucleation is favored too much, a shower of small crystallites will form in the droplet, rather than one large crystal; if favored too little, no crystal will form whatsoever. Other approaches involve crystallizing proteins under oil, where aqueous protein solutions are dispensed under liquid oil, and water evaporates through the layer of oil. Different oils have different evaporation permeabilities, therefore yielding changes in concentration rates from different percipient/protein mixture.

It is difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by &quot;screening&quot;; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).

Several factors are known to inhibit crystallization. The growing crystals are generally held at a constant temperature and protected from shocks or vibrations that might disturb their crystallization. Impurities in the molecules or in the crystallization solutions are often inimical to crystallization. Conformational flexibility in the molecule also tends to make crystallization less likely, due to entropy. Molecules that tend to self-assemble into regular helices are often unwilling to assemble into crystals. Crystals can be marred by twinning, which can occur when a unit cell can pack equally favorably in multiple orientations; although recent advances in computational methods may allow solving the structure of some twinned crystals. Having failed to crystallize a target molecule, a crystallographer may try again with a slightly modified version of the molecule; even small changes in molecular properties can lead to large differences in crystallization behavior.

===Data collection===

====Mounting the crystal====
The crystal is mounted for measurements so that it may be held in the X-ray beam and rotated. There are several methods of mounting. In the past, crystals were loaded into glass capillaries with the crystallization solution (the mother liquor). Crystals of small molecules are typically attached with oil or glue to a glass fiber or a loop, which is made of nylon or plastic and attached to a solid rod. Protein crystals are scooped up by a loop, then flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. This freezing reduces the radiation damage of the X-rays, as well as thermal motion (the Debye-Waller effect). However, untreated protein crystals often crack if flash-frozen; therefore, they are generally pre-soaked in a cryoprotectant solution before freezing. This pre-soak may itself cause the crystal to crack, ruining it for crystallography. Generally, successful cryo-conditions are identified by trial and error.

The capillary or loop is mounted on a goniometer, which allows it to be positioned accurately within the X-ray beam and rotated. Since both the crystal and the beam are often very small, the crystal must be centered within the beam to within ~25 micrometers accuracy, which is aided by a camera focused on the crystal. The most common type of goniometer is the &quot;kappa goniometer&quot;, which offers three angles of rotation: the ω angle, which rotates about an axis perpendicular to the beam; the κ angle, about an axis at ~50° to the ω axis; and, finally, the φ angle about the loop/capillary axis. When the κ angle is zero, the ω and φ axes are aligned. The κ rotation allows for convenient mounting of the crystal, since the arm in which the crystal is mounted may be swung out towards the crystallographer. The oscillations carried out during data collection (mentioned below) involve the ω axis only. An older type of goniometer is the four-circle goniometer, and its relatives such as the six-circle goniometer.

==== Recording the reflections ====

The relative intensities of the reflections provides information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector (such as a pixel detector) or with a charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.

One set of spots is insufficient to reconstruct the whole crystal; it represents only a small slice of the full three dimensional set. To collect all the necessary information, the crystal must be rotated step-by-step through 180°, with an image recorded at every step; actually, slightly more than 180° is required to cover reciprocal space, due to the curvature of the Ewald sphere. However, if the crystal has a higher symmetry, a smaller angular range such as 90° or 45° may be recorded. The rotation axis should be changed at least once, to avoid developing a &quot;blind spot&quot; in reciprocal space close to the rotation axis. It is customary to rock the crystal slightly (by 0.5–2°) to catch a broader region of reciprocal space.

Multiple data sets may be necessary for certain phasing methods. For example, multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing requires that the scattering be recorded at least three (and usually four, for redundancy) wavelengths of the incoming X-ray radiation. A single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set, owing to radiation damage; in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals must be taken.

=== Crystal symmetry, unit cell, and image scaling ===
The recorded series of two-dimensional diffraction patterns, each corresponding to a different crystal orientation, is converted into a three-dimensional set. Data processing begins with &quot;indexing&quot; the reflections. This means identifying the dimensions of the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its &quot;space group&quot;. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an &quot;autoindexing&quot; routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then &quot;integrated&quot;. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).

A full data set may consist of hundreds of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. These have to be merged and scaled usingpeaks appear in two or more images (&quot;merging&quot;) and scaling so there is a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.

=== Initial phasing ===
The intensity of each diffraction &#x27;spot&#x27; is proportional to the modulus squared of the structure factor. The structure factor is a complex number containing information relating to both the amplitude and phase of a wave. In order to obtain an interpretable &quot;electron density map&quot;, both amplitude and phase must be known (an electron density map allows a crystallographer to build a starting model of the molecule). The phase cannot be directly recorded during a diffraction experiment: this is known as the phase problem. Initial phase estimates can be obtained in a variety of ways:
* &quot;Ab initio&quot; phasing or direct methods – This is usually the method of choice for small molecules (&lt;1000 non-hydrogen atoms), and has been used successfully to solve the phase problems for small proteins. If the resolution of the data is better than 1.4 Å (140 pm), direct methods can be used to obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase relationships between certain groups of reflections.
* Molecular replacement – if a related structure is known, it can be used as a search model in molecular replacement to determine the orientation and position of the molecules within the unit cell. The phases obtained this way can be used to generate electron density maps.
* Anomalous X-ray scattering (&quot;MAD or SAD phasing&quot;) – the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an absorption edge of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above and in the middle of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.
* Heavy atom methods (multiple isomorphous replacement) – If electron-dense metal atoms can be introduced into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods can be used to determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals in the presence of a heavy atom). As in multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing with selenomethionine.

=== Model building and phase refinement ===


Having obtained initial phases, an initial model can be built. The atomic positions in the model and their respective Debye-Waller factors (or B-factors, accounting for the thermal motion of the atom) can be refined to fit the observed diffraction data, ideally yielding a better set of phases. A new model can then be fit to the new electron density map and successive rounds of refinement are carried out. This iterative process continues until the correlation between the diffraction data and the model is maximized. The agreement is measured by an &quot;R&quot;-factor defined as

:formula_1

where &quot;F&quot; is the structure factor. A similar quality criterion is &quot;R&quot;free, which is calculated from a subset (~10%) of reflections that were not included in the structure refinement. Both &quot;R&quot; factors depend on the resolution of the data. As a rule of thumb, &quot;R&quot;free should be approximately the resolution in angstroms divided by 10; thus, a data-set with 2 Å resolution should yield a final &quot;R&quot;free ~ 0.2. Chemical bonding features such as stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding and distribution of bond lengths and angles are complementary measures of the model quality. In iterative model building, it is common to encounter phase bias or model bias: because phase estimations come from the model, each round of calculated map tends to show density wherever the model has density, regardless of whether there truly is a density. This problem can be mitigated by maximum-likelihood weighting and checking using &quot;omit maps&quot;.

It may not be possible to observe every atom in the asymmetric unit. In many cases, crystallographic disorder smears the electron density map. Weakly scattering atoms such as hydrogen are routinely invisible. It is also possible for a single atom to appear multiple times in an electron density map, e.g., if a protein sidechain has multiple (&lt;4) allowed conformations. In still other cases, the crystallographer may detect that the covalent structure deduced for the molecule was incorrect, or changed. For example, proteins may be cleaved or undergo post-translational modifications that were not detected prior to the crystallization.

=== Disorder ===
A common challenge in refinement of crystal structures results from crystallographic disorder. Disorder can take many forms but in general involves the coexistence of two or more species or conformations. Failure to recognize disorder results in flawed interpretation. Pitfalls from improper modeling of disorder are illustrated by the discounted hypothesis of bond stretch isomerism. Disorder is modelled with respect to the relative population of the components, often only two, and their identity. In structures of large molecules and ions, solvent and counterions are often disordered.

=== Applied computational data analysis ===
The use of computational methods for the powder X-ray diffraction data analysis is now generalized. It typically compares the experimental data to the simulated diffractogram of a model structure, taking into account the instrumental parameters, and refines the structural or microstructural parameters of the model using least squares based minimization algorithm. Most available tools allowing phase identification and structural refinement are based on the Rietveld method, some of them being open and free software such as FullProf Suite, Jana2006, MAUD, Rietan, GSAS, etc. while others are available under commercial licenses such as Diffrac.Suite TOPAS, Match!, etc. Most of these tools also allow Le Bail refinement (also referred to as profile matching), that is, refinement of the cell parameters based on the Bragg peaks positions and peak profiles, without taking into account the crystallographic structure by itself. More recent tools allow the refinement of both structural and microstructural data, such as the FAULTS program included in the FullProf Suite, which allows the refinement of structures with planar defects (e.g. stacking faults, twinnings, intergrowths).

=== Deposition of the structure ===
Once the model of a molecule&#x27;s structure has been finalized, it is often deposited in a crystallographic database such as the Cambridge Structural Database (for small molecules), the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) (for inorganic compounds) or the Protein Data Bank (for protein and sometimes nucleic acids). Many structures obtained in private commercial ventures to crystallize medicinally relevant proteins are not deposited in public crystallographic databases.

== Contribution of women to X-ray crystallography ==
A number of women were pioneers in X-ray crystallography at a time when they were excluded from most other branches of physical science.

Kathleen Lonsdale was a research student of William Henry Bragg, who had 11 women research students out of a total of 18. She is known for both her experimental and theoretical work. Lonsdale joined his crystallography research team at the Royal Institution in London in 1923, and after getting married and having children, went back to work with Bragg as a researcher. She confirmed the structure of the benzene ring, carried out studies of diamond, was one of the first two women to be elected to the Royal Society in 1945, and in 1949 was appointed the first female tenured professor of chemistry and head of the Department of crystallography at University College London. Lonsdale always advocated greater participation of women in science and said in 1970: &quot;Any country that wants to make full use of all its potential scientists and technologists could do so, but it must not expect to get the women quite so simply as it gets the men... It is utopian, then, to suggest that any country that really wants married women to return to a scientific career, when her children no longer need her physical presence, should make special arrangements to encourage her to do so?&quot;. During this period, Lonsdale began a collaboration with William T. Astbury on a set of 230 space group tables which was published in 1924 and became an essential tool for crystallographers.

In 1932 Dorothy Hodgkin joined the laboratory of the physicist John Desmond Bernal, who was a former student of Bragg, in Cambridge, UK. She and Bernal took the first X-ray photographs of crystalline proteins. Hodgkin also played a role in the foundation of the International Union of Crystallography. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for her work using X-ray techniques to study the structures of penicillin, insulin and vitamin B12. Her work on penicillin began in 1942 during the war and on vitamin B12 in 1948. While her group slowly grew, their predominant focus was on the X-ray analysis of natural products. She is the only British woman ever to have won a Nobel Prize in a science subject.

Rosalind Franklin took the X-ray photograph of a DNA fibre that proved key to James Watson and Francis Crick&#x27;s discovery of the double helix, for which they both won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1962. Watson revealed in his autobiographic account of the discovery of the structure of DNA, &quot;The Double Helix&quot;, that he had used Franklin&#x27;s X-ray photograph without her permission. Franklin died of cancer in her 30s, before Watson received the Nobel Prize. Franklin also carried out important structural studies of carbon in coal and graphite, and of plant and animal viruses.

Isabella Karle of the United States Naval Research Laboratory developed an experimental approach to the mathematical theory of crystallography. Her work improved the speed and accuracy of chemical and biomedical analysis. Yet only her husband Jerome shared the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Herbert Hauptman, &quot;for outstanding achievements in the development of direct methods for the determination of crystal structures&quot;. Other prize-giving bodies have showered Isabella with awards in her own right.

Women have written many textbooks and research papers in the field of X-ray crystallography. For many years Lonsdale edited the &quot;International Tables for Crystallography&quot;, which provide information on crystal lattices, symmetry, and space groups, as well as mathematical, physical and chemical data on structures. Olga Kennard of the University of Cambridge, founded and ran the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, an internationally recognized source of structural data on small molecules, from 1965 until 1997. Jenny Pickworth Glusker, a British scientist, co-authored &quot;Crystal Structure Analysis: A Primer&quot;, first published in 1971 and as of 2010 in its third edition. Eleanor Dodson, an Australian-born biologist, who began as Dorothy Hodgkin&#x27;s technician, was the main instigator behind CCP4, the collaborative computing project that currently shares more than 250 software tools with protein crystallographers worldwide.

<text>The DAX (&quot;Deutscher Aktienindex&quot; (German stock index); ) is a stock market index consisting of the 40 major German blue chip companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. It is a total return index. Prices are taken from the Xetra trading venue. According to Deutsche Börse, the operator of Xetra, DAX measures the performance of the Prime Standard&#x27;s 40 largest German companies in terms of order book volume and market capitalization. DAX is the equivalent of the UK FTSE 100 and the US Dow Jones Industrial Average, and because of its small company selection it does not necessarily represent the vitality of the German economy as a whole.

The L-DAX Index is an indicator of the German benchmark DAX index&#x27;s performance after the Xetra trading venue closes based on the floor trading at the Börse Frankfurt trading venue. The L-DAX Index basis is the &quot;floor&quot; trade (&quot;Parketthandel&quot;) at the Frankfurt stock exchange; it is computed daily between 09:00 and 17:45 Hours CET. The L/E-DAX index (Late/Early DAX) is calculated from 17:55 to 22:00 CET and from 08:00 to 09:00 CET. The Eurex, a European electronic futures and options exchange based in Zurich, Switzerland with a subsidiary in Frankfurt, Germany, offers options (ODAX) and Futures (FDAX) on the DAX from 01:10 to 22:00 CET or from 02:10 to 22:00 CEST.

The Base date for the DAX is 30 December 1987, and it was started from a base value of 1,000. The Xetra technology calculates the index every second since 1 January 2006.

On 24 Nov 2020, Deutsche Börse announced an expansion of the DAX from 30 to 40 members and a tightening of rules in response to the Wirecard accounting scandal. The expansion occurred in the 3rd quarter of 2021.

== Versions ==
The DAX has two versions, called performance index and price index, depending on whether dividends are counted. The performance index, which measures total return, is the more commonly quoted, however the price index is more similar to commonly quoted indexes in other countries.

== Contract specifications ==
DAX futures are traded on the Deutsche Borse Indices &amp; ETF exchange (DBIndex). The contract specifications for the DAX Combined Index (ticker symbol DAXA) are listed below:
== Price history ==
On 16 March 2015, the performance index first closed above 12,000.

==Record values==
== Annual returns ==
The following collapsible table shows the annual development of the DAX, calculated retroactively up to 1950.
== Components ==
Below is the list of companies which are a component of the DAX 40, as of 20 March 2023. The current stock prices and list of DAX companies are available from financial websites. The index weighting refers to the DAX performance index.

== Former DAX components ==

<text>Future Concepts division (formerly Palo Alto Research Center, PARC and Xerox PARC) is a research and development company in Palo Alto, California. It was founded in 1969 by Jacob E. &quot;Jack&quot; Goldman, chief scientist of Xerox Corporation, as a division of Xerox, tasked with creating computer technology-related products and hardware systems.
Xerox PARC has been foundational to numerous revolutionary computer developments, including laser printing, Ethernet, the modern personal computer, graphical user interface (GUI) and desktop metaphor–paradigm, object-oriented programming, ubiquitous computing, electronic paper, amorphous silicon (a-Si) applications, the computer mouse, and very-large-scale integration (VLSI) for semiconductors.

Unlike Xerox&#x27;s existing research laboratory in Rochester, New York, which focused on refining and expanding the company&#x27;s copier business, Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Advanced Scientific &amp; Systems Laboratory&quot; aimed to pioneer new technologies in advanced physics, materials science, and computer science applications.

In 2002, Xerox spun off Palo Alto Research Center Incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary. In late April of 2023, Xerox announced the donation of the lab to SRI International.

==History==

In 1969, Goldman talked with George Pake, a physicist specializing in nuclear magnetic resonance and provost of Washington University in St. Louis, about starting a second research center for Xerox.

On July 1, 1970, the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center opened. Its 3,000-mile distance from Xerox headquarters in Rochester, New York, afforded scientists at the new lab great freedom in their work, but it increased the difficulty of persuading management of the promise of some of their greatest achievements.

In its early years, PARC&#x27;s West Coast location helped it hire many employees of the nearby SRI Augmentation Research Center (ARC) as that facility&#x27;s funding from DARPA, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force began to be reduced. By leasing land at Stanford Research Park, it encouraged Stanford University graduate students to be involved in PARC research projects and PARC scientists to collaborate with academic seminars and projects.

Much of PARC&#x27;s early success in the computer field was under the leadership of its Computer Science Laboratory manager Bob Taylor, who guided the lab as associate manager from 1970 to 1977, and as manager from 1977 to 1983.

Work at PARC since the early 1980s includes advances in ubiquitous computing, aspect-oriented programming, and IPv6.

After three decades as a division of Xerox, PARC was transformed in 2002 into an independent, wholly owned subsidiary company dedicated to developing and maturing advances in science and business concepts.

Xerox announced that it would donate the lab and its related assets to SRI International in April 2023. As part of the deal, Xerox would keep most of the patent rights inside PARC, and benefit from a preferred research agreement with SRI/PARC. On January 18, 2024, SRI announced the research group from the PARC will become its Future Concepts division.

==Developments==
PARC&#x27;s developments in information technology served for a long time as standards for much of the computing industry. Many advancements made at the center were not equaled or surpassed for two decades. Xerox PARC has been the inventor and incubator of many elements of modern computing, including:

*Laser printers
*Computer-generated bitmap graphics
*The graphical user interface, featuring skeuomorphic windows and icons, operated with a mouse
*Bravo, the WYSIWYG modal text editor
*Interpress, a resolution-independent graphical page-description language and the precursor to PostScript
*Ethernet as a local-area computer network
*Fully formed object-oriented programming (OOP) (with class-based inheritance, the most popular OOP model) in the Smalltalk programming language and integrated development environment
*Prototype-based programming (the second most popular inheritance model in OOP) in the Self language
*Model–view–controller software architecture
*AspectJ, an aspect-oriented programming (AOP) extension for the Java language

===Alto===

Most of these developments were included in the Alto, which added the computer mouse. These developments unified into a single model most aspects of now-standard personal computers use. The integration of Ethernet into the computer prompted the development of the PARC Universal Packet architecture, which is structured much like the modern Internet&#x27;s architecture.

===PARCTab===
The PARCTab is an experimental mobile computing device as an early experiment in ubiquitous computing (UbiComp). Its appearance resembles a personal digital assistant (PDA). Its functionality depends on the user&#x27;s location, by receiving location-specific information via infrared sensors from gateway nodes installed in a particular location.

It has a touch screen, stylus, and handwriting recognition. Xerox designed the similar and larger PARCPad. Both devices were developed around the same time as the Apple Newton.

==Distinguished researchers==

PARC&#x27;s distinguished researchers include four Turing Award winners: Butler Lampson (1992), Alan Kay (2003), Charles P. Thacker (2009), and Robert Metcalfe (2022). The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Software System Award recognized the Alto system in 1984, Smalltalk in 1987, InterLisp in 1992, and the remote procedure call in 1994. Lampson, Kay, Bob Taylor, and Thacker received the National Academy of Engineering&#x27;s prestigious Charles Stark Draper Prize in 2004 for their work on the Alto. Lynn Conway was recognized by the National Inventors Hall of Fame for her work on very-large-scale integration (VLSI) in 2023.

==Legacy==
Xerox has been heavily criticized, particularly by business historians, for failing to properly commercialize and profitably exploit PARC&#x27;s innovations. Xerox management failed to see the global potential of many of PARC&#x27;s inventions, but this was mostly a problem with its computing research, a relatively small part of PARC&#x27;s operations.

One notable example of this is the graphical user interface (GUI), initially developed at PARC for the Alto and then sold as the Xerox 8010 Information System workstation (with office software called Star) by the Xerox Systems Development Department. It heavily influenced future system design, but was deemed a failure because Xerox only sold about 25,000 units of the computer. A small group from PARC led by David Liddle and Charles Irby formed Metaphor Computer Systems. Metaphor Computer Systems extended the Star desktop concept into an animated graphic and communicating office-automation model and sold the company to IBM.

Several GUI engineers left to join Apple Computer to work on Lisa and Macintosh. Technologies pioneered by its materials scientists such as the liquid-crystal display (LCD), some major innovations in optical disc technology, and laser printing were actively and successfully introduced by Xerox to the business and consumer markets.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said that the Xerox graphical interface has notably influenced Microsoft and Apple. Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs said that &quot;Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry, could have been the IBM of the nineties, could have been the Microsoft of the nineties.&quot;

<doc id="34155" wikidata="Q129772" url="?curid=34155" title="Xenophon">
<text>Xenophon of Athens (; ; probably 355 or 354 BC) was a Greek military leader, philosopher, and historian. At the age of 30, he was elected as one of the leaders of the retreating Greek mercenaries, the Ten Thousand, who had been part of Cyrus the Younger&#x27;s attempt to seize control of the Achaemenid Empire. As the military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge wrote, &quot;the centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the genius of this warrior&quot;. Xenophon established precedents for many logistical operations and was among the first to describe strategic flanking maneuvers and feints in combat.

For at least two millennia, it has been debated whether or not Xenophon was first and foremost a general, historian, or philosopher. For the majority of time in the past two millennia, Xenophon was recognized as a philosopher. Quintilian in &quot;The Orator&#x27;s Education&quot; discusses the most prominent historians, orators and philosophers as examples of eloquence and recognizes Xenophon&#x27;s historical work, but ultimately places Xenophon next to Plato as a philosopher. Today, Xenophon is recognized as one of the greatest writers of antiquity. Xenophon&#x27;s works span multiple genres and are written in plain Attic Greek, which is why they have often been used in translation exercises for contemporary students of the Ancient Greek language. In the &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, Diogenes Laërtius observed that Xenophon was known as the &quot;Attic Muse&quot; because of the sweetness of his diction.

Despite being born an Athenian citizen, Xenophon came to be associated with Sparta, the traditional opponent of Athens. Much of what is known today about the Spartan society comes from Xenophon&#x27;s royal biography of the Spartan king &quot;Agesilaus&quot; and the &quot;Constitution of the Lacedaemonians&quot;. The sub-satrap Mania is primarily known through Xenophon&#x27;s writings. Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; recounts his adventures with the Ten Thousand while in the service of Cyrus the Younger, Cyrus&#x27;s failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from Artaxerxes II of Persia, and the return of Greek mercenaries after Cyrus&#x27;s death in the Battle of Cunaxa.

Xenophon wrote &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, outlining both military and political methods used by Cyrus the Great to conquer the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC. &quot;Anabasis&quot; and &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; inspired Alexander the Great and other Greeks to conquer Babylon and the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BC. The &quot;Hellenica&quot; continues directly from the final sentence of Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; covering the last seven years of the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) and the subsequent forty-two years (404–362 BC) ending with the Second Battle of Mantinea.

==Life==
===Early years===
Xenophon was born in the deme (local district) of Erchia in Athens; his father was called Gryllus () and belonged to an Athenian aristocratic family. The Peloponnesian War was being waged throughout Xenophon&#x27;s childhood and youth. A contemporary of Plato, Xenophon associated with Socrates, as was common for wealthy young men in this period, and probably served in the Athenian cavalry. He appears to have remained in Athens during the overthrow of Athenian democracy under the Thirty Tyrants, and fought democratic insurgents in the civil war of 403–404. Accounts of events in &quot;Hellenica&quot; suggest that Xenophon personally witnessed tumultuous political events such as the return of Alcibiades in 407 BC, the trial of the generals in 406 BC, and the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants in 403 BC. 

Personally invited by Proxenus of Beotia (&quot;Anabasis&quot; 3.1.9), one of the captains in Cyrus&#x27;s mercenary army, Xenophon, sailed to Ephesus to meet Cyrus the Younger and participate in Cyrus&#x27;s military campaign against Tissaphernes, the Persian satrap of Ionia. Xenophon describes his life in 401 BC and 400 BC in the memoir &quot;Anabasis&quot;.

===&quot;Anabasis&quot;===

Written years after the events it recounts, Xenophon&#x27;s book &quot;Anabasis&quot; (Greek: ἀνάβασις, literally &quot;going up&quot;) is his record of the expedition of Cyrus and the Greek mercenaries&#x27; journey to home. Xenophon writes that he asked Socrates for advice on whether to go with Cyrus and that Socrates referred him to the Pythia. Xenophon&#x27;s query to the oracle, however, was not whether or not to accept Cyrus&#x27; invitation, but &quot;to which of the gods he must pray and do sacrifice, so that he might best accomplish his intended journey and return in safety, with good fortune&quot;. The oracle answered his question and told him which gods to pray and sacrifice to. When Xenophon returned to Athens and told Socrates of the oracle&#x27;s advice, Socrates chastised him for asking so disingenuous a question (&quot;Anabasis&quot; 3.1.5–7).

Under the pretext of fighting Tissaphernes, the Persian satrap of Ionia, Cyrus assembled a massive army composed of native Persian soldiers and Greeks. Prior to waging war against Artaxerxes, Cyrus proposed that the enemy was the Pisidians, and so the Greeks were unaware that they were to battle against the larger army of King Artaxerxes II (&quot;Anabasis&quot; 1.1.8–11). At Tarsus, the soldiers became aware of Cyrus&#x27;s plans to depose the king and, as a result, refused to continue (&quot;Anabasis&quot; 1.3.1). However, Clearchus, a Spartan general, convinced the Greeks to continue with the expedition. The army of Cyrus met the army of Artaxerxes II in the Battle of Cunaxa. Cyrus was killed in the battle (&quot;Anabasis&quot; 1.8.27–1.9.1). Shortly thereafter, Clearchus was invited by Tissaphernes to a feast, where, alongside four other generals and many captains, including Xenophon&#x27;s friend Proxenus, he was captured and executed (&quot;Anabasis&quot; 2.5.31–32).

The mercenaries, known as the Ten Thousand, had no leadership in territory near Mesopotamia. They elected new leaders, including Xenophon himself. Dodge says of Xenophon&#x27;s generalship, &quot;Xenophon is the father of the system of retreat [...] He reduced its management to a perfect method.&quot;

Xenophon and his men initially had to deal with volleys by a minor force of harassing Persian missile cavalry. One night, Xenophon formed a body of archers and light cavalry. When the Persian cavalry arrived the next day, now firing within several yards, Xenophon unleashed his new cavalry, killing many and routing the rest. Tissaphernes pursued Xenophon, and when the Greeks reached the Great Zab river, one of the men devised a plan: goats, cows, sheep, and donkeys were to be slaughtered and their bodies stuffed with hay, sewn up, laid across the river, and covered with dirt so as not to be slippery and be used as a bridge to cross the river. This plan was discarded as impractical.

Dodge notes, &quot;On this retreat also was first shown the necessary, if cruel, means of arresting a pursuing enemy by the systematic devastation of the country traversed and the destruction of its villages to deprive him of food and shelter. And Xenophon is moreover the first who established in rear of the phalanx a reserve from which he could at will feed weak parts of his line. This was a superb first conception.&quot;

==== Conflicts ====

The Ten Thousand eventually made their way into the land of the Carduchians, a wild tribe inhabiting the mountains of modern southeastern Turkey. &quot;Once the Great King had sent into their country an army of 120,000 men, to subdue them, but of all that great host not one had ever seen his home again.&quot; The Ten Thousand were shot at with stones and arrows for several days before they reached a defile where the main Carduchian host sat. Xenophon had 8,000 men feint and marched the other 2,000 to a pass revealed by a prisoner under the cover of a rainstorm, and at daylight, they pushed in.

After the fighting, the Greeks went to the northern foothills of the mountains at the Centrites River, later finding a Persian force blocking the route north. Xenophon&#x27;s scouts found another ford, but the Persians blocked this as well. Xenophon sent a small force back toward the other ford, causing the Persians to detach a major part of their force parallel. Xenophon overwhelmed the force at his ford.
Winter has arrived as the Greeks marched through Armenia &quot;absolutely unprovided with clothing suitable for such weather&quot;. The Greeks decided to attack a wooden castle known to have had storage. The castle was stationed on a hill surrounded by forest. Xenophon ordered small parties of his men to appear on the hill road, and when the defenders shot at them, one soldier would leap into the trees. Then, &quot;the other men followed his example [...] When the stones were almost exhausted, the soldiers raced one another over the exposed part of the road&quot;, storming the fortress with most of the garrison now neutralized.

Soon after, Xenophon&#x27;s men reached Trapezus on the coast of the Black Sea (&quot;Anabasis&quot; 4.8.22). Before their departure, the Greeks made an alliance with the locals and fought one last battle against the Colchians, vassals of the Persians. Xenophon ordered his men to deploy the line extremely thin so as to overlap the enemy. The Colchians divided their army to check the Greek deployment, opening a gap in their line through which Xenophon rushed in his reserves. They then made their way westward back to Greek territory via Chrysopolis (&quot;Anabasis&quot; 6.3.16). Once there, they helped Seuthes II make himself king of Thrace before being recruited into the army of the Spartan general Thimbron (whom Xenophon refers to as Thibron).

Xenophon&#x27;s conduct of the retreat caused Dodge to name the Athenian knight the greatest general that preceded Alexander the Great.

=== Life after &quot;Anabasis&quot; ===
Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; ends in 399 BC in the city of Pergamon with the arrival of the Spartan commander Thimbron. Thimbron&#x27;s campaign is described in &quot;Hellenica&quot;. In the describtors, after capturing Teuthrania and Halisarna, the Greeks led by Thimbron lay siege to Larissa. Failing to capture Larissa, the Greeks fall back to Caria. As a result, the ephors of Sparta recall Thimbron and send Dercylidas to lead the Greek army. After facing the court at Sparta, Thimbron is banished. Xenophon describes Dercylidas as a significantly more experienced commander than Thimbron.

Led by Dercylidas, Xenophon and the Greek army march to Aeolis and capture nine cities in 8 days, including Larissa, Hamaxitus, and Kolonai. The Persians negotiated a temporary truce, and the Greek army retired for a winter camp at Byzantium. In 398 BC, Xenophon captured the city of Lampsacus. The Spartan ephors officially cleared the Ten Thousand of any previous wrongdoing (the Ten Thousand were likely a part of the investigation of Thimbron&#x27;s failure at Larissa) and integrated the Ten Thousand into Dercylidas&#x27; army. &quot;Hellenica&quot; mentions the response of the commander of the Ten Thousand, &quot;But men of Lacedaemon, we are the same men now as we were last year; but the commander now is one man (Dercylidas), and in the past was another (Thimbron). Therefore you are at once able to judge for yourselves the reason why we are not at fault now, although we were then.&quot;

In 397 BC, Dercylidas&#x27; force mirrored the movement of Tissaphernes&#x27; and Pharnabazus&#x27; forces near Ephesus but did not engage in battle. The Persian army retreated to Tralles and the Greeks to Leucophrys. Dercylidas proposed the new terms of truce to Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus and the three parties submitted the truce proposal to Sparta and the Persian king for ratification. Under Dercylidas&#x27; proposal, the Persians abandoned claims to independent Greek cities in Ionia, and the Spartans withdrew the army.

In 396 BC, the newly appointed Spartan king, Agesilaus, arrived at Ephesus and assumed command of the army from Dercylidas. Xenophon joined Agesilaus&#x27; campaign for the Ionian Greece independence of 396–394 BC. In 394 BC, Agesilaus&#x27; army returned to Greece, taking the route of the Persian invasion eighty years earlier and fought in the Battle of Coronea. Athens banished Xenophon for fighting on the Spartan side. Xenophon probably followed Agesilaus&#x27; march to Sparta in 394 BC and finished his military journey after seven years. Xenophon received an estate in Scillus where he spent the next twenty-three years. In 371 BC, after the Battle of Leuctra, the Elians confiscated Xenophon&#x27;s estate, and, according to Diogenes Laërtius, Xenophon moved to Corinth. Diogenes writes that Xenophon lived in Corinth until his death in 354 BC, at around the age of 74 or 75. Pausanias mentions Xenophon&#x27;s tomb in Scillus.

==Political philosophy==
Xenophon took a keen interest in political philosophy and his work often examines leadership.

===&quot;Cyropaedia&quot;===
====Relations between Medes and Persians in the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;====

Xenophon wrote the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; to outline his political and moral philosophy. He did this by endowing a fictional version of the boyhood of Cyrus the Great, founder of the first Persian Empire, with the qualities of what Xenophon considered the ideal ruler. Historians have asked whether Xenophon&#x27;s portrait of Cyrus was accurate or if Xenophon imbued Cyrus with events from Xenophon&#x27;s own life. There is a consensus that Cyrus&#x27;s career is best outlined in the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus. Herodotus contradicts Xenophon at several other points. Herodotus says that Cyrus led a rebellion against his maternal grandfather, Astyages, king of Media, and defeated him, thereafter keeping Astyages in his court for the remainder of his life (&quot;Histories&quot; 1.130). The Medes were thus &quot;reduced to subjection&quot; (1.130) and became &quot;slaves&quot; (1.129) to the Persians 20 years before the capture of Babylon in 539 BC.

The &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; relates instead that Astyages died and was succeeded by his son, Cyaxares II, the maternal uncle of Cyrus (1.5.2). In the initial campaign against the Lydians, Babylonians, and their allies, the Medians were led by Cyaxares and the Persians by Cyrus, who was crown prince of the Persians since his father was still alive (4.5.17). Xenophon relates that at this time the Medes were the strongest of the kingdoms that opposed the Babylonians (1.5.2). In the Harran Stele, a document from the court of Nabonidus wrote the same point. In the entry for year 14 or 15 of his reign (542–540 BC), Nabonidus speaks of his enemies as the kings of Egypt, the Medes, and the Arabs. There is no mention of the Persians; according to Herodotus and the current consensus, the Medians had been made &quot;slaves&quot; of the Persians several years previously. An archaeological bas-reliefs in the stairway at Persepolis shows no distinction in official status between the Persian and Median. Olmstead nevertheless wrote, &quot;Medes were honored equally with Persians; they were employed in high office and were chosen to lead Persian armies.&quot;
Both Herodotus (1.123,214) and Xenophon (1.5.1,2,4, 8.5.20) present Cyrus as about 40 years old when his forces captured Babylon. In the Nabonidus Chronicle, there is mention of the death of the wife of the king (name not given) within a month after the capture of Babylon. It has been conjectured that this was Cyrus&#x27;s first wife; &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;&#x27;s stated (8.5.19) that Cyaxares II gave his daughter in marriage to Cyrus soon after the fall of the city, with the kingdom of Media as her dowry.

====Persians as centaurs====
The &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; praises the first Persian emperor, Cyrus the Great, and it was through his greatness that the Persian Empire held together. However, following the lead of Leo Strauss, David Johnson suggests that there is a subtle layer to the book in which Xenophon conveys criticism of the Persians, the Spartans, and the Athenians. In section 4.3 of the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, Cyrus wrote his desire to institute cavalry. He wrote that he desires that no Persian &quot;kalokagathos&quot; (&quot;noble and good man&quot; literally, or simply &quot;noble&quot;) ever be seen on foot but always on a horse, so much so that the Persians may actually seem to be centaurs (4.3.22–23).

Xenophon plays upon the post-Persian-war propagandistic paradigm of using mythological imagery to represent the Greco-Persian conflict. Examples of this include the wedding of the Lapiths, Gigantomachy, Trojan War, and Amazonomachy on the Parthenon frieze. Johnson believes that the unstable dichotomy of man and horse found in a centaur is indicative of the unstable alliance of Persian and Mede formulated by Cyrus. He cites the regression of the Persians directly after the death of Cyrus as the result of this instability, a union made possible only through Cyrus.

====Against empire====

The strength of Cyrus in holding the empire together is praiseworthy, according to Xenophon. However, the empire began to decline upon the death of Cyrus. By this example, Xenophon sought to show that empires lacked stability and could only be maintained by a person of remarkable prowess, such as Cyrus.

Xenophon displays Cyrus as a lofty, temperate man. He is depicted as not subject to the foibles of others. He used the example of the Persians to decry the attempts at empire made by Athens and Sparta. Having written the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; after the downfall of Athens in the Peloponnesian War, this work criticizes the Greek attempts at empire and &quot;monarchy&quot;.

====Against meritocracy====
Another passage that Johnson cites as criticism of monarchy and empire concerns the devaluation of the &quot;homotīmoi&quot; (&quot;equal&quot;, or &quot;same honours&quot;, i.e., &quot;peers&quot;). &quot;Homotīmoi&quot; were highly educated and thus became the core of the soldiers as heavy infantry. Their band (1000 when Cyrus fought the Assyrians) shared equally in the spoils of war. However, in the face of overwhelming numbers against the Assyrians, Cyrus armed the commoners with similar arms instead of their normal light ranged armament (&quot;Cyropaedia&quot; 2.1.9).

Argument ensued as to how the spoils would now be split, and Cyrus enforced a meritocracy. Many &quot;homotīmoi&quot; found this unfair because their military training was no better than the commoners, only their education, and hand-to-hand combat was less a matter of skill than strength and bravery. As Johnson asserts, this passage decries imperial meritocracy and corruption, for the &quot;homotīmoi&quot; now had to ingratiate themselves to the emperor for positions and honours; from this point, they were referred to as &quot;entīmoi&quot;, no longer of the &quot;same honours&quot; but having to be &quot;in&quot; to get the honour.

===&quot;Constitution of the Spartans&quot;===

The Spartans wrote nothing about themselves, or if they did it, it is lost. Xenophon, in the Constitution of the Spartans, wrote:

Xenophon goes on to describe in detail the main aspects of Laconia.

===Old Oligarch===
A short treatise on the &quot;Constitution of the Athenians&quot; exists that was once thought to be written by Xenophon was probably written when Xenophon was about five years old. The author, often called in English the &quot;Old Oligarch&quot; or Pseudo-Xenophon, detests the democracy of Athens and the poorer classes, but he argues that the Periclean institutions are well designed for their deplorable purposes.

==Socratic works and dialogues==

Xenophon&#x27;s works include a selection of Socratic dialogues; these writings are preserved. Except for the dialogues of Plato, they are the only surviving representatives of the genre of Socratic dialogue. These works include Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot;, &quot;Memorabilia&quot;, &quot;Symposium&quot;, and &quot;Oeconomicus&quot;. The &quot;Symposium&quot; outlines the character of Socrates as he and his companions discuss what attributes they take pride in. One of the main plots of the &quot;Symposium&quot; is about the type of loving relationship (&quot;noble&quot; or &quot;base&quot;) a rich aristocrat will be able to establish with a young boy (present at the banquet alongside his own father). In &quot;Oeconomicus&quot;, Socrates explains how to manage a household. Both the &quot;Apology&quot; and the &quot;Memorabilia&quot; defend Socrates&#x27; character and teachings. The former is set during the trial of Socrates, while the latter explains his moral principles and that he was not a corrupter of the youth.

Although Xenophon claims to have been present at the &quot;Symposium&quot;, he was only a young boy at the date on which he proposes. Xenophon was not present at the trial of Socrates, having been on campaign in Anatolia and Mesopotamia. It seems that Xenophon wrote his &quot;Apology&quot; and &quot;Memorabilia&quot; as defences of his former teacher and to further the philosophic project, not to present a literal transcript of Socrates&#x27; response to the historical charges incurred.

===Relationship with Socrates===
Xenophon was a student of Socrates. In his &quot;Lives of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, the Greek biographer Diogenes Laërtius (who writes many centuries later) reports how Xenophon met Socrates. &quot;They say that Socrates met [Xenophon] in a narrow lane, and put his stick across it and prevented him from passing by, asking him where all kinds of necessary things were sold. And when he had answered him, he asked him again where men were made good and virtuous. And as he did not know, he said, &#x27;Follow me, then, and learn.&#x27; And from this time forth, Xenophon became a follower of Socrates.&quot; Diogenes Laërtius also relates an incident &quot;when in the battle of Delium Xenophon had fallen from his horse&quot; and Socrates reputedly &quot;stepped in and saved his life.&quot;

Both Plato and Xenophon wrote &quot;Apology&quot; concerning the death of Socrates. Xenophon and Plato seem to be concerned with the failures of Socrates to defend himself. Xenophon asserts that Socrates dealt with his prosecution in an exceedingly arrogant manner, or at least was perceived to have spoken arrogantly. Conversely, while not omitting it completely, Plato worked to temper that arrogance in his own &quot;Apology&quot;. Xenophon framed Socrates&#x27; defense, which both men admit was not prepared at all, not as a failure to argue, but as striving for death even in the light of unconvincing charges. As Danzig interprets it, convincing the jury to condemn him even on unconvincing charges would be a rhetorical challenge worthy of the great persuader. By contrast, Plato argued that Socrates was attempting to demonstrate a higher moral standard and teach a lesson.

===Modern reception===
Xenophon&#x27;s lessons on leadership have been reconsidered for their modern-day value. The &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, in outlining Cyrus as an ideal leader, is the work that O&#x27;Flannery suggests be used as a guide or example for those striving to be leaders. The linking of moral code and education is a quality subscribed to Cyrus that O&#x27;Flannery believes is in line with modern perceptions of leadership.

==List of works==
Xenophon&#x27;s entire classical corpus is extant. The following is a list of his works.

===Historical and biographical works===
* &quot;Anabasis&quot; (also: &quot;The Persian Expedition&quot; or &quot;The March Up Country&quot; or The &quot;Expedition of Cyrus&quot;): Provides an early life biography of Xenophon. &quot;Anabasis&quot; was used as a field guide by Alexander the Great during the early phases of his expedition into the Achaemenid Empire.
* &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; (also: &quot;The Education of Cyrus&quot;): Sometimes seen as the archetype of the European &quot;mirror of princes&quot; genre.
* &quot;Hellenica&quot;: His &quot;Hellenica&quot; is a major primary source for events in Greece from 411 to 362 BC, and is the continuation of the &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; by Thucydides, going so far as to begin with the phrase &quot;Following these events...&quot;. The Hellenica recounts the last seven years of the Peloponnesian War, as well as its aftermath, and is a detailed and direct account (however partial to Sparta) of the history of Greece until 362 BC.
* &quot;Agesilaus&quot;: The biography of Agesilaus II, king of Sparta and companion of Xenophon.
* &quot;Polity of the Lacedaemonians&quot;: Xenophon&#x27;s history and description of the Spartan government and institutions.

===Socratic works and dialogues===

====Defences of Socrates====
* &quot;Memorabilia&quot;: Collection of Socratic dialogues serving as a defense of Socrates outside of court.
* &quot;Apology&quot;: Xenophon&#x27;s defence of Socrates in court.

====Other Socratic dialogues====
* &quot;Oeconomicus&quot;: Socratic dialogue of a different sort, pertaining to household management and agriculture.
* &quot;Symposium&quot;: Symposic literature in which Socrates and his companions discuss what they take pride in with respect to themselves.

====Tyrants====
* &quot;Hiero&quot;: Dialogue about happiness between Hiero, the tyrant of Syracuse, and the lyric poet Simonides of Ceos.

===Short treatises===
These works were probably written by Xenophon when he was living in Scillus. His days were likely spent in relative leisure here, and he wrote these treatises about the sorts of activities he spent time on.
* &quot;On Horsemanship&quot;: Treatise on how to break, train, and care for horses.
* &quot;Hipparchikos&quot;: Outlines the duties of a cavalry officer.
* &quot;Hunting with Dogs&quot;: Treatise on the proper methods of hunting with dogs and the advantages of hunting.
* &quot;Ways and Means&quot;: Describes how Athens should deal with financial and economic crisis.

===Spuria===

<text>In computing, the term Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) is used to refer to a family of languages used to transform and render XML documents (e.g., XSL is used to determine how to display a XML document as a webpage).

Historically, the W3C XSL Working Group produced a draft specification under the name &quot;XSL&quot;, which eventually split into three parts:

# XSL Transformation (XSLT): an XML language for transforming XML documents
# XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO): an XML language for specifying the visual formatting of an XML document
# XML Path Language (XPath): a non-XML language used by XSLT, and also available for use in non-XSLT contexts, for addressing the parts of an XML document.

As a result, the term &quot;XSL&quot; is now used with a number of different meanings:

* Sometimes it refers to XSLT: this usage is best avoided. However, &quot;xsl&quot; is used both as the conventional namespace prefix for the XSLT namespace, and as the conventional filename suffix for files containing XSLT stylesheet modules
* Sometimes it refers to XSL-FO: this usage can be justified by the fact that the XSL-FO specification carries the title &quot;Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL)&quot;; however, the term XSL-FO is less likely to be misunderstood
* Sometimes it refers to both languages considered together, or to the working group that developed both languages
* Sometimes, especially in the Microsoft world, it refers to a now-obsolete variant of XSLT developed and shipped by Microsoft as part of MSXML before the W3C specification was finalized

== History ==

XSL began as an attempt to bring the functionality of DSSSL, particularly in the area of print and high-end typesetting, to XML.

In response to a submission from Arbortext, Inso, and Microsoft, a W3C working group on &quot;XSL&quot; started operating in December 1997, with Sharon Adler and Steve Zilles as co-chairs, with James Clark acting as editor (and unofficially as chief designer), and Chris Lilley as the W3C staff contact. The group released a first public Working Draft on 18 August 1998. XSLT and XPath became W3C Recommendations on 16 November 1999 and XSL-FO reached Recommendation status on 15 October 2001.

== The XSL family ==

=== XSL Transformations ===
The original version of XSLT (1.0) was published in November 1999, and was widely implemented. Some of the early implementations have fallen into disuse, but notable implementations
actively used in 2023 include those integrated into the mainstream web browsers, as well as Altova&#x27;s RaptorXML, libxslt, Saxon, the Microsoft .NET implementation System.Xml.Xsl, and Xalan which is integrated into the Oracle JVM. These products all have a high level of conformance to the specification, though they also offer proprietary vendor extensions, and some of them omit support for optional features such as disable-output-escaping.

Subsequent versions of XSLT include XSLT 2.0 (January 2007) and XSLT 3.0 (June 2017); there is work in progress on a version 4.0. These versions have not been as widely implemented as 1.0: the main implementations in widespread use in 2023 are Saxon (available in various versions for different platforms, including web browsers), and Altova&#x27;s RaptorXML.

=== XSL Formatting Objects ===
Support for XSL Formatting Objects is available in a number of products:

* the XEP package from RenderX has near 100% support for XSL-FO 1.0
* XSLFormatter from Antenna House also has near 100% support for the XSL-FO 1.0 specification and has 100% support for all new features within the XSL-FO 1.1 specification
* XINC from Lunasil has a great amount of support for the XSL-FO 1.0 specification
* FOP from the Apache project can render a portion of the XSL formatting objects 1.0 specification to PDF
* XML2PDF Formatting Engine Server from AltSoft has near 100% support for the XSL-FO 1.1

These products support output in a number of file formats, to varying degrees:

* Portable Document Format
* PostScript
* SVG
* MIF
* PCL
* text files

=== XPath ===
XML Path Language (XPath), itself part of the XSL family, functions within XSLT as a means of navigating an XML document.

Another W3C project, XQuery, aims to provide similar capabilities for querying XML documents using XPath.

<text>The Xingu River ( ; ; ) is a river in north Brazil. It is a southeast tributary of the Amazon River and one of the largest clearwater rivers in the Amazon basin, accounting for about 5% of its water.

==Description and history==
The first Indigenous Park in Brazil was created in the river basin by the Brazilian government in the early 1960s. This park marks the first indigenous territory recognized by the Brazilian government and it was the world&#x27;s largest indigenous preserve on the date of its creation. Currently, fourteen tribes live within Xingu Indigenous Park, surviving on natural resources and extracting from the river most of what they need for food and water.

The Brazilian government built the Belo Monte Dam on the Lower Xingu, which began operations in 2019 and is the world&#x27;s fifth-largest hydroelectric dam. Construction of this dam was under legal challenge by environment and indigenous groups, who assert the dam would have negative environmental and social impacts along with reducing the flow by up to 80% along a stretch known as the Volta Grande (&quot;Big Bend&quot;). The river flow in this stretch is highly complex and includes major sections of rapids. More than 450 fish species have been documented in the Xingu River Basin and it is estimated that the total is around 600 fish species, including many endemics. At least 193 fish species living in rapids are known from the lower Xingu, and at least 26 of these are endemic. From 2008 to 2018 alone, 24 new fish species have been described from the river. Many species are seriously threatened by the dam, which will significantly alter the flow in the Volta Grande rapids.

In the Upper Xingu region was a highly self-organized pre-Columbian anthropogenic landscape, including deposits of fertile agricultural terra preta, black soil in Portuguese, with a network of roads and polities each of which covered about 250 square kilometers.

Near the source of Xingu River is Culuene River, a tributary.

<text>Xerox Holdings Corporation (, ) is an American corporation that sells print and digital document products and services in more than 160 countries. Xerox was the pioneer of the photocopier market, beginning with the introduction of the Xerox 914 in 1959, so much so that the word &quot;xerox&quot; is commonly used as a synonym for &quot;photocopy&quot;. Xerox is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, though it is incorporated in New York with its largest group of employees based around Rochester, New York, the area in which the company was founded. As a large developed company, it is consistently placed in the list of Fortune 500 companies.

The company purchased Affiliated Computer Services for $6.4 billion in early 2010. On December 31, 2016, Xerox separated its business process service operations, essentially those operations acquired with the purchase of Affiliated Computer Services, into a new publicly traded company, Conduent. Xerox focuses on its document technology and document outsourcing business, and traded on the NYSE from 1961 to 2021, and the Nasdaq since 2021.

Researchers at Xerox and its Palo Alto Research Center invented several important elements of personal computing, such as the desktop metaphor GUI, the computer mouse and desktop computing. The concepts were adopted by Apple Inc. and later Microsoft.

==History==
Xerox was founded in 1906 in Rochester, New York, as the Haloid Photographic Company. It manufactured photographic paper and equipment.

In 1938, Chester Carlson, a physicist working independently, invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged photoconductor-coated metal plate and dry powder &quot;toner&quot;. However, it would take more than 20 years of refinement before the first automated machine to make copies was commercialized, using a document feeder, scanning light, and a rotating drum.
Joseph C. Wilson, credited as the &quot;founder of Xerox&quot;, took over Haloid from his father. He saw the promise of Carlson&#x27;s invention and, in 1946, signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product. Wilson remained as President/CEO of Xerox until 1967 and served as chairman until his death in 1971.

Looking for a term to differentiate its new system, Haloid hired a Greek scholar at Ohio State University and coined the term xerography from two Greek roots meaning &quot;dry writing&quot;.
Haloid changed its name to Haloid Xerox in 1958 and then Xerox Corporation in 1961.

Before releasing the 914, Xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype hand-operated equipment known as the Flat-plate 1385. The 1385 was not actually a viable copier because of its slowness of operation. As a consequence, it was sold as a platemaker for the Addressograph-Multigraph Multilith 1250 and related sheet-fed offset printing presses in the offset lithography market. It was little more than a high quality, commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera, complete with photo-flood lighting and timer. The glass film/plate had been replaced with a selenium-coated aluminum plate. Clever electrics turned this into a quick-developing and reusable substitute for film. A skilled user could produce fast, paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method. Having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry, Xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offset&#x27;s market share.

The 1385 was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer, the Copyflo, in 1955. The Copyflo was a large microfilm printer that could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative. Following the Copyflo, the process was scaled down to produce the 1824 microfilm printer. At about half the size and weight, this still sizable machine printed onto hand-fed, cut-sheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars. A scaled-down version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the 813 desktop copier.

===Xerox 914===
The company came to prominence in 1959 with the introduction of the Xerox 914, &quot;the most successful single product of all time&quot;. The 914, the first plain paper photocopier, was developed by Carlson and John H. Dessauer; it was so popular that by the end of 1961 Xerox had almost $60 million in revenue. The product was sold by an innovative ad campaign showing that even monkeys could make copies at the touch of a button - simplicity would become the foundation of Xerox products and user interfaces. Revenues leaped to over $500 million by 1965.

=== Xeronic Computer Printer ===

In 1956, Haloid formed a joint venture in the UK with Rank Organisation whose Rank Precision Industries Ltd. subsidiary was charged with anglicising the US products. Rank&#x27;s Precision Industries went on to develop the Xeronic computer printer and Rank Data Systems Ltd was set up to bring the product to market. It used cathode-ray tubes to generate the characters and forms that could be overlaid from microfilm images. Initially, they planned for the Ferranti and AEI computer companies to sell the Xeronic as an on-line peripheral, but due to interface problems, Rank switched to a magnetic tape off-line technique. In 1962, Lyons Computers Ltd. placed an order for use with their LEO III computer, and the printer was delivered in 1964. It printed 2,888 lines per minute, slower than the target of 5,000 lpm.

===1960s===

In the 1960s, Xerox held a dominant position in the photocopier market. In 1960, a xerography research facility called the Wilson Center for Research and Technology was opened in Webster, New York. In 1961, the company changed its name to Xerox Corporation. Xerox common stock (XRX) was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1961 and on the Chicago Stock Exchange in 1990.

In 1963, Xerox introduced the Xerox 813, the first desktop plain-paper copier, realizing Carlson&#x27;s vision of a copier that could fit on anyone&#x27;s office desk. Ten years later, in 1973, a basic, analogue, color copier, based on the 914, followed. The 914 itself was gradually sped up to become the 420 and 720. The 813 was similarly developed into the 330 and 660 products and, eventually, also the 740 desktop microfiche printer.

Xerox&#x27;s first foray into duplicating, as distinct from copying, was with the Xerox 2400, introduced in 1966. The model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour. Although not as fast as offset printing, this machine introduced the industry&#x27;s first automatic document feeder, paper slitter and perforator, and collator (sorter). This product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the Xerox 3600 Duplicator.

Meanwhile, a small lab team was borrowing copiers and modifying them. The lab was developing what it called long distance xerography (LDX) to connect a modified 813 copier to a CRT based scanner using a special service (TELPAK) of the public telephone network, so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other. The LDX system was introduced in 1964, followed in 1966 by the Magnafax Telecopier, a much smaller, slower and less expensive version that acoustically coupled to a desk phone. However, fax machines would not become a truly mainstream device until the 1980s.

In 1968, C. Peter McColough, a longtime executive of Haloid and Xerox, became Xerox&#x27;s CEO. The same year, the company consolidated its headquarters at Xerox Square in downtown Rochester, New York, with its 30-story Xerox Tower.

Xerox embarked on a series of acquisitions. It purchased University Microfilms International in 1962, Electro-Optical Systems in 1963, and R. R. Bowker in 1967. In 1969, Xerox acquired Scientific Data Systems (SDS), which it renamed the Xerox Data Systems (XDS) division and which produced the Sigma line and its successor XDS 5xx series of mainframe computers in the 1960s and 1970s. Xerox sold XDS to Honeywell in 1975.

===1970s===
Archie McCardell was named president of the company in 1971. During his tenure, Xerox introduced the Xerox 6500, its first color copier. During McCardell&#x27;s reign at Xerox, the company announced record revenues, earnings and profits in 1973, 1974, and 1975. John Carrol became a backer, later spreading the company throughout North America.

In the mid-1970s, Xerox introduced the Xerox 9200 Duplicating System. Originally designed to be sold to print shops to increase their productivity, it was twice a fast as the 3600 duplicator at two impressions per second (7200 per hour). It was followed by the 9400, which did auto-duplexing, and then by the 9500, which was which added variable zoom reduction and electronic lightness/darkness control.

In a 1975 Super Bowl commercial for the 9200, Xerox debuted an advertising campaign featuring Brother Dominic, a monk who used the 9200 system to save decades of manual copying. Before it was aired, there was some concern that the commercial would be denounced as blasphemous. However, when the commercial was screened for the Archbishop of New York, he found it amusing and gave it his blessing. Dominic, portrayed by Jack Eagle, became the face of Xerox into the 1980s.

Following these years of record profits, in 1975, Xerox resolved an anti-trust suit with the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which at the time was under the direction of Frederic M. Scherer. The Xerox consent decree resulted in the forced licensing of the company&#x27;s entire patent portfolio, mainly to Japanese competitors. Within four years of the consent decree, Xerox&#x27;s share of the U.S. copier market dropped from nearly 100% to less than 14%.

In 1979, Xerox purchased Western Union International (WUI) as the basis for its proposed &quot;Xerox Telecommunications Network&quot; (XTEN) for local-loop communications. However, after three years, in 1982, the company decided the idea was a mistake and sold its assets to MCI at a loss.

===1980s===
David T. Kearns, a Xerox executive since 1971, took over as CEO in 1982. The company was revived in the 1980s and 1990s, through improvement in quality design and realignment of its product line. Attempting to expand beyond copiers, in 1981 Xerox introduced a line of electronic memory typewriters, the &quot;Memorywriter&quot;, which gained 20% market share, mostly at the expense of IBM.

In 1980, Xerox acquired Kurzweil Computer Products, a pioneering manufacturer of flatbed scanners, from Ray Kurzweil. It later acquired Datacopy, another pioneer in the image scanner market, for $31 million in 1986. 

In 1983, Xerox bought Crum &amp; Forster, an insurance company, and formed Xerox Financial Services (XFS) in 1984.

In 1985, Xerox sold all of its publishing subsidiaries including University Microfilms and R. R. Bowker.

The 6500 color copier was also introduced in 1986. The first one was sold in Philadelphia by Jack Schneider.

In 1989, Xerox won the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for Business Products and Systems, headquartered in Rochester, NY.

===1990s===

In 1990, Paul Allaire, a Xerox executive since 1966, succeeded David Kearns, who had reached mandatory retirement age. Allaire disentangled Xerox from the financial services industry.

The development of digital photocopiers in the 1990s and a revamp of the entire product range again gave Xerox a technical lead over its competitors. In 1990, Xerox released the DocuTech Production Publisher Model 135, ushering in print-on-demand. Digital photocopiers were essentially high-end laser printers with integrated scanners. Soon, additional features such as network printing and faxing were added to many models, known as multi-function machines, or just MFMs, which were able to be attached to computer networks. Xerox worked to turn its product into a service, providing a complete document service to companies including supply, maintenance, configuration, and user support.

To reinforce this image, the company introduced a corporate signature in 1994, The Document Company, above its main logo and introduced a red digital X. The digital X symbolized the transition of documents between the paper and digital worlds.

In April 1999, Allaire was succeeded by Richard Thoman, who had been brought in from IBM in 1997 as president. The first &quot;outsider&quot; to head Xerox, Thoman resigned in 2000.

===2000s===

After Thoman&#x27;s resignation, Allaire again resumed the position of CEO and served until the appointment of Anne M. Mulcahy, another long-term Xerox executive. Xerox&#x27;s turnaround was largely led by Mulcahy, who was appointed president in May 2000, CEO in August 2001 and chairman in January 2002. She launched an aggressive turnaround plan that returned Xerox to full-year profitability by the end of 2002, along with decreasing debt, increasing cash, and continuing to invest in research and development.

In 2000, Xerox acquired Tektronix color printing and imaging division in Wilsonville, Oregon, for US$925 million. This led to the current Xerox Phaser line of products as well as Xerox solid ink printing technology.

In September 2004, Xerox celebrated the 45th anniversary of the Xerox 914. More than 200,000 units were made around the world between 1959 and 1976, the year production of the 914 was stopped. Today, the 914 is part of American history as an artifact in the Smithsonian Institution.

In November 2006, Xerox completed the acquisition of XMPie. XMPie, a provider of software for cross-media, variable data one-to-one marketing, was the first acquisition of Xerox to remain independent entity, as a Xerox company and not a division, and to this day is led by its original founder Jacob Aizikowitz.

Xerox headquarters moved from Stamford, Connecticut, to Norwalk in October 2007.

In October 2008, Xerox Canada Ltd. was named one of Greater Toronto&#x27;s Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper.

On July 1, 2009, Ursula Burns succeeded Anne Mulcahy as CEO of Xerox. Burns was the first African American woman to head a company of that size.

On September 28, 2009, Xerox announced the intended acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services, a services and outsourcing company, for $6.4 billion. The acquisition was completed in February 2010. Xerox said it paid 4.935 Xerox shares and $18.60 cash for each share of ACS, totaling $6.4 billion, or $63.11 a share for the company.

===2010s===

In May 2011, Xerox acquired NewField IT for an undisclosed sum.

In December 2013, Xerox sold its Wilsonville, Oregon solid ink product design, engineering and chemistry group and related assets previously acquired from Tektronix to 3D Systems for $32.5 million in cash.

In December 2014, Xerox sold the IT outsourcing business it had acquired in 2009 from Affiliated Computer Services to Atos for $1.05 billion. This move was taken due to the relatively slow growth of this business relative to some other Xerox units.

In January 2016, Xerox—reportedly under pressure from activist shareholder and corporate raider Carl Icahn—announced that by the end of the year it would spin off its business services unit, largely made up of Affiliated Computer Services, into its own publicly traded company. The name and management of the new company had not been determined at the time of the announcement. Icahn would appoint three members of the new company&#x27;s board of directors, and he would choose a person to advise its search for a CEO. In June, the company announced that the document management business would retain the name Xerox and the new business services company would be named Conduent. It also announced that Ashok Vemuri would serve as Conduent&#x27;s CEO and that Icahn would control three seats on the new company&#x27;s board. It continued to seek a CEO for Xerox; in May, Burns announced her intention to step down as CEO but continue as chairman of the document management business. In June 2016, the company announced that Jeff Jacobson would become the new CEO following the completion of the company&#x27;s planned separation. This became effective in January 2017.

On January 31, 2018, Xerox announced that Fujifilm had agreed to acquire a 50.1% controlling stake in the company for US$6.1 billion, which was to be combined into their existing joint venture Fuji Xerox (having a value of $18 billion post-acquisition).
On May 1, 2018, it was announced that chairman Robert Keegan and CEO Jeff Jacobson and four other directors would resign as part of a deal with investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who had mounted a proxy fight to oppose the Fujifilm deal. On May 4, Xerox backed away from the deal after stipulations about ceasing litigation were not met. Icahn and Deason responded with an open letter to shareholders blaming the board and management. On May 13 a new deal was reached that additionally cancelled the Fujifilm transaction.

In November 2019, Xerox began to pursue a hostile takeover of PC and printer manufacturer HP Inc., declaring its intent to &quot;engage directly&quot; with shareholders after HP rejected two unsolicited bids for the company. Xerox stated in January 2020 that it would pursue the replacement of HP&#x27;s board. HP criticized the proposed purchase as a &quot;flawed value exchange&quot; based on &quot;overstated synergies&quot;, and instituted a shareholder rights plan and other measures designed to quell the bid, which the company believed was being orchestrated by Icahn.

=== 2020s ===

In February 2020, Xerox announced the hiring of Tali Rosman as VP of Xerox&#x27;s 3D business. She joined Xerox from NICE Ltd., where she was vice president and head of business operations for the Americas. She would report to CTO Naresh Shanker.

On March 5, HP revealed that its board of directors had unanimously declined Xerox&#x27;s $24 a share cash-and-stock offer.

On March 13, Xerox revealed that it was putting its campaign to acquire HP on hold by postponing additional presentations, interviews with the press and meetings with HP shareholders. Xerox vice chairman and chief executive John Visentin cited the COVID-19 pandemic as a main reason and said, &quot;In light of the escalating Covid-19 pandemic, Xerox needs to prioritize health and safety of its employees, customers, partners and affiliates over and above all considerations, including its proposal to acquire HP.&quot;

On March 31, 2020, Xerox canceled its $24 a share offer.

In September 2020, Xerox opened its North Carolina Center of Excellence in Cary, North Carolina. The center includes the research and development operations, the 3-D printing lab, and th eXerox Digital eXperience IT organization.

In September 2021, Xerox announced it was transferring its stock ticker from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq after 60 years. The move, as described by Visentin, was to &quot;[challenge] the status quo by developing and leveraging new innovations to create solutions that address major secular challenges across industries&quot;, and was viewed as part of Xerox&#x27;s transition into software. The transfer went into effect on September 21, 2021.

In December 2024, Xerox announced an agreement to acquire Lexmark International, a Chinese-owned maker of printers and printing software, in a $1.5 billion deal. This acquisition aims to strengthen Xerox&#x27;s foothold in Asian markets.

===Digital printing===
The laser printer was invented in 1969 by Xerox researcher Gary Starkweather by modifying a Xerox 7000 copier. Xerox management was afraid the product version of Starkweather&#x27;s invention, which became the 9700, would negatively impact their copier business so the innovation sat in limbo until IBM launched the 3800 laser printer in 1976.
The first commercial non-impact printer was the Xerox 1200, introduced in 1973, based on the 3600 copier. It had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer Phil Chen. It was used in mainframe computer environments for large-volume printing for business applications.

In 1977, after IBM had produced the first laser printer, the Xerox 9700 was introduced. It was also used in mainframe environments and could handle even larger amounts of paper and printing. Laser printing eventually became a multibillion-dollar business for Xerox.

In the late 1970s, Xerox introduced the Xerox 350 color slide machine. This product allowed the customer to create digital word and graphic 35-millimetre slides. Many of the concepts used in today&#x27;s photo editing programs were pioneered with this technology.

In 1980, Xerox announced the 5700 laser printer, a much smaller version of their 9700, but with touch-screen capabilities and multiple media input (word processing disks, IBM magcards, etc.) and printer &#x27;finishing&#x27; options. This product was allegedly never intended to make the commercial markets due to its development cost, but rather to show the innovation of Xerox. It took off with many customers, but was soon replaced with the smaller and lower cost Xerox 2700 Distributed Electronic Printer offering in 1982.

===Palo Alto Research Center===
In 1970, under company president C. Peter McColough, Xerox opened the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, known as Xerox PARC. The facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface (GUI), laser printing, WYSIWYG text editors, and Ethernet. From these inventions, Xerox PARC created the Xerox Alto in 1973, a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer. This machine can be considered the first true Personal Computer, given its versatile combination of a cathode-ray-type screen, mouse-type pointing device, and a QWERTY-type alphanumeric keyboard. But the Alto was never commercially sold, as Xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it. It was, however, installed in Xerox&#x27;s own offices, worldwide and those of the US Government and military, who could see the potential. Within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by Xerox&#x27;s own unique LAN, The Ethernet. Data was sent around this system of heavy, yellow, low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system. In addition, PARC also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites, the PARC Universal Packet (PUP).

In 1979, Steve Jobs made a deal with Xerox&#x27;s venture capital division: He would let them invest US$1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on. Jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the WIMP (Window, Icon, Menu, and Pointing device) system and redirected development of the Apple Lisa to incorporate these technologies. Jobs is quoted as saying: &quot;They just had no idea what they had.&quot;

In 1980, Jobs invited several key PARC researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas.
In 1981, Xerox released a system similar to the Alto, the Xerox Star. It was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers, such as a bitmapped display, window-based GUI, mouse, Ethernet networking, file servers, print servers, and e-mail. The Xerox Star and its successor the Xerox Daybreak, despite their technological breakthroughs, did not sell well due to its high price, retailing at US$16,000 per unit (). A typical Xerox Star-based office, complete with network and printers, would have cost US$100,000 ().

In the mid-1980s, Apple considered buying Xerox; however, a deal was never reached. Apple instead bought rights to the Alto GUI and adapted it into a more affordable personal computer, aimed towards the business and education markets. The Apple Macintosh was released in 1984, and it was the first personal computer to popularize the GUI and mouse among the public.

In 2002, PARC was spun off into an independent wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox.

In April 2023, Xerox announced that it would donate the lab and its related assets to SRI International. As part of the deal, Xerox would keep most of the patent rights inside PARC, and benefit from a preferred research agreement with SRI/PARC.

==Chief executives==
==Products and services==

Xerox manufactures and sells office equipment including scanners, printers, and multifunction systems that scan, print, copy, email and fax. These model families include WorkCentre, Phaser, and ColorQube. For the graphic communications and commercial print industries, the Xerox product portfolio includes high-volume, digital printing presses, production printers, and wide format printers that use xerographic and inkjet printing technologies. Products include the iGen, Nuvera, DocuPrint, and Impika series, as well as the Trivor, iPrint, and Rialto (inkjet) machines.

==Corporate structure==

Although Xerox is a global brand, it maintained a joint venture from 1962 to 2021, Fuji Xerox, with Japanese photographic firm Fuji Photo Film Co. to develop, produce and sell in the Asia-Pacific region. Fujifilm announced in January 2020 that it would not renew its technology agreement with Xerox, with Fuji Xerox being renamed to Fujifilm Business Innovation in April 2021.

Xerox India, formerly Modi Xerox, is Xerox&#x27;s Indian subsidiary derived from a joint venture formed between Dr. Bhupendra Kumar Modi and Rank Xerox in 1983. Xerox obtained a majority stake in 1999 and aims to buy out the remaining shareholders.

NewField IT is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox that implements and supports third-party software for MPS providers.

==Rank Xerox==
The European company Rank Xerox, originally a joint venture between Xerox and the British company The Rank Organisation, later extended to Asia and Africa, has been fully owned by Xerox Corporation since 1997. The Rank Xerox name was discontinued following the buyout, and the Rank Xerox Research Centre was renamed to the Xerox Research Centre Europe. The laboratory, based in France, was acquired by South Korean IT company Naver Corporation in 2017, and later became Naver Labs Europe.

== Sponsorship ==
Xerox now sponsors the Factory Ducati Team in the World Superbike Championship, under the name of the &quot;Xerox Ducati&quot;.

In November 2024, Aston Martin F1 Team announced a partnership with Xerox commencing in 2025.

==Accounting irregularities==
On May 31, 2001, Xerox Corporation announced that its auditors, KPMG LLP, had certified Xerox&#x27;s financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2000; the financials included some restatements. On March 31, 2002, Xerox restated its financials which reflected the reallocation of equipment sales revenue of more than $2 billion. On April 11, 2002, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against Xerox. The complaint alleged Xerox deceived the public between 1997 and 2000 by employing several &quot;accounting maneuvers&quot;, the most significant of which was a change in which Xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases – recognizing a &quot;sale&quot; when a lease contract was signed, instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract. At issue was when the revenue was recognized, not the validity of the revenue. Xerox&#x27;s restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized. On December 20, 2002, Xerox Corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its non-cash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements, resulted in after-tax understatement of interest expense of approximately $5 million to $6 million or less than 1 cent per share in each of the four quarters of 2001 and for the first three quarters of 2002.

In response to the SEC&#x27;s complaint, Xerox Corporation neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. It agreed to pay a $10 million penalty and to restate its financial results for the years 1997 through 2000. On June 5, 2003, six Xerox senior executives accused of securities fraud settled their issues with the SEC and neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. They agreed to pay $22 million in penalties, disgorgement, and interest. The company received approval to settle the securities lawsuit in 2008.

On January 29, 2003, the SEC filed a complaint against Xerox&#x27;s auditors, KPMG, alleging four partners in the &quot;Big Five&quot; accounting firm permitted Xerox to &quot;cook the books&quot; to fill a $3 billion &quot;gap&quot; in revenue and $1.4 billion &quot;gap&quot; in pre-tax earnings. In April 2005 KPMG settled with the SEC by paying a US$22.48 million fine. Meanwhile, Xerox paid a civil penalty of $10 million. As part of the settlement KPMG neither admits nor denies wrongdoings.

During a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Xerox began to revamp itself once more. As a symbol of this transformation, the relative size of the word &quot;Xerox&quot; was increased in proportion to &quot;The Document Company&quot; on the corporate signature, and the latter was dropped altogether in September 2004, along with the digital X. However, the digital X and &quot;The Document Company&quot; were still used by Fuji Xerox until April 2008.

==Character substitution bug==
In 2013, German computer scientist discovered an error in a Xerox WorkCentre 7535 copier. The device would substitute number digits in scanned documents, even when OCR was turned off. For instance, a cost table in a scanned document had an entry of 85.40, instead of the original sum of 65.40. After unsuccessfully trying to resolve this issue with Xerox&#x27;s customer support, he publicised his findings on his blog. Providing example pages that would lead to the bug occurring, it was confirmed that this bug was reproducible on a wide variety of Xerox WorkCentre and other high-end Xerox copiers.

The source of the error was a bug in the JBIG2 implementation, which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once. While this provides a high level of compression, it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters.

A possible workaround was published by Kriesel, which involved setting the image quality from &quot;normal&quot; to &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;high&quot;. Shortly afterwards, it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual, which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in &quot;normal mode&quot;, indicating that Xerox was aware of the software error. In Xerox&#x27;s initial response to a growing interest by the media, the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed. After Kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes (normal, higher and high) including the factory defaults, Xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem. Despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode, Xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch.

==Trademark==

The word &quot;xerox&quot; is used as a synonym for &quot;photocopy&quot; (both as a noun and a verb) in many areas: for example, &quot;I xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk&quot; or &quot;Please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam&quot;. Though both are common, the company does not condone such uses of its trademark, and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of Xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts. The company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that Xerox should not be used as a verb.

To this end, the company has written to publications that have used Xerox as a verb. It has also purchased print advertisements using &quot;xerox&quot; as a verb, claiming that &quot;you cannot &#x27;xerox&#x27; a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying machine&quot;. Xerox Corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categories. Despite their efforts, many dictionaries continue to include the use of &quot;xerox&quot; as a verb, including the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. In 2012, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) of India declared &quot;xerox&quot; a non-generic term after &quot;almost 50 years (1963–2009) of continued existence on the register without challenge, and with proof of almost 44 years of use evident (1965–2009)&quot;, but as of 2015, most Indians still use it as a synonym for photocopying.

The company has also advertised its trademark concerns, in an attempt to persuade journalists and others not to use &quot;Xerox&quot; as a verb.

<text>In computing, Xyzzy is sometimes used as a metasyntactic variable or as a video game cheat code. &quot;Xyzzy&quot; comes from the &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; computer game, where it is the first &quot;magic string&quot; that most players encounter (others include &quot;plugh&quot; and &quot;plover&quot;).

==Origin==
Modern usage is primarily from one of the earliest computer games, &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, in which the player explores a cave with many rooms, collecting the treasures found there. By typing &quot;xyzzy&quot; at the appropriate time, the player could move instantly between two otherwise distant points. As &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; was both one of the first adventure games and one of the first interactive fiction pieces, hundreds of later interactive fiction games included responses to the command &quot;xyzzy&quot; in tribute.

The origin of the word &quot;xyzzy&quot; has been the subject of debate. According to Ron Hunsinger, the sequence of letters &quot;XYZZY&quot; has been used as a mnemonic to remember the process for computing cross products. Will Crowther, the author of &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, states that he was unaware of the mnemonic, and that he &quot;made it up from whole cloth&quot; when writing the game.

== Usage ==
===Operating systems===
Xyzzy has been implemented as an undocumented no-op command on several operating systems; in the 16-bit version of Data General&#x27;s AOS, for example, it would typically respond &quot;Nothing happens&quot;, just as the game did if the magic was invoked at the wrong spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled the word. The 32-bit version, AOS/VS, would respond &quot;Twice as much happens&quot;. On several computer systems from Sun Microsystems, the command &quot;xyzzy&quot; is used to enter the interactive shell of the U-Boot bootloader. Early versions of Zenith Z-DOS (a re-branded variant of MS-DOS 1.25) had the command &quot;xyzzy&quot; which took a parameter of &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;. Xyzzy by itself would print the status of the last &quot;xyzzy on&quot; or &quot;xyzzy off&quot; command.

When booting a Cr-48 from developer mode, when the screen displays the &quot;sad laptop&quot; image, typing &quot;xyzzy&quot; produces a joke Blue Screen of Death.

According to Brantley Coile, the Cisco PIX firewall had a xyzzy command that simply said &quot;Nothing happens.&quot; He also put the command into the Coraid VSX to escape the CLI and get into the shell. It would announce &quot;Foof! You are in a directory. There are files here.&quot; The new California Coraid management made the developers change the string to &quot;/exportmode&quot; and get rid of the &quot;Foof!&quot; message. Since regaining ownership of the Coraid software, the command is being returned to the system and now, in VSX release 8, the response is &quot;»Foof!« You are in a debris room.&quot;

===Application programs===
Within the low-traffic Usenet newsgroup alt.xyzzy, the word is used for test messages, to which other readers (if there are any) customarily respond, &quot;Nothing happens&quot; as a note that the test message was successfully received. In the Internet Relay Chat client mIRC and Pidgin, entering the undocumented command &quot;/xyzzy&quot; will display the response &quot;Nothing happens&quot;. The string &quot;xyzzy&quot; is also used internally by mIRC as the hard-coded master encryption key that is used to decrypt over 20 sensitive strings from within the mirc.exe program file.
A &quot;deluxe chatting program&quot; for DIGITAL&#x27;s VAX/VMS written by David Bolen in 1987 and distributed via BITNET took the name xyzzy. It enabled users on the same system or on linked DECnet nodes to communicate via text in real time. There was a compatible program with the same name for IBM&#x27;s VM/CMS.

xYzZY is used as the default boundary marker by the Perl HTTP::Message module for multipart MIME messages, and was used in Apple&#x27;s AtEase for workgroups as the default administrator password in the 1990s.
Gmail supports the command &quot;XYZZY&quot; when connected via IMAP before logging in. It takes no arguments, and responds with &quot;OK Nothing happens.&quot;

The Hewlett-Packard 9836A computer with HPL 2.0 programming language has XYZZY built into the HPL language itself with the result of &quot;I see no cave here.&quot; when used. The same message is returned from HP 3458A and HP 3245A instruments when queried with XYZZY via the HPIB bus.

In most versions of the Ingres dbms, returns &quot;Nothing happens.&quot; However, returns &quot;Nothing happens to Wim&quot;. The function has been part of the Ingres product since at least version 5 (late 1980s), but was removed from the main codeline sometime in the early 2000s. While talking to one of the members of the Ingres development team, Wim de Boer, at that time the secretary of the Ingres Users Group Nederland (IUGN), mentioned the removal of this Easter egg. This developer, who was a frequent speaker at the events organised by the IUGN, managed to put the function back into the product and—especially for Wim—added handling for the &#x27;wim&#x27; value of the parameter.

===Other computer games and media===

The popular &quot;Minesweeper&quot; game under older versions of Microsoft Windows had a cheat mode triggered by entering the command codice_1, then pressing the key sequence shift and then enter, which turned a single pixel in the top-left corner of the entire screen into a small black or white dot depending on whether or not the mouse pointer is over a mine. This easter egg was present in all Windows versions through Windows XP Service Pack 3, but under Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0 the pixel was visible only if the standard Explorer desktop was not running. The easter egg does not exist in versions after Windows XP SP3.

In the game &quot;Zork&quot;, typing xyzzy and pressing enter produces the response: &quot;A hollow voice says &#x27;fool. The command commonly produces a humorous response in other Infocom games and text adventures, leading to its usage in the title of the interactive fiction competition, the XYZZY Awards.

In the 1994 game &quot;Road Rash&quot;, if the user were to enter &quot;xyzzy&quot; in the main menu, they could access several cheats such as nitrous refills, oil refills, etc.

In the 2022 game &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot; the code is written on a sign at the entrance of a cave labyrinth. Ripping the sign off and using it in the cave, which leads to reading it, lets the protagonist, Guybrush Threepwood, return to the entrance of the cave.

<doc id="34168" wikidata="Q583360" url="?curid=34168" title="Xenogears">
<text>Xenogears is a 1998 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation video game console. It is the debut entry in the larger &quot;Xeno&quot; franchise. The gameplay of &quot;Xenogears&quot; revolves around navigating 3D environments both on-foot and using humanoid mecha dubbed &quot;Gears&quot;. Combat is governed by a version of the turn-based &quot;Active Time Battle&quot; system. The story follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey across the world to overthrow the all-powerful rule of Solaris and uncover mysteries concerning their world. The story incorporates Jungian psychology, Freudian thought, and religious symbolism.

Created by Tetsuya Takahashi and his wife Kaori Tanaka as a proposal for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, it was allowed to be developed as its own project; first as a sequel to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and then as an original game with a science fiction premise. The characters were designed by Kunihiko Tanaka, while the gears were designed by Junya Ishigaki and Yoshinori Ogura. The designs were portrayed during in-game cinematics through the use of anime cutscenes. Due to time constraints and the team&#x27;s general inexperience, the second half of the game&#x27;s plot was primarily told through cutscenes.

The game was almost not localized due to its religious content; its localization was handled by Square Electronic Arts staff and translator Richard Honeywood, who described it as one of the most troublesome games of his career. Xenogears received critical acclaim, with many calling it a work of art due to its heavy religious themes and elements of Jungian psychology. Praises particularly went towards the storyline, gameplay, characters, and psychological and religious themes, but received criticism for the rushed pace of the second disc, due to a lack of gameplay and excessive narration. By 2003, the game had shipped 1.19 million copies worldwide, gaining a cult following. While a direct sequel has not been developed, Takahashi would later found Monolith Soft and develop the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; trilogy and &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; games as spiritual successors.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Xenogears&quot; combines traditional role-playing video game structures such as Square&#x27;s signature Active Time Battle system with new features particular to the game&#x27;s martial arts combat style. It features two slightly different battle systems: in the first, the player controls human characters in turn-based combat manipulated through the sequencing of learned combos. The second, making use of &quot;gears&quot;, introduces different sets of statistics and abilities for each character. &quot;Xenogears&quot; features both traditional anime and pre-rendered CGI movie clips by Production I.G to illustrate important plot points. The player advances the protagonist and his companions through a three-dimensional fictional world.

Battle in &quot;Xenogears&quot; is a variant of the Active Time Battle system found in games such as &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Most enemy encounters in &quot;Xenogears&quot; are random. When a battle begins, there is a transition to a separate screen with a combat interface. Player-characters use a combination of martial arts moves, &quot;Ether&quot; (magical) attacks, and special &quot;Deathblow&quot; combinations, which are learned through the repetition of specific proportions of strong, moderate, and weak hits. All offensive actions use Action Points (AP), costing either three points, two points, or one point, corresponding to the intensity of the attack.

Characters can use a variety of magical abilities for both offense and ally-support. These abilities are limited by the number of available Ether Points (EP), which must be replenished using items during exploration (non-combat) sequences. For most characters, these abilities are attributed to &quot;Ether&quot;, a mysterious power to which (presumably) all humans have access. Some characters&#x27; magical abilities are referred to by different names, implying differences in their origins. For example, Fei&#x27;s magic is called &quot;Chi&quot; and Citan&#x27;s is called &quot;Arcane&quot;. While fighting in gears, human Ether abilities are amplified, though some change or become unavailable during this type of combat.

In addition to hand-to-hand combat, the characters sometimes fight from within giant robots called gears. In gear combat, the limiting factor of AP is replaced by fuel, with each attack consuming an amount corresponding to its power. For these battles, &quot;deathblows&quot; may only be executed after first building up the &quot;Attack Level&quot;—represented by a number in the bottom-left of the gear combat interface—through the execution of strong, moderate, or weak attacks. One deathblow is allowed per point on the Attack Level gauge. There are three levels for normal gear deathblows and, beyond the third level, an &quot;infinite&quot; level with its own set of deathblows. To reach &quot;Infinity Mode&quot;, a character must stay at attack level 3 while performing any other action. With each turn, there is a chance that Infinity Mode will be reached. Having a duration of three turns, Infinity Mode allows fuel to be recharged in much larger quantities and, while in this mode, gears have access to &quot;Infinity&quot; attacks. Gears can regain fuel with a &quot;Charge&quot; command. The gears can activate &quot;Boosters&quot; which enable them to act faster at a cost of extra fuel per turn.

==Plot==

===Setting===
&quot;Xenogears&quot; initially takes place on Ignas, the largest continent of the &quot;Xenogears&quot; world and the site of a centuries-long war between the nations of Aveh and Kislev. A church-like organization known as the Ethos has excavated gears, giant robot suits, for the preservation of the world&#x27;s culture. Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to assist Aveh. With Gebler&#x27;s help, the Aveh military recovered its losses and began making its way into Kislev&#x27;s territory. As the story unfolds, the setting broadens to encompass the entire world and the two floating countries, Shevat and Solaris. Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and an AI collective known as the Gazel Ministry, commands the Gebler army and the Ethos and secretly uses both to dominate the land-dwellers. Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris.

Much of the &quot;Xenogears&quot; plot and backstory is detailed in the Japanese-only book &quot;Xenogears Perfect Works&quot;. Produced by DigiCube, it details the history of the &quot;Xenogears&quot; universe from the discovery of the Zohar to the start of the game. According to the &quot;Perfect Works&quot; schematic (as well as the game&#x27;s end credits), &quot;Xenogears&quot; is the fifth episode in a series of six, with events spanning multiple millennia.

===Characters===

&quot;Xenogears&quot;″ nine playable characters come from different areas of the game&#x27;s world. The game begins on Ignas, a continent with two countries, Aveh and Kislev. Fei and Citan at first appear to be from this land, although it is later learned that they originate from the capital cities Aphel Aura and Etrenank of the floating countries of Shevat and Solaris, respectively. Fei is the story&#x27;s protagonist, and has initially lost his memories of his past. Elly, a beautiful Gebler officer of Solaris, is destined to be near Fei and falls in love with him by the end of the game. Citan is a man whose knowledge of the world and technology often aids in the party&#x27;s quest. Bart, a desert pirate, is also from Ignas and is the rightful heir to the throne of Aveh. Rico, a demi-human with incredible strength, lives in a Kislev prison, spending his days as a gear-battling champion. Solaris, a hidden city of advanced technology, is home to several characters in the game. Billy, a pious worker for the Ethos religious group, was originally from Solaris. Maria and Chu-Chu are both from Shevat, the floating city and the only place resisting Solaris&#x27; domination. Emeralda is a humanoid being constructed by an ancient civilization from a colony of nanomachines, and was retrieved from the ruins of the ancient civilization Zeboim. Significant non-playable characters include Krelian and Miang, both leaders of Solaris who seek to revive Deus, a mechanical weapon that fell to earth thousands of years ago. They serve as the game&#x27;s main antagonists. Grahf, a mysterious man with immense power, serves as a major antagonist; he follows Fei and his group and often fights them, though his goals remain a mystery until very late in the game. As being &quot;the Contact&quot; and &quot;the Anti-type&quot;, Fei and Elly have been reincarnated several times, while &quot;the Complement&quot;, Miang, has awoken in hundreds of women down throughout the game&#x27;s history.

===Story=== 
&quot;Xenogears&quot; centers around the protagonist Fei Fong Wong, an adopted young male in the village of Lahan, brought by a mysterious &quot;masked man&quot; three years ago. The events surrounding Fei&#x27;s arrival at the village cause him to have retrograde amnesia. During an attack on Lahan from Gebler, Fei pilots an empty gear and fights the enemy, accidentally destroying the village. As a result, Fei and Citan, the village&#x27;s doctor, leave with the abandoned gear to get it away from the village. Fei meets Elly, a Gebler officer, and then Grahf, who claims to know about Fei&#x27;s past and admits to spearheading the attack on Lahan to unlock Fei&#x27;s abilities. Eventually, Fei and Citan are picked up by Bart, a desert pirate and heir to the throne of Aveh. Fei again loses control of himself inside his gear while Bart and Citan are attacked by an unknown red gear. Fei wakes up in a Kislev prison and meets Wiseman, a mysterious masked man, who originally brought Fei to Lahan. Fei is able to escape with the help of his friends, including a new one, prisoner Rico, but he and Elly are separated from the rest of the party and accidentally shot down by Bart.

They are rescued by the Thames, a mobile floating city. After learning Elly&#x27;s whereabouts, Gebler attacks Thames to kidnap Elly and Miang, a Gebler officer, unsuccessfully attempts to brainwash her. Gebler leader Ramsus, who holds a vendetta against Fei, attacks Thames, searching for him. Afterward, Billy, an Ethos worker onboard Thames, allows Fei to use the Ethos&#x27; advanced medical technology. Bishop Stone, Ethos&#x27; leader, reveals to the party Ethos&#x27;s true purpose of controlling the land dwellers, or &quot;Lambs&quot;, for Solaris. The group follows Stone to Zeboim, an excavation site. They discover a young girl composed of nanomachines, which is what Solarian leader Krelian seeks. Stone takes the girl while the group fights Id, the mysterious red gear&#x27;s pilot, who wants the girl, but is stopped by Wiseman. The group returns and finds Fei awake and standing at his gear with a case of anterograde amnesia. Fei and his friends decide to ally themselves with the floating city of Shevat, the only remaining city capable of resisting Solaris, joined by Shevat locals Maria and Chu-Chu. During this time, Bart regains his throne and initiates peace between the two countries and Stone is destroyed. Upon entering Solaris, they encounter Emeralda, the nanomachine colony. She attacks at first, but recognizes Fei, referring to him as &quot;Kim&quot;, much to Fei&#x27;s confusion. In Solaris, Fei learns that Citan has been working for Emperor Cain and that Solaris has been producing food and medicine out of mutated humans in the Soylent System facility. The party also learns that the Gazel Ministry seeks to revive God and achieve eternal life, while Krelian seeks to possess Elly. They escape from Solaris before Id destroys it as Citan was really a double agent on their side because Cain was actually against the Ministry. Back at Shevat, Citan informs his friends that Id is actually Fei&#x27;s split personality, with Fei&#x27;s gear turning red when he switches to Id due to their connection.

After Krelian manipulates Ramsus into assassinating the Emperor, the Gazel Ministry uses the Gaetia Key, an artifact that manipulates the DNA of massive numbers of humans around the world, turning them into mutants called Wels to collect flesh to reconstruct their god, an all-powerful war machine called Deus that crash-landed on the planet ten thousand years ago. During this time, Elly and Fei become romantically involved with each other and learn that they are the reincarnations of Sophia and Lacan. Lacan was a painter while Sophia was the Holy Mother of Nisan around the time of the war between Shevat and Solaris five hundred years earlier. Lacan blamed himself for Sophia&#x27;s death during the war and, with the help of Miang, became Grahf and sought to destroy the world. Although defeated, he and Miang have transmigrated their minds into other humans since. Krelian disposes the Gazel Ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnaps Elly, the &quot;Mother&quot;, with Miang who must be sacrificed in order to revive Deus. Miang is killed by an enraged Ramsus as he realizes he has been used, and Elly turns into Miang. Before becoming absorbed by Deus with Krelian, Miang revealed that Deus is actually the core of an interplanetary invasion system created by a federation of spacefaring humans, one that was deemed far too dangerous for use and was therefore dismantled. Fei, as Id, attempts to make contact with the Zohar. Wiseman, who reveals himself to be Fei&#x27;s father, stops him, giving peace to Fei&#x27;s other personalities. At this time, Fei makes contact with the Wave Existence—an extra-dimensional being who is trapped inside Deus and is the source of power for all gears—and learns that he must destroy Deus to free humanity. Fei&#x27;s gear transforms into the Xenogears and Grahf appears, revealing that he had been inside Fei&#x27;s father&#x27;s body. Grahf tries to merge with Fei but is defeated and sacrifices himself.

Fei had discovered that he is a descendant of Abel, a young boy who was a passenger on board the Eldridge, a spaceship that was being used to transport Deus, who had become self-aware and took over the Eldridge. Amidst the confusion, Abel was separated from his mother and accidentally made contact with the Wave Existence through the Zohar, Deus&#x27; power source. It gave him the power to one day destroy Deus and the Zohar in order to free itself. The Wave Existence also sensed Abel&#x27;s longing for his mother and used the biological computer Kadomony to create a woman for a companion. When Deus gained full control over the Eldridge, the captain decided to initiate the self-destruct sequence in an attempt to destroy it. Both Deus and the Zohar survived the explosion and landed on a nearby planet along with Abel, under the protection of the Wave Existence. He was the sole survivor, but was soon united with the woman that the Wave Existence had created for him as a companion, Elly. Abel and Elly, at first, led a happy life, but Deus had also created Miang, Cain, and the Gazel Ministry to begin a human civilization on the planet, one which would be under their control to one day be turned into Wels and be absorbed into Deus to recover its strength. When the now-adult Abel and Elly discovered this, they openly challenged Cain and the Gazel Ministry, but lost and were both killed. However, through the power of the Wave Existence, they are able to be reincarnated in later eras to combat Deus. One of these incarnations lived during an ancient technologically advanced era in Zeboim, where Abel&#x27;s incarnation went by the name Kim and created Emeralda. Ramsus, revealed to be a biologically engineered clone of Emperor Cain, who had a change of heart over time after killing Abel, created by Krelian and Miang as a means of controlling Deus who was rejected in favor of Fei, hence his hatred of the latter, attacks one more time and is finally defeated. He is later rescued during an attack and convinced to let go of his anger and aid the group.

Fei sets out to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy released from the Wave Existence&#x27;s shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move it away from the planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian&#x27;s ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpentine incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus, destroying Miang for good. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei&#x27;s offer to return and ascends to a higher plane of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite with the rest of the party.

==Development==
&quot;Xenogears&quot; was produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, who previously worked on the SNES game &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;. The scenario of the game was written by director Tetsuya Takahashi and by Kaori Tanaka. Yasuyuki Honne served as art director, while Kunihiko Tanaka was responsible for the character designs. Tetsuo Mizuno, Tomoyuki Takechi, and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi were executive producers for &quot;Xenogears&quot;. Koichi Mashimo, an animation director and his studio Bee Train, was in charge of the anime cut scenes. The CGI sequences were created by Shirogumi. &quot;Xenogears&quot; started out as an early concept conceived by Takahashi and Tanaka for the Square game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Their superior in the company deemed it &quot;too dark and complicated for a fantasy&quot;, but Takahashi was allowed to develop it as a separate project. The project began under the working title &quot;Project Noah&quot;. The main impetus for Takahashi was that he was growing frustrated with the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. The initial concept was to make &quot;Xenogears&quot; a sequel to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, but after multiple clashes with the company over this and unspecified practical difficulties, it was decided to make it a completely original title. Due to this initial development idea, there were concepts unsuited for a fantasy world, so a compromise was made by incorporating both fantasy and science fiction into the game&#x27;s world.

Development took approximately two years, and included a staff of thirty developers. Preliminary planning and creation of the backstory extended to several years before that. The word &quot;Xeno&quot; had been decided between staff from an early stage, with its meaning being &quot;something strange or alien&quot;. &quot;Gears&quot; was chosen from multiple suggested words. The game&#x27;s Gears were not present during early stages, with their places being filled by traditional summoned monsters. The game&#x27;s use of anime cutscenes was chosen as it was difficult to properly recreate Tanaka&#x27;s Gear artwork into 3D CGI. The game&#x27;s engine was also designed to be best suited for the 3D map displays and battle arenas. Takahashi had wanted to create the game in full 3D, but the PlayStation&#x27;s capacities meant this could not be managed, resulting in the current mesh of 2D sprites against 3D backgrounds. The themes and story were greatly influenced by the works and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, as well as dystopian science fiction films such as &quot;THX 1138&quot; and &quot;Soylent Green&quot;. According to Tanaka, the reason for this correlation was simply due to a common interest with her husband. According to her, the story revolved around &quot;where do we come from, what are we, where are we going&quot;. There was a large portion of story and artwork that did not make it into the final game. The game&#x27;s second disc consisted mainly of narration by Fei and Elly of events following the party&#x27;s escape from Solaris. While it was popularly assumed to be due to budget constraints, Takahashi later revealed the full reason; as his team was inexperienced they were unable to create the entire proposed game in the expected two-year development time, so instead of ending prematurely with the end of the first disc, Takahashi offered up a compromise which became the second disc&#x27;s content, allowing the staff to finish the game within time and budget deadlines.

Square had announced that &quot;Xenogears&quot; may not have come out in the United States due to &quot;sensitive religious issues&quot;. The English translation of &quot;Xenogears&quot; was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge. In a later interview, Honeywood stated that the biggest issue was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of &quot;killing God&quot;, which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood may also have had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus: the staff were originally going to call it Yahweh, and during his argument against it he said &quot;It&#x27;s dangerous&quot; (ヤベーよ, &quot;yabē yo&quot;). The Japanese staff found the similarity between Yahweh and &quot;yabē&quot; amusing, and, according to Honeywood, decided to call the boss Yabeh in Japanese.

Square Enix released &quot;Xenogears&quot; on the Japanese PlayStation Network on June 25, 2008, and in North America on February 22, 2011.

===Music===
The music in &quot;Xenogears&quot; was composed and produced by Yasunori Mitsuda. The &quot;Xenogears Original Soundtrack&quot; was released on two discs and published by DigiCube in Japan in 1998. The score contains 41 instrumental tracks, in addition to a choral track and two songs. According to Mitsuda, the music of &quot;Xenogears&quot; belongs to the traditional music genre. Though he first described it as stemming from &quot;a world of [his] own imagining&quot; rather than any specific country, he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence. There are two vocal tracks included on the OST, and both are sung by Joanne Hogg. One of the tracks, &quot;Stars of Tears&quot;, did not appear in the final version of the game. It was originally intended to play in a cut scene at the start of the game along with the main staff credits. The scene, however, was removed for pacing issues, as it would have made the combined opening movie and introduction scenes last roughly ten minutes. The other, &quot;Small Two of Pieces ~Screeching Shards~&quot;, was the first ending theme with lyrics to ever appear in a game developed by Square.

An arranged soundtrack of &quot;Xenogears&quot; composed and arranged by Mitsuda was released as &quot;Creid&quot;. For &quot;Creid&quot;, he expanded on the theme from the original album of having Celtic influences in &quot;easy-to-listen-to&quot; pop tracks to create an album of arranged &quot;Xenogears&quot; music with a more prominent Celtic style. The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks, and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces. The album features five vocal tracks and five instrumental tracks. The main lyricist, Junko Kudo, wrote the lyrics to four of the five vocal tracks, while Mitsuda wrote the lyrics to the title track, which were then translated from Japanese to Gaelic for the recording. Celtic singer Joanne Hogg did not reprise her role in &quot;Creid&quot;. Instead, Tetsuko Honma sang the four tracks written by Kudo, while Eimear Quinn sang &quot;Creid&quot;. &quot;&quot;, an album of music from the game arranged orchestrally by Mitsuda&#x27;s own music company Procyon Studio, was released on CD and vinyl in February 2011.

A Blu-ray album entitled &quot;Xenogears Original Soundtrack Revival Disc - the first and the last -&quot; was released in Japan on April 4, 2018. The album is a remaster of the original soundtrack, plus outtakes and other content. A 20th anniversary concert was held in Tokyo, Japan on April 7 and 8, 2018.

===Merchandise===
There have been several Japanese books and comics published concerning the &quot;Xenogears&quot; franchise. &quot;Xenogears God Slaying Story&quot;, a series by Masatoshi Kusakabe, was published by Shueisha in 1998. DigiCube published both &quot;Xenogears Perfect Works&quot; and a memorial album named &quot;Thousands of Daggers&quot;, which contains the entire script to the game in Japanese, along with screenshots. Two manga books, &quot;Xenogears Comic Anthology&quot; and &quot;Xenogears 4koma Comic&quot;, were released by Movic. Movic released wallscrolls, notebooks, pins, keychains, stickers, and postcards depicting the &quot;Xenogears&quot; cast.

==Reception==
&quot;Xenogears&quot; was a commercial success in both Japan and North America. It received a &quot;Gold Prize&quot; from Sony in May 1998, indicating sales above 500,000 units in Japan, and proceeded to sell over 890,000 copies domestically by the end of the year. As of March 31, 2003, the game had shipped 1.19 million copies worldwide, with 910,000 of those copies being shipped in Japan and 280,000 abroad. As a result of these sales, it was re-released as a Greatest Hits title in December 2003. In Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;, &quot;Xenogears&quot; was voted the 16th best video game of all time by its readers in a poll held in 2006. On a similar poll at GameFAQs, users of the website voted &quot;Xenogears&quot; the 32nd &quot;Best Game Ever&quot; in 2005. It was placed in the same position in IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Games - Readers Choice&quot; feature in 2006, and as number 28 in 2008.

===Critical response===
&quot;Xenogears&quot; was met with critical acclaim. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the story, characters, gameplay, graphics, and soundtrack. IGN described it as the &quot;hands-down best RPG&quot; of the year, praising the storyline, gameplay, graphics, presentation, and soundtrack. GameSpot described it as one of Squaresoft&#x27;s best role-playing games, praising the story, gameplay, and audio, but criticized the lack of graphical polish. Allgame pointed out in a positive light that the character battles are &quot;unlike most role-playing games from this company&quot;.

The game&#x27;s story and characters were well received. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said it is &quot;rich in story and character development.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; and &quot;Next Generation&quot; agreed that the plot was one of the game&#x27;s highlights, the former drawing comparisons to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Star Blazers&quot;, the Old Testament, and many other Square games, making it &quot;a game every RPG fanatic must play.&quot; IGN said the storyline is intricate, engrossing, &quot;deep, complex, and once in a while even confusing, until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered.&quot; GameSpot said the story is &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;thought-provoking&quot; but said it can be &quot;a little preachy at times&quot;, but went on to say that the religious and existential themes &quot;enhance the story and [our] understanding of the game&#x27;s deep characterizations&quot;. Game Revolution described the storyline as &quot;epic&quot; and &quot;fabulous&quot; with &quot;many twists and turns&quot; and a large cast of characters. RPGFan said &quot;the story is unique and probably the most complex and interesting of any RPG&quot;, giving it a 99% rating for the story. Retrospectively, &quot;Edge&quot; praised the plot&#x27;s scope and ambition and the protagonist as the &quot;most complicated Freudian hero&quot; in video games, but said it has a &quot;flawed&quot; script and &quot;muddied&quot; translation, as well as too many cut scenes, especially on the second disc, where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the number of cut scenes increases. Years after the game&#x27;s release, Jeremy Parish of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called the game&#x27;s plot &quot;one of the wackiest game plotlines ever&quot;, but said that it &quot;actually makes sense&quot; if the player ignores all of the sideplots. IGN, however, stated that despite having too many cut scenes and a sometimes confusing plot, &quot;immersion is a key factor in &quot;Xenogears&quot; and the questions you may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game.&quot; Following the PSN release, RPGFan&#x27;s James Quentin Clark said &quot;Xenogears&quot; has &quot;hands down the best single story I have seen in any video game,&quot; giving it a 100% rating for the story.

Reviewers largely praised &quot;Xenogears&quot;&#x27; gameplay. &quot;Next Generation&quot; praised Square&#x27;s Active Time Battle gauge and said that inclusion of the AP meter and combo attacks &quot;is not only refreshing in a turn-based RPG, but gives players a higher level of interaction during battle.&quot; IGN claimed that &quot;the most impressive feature in combat is the ability to use massive &quot;Gears&quot; or mechs&quot;, noting that Square&#x27;s attention to programming these battles is made evident by how &quot;visually satisfying&quot; they are. IGN praised the game&#x27;s exploration, saying that the ability to jump and climb &quot;adds even more depth to exploration of different environments and distances Xenogears from being too straightforward of a traditional RPG&quot;, the only complaint being that the rotating camera is sometimes &quot;clumsy&quot;.

The soundtrack was well received. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said the game sounds as &quot;beautiful&quot; as it looks. GameSpot said it &quot;expertly uses audio to push the story along&quot; and noted that many of the games&#x27; tracks &quot;include voice or chanting and all are appropriately uppity or low with the game&#x27;s mood&quot;, but said there were many areas with silence or ambience making the &quot;game&#x27;s soundtrack a tad sparse.&quot; &quot;Xenogears&quot; was the first Square game to feature voice overs and anime cut scenes. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said they are &quot;some of the slickest animation cinemas&quot; they have seen. Game Revolution praised the &quot;absolutely spectacular and stunning&quot; hand-drawn anime cut-scenes, but stated that they were sparse and poorly synched with the voice acting.

Retrospectively, &quot;Edge&quot; commented that although it is &quot;considered by some to be a multimillion-yen, convoluted science-fiction vanity project, &quot;Xenogears&quot; nevertheless remains one of the most keenly eulogized PlayStation RPGs.&quot; The magazine also noted that it was Takahashi&#x27;s &quot;most challenging and pure work&quot; and that the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series never quite matched up to &quot;Xenogears&quot;.

===Legacy===
Shortly after &quot;Xenogears&quot; was released, there was speculation of a sequel being released, although this never occurred. In 1999, Tanaka said that a project related to &quot;Xenogears&quot; was being developed. He also revealed that a sequel to &quot;Xenogears&quot; was initially planned, but never came to be. In June 2000, Sugiura Hirohide, president of Monolith Soft, said that a sequel was being considered before being cancelled due to the company&#x27;s film investments at the time with &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;.

While &quot;Xenogears&quot; has never had an official sequel or prequel, there was speculation that Namco and Monolith Soft&#x27;s &quot;Xenosaga&quot; was a prequel when it was first announced. Tetsuya Takahashi was the director and writer for both &quot;Xenogears&quot; and &quot;Xenosaga&quot; and noted that &quot;with our relation between Square, I think it is difficult for us to say it is a direct sequel or prequel&quot;. Approximately twenty members of the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; development staff had previously worked on &quot;Xenogears&quot;.

On the connection between &quot;Xenogears&quot; and &quot;Xenosaga&quot;, Takahashi has stated:It&#x27;s probably more suitable to say that it follows the direction and style of &quot;Xenogears&quot;. [...] Now that we are under a different company, we figured we should start everything from scratch all over again. Though there are familiar faces that serve as important characters in &quot;Xenosaga&quot;, others are more like self-parodies, so we don&#x27;t really want &quot;Xenogears&quot; fans to overreact. Like movies, sometimes you have the director of the movie or friend of the leading actor appearing as cameos, so it&#x27;s similar to that.

&quot;Xenogears&quot; has occasionally been featured in other Square Enix properties. On 21 October 2016, it was revealed that Xenogears would be featured in &quot;World of Final Fantasy&quot; as a mirage. In 2017, gears from the game, along with avatars of Fei and Bart, were included as pre-order cosmetic bonuses in Square Enix&#x27;s mecha shooting game, &quot;Figureheads&quot;. On 11 February 2018, in celebration of &quot;Xenogears&quot;″ 20th anniversary, Kunihiko Tanaka and Junya Ishigaki collaborated with Square Enix to release Xenogears Bring Arts figures of Fei, Elly and Welltall. The cast of &quot;Xenogears&quot; were also featured in &quot;Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&quot; for a limited time as part of a collaboration event.

Despite the game&#x27;s popularity, it has never been released in Europe. In 2011, the PlayStation Store Content Manager at the time (responding to a query about the possibility of &quot;Xenogears&quot; on the European PlayStation Network Store) explained that the lack of a PAL disc release created &quot;a series of problems&quot; that needed to be addressed, and that they didn&#x27;t know if such problems could be resolved.

<text>Kislev or Chislev (Hebrew: , &quot;Kīslev&quot; &quot;Kīslēw&quot;), is the third month of the civil year and the ninth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. In the Babylonian calendar its name was &quot;Kislimu&quot;.

In a regular (&quot;kesidran&quot;) year Kislev has 30 days, but because of the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, in some years it can lose a day to make the year a &quot;short&quot; (&quot;chaser&quot;) year. Kislev is a month which occurs in November–December on the Gregorian calendar and is sometimes known as the month of dreams.

In Jewish Rabbinic literature, the month of Kislev is believed to correspond to the Tribe of Benjamin.

<text>XFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System. It was originally written for Unix-like operating systems on IBM PC compatibles and was available for many other operating systems and platforms. It is free and open source software under the XFree86 License version 1.1. It was developed by the XFree86 Project, Inc. The lead developer was David Dawes. The last released version was 4.8.0, released December 2008. The last XFree86 CVS commit was made on May 18, 2009; the project was confirmed dormant in December 2011.

For most of the 1990s and early 2000s, the project was the source of most innovation in X and was the &quot;de facto&quot; steward of X development. Until early 2004, it was almost universal on Linux and the BSDs.

In February 2004, with version 4.4.0, The XFree86 Project began distributing new code with a copyright license that the Free Software Foundation considered GPL incompatible. Most open source operating systems using XFree86 found this unacceptable and moved to a fork from before the license change. The first fork was the abortive Xouvert, but X.Org Server soon became dominant. Most XFree86 developers also moved to X.Org.

== Usage ==

While XFree86 was widely used by most Unix-like computer operating systems before its license change with version 4.4.0, it has since then been superseded by X.org and is used rarely nowadays. The last remaining operating system distribution to use it was NetBSD, which shipped some platforms with 4.5.0 by default until removing it as obsolete in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;n/cvsweb&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m/2015/07/23&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and later releases use X.org by default on various ports (including i386 and amd64), and X.org is available through NetBSD pkgsrc for architectures for which XFree86 remains the default because of better support.

, the codice_1 branch and release were the last to potentially contain XFree86, and XFree86 was completely removed before codice_2 branch and release in 2018.

== Architecture ==
The XFree86 server communicates with the host operating system&#x27;s kernel to drive input and output devices, with the exception of graphics cards. These are generally managed directly by XFree86, so it includes its own drivers for all graphic cards a user might have. Some cards are supported by vendors themselves via binary-only drivers.

Since version 4.0, XFree86 has supported certain accelerated 3D graphics cards via the GLX and DRI extensions. Version 4.0 also moved to a new driver model, from one X server binary per driver to a unique X server capable of loading several drivers at a time.

Because the server usually needs low level access to graphics hardware, on many configurations it needs to run as the superuser, or a user with UID 0. However, on some systems and configurations it is possible to run the server as a normal user.

It is also possible to use XFree86 in a framebuffer device, which in turn uses a kernel graphics card driver.

On a typical POSIX-system, the directory /etc/X11 includes the configuration files. The basic configuration file is /etc/X11/XF86Config (or XF86Config-4) that includes variables about the screen (monitor), keyboard and graphics card. The program &quot;xf86config&quot; is often used, although &quot;xf86cfg&quot; also comes with the XFree86 server and is friendlier. Many Linux distributions used to include a configuration tool that was easier to use (such as Debian&#x27;s debconf) or autodetected most (if not all) settings (such as Red Hat Linux and Fedora&#x27;s &quot;Anaconda&quot;, SuSE&#x27;s &quot;YaST&quot; and Mandrake Linux).

== History==

=== Early history and naming ===

The project began in 1992 when David Wexelblat, Glenn Lai, David Dawes and Jim Tsillas joined forces addressing bugs in the source code of the X386 X display server (written by Thomas Roell), as contributed to X11R5. This version was initially called X386 1.2E. As newer versions of the (originally freeware) X386 were being sold under a proprietary software license by SGCS (of which Roell was a partner), confusion existed between the projects. After discussion, the project was renamed X&quot;Free&quot;86, as a pun (compare X-three-eighty-six to X-free-eighty-six). Roell has continued to sell proprietary X servers, most recently under the name &quot;Accelerated-X&quot;.

=== Rise with Linux ===

As Linux grew in popularity, XFree86 rose with it, as the main X project with drivers for PC video cards.

By the late 1990s, official X development was moribund. Most technical advancement was happening in the XFree86 project. In 1999, XFree86 was sponsored onto X.Org (the official industry consortium) by various hardware companies interested in its use with Linux and its status as the most popular version of X.

=== 2002: Growing dissent within the project ===

By 2002, while Linux&#x27;s popularity, and hence the installed base of X, surged, X.Org was all but inactive; active development was largely carried out by XFree86. However, there was considerable dissent within XFree86.

XFree86 used to have a &quot;Core Team&quot; which was made up of experienced developers, selected by other Core Team members for their merits. Only the members of this Core Team were allowed to commit to CVS. This was perceived as far too cathedral-like in its development model: developers were unable to get commit rights quickly and vendors ended up maintaining extensive patches.

A key event was Keith Packard losing his commit rights. Hours before the feature freeze window for XFree86 4.3.0 started, he committed the XFIXES extension (which he developed himself), without prior discussion or without review within the Core Team. The Core Team decided to remove Keith&#x27;s commit access, but without removing him from the Core Team itself, and the XFIXES extension was backed out six weeks later.

=== 2003: The fork and the disbanding of the Core Team ===

In March 2003, the Core Team claimed that Packard had been trying to fork the XFree86 project by working inside the project while trying to attract core developers to a new X Server project of his own making. Packard denied this had been his aim, but some emails were provided as evidence otherwise. Keith Packard was subsequently expelled from the Core Team.

A short time later, Packard created xwin.org, which mainly served as a meeting point for cultivating the XFree86 fork. The rest of the year, many of the developers that were still active at XFree86 went over to the project that was being set up at the freedesktop.org and X.org domains.

By the end of the year, due to dwindling active membership and limited remaining development capacity, the XFree86 Core Team voted to disband itself.

=== 2004: Licensing controversy ===

Versions of XFree86 up to and including some release candidates for 4.4.0 were under the MIT License, a permissive, non-copyleft free software license. In February 2004, XFree86 4.4 was released with a change to the XFree86 license, by adding a credit clause, similar to that in the original BSD license, but broader in scope. The newer terms are referred to as the XFree86 License 1.1.
Many projects relying on XFree86 found the new license unacceptable, and the Free Software Foundation considers it incompatible with the version 2 of the GNU General Public License, though compatible with version 3. The XFree86 Project states that the license is &quot;as GPL compatible as any and all previous versions were&quot;, but does not mention which version or versions of the GPL this is valid for.

Some projects made releases (notably OpenBSD 3.5 and 3.6, and Debian 3.1 &quot;Sarge&quot;) based on XFree86 version 4.4 RC2, the last version under the old license. Most operating systems incorporating XFree86 (including later versions of OpenBSD and Debian) migrated to the X.Org Server.

The last code commit was in 2009; the project was confirmed dormant in 2011 and the website was last updated in 2014, commemorating the then-22nd anniversary.

== Forks of XFree86 ==

=== Xwin ===

Shortly after he was expelled from the XFree86 Core Team, Keith Packard started setting up xwin.org. While this was claimed to be the fork of XFree86, Keith Packard later refined this to &quot;a forum for community participation in X&quot;. XWin saw a lot of activity in the first two months after the announcements, but most of the activity was happening behind the scenes, and Keith moved his own development to freedesktop.org.

=== Xouvert ===

Xouvert was later also hailed as the first XFree86 fork in August 2003. Even though releases were announced for October 2003 and April 2004, no releases were made. The last status change was made in March 2004 and it was communicated that there were delays in setting up a revision control system.

=== X.Org ===

The X.Org Server became the official reference implementation of X11. The first version, X11R6.7.0, was forked from XFree86 version 4.4 RC2 to avoid the XFree86 license changes, with X11R6.6 changes merged in. Version X11R6.8 added many new extensions, drivers and fixes. It is hosted by and works closely with corporate-sponsored freedesktop.org.

Most of the open-source Unix-like operating systems have adopted the X.Org Server in place of XFree86, and most of the XFree86 developers have moved to X.Org.

<doc id="34191" wikidata="Q1570087" url="?curid=34191" title="X (American band)">
<text>X is an American punk rock band formed in Los Angeles. The original members are vocalist Exene Cervenka, vocalist-bassist John Doe, guitarist Billy Zoom and drummer D. J. Bonebrake. The band released seven studio albums from 1980 to 1993. After a period of inactivity during the mid-to-late 1990s, X reunited in the early 2000s and continued to tour. In June 2024, X announced a final album and farewell tour.

X achieved limited mainstream success but influenced various genres of music, including punk rock, Americana, and folk rock. In 1991, Music critic Robert Hilburn identified them as one of the most influential bands of their era. In 2003, X&#x27;s first two studio albums, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;Wild Gift&quot;, were ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as being among the 500 greatest albums of all time. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was ranked 91st on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Top 100 Albums of the 1980s.

==History==
===1977–1979: Formation and Dangerhouse era===
X was founded by bassist-singer Doe and guitarist Zoom. Doe brought his poetry-writing girlfriend Cervenka to band practices, and she eventually joined the band as a vocalist. Drummer Bonebrake was the last of the original members to join after leaving local group The Eyes; he also filled in on drums for Germs.

X&#x27;s first record deal was with independent label Dangerhouse, for which the band produced one single, &quot;Adult Books&quot;/&quot;We&#x27;re Desperate&quot; (1978). A Dangerhouse session version of &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was also featured on a 1979 Dangerhouse 12-inch EP compilation called &quot;Yes L.A.&quot; (a play on the no-wave compilation &quot;No New York&quot;), a six-song picture disc that also featured other early L.A. punk bands The Eyes, The Germs, The Bags, The Alley Cats, and Black Randy and the Metrosquad.

===1980–1981: &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;Wild Gift&quot;===

As the band became the flag bearer for the local scene, a larger independent label, Slash Records, signed them. The result was their debut, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (1980) which was produced by the Doors&#x27; keyboard player, Ray Manzarek. It sold well by the standards of independent labels. Much of X&#x27;s early material had a rockabilly edge. Doe and Cervenka co-wrote most of the group&#x27;s songs and their slightly off-kilter harmony vocals served as the group&#x27;s most distinctive element. Their lyrics tended to be straight-out poetry; comparisons to Charles Bukowski and Raymond Chandler were made from the start.

Their follow-up effort, &quot;Wild Gift&quot; (1981), was similar in musical style. It featured shorter, faster songs and is arguably their most stereotypically punk-sounding record.

During 1981, both Doe and Bonebrake (along with Dave Alvin, guitarist of The Blasters) served as members of The Flesh Eaters, performing on that band&#x27;s second album, &quot;A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die&quot;.

===1982–1984: Elektra era and The Knitters===

X signed with major label Elektra in 1982 and released &quot;Under the Big Black Sun&quot;, which marked a departure from their trademark sound. While still fast and loud, with raw punk guitars, the album displayed evolving country leanings. The album was influenced by the death of Cervenka&#x27;s elder sister Mirielle in a 1980 car accident. Three songs on the album (&quot;Riding with Mary&quot;, &quot;Come Back to Me&quot; and the title track) all directly relate to the tragedy. A fourth, a high-speed version of Al Dubin and Joe Burke&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with Tears in My Eyes&quot;, was, years later, indirectly attributed to Cervenka&#x27;s mournful state of mind. The stark black-and-white cover art and title were also a reflection of the somber mood of the band during this time. Cervenka has said it is her favorite X album.

In 1983, the band slightly redefined their sound with the release of the album &quot;More Fun in the New World&quot;, making X somewhat more polished, eclectic and radio-ready than on previous albums. With the sound moving away from punk rock, the band&#x27;s rockabilly influence became even more noticeable, along with some new elements: funk on the track &quot;True Love Pt. II&quot;, and Woody Guthrie-influenced folk protest songs like &quot;The New World&quot; and &quot;I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts&quot;. The record received critical praise from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;, which had long been stalwart supporters of X and their sound.

The Knitters, a side project, were composed of X minus Zoom, plus Alvin on guitar and Johnny Ray Bartel (of the Red Devils) on double bass, and released the &quot;Poor Little Critter on the Road&quot; album in 1985. The Knitters were devoted to folk and country music; music critic Denise Sullivan said their take on Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;Silver Wings&quot; &quot;may be the definitive version&quot;.

The band&#x27;s music was featured in three movie soundtracks during this period. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and &quot;Beyond and Back&quot; were used in Wim Wenders&#x27;s &quot;State of Things&quot; (1982). &quot;Breathless&quot; was used in the Richard Gere remake of Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; (1983). &quot;Wild Thing&quot; was used in the Charlie Sheen comedy &quot;Major League&quot; (1989). (Source; IMDB)

===1985–1987: Commercial era and departure of Zoom===
Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical reception for their first four albums, the band was frustrated by its lack of wider mainstream success. Zoom had also said that he would leave the band unless its next album was more successful. The band decided to change producers in search of a more accessible sound. Their fifth record, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love Grand!&quot;, was produced by pop metal producer Michael Wagener. It featured a drastic change in sound, especially in the polished and layered production, while the band&#x27;s punk roots were little in evidence, replaced by a countrified version of hard rock. The change in production was intended to bring the band more chart success, but although it received more mainstream radio play than their earlier releases, it did not represent a commercial breakthrough. &quot;Burning House of Love&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, was a minor hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Rock Tracks chart, where it peaked at #26 in September 1985. Zoom left the group shortly thereafter in 1986, the same year in which the feature-length documentary film, &quot;X: The Unheard Music&quot;, was released.

Zoom was initially replaced by Alvin, who had left the Blasters. The band then added a fifth member, guitarist Tony Gilkyson, formerly of the band Lone Justice. By the time the band released its sixth album, &quot;See How We Are&quot;, Alvin had already left the band, although he played on the record along with Gilkyson and wrote &quot;4th of July&quot; for the band. Like &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love Grand&quot;, the album&#x27;s sound was far removed from the band&#x27;s punk origins, yet featured a punchy, energetic, hard-rocking roots rock sound that in many ways represented a more natural progression from their earlier sound than the previous album had. After touring for the album, X released a live album of the tour, titled &quot;Live at the Whisky a Go-Go&quot;, and then went on an extended hiatus.

Back in 1984, X had released a cover version of &quot;Wild Thing&quot; as a non-album single. In 1989, the song was re-released as the lead single from the soundtrack to the hit film &quot;Major League&quot;. It later became a staple at sporting events, particularly baseball games, and was used by Japanese professional wrestler Atsushi Onita after he founded Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling in 1989. The song is now used as Jon Moxley&#x27;s entrance music in All Elite Wrestling.

===1993–1995: First reunion, &quot;Hey Zeus!&quot; and &quot;Unclogged&quot;===
X regrouped in the early 1990s to record their seventh studio album, &quot;Hey Zeus!&quot;, released in 1993 on the Big Life label. The album marked somewhat of a retreat from the increasingly roots rock direction that the band&#x27;s past few records had gone in, instead featuring an eclectic alternative rock sound that fit in well with the then-current musical climate. Despite this, it failed to become a hit, although two of its songs, &quot;Country at War&quot; and &quot;New Life,&quot; peaked at numbers 15 and 26 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts, respectively.

In 1994, they contributed a cover of the Richard Thompson song &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot; to a Thompson tribute album called &quot;Beat the Retreat&quot;, which featured David Hidalgo of Los Lobos on electric guitar. On the same album, Doe sang harmony and played bass and Bonebrake played drums on Bob Mould&#x27;s cover of &quot;Turning of the Tide,&quot; and Bonebrake played drums on the title track, which was performed by the British folk artist June Tabor.

The band released an acoustic live album, &quot;Unclogged&quot;, in 1995 on Infidelity Records.

===1997–2004: Hiatus and second reunion===

In 1997, X released a compilation called &quot;Beyond and Back: The X Anthology&quot;, which focused heavily on the early years with Zoom and included a number of previously unreleased versions of songs that had appeared on their previous albums. At the same time, they also announced that they were disbanding. However, they did a farewell tour to promote the compilation in 1998, with Zoom returning on guitar. The original lineup also returned to the studio for the final time, with Manzarek reprising his role as producer, to record a cover of the Doors&#x27; &quot;The Crystal Ship&quot; for the soundtrack for &quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future&quot;.

&quot;X: The Unheard Music&quot; was released on DVD in 2005, as was the concert DVD &quot;X – Live in Los Angeles&quot;, which commemorated the 25th anniversary of the band&#x27;s landmark debut album, &quot;Los Angeles.&quot;

===2005–2007: Reunion of The Knitters===

In 2005, Doe, Cervenka and Bonebrake reunited with Alvin and Bartel to release a second Knitters album, 20 years after the first, titled &quot;The Modern Sounds of the Knitters&quot;. In summer 2006, X toured North America on the &quot;As the World Burns&quot; tour with the Rollins Band and the Riverboat Gamblers. In the spring of 2008, the band, with all original members, embarked on their &quot;13X31&quot; tour with Skybombers and the Detroit Cobras. &quot;13X31&quot; was a reference to their 31st anniversary.

===2008–present: Touring and first album in 27 years===
From 2004 onward, X have continued to perform frequently around North America.

X appeared at the 2008 SXSW Festival (with footage of their performance made viewable on Crackle); the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 19, 2009; and the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Minehead, England from May 15–17, 2009. They were invited to perform at the latter by the festival&#x27;s curators, the Breeders.

In June 2009, the band publicly announced that Cervenka had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. However, she told the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; in 2011 that the doctor who originally diagnosed the disease believes he misdiagnosed her. Cervenka stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve had so many doctors tell me I have MS, then some say I don&#x27;t ... I don&#x27;t even care anymore&quot;.

In June 2010, X played a free show at the North by Northeast festival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and headlined the third annual Roadshow Revival, a Johnny Cash tribute festival in Ventura, California. X performed at The Voodoo Experience 2011, held at City Park in New Orleans, Louisiana, on October 28–30, 2011. The band also opened for Pearl Jam on their 2011 South and Central American tour in November and their European tour in June and July 2012.
On September 2, 2012, X performed at the Budweiser Made in America Festival in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In July 2015, Zoom took a performing break to undergo treatment for bladder cancer, returning in November 2015.

On March 4, 2016, X appeared on the episode &quot;Show Me a Hero&quot; of Adult Swim show &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot;. On October 13, 2017, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened a new exhibit titled &quot;X: 40 Years of Punk in Los Angeles&quot;, to run through February 25, 2018.

In 2017, Cervenka announced that X had added Craig Packham of The Palominos to fill in on drums and rhythm guitar, because Bonebrake and Zoom were now playing vibes and saxophone, respectively.

In 2018, the band released &quot;X – Live in Latin America&quot; via a Kickstarter campaign, to coincide with their 40th anniversary. The album was recorded during a 2011 tour where X was the opening band for Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam&#x27;s sound engineer made the recordings, and presented them to X at the end of the tour. The album was produced by Rob Schnapf, and featured the four original members of X.

In early 2019 Fat Possum Records released two new X songs as a single, followed by the &quot;genuinely good&quot; (per BrooklynVegan) new album &quot;Alphabetland&quot; on April 22, 2020. On February 9, 2021, Fat Possum released &quot;Xtras&quot;: two more tracks from the same recording sessions, one being an alternate version. Robby Krieger, of the Doors, played slide guitar on one track each of &quot;Alphabetland&quot; and of &quot;Xtras&quot;.

In June 2024, John Doe announced on Facebook that a new X album &quot;Smoke &amp; Fiction&quot; would be released on August 2, 2024, by Fat Possum Records. A subsequent announcement stated that this would be X&#x27;s final album. The album reflects on the band&#x27;s early history and the broader world events of those years. The release will be accompanied by an extensive US farewell tour starting July 6, 2024.

<text>Xenarthra (; from Ancient Greek , xénos, &quot;foreign, alien&quot; + , árthron, &quot;joint&quot;) is a major clade of placental mammals native to the Americas. There are 31 living species: the anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos. Extinct xenarthrans include the glyptodonts, pampatheres and ground sloths. Xenarthrans originated in South America during the late Paleocene about 60 million years ago. They evolved and diversified extensively in South America during the continent&#x27;s long period of isolation in the early to mid Cenozoic Era. They spread to the Antilles by the early Miocene and, starting about 3 million years ago, spread to Central and North America as part of the Great American Interchange. Nearly all of the formerly abundant megafaunal xenarthrans became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene.

==Characteristics==
Xenarthrans share several characteristics that are not present in other placental mammals, which suggest that xenarthrans descend from subterranean diggers. The name Xenarthra derives from the two ancient Greek words (), meaning &quot;strange, unusual&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;joint&quot;, and refers to their vertebral joints, which have extra articulations that are unlike other mammals. The ischium of the pelvis is also fused to the sacrum of the spine. Xenarthran limb bones are typically robust, with large processes for muscle attachment. Relative to their body size, living xenarthrans are extremely strong. Their limb bone structures are unusual. They have single-color vision. The teeth of xenarthrans are unique. Xenarthrans are also often considered to be among the most primitive of placental mammals. Females show no clear distinction between the uterus and vagina, and males have testicles inside the body, which are located between the bladder and the rectum. Xenarthrans have the lowest metabolic rates among therians.

Xenarthran forms and lifestyles include:
* Armadillos: Mostly small and some larger omnivores and insectivores with flexible banded body armor
* Glyptodonts: Large herbivores with a rigid semi-spherical carapace
* Pampatheres: Large herbivores (and possibly omnivores) with banded body armor
* Anteaters: Small to large specialized feeders on social insects 
* Tree sloths: Medium-sized folivores specialized for life hanging upside-down in trees
* Ground sloths: Medium to very large ground-living herbivores (and possibly omnivores)
* Aquatic sloths: &quot;Thalassocnus&quot;, a medium-sized herbivore, is the only known aquatic sloth

==Evolutionary relationships==
Xenarthrans were previously classified alongside the pangolins and aardvarks in the order Edentata (meaning toothless, because the members do not have incisors and lack, or have poorly developed, molars). Subsequently, Edentata was found to be a polyphyletic grouping whose New World and Old World taxa are unrelated, and it was split up to reflect their true phylogeny. Aardvarks and pangolins are now placed in individual orders, and the new order Xenarthra was erected to group the remaining families (which are all related). The morphology of xenarthrans generally suggests that the anteaters and sloths are more closely related to each other than either is to the armadillos, glyptodonts, and pampatheres; this idea is upheld by molecular studies. Since its conception, Xenarthra has increasingly come to be considered to be of a higher rank than &#x27;order&#x27;; some authorities consider it to be a cohort, while others consider it to be a superorder.

Whatever the rank, Xenarthra is now generally considered to be divided into two orders:

* Cingulata (Latin, &quot;the ones with belts/armor&quot;), the armadillos and the extinct glyptodonts and pampatheres 
* Pilosa (Latin, &quot;the ones with fur&quot;), which is subdivided into: 
** Vermilingua (&quot;worm-tongues&quot;), the anteaters
** Folivora (&quot;leaf-eaters&quot;), the sloths (both tree sloths and the extinct ground sloths). Folivora is also called Tardigrada or Phyllophaga.

Their relationship to other placental mammals is obscure. Xenarthrans have been defined as most closely related to Afrotheria (in the group Atlantogenata), or to Boreoeutheria (in the group Exafroplacentalia), or to Epitheria (Afrotheria+Boreoeutheria, i.e. as a sister group to all other placental mammals). A comprehensive phylogeny by Goloboff et al. includes xenarthrans as a sister clade of Euarchontoglires within Boreoeutheria (Laurasiatheria+Euarchontoglires). Overall, studies using mitochondrial DNA have tended to group them as a sister clade to Ferungulata (carnivorans+ungulates+pholidotans), while studies using nuclear DNA have identified them as 1) a sister clade to Afrotheria, 2) a sister clade to all placentals &quot;except&quot; Afrotheria, or 3) a trichotomy (three-way split): Afrotheria, Xenarthra, and everything else (i.e. Boreoeutheria). Among studies that use physical characteristics rather than DNA to look at relationships, a large phenomic analysis of living and fossil mammals suggests placental mammals evolved shortly after the end of the Cretaceous, and first split into Xenarthra and Epitheria (all other placentals).

==Characteristics==

Xenarthrans share several characteristics not present in other mammals. Authorities have tended to agree they are a primitive group of placental mammals not very closely related to other orders, without agreeing on how to classify them. George Gaylord Simpson first suggested in 1931 that their combination of unique characteristics shows the group evolved from highly specialized early ancestors that lived underground or were nocturnal and dug with their forelimbs to feed on social insects like ants or termites. Most researchers since then have agreed. These extreme characteristics led to their confusion with unrelated groups that had similar specializations (aardvarks and pangolins), and obscures their relationships with other mammals.

=== Dentition ===
The teeth of xenarthrans differ from all other mammals. The dentition of most species is either significantly reduced and highly modified, or absent. With the single exception of &quot;Dasypus&quot; armadillos and their ancestral genus &quot;Propraopus&quot;, xenarthrans do not have a milk dentition. They have a single set of teeth through their lives; these teeth have no functional enamel, and usually there are few or no teeth in the front of the mouth and the rear teeth all look alike. As a result, it is impossible to define Xenarthra as having incisors, canines, premolars, or molars. Since most mammals are classified by their teeth, it has been difficult to determine their relationships to other mammals. Xenarthrans may have evolved from ancestors that had already lost basic mammalian dental features like tooth enamel and a crown with cusps; reduced, highly simplified teeth are usually found in mammals that feed by licking up social insects. Several groups of xenarthrans did evolve cheek teeth to chew plants, but since they lacked enamel, patterns of harder and softer dentine created grinding surfaces. Dentine is less resistant to wear than the enamel-cusped teeth of other mammals, and xenarthrans developed open-rooted teeth that grow continuously. Currently, no living or extinct xenarthrans have been found to have the standard mammalian dental formula or crown morphology derived from the ancient tribosphenic pattern.

===Spine===
The name Xenarthra, which means &quot;strange joints&quot;, was chosen because the vertebral joints of members of the group have extra articulations of a type unlike any other mammals. This trait is referred to as &quot;xenarthry&quot;. (Tree sloths lost these articulations to increase the flexibility of their spines, but their fossil ancestors had xenarthrous joints.) Additional points of articulation between vertebrae strengthen and stiffen the spine, an adaptation developed in different ways in various groups of mammals that dig for food. Xenarthrans also tend to have different numbers of vertebrae than other mammals; sloths have a reduced number of lumbar vertebrae with either more or fewer cervical vertebrae than most mammals, while cingulates have neck vertebrae fused into a cervical tube, with glyptodonts fusing thoracic and lumbar vertebrae as well.

===Vision===
Xenarthrans have been determined to have single-color vision. PCR analysis determined that a mutation in a stem xenarthran led to long-wavelength sensitive-cone (LWS) monochromacy (single color vision), common in nocturnal, aquatic and subterranean mammals. Further losses led to rod monochromacy in a stem cingulate and a stem pilosan, pointing to a subterranean ancestry; the ancestors of Xenarthra had the reduced eyesight characteristic of vertebrates that live underground. Some authorities state that xenarthrans lack a functional pineal gland; pineal activity is related to the perception of light.

===Metabolism===
Living xenarthrans have the lowest metabolic rates among therians. Paleoburrows have been discovered which are up to wide and long, with claw marks from excavation referred to the ground sloths &quot;Glossotherium&quot; or &quot;Scelidotherium&quot;. Remains of ground sloths (&quot;Mylodon&quot; and others) in caves are particularly common in colder parts of their range, suggesting ground sloths may have used burrows and caves to help regulate their body temperature. Analysis of the fossil South American Lujan fauna suggests far more large herbivorous mammals were present than similar contemporary environments can support. As most large Lujan herbivores were xenarthrans, low metabolic rate may be a feature of the entire clade, allowing relatively low-resource scrublands to support large numbers of huge animals. Faunal analysis also shows far fewer large predators in pre-GABI South American faunas than would be expected based on current faunas in similar environments. This suggests other factors than predation controlled the numbers of xenarthrans. South America had no placental predatory mammals until the Pleistocene, and xenarthran large-mammal faunas may have been vulnerable to many factors including a rise in numbers of mammalian predators, resource use by spreading North American herbivores with faster metabolisms and higher food requirements, and climate change.

<doc id="34195" wikidata="Q8045330" url="?curid=34195" title="XyWrite">
<text>XyWrite is a word processor for MS-DOS and Windows modeled on the mainframe-based ATEX typesetting system. Popular with writers and editors for its speed and degree of customization, XyWrite was in its heyday the house word processor in many editorial offices, including the &quot;New York Times&quot; from 1989 to 1993. XyWrite was developed by David Erickson and marketed by XyQuest from 1982 through 1992, after which it was acquired by The Technology Group. The final version for MS-DOS was 4.18 (1993); for Windows, 4.13.

==Features==
* Its file format consists of plain text (IBM437, or so-called &quot;extended ASCII&quot;) with markup (within guillemets: « »). This capability is useful for typesetters who need to convert to various formats, e.g., LaTeX. A plug-in for ANSI characters is available.
* XyWrite is written in assembly language, allowing it to run faster than word processors written in a higher level language.
* It has a flexible macro-programming language (XPL) that offers many advantages for quick search and replace, copy-editing and reformatting of raw text. Users continue to write and share macros extending XyWrite features (printing to USB devices, for example).
* Plain-text, editable configuration files allow easy customization of the keyboard—for remapping keystrokes and for execution of complex commands with individual keystrokes—as well as customization of what is loaded on launching the program.
* Commands can be typed in directly on a command line, without the use of a mouse. Commands are usually in simple English, such as &quot;Save,&quot; &quot;Print,&quot; and &quot;Search,&quot; or their shorter versions, such as &quot;Sa&quot; for &quot;Save&quot; (commands are case-insensitive).
* Up to nine files can be opened for editing at one time in separate &quot;windows&quot; that allow quick copy-and-paste among several files. Two files may be opened on the same screen for easy comparison of changes; a XyWrite command will do the comparison automatically, putting the cursor on the location at which the two files first differ (from which the user can move to the next difference).
* Version 4 (or &quot;Signature&quot;) has full WYSIWYG graphical editing capabilities including on-screen display of bitmaps and Bitstream Speedo fonts.
* The Microsoft Windows version provided version 4 in a Windows environment, in WYSIWYG, without losing its command line driven interface. It supported the standard Windows&#x27; True Type fonts along with Speedo fonts.

==History and current usage==
XyQuest was founded in June 1982 by former ATEX employees Dave Erickson and John Hild. Its most successful product was XyWrite III Plus, which attracted a devoted following among professional writers.

Announced in September 1989, XyWrite IV promised a lot to users, it entered beta-test after a year in November 1990 hoping to release by year end. By February 1991 it still hadn&#x27;t shipped. The turning point for XyWrite came in the form of a disastrous near-partnership with IBM, which was seeking a modern replacement for its venerable DisplayWrite word processor. Working under an agreement signed in June 1990, XyQuest devoted nearly all of its development resources to revising Erickson&#x27;s XyWrite IV to IBM&#x27;s specifications, including IBM Common User Access-style menus, mouse support and a graphical user interface. Publicized in early 1991, the agreement envisioned as a marriage between XyQuest technology and IBM marketing, the product was to be called Signature, and would ship for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows and IBM OS/2. DisplayWrite would be discontinued at the same time in favor of the new software.

But on the eve of Signature&#x27;s release, IBM announced a strategic decision to withdraw completely from the desktop software market, shocking XyQuest and leaving Signature in limbo. When a prospective new alliance with Lotus did not materialize, XyQuest regained the marketing rights to the software and restickered the ready-to-ship Signature packages pasting over the IBM logo. Following mixed reviews and poor performance, it was later improved and renamed as XyWrite 4.0.

However, the changes IBM had insisted on were a liability where the III Plus user base was concerned. Some key reviews (such as in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;) were harsh, and there were complaints that 4.0 was buggy and slow. Moreover, in the years since the last major XyWrite release, WordPerfect had cemented its hold on the DOS word processor market. Already financially strained by the long development cycle for Signature, by the end of 1992 XyQuest was bleeding money. The sale to &quot;The Technology Group&quot; ensued.

While there were a few maintenance releases of 4.0 after the acquisition, The Technology Group&#x27;s major commitment was to developing XyWrite for Windows. But XyWrite remained a niche product, unable to compete for the business user against Word for Windows, WordPerfect for Windows, and Ami Pro, despite added versatility and customization potential. The Technology Group was dissolved in 2003.

Several versions of XyWrite were also localized for use in European countries. For example, the programs were offered in Germany under the name &quot;euroscript&quot; by North American Software GmbH.

===Nota Bene===
A descendant of XyWrite called Nota Bene is still being actively developed. Nota Bene, which runs on the XyWrite engine, is popular among academics. As of January 2020, Nota Bene for Windows is at version 12. NotaBene is supported on native Windows, Mac and on Linux running WINE.

===Current usage===
In 2015, work started on using XyWrite within the vDos program shell in 32 and 64 bit windows. This was successful in October 2016, resulting in an x86 PC and DOS emulator for Windows based on Jos Schaars&#x27;s vDos. Formerly known as vDos-lfn, vDosPlus allows XyWrite 4, XyWrite III+, and Nota Bene for DOS to run under the latest versions of Microsoft Windows (including 64-bit Windows). VdosPlus.org shows the various functions, and XyWWWeb shows usage.

XyWrite does not have as many features as Word or OpenOffice.org. For example, XyWrite is unaware of Windows ANSI or Unicode character sets and Nota Bene does not support languages (such as Chinese) that require double-byte characters.

==Reception==
&quot;Byte&quot; in 1984 stated &quot;the XyQuest people have done an admirable job porting the editing part of the Atex system&quot; to the IBM PC. While criticizing the documentation, it called XyWrite &quot;extremely fast, powerful, compact, and flexible&quot;.

<doc id="34197" wikidata="Q34777" url="?curid=34197" title="X-ray">
<text>An X-ray (also known in many languages as Röntgen radiation) is a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than those of ultraviolet rays and longer than those of gamma rays. Roughly, X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 10 nanometers to 10 picometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range of 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz ( to ) and photon energies in the range of 100 eV to 100 keV, respectively.

X-rays were discovered in 1895 by the German scientist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, who named it &quot;X-radiation&quot; to signify an unknown type of radiation.

X-rays can penetrate many solid substances such as construction materials and living tissue, so X-ray radiography is widely used in medical diagnostics (e.g., checking for broken bones) and material science (e.g., identification of some chemical elements and detecting weak points in construction materials). However X-rays are ionizing radiation and exposure can be hazardous to health, causing DNA damage, cancer and, at higher intensities, burns and radiation sickness. Their generation and use is strictly controlled by public health authorities.

==History==

=== Pre-Röntgen observations and research ===
X-rays were originally noticed in science as a type of unidentified radiation emanating from discharge tubes by experimenters investigating cathode rays produced by such tubes, which are energetic electron beams that were first observed in 1869. Early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them in many of the early Crookes tubes (invented around 1875). Crookes tubes created free electrons by ionization of the residual air in the tube by a high DC voltage of anywhere between a few kilovolts and 100 kV. This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the cathode to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the anode or the glass wall of the tube.

The earliest experimenter thought to have (unknowingly) produced X-rays was William Morgan. In 1785, he presented a paper to the Royal Society of London describing the effects of passing electrical currents through a partially evacuated glass tube, producing a glow created by X-rays. This work was further explored by Humphry Davy and his assistant Michael Faraday.

Starting in 1888, Philipp Lenard conducted experiments to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air. He built a Crookes tube with a &quot;window&quot; at the end made of thin aluminium, facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it (later called a &quot;Lenard tube&quot;). He found that something came through, that would expose photographic plates and cause fluorescence. He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various materials. It has been suggested that at least some of these &quot;Lenard rays&quot; were actually X-rays.

Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before Röntgen made his discovery and announcement. He based it on the electromagnetic theory of light. However, he did not work with actual X-rays.

In early 1890, photographer William Jennings and associate professor of the University of Pennsylvania Arthur W. Goodspeed were making photographs of coins with electric sparks. On 22 February after the end of their experiments two coins were left on a stack of photographic plates before Goodspeed demonstrated to Jennings the operation of Crookes tubes. While developing the plates, Jennings noticed disks of unknown origin on some of the plates, but nobody could explain them, and they moved on. Only in 1896 they realized that they accidentally made an X-ray photograph (they didn&#x27;t claim a discovery).

Also in 1890, Roentgen&#x27;s assistant Ludwig Zehnder noticed a flash of light from a fluorescent screen immediately before the covered tube he was switching on punctured.

When Stanford University physics professor Fernando Sanford conducted his &quot;electric photography&quot; experiments in 1891–1893 by photographing coins in the light of electric sparks, like Jennings and Goodspeed, he may have unknowingly generated and detected X-rays. His letter of 6 January 1893 to the &quot;Physical Review&quot; was duly published and an article entitled &quot;Without Lens or Light, Photographs Taken With Plate and Object in Darkness&quot; appeared in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;.

In 1894, Nikola Tesla noticed damaged film in his lab that seemed to be associated with Crookes tube experiments and began investigating this invisible, radiant energy. After Röntgen identified the X-ray, Tesla began making X-ray images of his own using high voltages and tubes of his own design, as well as Crookes tubes.

===Discovery by Röntgen===
On 8 November 1895, German physics professor Wilhelm Röntgen stumbled on X-rays while experimenting with Lenard tubes and Crookes tubes and began studying them. He wrote an initial report &quot;On a new kind of ray: A preliminary communication&quot; and on 28 December 1895, submitted it to Würzburg&#x27;s Physical-Medical Society journal. This was the first paper written on X-rays. Röntgen referred to the radiation as &quot;X&quot;, to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. Some early texts refer to them as Chi-rays, having interpreted &quot;X&quot; as the uppercase Greek letter Chi, &quot;Χ&quot;.

There are conflicting accounts of his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, but this is a likely reconstruction by his biographers: Röntgen was investigating cathode rays from a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.

Röntgen discovered their medical use when he made a picture of his wife&#x27;s hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. The photograph of his wife&#x27;s hand was the first photograph of a human body part using X-rays. When she saw the picture, she said &quot;I have seen my death.&quot;

The discovery of X-rays generated significant interest. Röntgen&#x27;s biographer Otto Glasser estimated that, in 1896 alone, as many as 49 essays and 1044 articles about the new rays were published. This was probably a conservative estimate, if one considers that nearly every paper around the world extensively reported about the new discovery, with a magazine such as &quot;Science&quot; dedicating as many as 23 articles to it in that year alone. Sensationalist reactions to the new discovery included publications linking the new kind of rays to occult and paranormal theories, such as telepathy.

The name X-rays stuck, although (over Röntgen&#x27;s great objections) many of his colleagues suggested calling them &quot;Röntgen rays&quot;. They are still referred to as such in many languages, including German, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Danish, Polish, Czech, Bulgarian, Swedish, Finnish, Portuguese, Estonian, Slovak, Slovenian, Turkish, Russian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Albanian, Japanese, Dutch, Georgian, Hebrew, Icelandic, and Norwegian.

Röntgen received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.

===Advances in radiology===

Röntgen immediately noticed X-rays could have medical applications. Along with his 28 December Physical-Medical Society submission, he sent a letter to physicians he knew around Europe (1 January 1896). News (and the creation of &quot;shadowgrams&quot;) spread rapidly with Scottish electrical engineer Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton being the first after Röntgen to create an X-ray photograph (of a hand). Through February, there were 46 experimenters taking up the technique in North America alone.

The first use of X-rays under clinical conditions was by John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England on 11 January 1896, when he radiographed a needle stuck in the hand of an associate. On 14 February 1896, Hall-Edwards was also the first to use X-rays in a surgical operation.

In early 1896, several weeks after Röntgen&#x27;s discovery, Ivan Romanovich Tarkhanov irradiated frogs and insects with X-rays, concluding that the rays &quot;not only photograph, but also affect the living function&quot;. At around the same time, the zoological illustrator James Green began to use X-rays to examine fragile specimens. George Albert Boulenger first mentioned this work in a paper he delivered before the Zoological Society of London in May 1896. The book &quot;Sciagraphs of British Batrachians and Reptiles&quot; (sciagraph is an obsolete name for an X-ray photograph), by Green and James H. Gardiner, with a foreword by Boulenger, was published in 1897.

The first medical X-ray made in the United States was obtained using a discharge tube of Ivan Puluj&#x27;s design. In January 1896, on reading of Röntgen&#x27;s discovery, Frank Austin of Dartmouth College tested all of the discharge tubes in the physics laboratory and found that only the Puluj tube produced X-rays. This was a result of Puluj&#x27;s inclusion of an oblique &quot;target&quot; of mica, used for holding samples of fluorescent material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896, Gilman Frost, professor of medicine at the college, and his brother Edwin Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Gilman had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture, to the X-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on gelatin photographic plates obtained from Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in Röntgen&#x27;s work.

Many experimenters, including Röntgen himself in his original experiments, came up with methods to view X-ray images &quot;live&quot; using some form of luminescent screen. Röntgen used a screen coated with barium platinocyanide. On 5 February 1896, live imaging devices were developed by both Italian scientist Enrico Salvioni (his &quot;cryptoscope&quot;) and William Francis Magie of Princeton University (his &quot;Skiascope&quot;), both using barium platinocyanide. American inventor Thomas Edison started research soon after Röntgen&#x27;s discovery and investigated materials&#x27; ability to fluoresce when exposed to X-rays, finding that calcium tungstate was the most effective substance. In May 1896, he developed the first mass-produced live imaging device, his &quot;Vitascope&quot;, later called the fluoroscope, which became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903, before the death of Clarence Madison Dally, one of his glassblowers. Dally had a habit of testing X-ray tubes on his own hands, developing a cancer in them so tenacious that both arms were amputated in a futile attempt to save his life; in 1904, he became the first known death attributed to X-ray exposure. During the time the fluoroscope was being developed, Serbian American physicist Mihajlo Pupin, using a calcium tungstate screen developed by Edison, found that using a fluorescent screen decreased the exposure time it took to create an X-ray for medical imaging from an hour to a few minutes.

In 1901, U.S. President William McKinley was shot twice in an assassination attempt while attending the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. While one bullet only grazed his sternum, another had lodged somewhere deep inside his abdomen and could not be found. A worried McKinley aide sent word to inventor Thomas Edison to rush an X-ray machine to Buffalo to find the stray bullet. It arrived but was not used. While the shooting itself had not been lethal, gangrene had developed along the path of the bullet, and McKinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection six days later.

===Hazards discovered===
With the widespread experimentation with X‑rays after their discovery in 1895 by scientists, physicians, and inventors came many stories of burns, hair loss, and worse in technical journals of the time. In February 1896, Professor John Daniel and William Lofland Dudley of Vanderbilt University reported hair loss after Dudley was X-rayed. A child who had been shot in the head was brought to the Vanderbilt laboratory in 1896. Before trying to find the bullet, an experiment was attempted, for which Dudley &quot;with his characteristic devotion to science&quot; volunteered. Daniel reported that 21 days after taking a picture of Dudley&#x27;s skull (with an exposure time of one hour), he noticed a bald spot in diameter on the part of his head nearest the X-ray tube: &quot;A plate holder with the plates towards the side of the skull was fastened and a coin placed between the skull and the head. The tube was fastened at the other side at a distance of one-half-inch [] from the hair.&quot; Beyond burns, hair loss, and cancer, X-rays can be linked to infertility in males based on the amount of radiation used.

In August 1896, H. D. Hawks, a graduate of Columbia College, suffered severe hand and chest burns from an X-ray demonstration. It was reported in &quot;Electrical Review&quot; and led to many other reports of problems associated with X-rays being sent in to the publication. Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Edison&#x27;s lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an X-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering. Other effects were sometimes blamed for the damage including ultraviolet rays and (according to Tesla) ozone. Many physicians claimed there were no effects from X-ray exposure at all. On 3 August 1905, in San Francisco, California, Elizabeth Fleischman, an American X-ray pioneer, died from complications as a result of her work with X-rays.

Hall-Edwards developed a cancer (then called X-ray dermatitis) sufficiently advanced by 1904 to cause him to write papers and give public addresses on the dangers of X-rays. His left arm had to be amputated at the elbow in 1908, and four fingers on his right arm soon thereafter, leaving only a thumb. He died of cancer in 1926. His left hand is kept at Birmingham University.

===20th century and beyond===
The many applications of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest. Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays and these first-generation cold cathode or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until about 1920.

A typical early 20th-century medical X-ray system consisted of a Ruhmkorff coil connected to a cold cathode Crookes X-ray tube. A spark gap was typically connected to the high voltage side in parallel to the tube and used for diagnostic purposes. The spark gap allowed detecting the polarity of the sparks, measuring voltage by the length of the sparks thus determining the &quot;hardness&quot; of the vacuum of the tube, and it provided a load in the event the X-ray tube was disconnected. To detect the hardness of the tube, the spark gap was initially opened to the widest setting. While the coil was operating, the operator reduced the gap until sparks began to appear. A tube in which the spark gap began to spark at around was considered soft (low vacuum) and suitable for thin body parts such as hands and arms. A spark indicated the tube was suitable for shoulders and knees. An spark would indicate a higher vacuum suitable for imaging the abdomen of larger individuals. Since the spark gap was connected in parallel to the tube, the spark gap had to be opened until the sparking ceased to operate the tube for imaging. Exposure time for photographic plates was around half a minute for a hand to a couple of minutes for a thorax. The plates may have a small addition of fluorescent salt to reduce exposure times.

Crookes tubes were unreliable. They had to contain a small quantity of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated. However, as time passed, the X-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas, causing the tube to generate &quot;harder&quot; X-rays until it soon stopped operating. Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air, known as &quot;softeners&quot;. These often took the form of a small side tube that contained a small piece of mica, a mineral that traps relatively large quantities of air within its structure. A small electrical heater heated the mica, causing it to release a small amount of air, thus restoring the tube&#x27;s efficiency. However, the mica had a limited life, and the restoration process was difficult to control.

In 1904, John Ambrose Fleming invented the thermionic diode, the first kind of vacuum tube. This used a hot cathode that caused an electric current to flow in a vacuum. This idea was quickly applied to X-ray tubes, and hence heated-cathode X-ray tubes, called &quot;Coolidge tubes&quot;, completely replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.

In about 1906, the physicist Charles Barkla discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic X-ray spectrum. He won the 1917 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.

In 1912, Max von Laue, Paul Knipping, and Walter Friedrich first observed the diffraction of X-rays by crystals. This discovery, along with the early work of Paul Peter Ewald, William Henry Bragg, and William Lawrence Bragg, gave birth to the field of X-ray crystallography.

In 1913, Henry Moseley performed crystallography experiments with X-rays emanating from various metals and formulated Moseley&#x27;s law which relates the frequency of the X-rays to the atomic number of the metal.

The Coolidge X-ray tube was invented the same year by William D. Coolidge. It made possible the continuous emissions of X-rays. Modern X-ray tubes are based on this design, often employing the use of rotating targets which allow for significantly higher heat dissipation than static targets, further allowing higher quantity X-ray output for use in high-powered applications such as rotational CT scanners.

The use of X-rays for medical purposes (which developed into the field of radiation therapy) was pioneered by Major John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England. Then in 1908, he had to have his left arm amputated because of the spread of X-ray dermatitis on his arm.

Medical science also used the motion picture to study human physiology. In 1913, a motion picture was made in Detroit showing a hard-boiled egg inside a human stomach. This early X-ray movie was recorded at a rate of one still image every four seconds. Dr Lewis Gregory Cole of New York was a pioneer of the technique, which he called &quot;serial radiography&quot;. In 1918, X-rays were used in association with motion picture cameras to capture the human skeleton in motion. In 1920, it was used to record the movements of tongue and teeth in the study of languages by the Institute of Phonetics in England.

In 1914, Marie Curie developed radiological cars to support soldiers injured in World War I. The cars would allow for rapid X-ray imaging of wounded soldiers so battlefield surgeons could quickly and more accurately operate.

From the early 1920s through to the 1950s, X-ray machines were developed to assist in the fitting of shoes and were sold to commercial shoe stores. Concerns regarding the impact of frequent or poorly controlled use were expressed in the 1950s, leading to the practice&#x27;s eventual end that decade.

The X-ray microscope was developed during the late 1940s and early 1950s.

The Chandra X-ray Observatory, launched on 23 July 1999, has been allowing the exploration of the very violent processes in the universe that produce X-rays. Unlike visible light, which gives a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable. It features stars being torn apart by black holes, galactic collisions, and novae, and neutron stars that build up layers of plasma that then explode into space.
An X-ray laser device was proposed as part of the Reagan Administration&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s, but the only test of the device (a sort of laser &quot;blaster&quot; or death ray, powered by a thermonuclear explosion) gave inconclusive results. For technical and political reasons, the overall project (including the X-ray laser) was defunded (though was later revived by the second Bush Administration as National Missile Defense using different technologies).

Phase-contrast X-ray imaging refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of an X-ray beam to form the image. Due to its good sensitivity to density differences, it is especially useful for imaging soft tissues. It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures in a wide range of biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for X-ray phase-contrast imaging, all using different principles to convert phase variations in the X-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, Talbot interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and X-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-based X-ray imaging, making it possible to distinguish from each other details that have almost similar density. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus X-ray sources, X-ray optics, and high resolution X-ray detectors.

==Energy ranges==
===Soft and hard X-rays===
X-rays with high photon energies above 5–10 keV (below 0.2–0.1 nm wavelength) are called &quot;hard X-rays&quot;, while those with lower energy (and longer wavelength) are called &quot;soft X-rays&quot;. The intermediate range with photon energies of several keV is often referred to as &quot;tender X-rays&quot;. Due to their penetrating ability, hard X-rays are widely used to image the inside of objects (e.g. in medical radiography and airport security). The term &quot;X-ray&quot; is metonymically used to refer to a radiographic image produced using this method, in addition to the method itself. Since the wavelengths of hard X-rays are similar to the size of atoms, they are also useful for determining crystal structures by X-ray crystallography. By contrast, soft X-rays are easily absorbed in air; the attenuation length of 600 eV (~2 nm) X-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.

===Gamma rays===
There is no consensus for a definition distinguishing between X-rays and gamma rays. One common practice is to distinguish between the two types of radiation based on their source: X-rays are emitted by electrons, while gamma rays are emitted by the atomic nucleus. This definition has several problems: other processes can also generate these high-energy photons, or sometimes the method of generation is not known. One common alternative is to distinguish X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength (or, equivalently, frequency or photon energy), with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10−11 m (0.1 Å), defined as gamma radiation. This criterion assigns a photon to an unambiguous category, but is only possible if wavelength is known. (Some measurement techniques do not distinguish between detected wavelengths.) However, these two definitions often coincide since the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes generally has a longer wavelength and lower photon energy than the radiation emitted by radioactive nuclei. Occasionally, one term or the other is used in specific contexts due to historical precedent, based on measurement (detection) technique, or based on their intended use rather than their wavelength or source.
Thus, gamma-rays generated for medical and industrial uses, for example radiotherapy, in the ranges of 6–20 MeV, can in this context also be referred to as X-rays.

==Properties==
X-ray photons carry enough energy to ionize atoms and disrupt molecular bonds. This makes it a type of ionizing radiation, and therefore harmful to living tissue. A very high radiation dose over a short period of time causes burns and radiation sickness, while lower doses can give an increased risk of radiation-induced cancer. In medical imaging, this increased cancer risk is generally greatly outweighed by the benefits of the examination. The ionizing capability of X-rays can be used in cancer treatment to kill malignant cells using radiation therapy. It is also used for material characterization using X-ray spectroscopy.

Hard X-rays can traverse relatively thick objects without being much absorbed or scattered. For this reason, X-rays are widely used to image the inside of visually opaque objects. The most often seen applications are in medical radiography and airport security scanners, but similar techniques are also important in industry (e.g. industrial radiography and industrial CT scanning) and research (e.g. small animal CT). The penetration depth varies with several orders of magnitude over the X-ray spectrum. This allows the photon energy to be adjusted for the application so as to give sufficient transmission through the object and at the same time provide good contrast in the image.

X-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light, which makes it possible to probe structures much smaller than can be seen using a normal microscope. This property is used in X-ray microscopy to acquire high-resolution images, and also in X-ray crystallography to determine the positions of atoms in crystals.

==Interaction with matter==
X-rays interact with matter in three main ways, through photoabsorption, Compton scattering, and Rayleigh scattering. The strength of these interactions depends on the energy of the X-rays and the elemental composition of the material, but not much on chemical properties, since the X-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies. Photoabsorption or photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism in the soft X-ray regime and for the lower hard X-ray energies. At higher energies, Compton scattering dominates.

===Photoelectric absorption===
The probability of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to formula_1, where formula_2 is the atomic number and formula_3 is the energy of the incident photon. This rule is not valid close to inner shell electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability, so called absorption edges. However, the general trend of high absorption coefficients and thus short penetration depths for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue, photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances, this limit is higher. The high amount of calcium (formula_4) in bones, together with their high density, is what makes them show up so clearly on medical radiographs.

A photoabsorbed photon transfers all its energy to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron that is likely to ionize more atoms in its path. An outer electron will fill the vacant electron position and produce either a characteristic X-ray or an Auger electron. These effects can be used for elemental detection through X-ray spectroscopy or Auger electron spectroscopy.

===Compton scattering===
Compton scattering is the predominant interaction between X-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging. Compton scattering is an inelastic scattering of the X-ray photon by an outer shell electron. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron, thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the X-ray. The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays. The probability for different scattering angles is described by the Klein–Nishina formula. The transferred energy can be directly obtained from the scattering angle from the conservation of energy and momentum.

===Rayleigh scattering===
Rayleigh scattering is the dominant elastic scattering mechanism in the X-ray regime. Inelastic forward scattering gives rise to the refractive index, which for X-rays is only slightly below 1.

==Production==
Whenever charged particles (electrons or ions) of sufficient energy hit a material, X-rays are produced.

===Production by electrons===


X-rays can be generated by an X-ray tube, a vacuum tube that uses a high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a hot cathode to a high velocity. The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the anode, creating the X-rays. In medical X-ray tubes the target is usually tungsten or a more crack-resistant alloy of rhenium (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications, such as when softer X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a copper target is most common, with cobalt often being used when fluorescence from iron content in the sample might otherwise present a problem. When even lower energies are needed, as in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the Kα X-rays from an aluminium or magnesium target are often used.

The maximum energy of the produced X-ray photon is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube times the electron charge, so an 80 kV tube cannot create X-rays with an energy greater than 80 keV. When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are created by two different atomic processes:
# &quot;Characteristic X-ray emission&quot; (X-ray electroluminescence): If the electron has enough energy, it can knock an orbital electron out of the inner electron shell of the target atom. After that, electrons from higher energy levels fill the vacancies, and X-ray photons are emitted. This process produces an emission spectrum of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as spectral lines. Usually, these are transitions from the upper shells to the K shell (called K lines), to the L shell (called L lines) and so on. If the transition is from 2p to 1s, it is called Kα, while if it is from 3p to 1s it is Kβ. The frequencies of these lines depend on the material of the target and are therefore called characteristic lines. The Kα line usually has greater intensity than the Kβ one and is more desirable in diffraction experiments. Thus the Kβ line is filtered out by a filter. The filter is usually made of a metal having one proton less than the anode material (e.g. Ni filter for Cu anode or Nb filter for Mo anode).
# &quot;Bremsstrahlung&quot;: This is radiation given off by the electrons as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the nuclei. These X-rays have a continuous spectrum. The frequency of &quot;Bremsstrahlung&quot; is limited by the energy of incident electrons.

So, the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous &quot;Bremsstrahlung&quot; spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines. The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes range from roughly 20 kV to 150 kV and thus the highest energies of the X-ray photons range from roughly 20 keV to 150 keV.

Both of these X-ray production processes are inefficient, with only about one percent of the electrical energy used by the tube converted into X-rays, and thus most of the electric power consumed by the tube is released as waste heat. When producing a usable flux of X-rays, the X-ray tube must be designed to dissipate the excess heat.

A specialized source of X-rays which is becoming widely used in research is synchrotron radiation, which is generated by particle accelerators. Its unique features are X-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of X-ray tubes, wide X-ray spectra, excellent collimation, and linear polarization.

Short nanosecond bursts of X-rays peaking at 15 keV in energy may be reliably produced by peeling pressure-sensitive adhesive tape from its backing in a moderate vacuum. This is likely to be the result of recombination of electrical charges produced by triboelectric charging. The intensity of X-ray triboluminescence is sufficient for it to be used as a source for X-ray imaging.

===Production by fast positive ions===
X-rays can also be produced by fast protons or other positive ions. The proton-induced X-ray emission or particle-induced X-ray emission is widely used as an analytical procedure. For high energies, the production cross section is proportional to &quot;Z&quot;12&quot;Z&quot;2−4, where &quot;Z&quot;1 refers to the atomic number of the ion, &quot;Z&quot;2 refers to that of the target atom. An overview of these cross sections is given in the same reference.

===Production in lightning and laboratory discharges===
X-rays are also produced in lightning accompanying terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. The underlying mechanism is the acceleration of electrons in lightning related electric fields and the subsequent production of photons through &quot;Bremsstrahlung&quot;. This produces photons with energies of some few keV and several tens of MeV. In laboratory discharges with a gap size of approximately 1 meter length and a peak voltage of 1 MV, X-rays with a characteristic energy of 160 keV are observed. A possible explanation is the encounter of two streamers and the production of high-energy run-away electrons; however, microscopic simulations have shown that the duration of electric field enhancement between two streamers is too short to produce a significant number of run-away electrons. Recently, it has been proposed that air perturbations in the vicinity of streamers can facilitate the production of run-away electrons and hence of X-rays from discharges.

==Detectors==

X-ray detectors vary in shape and function depending on their purpose. Imaging detectors such as those used for radiography were originally based on photographic plates and later photographic film, but are now mostly replaced by various digital detector types such as image plates and flat panel detectors. For radiation protection direct exposure hazard is often evaluated using ionization chambers, while dosimeters are used to measure the radiation dose the person has been exposed to. X-ray spectra can be measured either by energy dispersive or wavelength dispersive spectrometers. For X-ray diffraction applications, such as X-ray crystallography, hybrid photon counting detectors are widely used.

==Medical uses==


Since Röntgen&#x27;s discovery that X-rays can identify bone structures, X-rays have been used for medical imaging. The first medical use was less than a month after his paper on the subject. Up to 2010, five billion medical imaging examinations had been conducted worldwide. Radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 made up about 50% of total ionizing radiation exposure in the United States.

===Projectional radiographs===

Projectional radiography is the practice of producing two-dimensional images using X-ray radiation. Bones contain a high concentration of calcium, which, due to its relatively high atomic number, absorbs X-rays efficiently. This reduces the amount of X-rays reaching the detector in the shadow of the bones, making them clearly visible on the radiograph. The lungs and trapped gas also show up clearly because of lower absorption compared to tissue, while differences between tissue types are harder to see.

Projectional radiographs are useful in the detection of pathology of the skeletal system as well as for detecting some disease processes in soft tissue. Some notable examples are the very common chest X-ray, which can be used to identify lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or pulmonary edema, and the abdominal x-ray, which can detect bowel (or intestinal) obstruction, free air (from visceral perforations), and free fluid (in ascites). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as gallstones (which are rarely radiopaque) or kidney stones which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the brain or muscle. One area where projectional radiographs are used extensively is in evaluating how an orthopedic implant, such as a knee, hip or shoulder replacement, is situated in the body with respect to the surrounding bone. This can be assessed in two dimensions from plain radiographs, or it can be assessed in three dimensions if a technique called &#x27;2D to 3D registration&#x27; is used. This technique purportedly negates projection errors associated with evaluating implant position from plain radiographs.

Dental radiography is commonly used in the diagnoses of common oral problems, such as cavities.

In medical diagnostic applications, the low energy (soft) X-rays are unwanted, since they are totally absorbed by the body, increasing the radiation dose without contributing to the image. Hence, a thin metal sheet, often of aluminium, called an X-ray filter, is usually placed over the window of the X-ray tube, absorbing the low energy part in the spectrum. This is called &quot;hardening&quot; the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy (or harder) X-rays.

To generate an image of the cardiovascular system, including the arteries and veins (angiography) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated contrast agent has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine whether there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.

===Computed tomography===

Computed tomography (CT scanning) is a medical imaging modality where tomographic images or slices of specific areas of the body are obtained from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken in different directions. These cross-sectional images can be combined into a three-dimensional image of the inside of the body. CT scans are a quicker and more cost effective imaging modality that can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.

===Fluoroscopy===
Fluoroscopy is an imaging technique commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray image intensifier and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for coronary artery blockages), embolization procedures (to stop bleeding during hemorrhoidal artery embolization), and barium swallow (to examine for esophageal disorders and swallowing disorders). As of recent, modern fluoroscopy utilizes short bursts of x-rays, rather than a continuous beam, to effectively lower radiation exposure for both the patient and operator.

===Radiotherapy===
The use of X-rays as a treatment is known as radiation therapy and is largely used for the management (including palliation) of cancer; it requires higher radiation doses than those received for imaging alone. X-rays beams are used for treating skin cancers using lower energy X-ray beams while higher energy beams are used for treating cancers within the body such as brain, lung, prostate, and breast.

==Adverse effects==

X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation, and are classified as a carcinogen by both the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer and the U.S. government. Diagnostic X-rays (primarily from CT scans due to the large dose used) increase the risk of developmental problems and cancer in those exposed. It is estimated that 0.4% of current cancers in the United States are due to computed tomography (CT scans) performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% with 2007 rates of CT usage.

Experimental and epidemiological data currently do not support the proposition that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer. However, this is under increasing doubt. Cancer risk can start at the exposure of 1100 mGy. It is estimated that the additional radiation from diagnostic X-rays will increase the average person&#x27;s cumulative risk of getting cancer by age 75 by 0.6–3.0%. The amount of absorbed radiation depends upon the type of X-ray test and the body part involved. CT and fluoroscopy entail higher doses of radiation than do plain X-rays.

To place the increased risk in perspective, a plain chest X-ray will expose a person to the same amount from background radiation that people are exposed to (depending upon location) every day over 10 days, while exposure from a dental X-ray is approximately equivalent to 1 day of environmental background radiation. Each such X-ray would add less than 1 per 1,000,000 to the lifetime cancer risk. An abdominal or chest CT would be the equivalent to 2–3 years of background radiation to the whole body, or 4–5 years to the abdomen or chest, increasing the lifetime cancer risk between 1 per 1,000 to 1 per 10,000. This is compared to the roughly 40% chance of a US citizen developing cancer during their lifetime. For instance, the effective dose to the torso from a CT scan of the chest is about 5 mSv, and the absorbed dose is about 14 mGy. A head CT scan (1.5 mSv, 64 mGy) that is performed once with and once without contrast agent, would be equivalent to 40 years of background radiation to the head. Accurate estimation of effective doses due to CT is difficult with the estimation uncertainty range of about ±19% to ±32% for adult head scans depending upon the method used.

The risk of radiation is greater to a fetus, so in pregnant patients, the benefits of the investigation (X-ray) should be balanced with the potential hazards to the fetus. If there is 1 scan in 9 months, it can be harmful to the fetus. Therefore, women who are pregnant get ultrasounds as their diagnostic imaging because this does not use radiation. If there is too much radiation exposure there could be harmful effects on the fetus or the reproductive organs of the mother. In the US, there are an estimated 62 million CT scans performed annually, including more than 4 million on children. Avoiding unnecessary X-rays (especially CT scans) reduces radiation dose and any associated cancer risk.

Medical X-rays are a significant source of human-made radiation exposure. In 1987, they accounted for 58% of exposure from human-made sources in the United States. Since human-made sources accounted for only 18% of the total radiation exposure, most of which came from natural sources (82%), medical X-rays only accounted for 10% of &quot;total&quot; American radiation exposure; medical procedures as a whole (including nuclear medicine) accounted for 14% of total radiation exposure. By 2006, however, medical procedures in the United States were contributing much more ionizing radiation than was the case in the early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the total radiation exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures, in particular computed tomography (CT), and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine.

Dosage due to dental X-rays varies significantly depending on the procedure and the technology (film or digital). Depending on the procedure and the technology, a single dental X-ray of a human results in an exposure of 5 to 40 μSv. A full mouth series of X-rays may result in an exposure of up to 60 (digital) to 180 (film) μSv, for a yearly average of up to 400 μSv.

Financial incentives have been shown to have a significant impact on X-ray use with doctors who are paid a separate fee for each X-ray providing more X-rays.

Early photon tomography or EPT (as of 2015) along with other techniques are being researched as potential alternatives to X-rays for imaging applications.

==Other uses==
Other notable uses of X-rays include:

* X-ray crystallography in which the pattern produced by the diffraction of X-rays through the closely spaced lattice of atoms in a crystal is recorded and then analysed to reveal the nature of that lattice. A related technique, fiber diffraction, was used by Rosalind Franklin to discover the double helical structure of DNA.
* X-ray astronomy, which is an observational branch of astronomy, which deals with the study of X-ray emission from celestial objects.
* X-ray microscopic analysis, which uses electromagnetic radiation in the soft X-ray band to produce images of very small objects.
* X-ray fluorescence, a technique in which X-rays are generated within a specimen and detected. The outgoing energy of the X-ray can be used to identify the composition of the sample.
* Industrial radiography uses X-rays for inspection of industrial parts, particularly welds.
* Radiography of cultural objects, most often X-rays of paintings to reveal underdrawing, pentimenti alterations in the course of painting or by later restorers, and sometimes previous paintings on the support. Many pigments such as lead white show well in radiographs.
* X-ray spectromicroscopy has been used to analyse the reactions of pigments in paintings. For example, in analysing colour degradation in the paintings of van Gogh.

==Visibility==
While generally considered invisible to the human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible. Brandes, in an experiment a short time after Röntgen&#x27;s landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint &quot;blue-gray&quot; glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself. Upon hearing this, Röntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door Röntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the experiment was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with ionizing radiation. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of rhodopsin molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of phosphorescence in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.

Though X-rays are otherwise invisible, it is possible to see the ionization of the air molecules if the intensity of the X-ray beam is high enough. The beamline from the wiggler at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility is one example of such high intensity.

==Units of measure and exposure==
The measure of X-rays ionizing ability is called the exposure:
* The coulomb per kilogram (C/kg) is the SI unit of ionizing radiation exposure, and it is the amount of radiation required to create one coulomb of charge of each polarity in one kilogram of matter.
* The roentgen (R) is an obsolete traditional unit of exposure, which represented the amount of radiation required to create one electrostatic unit of charge of each polarity in one cubic centimeter of dry air. 1 roentgen = .

However, the effect of ionizing radiation on matter (especially living tissue) is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited into them rather than the charge generated. This measure of energy absorbed is called the absorbed dose:
* The gray (Gy), which has units of (joules/kilogram), is the SI unit of absorbed dose, and it is the amount of radiation required to deposit one joule of energy in one kilogram of any kind of matter.
* The rad is the (obsolete) corresponding traditional unit, equal to 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram. 100 rad = 1 gray.

The equivalent dose is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For X-rays it is equal to the absorbed dose.
* The Roentgen equivalent man (rem) is the traditional unit of equivalent dose. For X-rays it is equal to the rad, or, in other words, 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram. 100 rem = 1 Sv.
* The sievert (Sv) is the SI unit of equivalent dose, and also of effective dose. For X-rays the &quot;equivalent dose&quot; is numerically equal to a Gray (Gy). 1 Sv = 1 Gy. For the &quot;effective dose&quot; of X-rays, it is usually not equal to the Gray (Gy).

<text>x86 (also known as 80x86 or the 8086 family) is a family of complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architectures initially developed by Intel, based on the 8086 microprocessor and its 8-bit-external-bus variant, the 8088. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of 8-bit Intel&#x27;s 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term &quot;x86&quot; came into being because the names of several successors to Intel&#x27;s 8086 processor end in &quot;86&quot;, including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486. Colloquially, their names were &quot;186&quot;, &quot;286&quot;, &quot;386&quot; and &quot;486&quot;.

The term is not synonymous with IBM PC compatibility, as this implies a multitude of other computer hardware. Embedded systems and general-purpose computers used x86 chips before the PC-compatible market started, some of them before the IBM PC (1981) debut.

, most desktop and laptop computers sold are based on the x86 architecture family, while mobile categories such as smartphones or tablets are dominated by ARM. At the high end, x86 continues to dominate computation-intensive workstation and cloud computing segments.

==Overview==
In the 1980s and early 1990s, when the 8088 and 80286 were still in common use, the term x86 usually represented any 8086-compatible CPU. Today, however, x86 usually implies binary compatibility with the 32-bit instruction set of the 80386. This is due to the fact that this instruction set has become something of a lowest common denominator for many modern operating systems and also probably because the term became common after the introduction of the 80386 in 1985.

A few years after the introduction of the 8086 and 8088, Intel added some complexity to its naming scheme and terminology as the &quot;iAPX&quot; of the ambitious but ill-fated Intel iAPX 432 processor was tried on the more successful 8086 family of chips, applied as a kind of system-level prefix. An 8086 system, including coprocessors such as 8087 and 8089, and simpler Intel-specific system chips, was thereby described as an iAPX 86 system. There were also terms &quot;iRMX&quot; (for operating systems), &quot;iSBC&quot; (for single-board computers), and &quot;iSBX&quot; (for multimodule boards based on the 8086 architecture), all together under the heading &quot;Microsystem 80&quot;. However, this naming scheme was quite temporary, lasting for a few years during the early 1980s.

Although the 8086 was primarily developed for embedded systems and small multi-user or single-user computers, largely as a response to the successful 8080-compatible Zilog Z80, the x86 line soon grew in features and processing power. Today, x86 is ubiquitous in both stationary and portable personal computers, and is also used in midrange computers, workstations, servers, and most new supercomputer clusters of the TOP500 list. A large amount of software, including a large list of are using x86-based hardware.

Modern x86 is relatively uncommon in embedded systems, however; small low power applications (using tiny batteries), and low-cost microprocessor markets, such as home appliances and toys, lack significant x86 presence. Simple 8- and 16-bit based architectures are common here, as well as simpler RISC architectures like RISC-V, although the x86-compatible VIA C7, VIA Nano, AMD&#x27;s Geode, Athlon Neo and Intel Atom are examples of 32- and 64-bit designs used in some relatively low-power and low-cost segments.

There have been several attempts, including by Intel, to end the market dominance of the &quot;inelegant&quot; x86 architecture designed directly from the first simple 8-bit microprocessors. Examples of this are the iAPX 432 (a project originally named the &quot;Intel 8800&quot;), the Intel 960, Intel 860 and the Intel/Hewlett-Packard Itanium architecture. However, the continuous refinement of x86 microarchitectures, circuitry and semiconductor manufacturing would make it hard to replace x86 in many segments. AMD&#x27;s 64-bit extension of x86 (which Intel eventually responded to with a compatible design) and the scalability of x86 chips in the form of modern multi-core CPUs, is underlining x86 as an example of how continuous refinement of established industry standards can resist the competition from completely new architectures.

==Chronology==

The table below lists processor models and model series implementing various architectures in the x86 family, in chronological order. Each line item is characterized by significantly improved or commercially successful processor microarchitecture designs.

==History==
===Designers and manufacturers===

At various times, companies such as IBM, VIA, NEC, AMD, TI, STM, Fujitsu, OKI, Siemens, Cyrix, Intersil, C&amp;T, NexGen, UMC, and DM&amp;P started to design or manufacture x86 processors (CPUs) intended for personal computers and embedded systems. Other companies that designed or manufactured x86 or x87 processors include ITT Corporation, National Semiconductor, ULSI System Technology, and Weitek.

Such x86 implementations were seldom simple copies but often employed different internal microarchitectures and different solutions at the electronic and physical levels. Quite naturally, early compatible microprocessors were 16-bit, while 32-bit designs were developed much later. For the personal computer market, real quantities started to appear around 1990 with i386 and i486 compatible processors, often named similarly to Intel&#x27;s original chips. 

After the fully pipelined i486, in 1993 Intel introduced the Pentium brand name (which, unlike numbers, could be trademarked) for their new set of superscalar x86 designs. With the x86 naming scheme now legally cleared, other x86 vendors had to choose different names for their x86-compatible products, and initially some chose to continue with variations of the numbering scheme: IBM partnered with Cyrix to produce the 5x86 and then the very efficient 6x86 (M1) and 6x86MX (MII) lines of Cyrix designs, which were the first x86 microprocessors implementing register renaming to enable speculative execution.

AMD meanwhile designed and manufactured the advanced but delayed 5k86 (K5), which, internally, was closely based on AMD&#x27;s earlier 29K RISC design; similar to NexGen&#x27;s Nx586, it used a strategy such that dedicated pipeline stages decode x86 instructions into uniform and easily handled micro-operations, a method that has remained the basis for most x86 designs to this day.

Some early versions of these microprocessors had heat dissipation problems. The 6x86 was also affected by a few minor compatibility problems, the Nx586 lacked a floating-point unit (FPU) and (the then crucial) pin-compatibility, while the K5 had somewhat disappointing performance when it was (eventually) introduced.

Customer ignorance of alternatives to the Pentium series further contributed to these designs being comparatively unsuccessful, despite the fact that the K5 had very good Pentium compatibility and the 6x86 was significantly faster than the Pentium on integer code. AMD later managed to grow into a serious contender with the K6 set of processors, which gave way to the very successful Athlon and Opteron.

There were also other contenders, such as Centaur Technology (formerly IDT), Rise Technology, and Transmeta. VIA Technologies&#x27; energy efficient C3 and C7 processors, which were designed by the Centaur company, were sold for many years following their release in 2005. Centaur&#x27;s 2008 design, the VIA Nano, was their first processor with superscalar and speculative execution. It was introduced at about the same time (in 2008) as Intel introduced the Intel Atom, its first &quot;in-order&quot; processor after the P5 Pentium.

Many additions and extensions have been added to the original x86 instruction set over the years, almost consistently with full backward compatibility. The architecture family has been implemented in processors from Intel, Cyrix, AMD, VIA Technologies and many other companies; there are also open implementations, such as the Zet SoC platform (currently inactive). Nevertheless, of those, only Intel, AMD, VIA Technologies, and DM&amp;P Electronics hold x86 architectural licenses, and from these, only the first two actively produce modern 64-bit designs, leading to what has been called a &quot;duopoly&quot; of Intel and AMD in x86 processors.

However, in 2014 the Shanghai-based Chinese company Zhaoxin, a joint venture between a Chinese company and VIA Technologies, began designing VIA based x86 processors for desktops and laptops. The release of its newest &quot;7&quot; family of x86 processors (e.g. KX-7000), which are not quite as fast as AMD or Intel chips but are still state of the art, had been planned for 2021; as of March 2022 the release had not taken place, however.

===From 16-bit and 32-bit to 64-bit architecture===
The instruction set architecture has twice been extended to a larger word size. In 1985, Intel released the 32-bit 80386 (later known as i386) which gradually replaced the earlier 16-bit chips in computers (although typically not in embedded systems) during the following years; this extended programming model was originally referred to as &quot;the i386 architecture&quot; (like its first implementation) but Intel later dubbed it IA-32 when introducing its (unrelated) IA-64 architecture.

In 1999–2003, AMD extended this 32-bit architecture to 64 bits and referred to it as x86-64 in early documents and later as AMD64. Intel soon adopted AMD&#x27;s architectural extensions under the name IA-32e, later using the name EM64T and finally using Intel 64. Microsoft and Sun Microsystems/Oracle also use term &quot;x64&quot;, while many Linux distributions, and the BSDs also use the &quot;amd64&quot; term. Microsoft Windows, for example, designates its 32-bit versions as &quot;x86&quot; and 64-bit versions as &quot;x64&quot;, while installation files of 64-bit Windows versions are required to be placed into a directory called &quot;AMD64&quot;.

In 2023, Intel proposed a major change to the architecture referred to as X86S (formerly known as X86-S). The S in X86S stood for &quot;simplification&quot;, which aimed to remove support for legacy execution modes and instructions. A processor implementing this proposal would start execution directly in long mode and would only support 64-bit operating systems. 32-bit code would only be supported for user applications running in ring 3, and would use the same simplified segmentation as long mode. In December 2024 Intel cancelled this project.

==Basic properties of the architecture==
The x86 architecture is a variable instruction length, primarily &quot;CISC&quot; design with emphasis on backward compatibility. The instruction set is not typical CISC, however, but basically an extended version of the simple eight-bit 8008 and 8080 architectures. Byte-addressing is enabled and words are stored in memory with little-endian byte order. Memory access to unaligned addresses is allowed for almost all instructions. The largest native size for integer arithmetic and memory addresses (or offsets) is 16, 32 or 64 bits depending on architecture generation (newer processors include direct support for smaller integers as well). Multiple scalar values can be handled simultaneously via the SIMD unit present in later generations, as described below. Immediate addressing offsets and immediate data may be expressed as 8-bit quantities for the frequently occurring cases or contexts where a −128..127 range is enough. Typical instructions are therefore 2 or 3 bytes in length (although some are much longer, and some are single-byte).

To further conserve encoding space, most registers are expressed in opcodes using three or four bits, the latter via an opcode prefix in 64-bit mode, while at most one operand to an instruction can be a memory location. However, this memory operand may also be the destination (or a combined source and destination), while the other operand, the source, can be either register or immediate. Among other factors, this contributes to a code size that rivals eight-bit machines and enables efficient use of instruction cache memory. The relatively small number of general registers (also inherited from its 8-bit ancestors) has made register-relative addressing (using small immediate offsets) an important method of accessing operands, especially on the stack. Much work has therefore been invested in making such accesses as fast as register accesses—i.e., a one cycle instruction throughput, in most circumstances where the accessed data is available in the top-level cache.

===Floating point and SIMD===
A dedicated floating-point processor with 80-bit internal registers, the 8087, was developed for the original 8086. This microprocessor subsequently developed into the extended 80387, and later processors incorporated a backward compatible version of this functionality on the same microprocessor as the main processor. In addition to this, modern x86 designs also contain a SIMD-unit (see SSE below) where instructions can work in parallel on (one or two) 128-bit words, each containing two or four floating-point numbers (each 64 or 32 bits wide respectively), or alternatively, 2, 4, 8 or 16 integers (each 64, 32, 16 or 8 bits wide respectively).

The presence of wide SIMD registers means that existing x86 processors can load or store up to 128 bits of memory data in a single instruction and also perform bitwise operations (although not integer arithmetic) on full 128-bits quantities in parallel. Intel&#x27;s Sandy Bridge processors added the Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) instructions, widening the SIMD registers to 256 bits. The Intel Initial Many Core Instructions implemented by the Knights Corner Xeon Phi processors, and the AVX-512 instructions implemented by the Knights Landing Xeon Phi processors and by Skylake-X processors, use 512-bit wide SIMD registers.
==Current implementations==
During execution, current x86 processors employ a few extra decoding steps to split most instructions into smaller pieces called micro-operations. These are then handed to a control unit that buffers and schedules them in compliance with x86-semantics so that they can be executed, partly in parallel, by one of several (more or less specialized) execution units. These modern x86 designs are thus pipelined, superscalar, and also capable of out of order and speculative execution (via branch prediction, register renaming, and memory dependence prediction), which means they may execute multiple (partial or complete) x86 instructions simultaneously, and not necessarily in the same order as given in the instruction stream.
Some Intel CPUs (Xeon Foster MP, some Pentium 4, and some Nehalem and later Intel Core processors) and AMD CPUs (starting from Zen) are also capable of simultaneous multithreading with two threads per core (Xeon Phi has four threads per core). Some Intel CPUs support transactional memory (TSX).

When introduced, in the mid-1990s, this method was sometimes referred to as a &quot;RISC core&quot; or as &quot;RISC translation&quot;, partly for marketing reasons, but also because these micro-operations share some properties with certain types of RISC instructions. However, traditional microcode (used since the 1950s) also inherently shares many of the same properties; the new method differs mainly in that the translation to micro-operations now occurs asynchronously. Not having to synchronize the execution units with the decode steps opens up possibilities for more analysis of the (buffered) code stream, and therefore permits detection of operations that can be performed in parallel, simultaneously feeding more than one execution unit.

The latest processors also do the opposite when appropriate; they combine certain x86 sequences (such as a compare followed by a conditional jump) into a more complex micro-op which fits the execution model better and thus can be executed faster or with fewer machine resources involved.

Another way to try to improve performance is to cache the decoded micro-operations, so the processor can directly access the decoded micro-operations from a special cache, instead of decoding them again. Intel followed this approach with the Execution Trace Cache feature in their NetBurst microarchitecture (for Pentium 4 processors) and later in the Decoded Stream Buffer (for Core-branded processors since Sandy Bridge).

Transmeta used a completely different method in their Crusoe x86 compatible CPUs. They used just-in-time translation to convert x86 instructions to the CPU&#x27;s native VLIW instruction set. Transmeta argued that their approach allows for more power efficient designs since the CPU can forgo the complicated decode step of more traditional x86 implementations.

==Addressing modes==
Addressing modes for 16-bit processor modes can be summarized by the formula:
:formula_1

Addressing modes for 32-bit x86 processor modes can be summarized by the formula:
:formula_2

Addressing modes for the 64-bit processor mode can be summarized by the formula:
:formula_3

Instruction relative addressing in 64-bit code (RIP + displacement, where RIP is the instruction pointer register) simplifies the implementation of position-independent code (as used in shared libraries in some operating systems).

The 8086 had of eight-bit (or alternatively ) I/O space, and a (one segment) stack in memory supported by computer hardware. Only words (two bytes) can be pushed to the stack. The stack grows toward numerically lower addresses, with pointing to the most recently pushed item. There are 256 interrupts, which can be invoked by both hardware and software. The interrupts can cascade, using the stack to store the return address.

==x86 registers==
===16-bit===
The original Intel 8086 and 8088 have fourteen 16-bit registers. Four of them (AX, BX, CX, DX) are general-purpose registers (GPRs), although each may have an additional purpose; for example, only CX can be used as a counter with the loop instruction. Each can be accessed as two separate bytes (thus BX&#x27;s high byte can be accessed as BH and low byte as BL). Two pointer registers have special roles: SP (stack pointer) points to the &quot;top&quot; of the stack, and BP (base pointer) is often used to point at some other place in the stack, typically above the local variables (see frame pointer). The registers SI, DI, BX and BP are address registers, and may also be used for array indexing.

One of four possible &#x27;segment registers&#x27; (CS, DS, SS and ES) is used to form a memory address. In the original 8086 / 8088 / 80186 / 80188 every address was built from a segment register and one of the general purpose registers. For example ds:si is the notation for an address formed as [16 * ds + si] to allow 20-bit addressing rather than 16 bits, although this changed in later processors. At that time only certain combinations were supported.

The FLAGS register contains flags such as carry flag, overflow flag and zero flag. Finally, the instruction pointer (IP) points to the next instruction that will be fetched from memory and then executed; this register cannot be directly accessed (read or written) by a program.

The Intel 80186 and 80188 are essentially an upgraded 8086 or 8088 CPU, respectively, with on-chip peripherals added, and they have the same CPU registers as the 8086 and 8088 (in addition to interface registers for the peripherals).

The 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 can use an optional floating-point coprocessor, the 8087. The 8087 appears to the programmer as part of the CPU and adds eight 80-bit wide registers, st(0) to st(7), each of which can hold numeric data in one of seven formats: 32-, 64-, or 80-bit floating point, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit (binary) integer, and 80-bit packed decimal integer. It also has its own 16-bit status register accessible through the instruction, and it is common to simply use some of its bits for branching by copying it into the normal FLAGS.

In the Intel 80286, to support protected mode, three special registers hold descriptor table addresses (GDTR, LDTR, IDTR), and a fourth task register (TR) is used for task switching. The 80287 is the floating-point coprocessor for the 80286 and has the same registers as the 8087 with the same data formats.

===32-bit===
With the advent of the 32-bit 80386 processor, the 16-bit general-purpose registers, base registers, index registers, instruction pointer, and FLAGS register, but not the segment registers, were expanded to 32 bits. The nomenclature represented this by prefixing an &quot;E&quot; (for &quot;extended&quot;) to the register names in x86 assembly language. Thus, the AX register corresponds to the lower 16 bits of the new 32-bit EAX register, SI corresponds to the lower 16 bits of ESI, and so on. The general-purpose registers, base registers, and index registers can all be used as the base in addressing modes, and all of those registers except for the stack pointer can be used as the index in addressing modes.

Two new segment registers (FS and GS) were added. With a greater number of registers, instructions and operands, the machine code format was expanded. To provide backward compatibility, segments with executable code can be marked as containing either 16-bit or 32-bit instructions. Special prefixes allow inclusion of 32-bit instructions in a 16-bit segment or vice versa.

The 80386 had an optional floating-point coprocessor, the 80387; it had eight 80-bit wide registers: st(0) to st(7), like the 8087 and 80287. The 80386 could also use an 80287 coprocessor. With the 80486 and all subsequent x86 models, the floating-point processing unit (FPU) is integrated on-chip.

The Pentium MMX added eight 64-bit MMX integer vector registers (MM0 to MM7, which share lower bits with the 80-bit-wide FPU stack). With the Pentium III, Intel added a 32-bit Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) control/status register (MXCSR) and eight 128-bit SSE floating-point registers (XMM0 to XMM7).

===64-bit===

Starting with the AMD Opteron processor, the x86 architecture extended the 32-bit registers into 64-bit registers in a way similar to how the 16 to 32-bit extension took place. An R-prefix (for &quot;register&quot;) identifies the 64-bit registers (RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, RBP, RSP, RFLAGS, RIP), and eight additional 64-bit general registers (R8–R15) were also introduced in the creation of x86-64. Also, eight more SSE vector registers (XMM8–XMM15) were added. However, these extensions are only usable in 64-bit mode, which is one of the two modes only available in long mode. The addressing modes were not dramatically changed from 32-bit mode, except that addressing was extended to 64 bits, virtual addresses are now sign extended to 64 bits (in order to disallow mode bits in virtual addresses), and other selector details were dramatically reduced. In addition, an addressing mode was added to allow memory references relative to RIP (the instruction pointer), to ease the implementation of position-independent code, used in shared libraries in some operating systems.

===128-bit===

SIMD registers XMM0–XMM15 (XMM0–XMM31 when AVX-512 is supported).

===256-bit===

SIMD registers YMM0–YMM15 (YMM0–YMM31 when AVX-512 is supported). Lower half of each of the YMM registers maps onto the corresponding XMM register.

===512-bit===

SIMD registers ZMM0–ZMM31. Lower half of each of the ZMM registers maps onto the corresponding YMM register.

===Miscellaneous/special purpose===
x86 processors that have a protected mode, i.e. the 80286 and later processors, also have three descriptor registers (GDTR, LDTR, IDTR) and a task register (TR).

32-bit x86 processors (starting with the 80386) also include various special/miscellaneous registers such as control registers (CR0 through 4, CR8 for 64-bit only), debug registers (DR0 through 3, plus 6 and 7), test registers (TR3 through 7; 80486 only), and model-specific registers (MSRs, appearing with the Pentium).

AVX-512 has eight extra 64-bit mask registers K0–K7 for selecting elements in a vector register. Depending on the vector register and element widths, only a subset of bits of the mask register may be used by a given instruction.

===Purpose===
Although the main registers (with the exception of the instruction pointer) are &quot;general-purpose&quot; in the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the instruction set and can be used for anything, it was originally envisioned that they be used for the following purposes:
* AL/AH/AX/EAX/RAX: Accumulator
* CL/CH/CX/ECX/RCX: Counter (for use with loops and strings)
* DL/DH/DX/EDX/RDX: Extend the precision of the accumulator (e.g. combine 32-bit EAX and EDX for 64-bit integer operations in 32-bit code)
* BL/BH/BX/EBX/RBX: Base index (for use with arrays)
* SP/ESP/RSP: Stack pointer for top address of the stack.
* BP/EBP/RBP: Stack base pointer for holding the address of the current stack frame.
* SI/ESI/RSI: &quot;Source index&quot; for string operations.
* DI/EDI/RDI: &quot;Destination index&quot; for string operations.
* IP/EIP/RIP: Instruction pointer. Holds the program counter, the address of next instruction.

Segment registers:
*CS: Code
*DS: Data
*SS: Stack
*ES: Extra data
*FS: Extra data #2
*GS: Extra data #3

No particular purposes were envisioned for the other 8 registers available only in 64-bit mode.

Some instructions compile and execute more efficiently when using these registers for their designed purpose. For example, using AL as an accumulator and adding an immediate byte value to it produces the efficient &quot;add to AL&quot; opcode of 04h, whilst using the BL register produces the generic and longer &quot;add to register&quot; opcode of 80C3h. Another example is double precision division and multiplication that works specifically with the AX and DX registers.

Modern compilers benefited from the introduction of the &quot;sib&quot; byte (&quot;scale-index-base byte&quot;) that allows registers to be treated uniformly (minicomputer-like). However, using the sib byte universally is non-optimal, as it produces longer encodings than only using it selectively when necessary. (The main benefit of the sib byte is the orthogonality and more powerful addressing modes it provides, which make it possible to save instructions and the use of registers for address calculations such as scaling an index.) Some special instructions lost priority in the hardware design and became slower than equivalent small code sequences. A notable example is the LODSW instruction.

Note: The ?IL registers are only available in 64-bit mode.

==Operating modes==

===Real mode===

Real Address mode, commonly called Real mode, is an operating mode of 8086 and later x86-compatible CPUs. Real mode is characterized by a 20-bit segmented memory address space (meaning that only slightly more than 1 MiB of memory can be addressed), direct software access to peripheral hardware, and no concept of memory protection or multitasking at the hardware level. All x86 CPUs in the 80286 series and later start up in real mode at power-on; 80186 CPUs and earlier had only one operational mode, which is equivalent to real mode in later chips. (On the IBM PC platform, direct software access to the IBM BIOS routines is available only in real mode, since BIOS is written for real mode. However, this is not a property of the x86 CPU but of the IBM BIOS design.)

In order to use more than 64 KB of memory, the segment registers must be used. This created great complications for compiler implementors who introduced odd pointer modes such as &quot;near&quot;, &quot;far&quot; and &quot;huge&quot; to leverage the implicit nature of segmented architecture to different degrees, with some pointers containing 16-bit offsets within implied segments and other pointers containing segment addresses and offsets within segments. It is technically possible to use up to 256 KB of memory for code and data, with up to 64 KB for code, by setting all four segment registers once and then only using 16-bit offsets (optionally with default-segment override prefixes) to address memory, but this puts substantial restrictions on the way data can be addressed and memory operands can be combined, and it violates the architectural intent of the Intel designers, which is for separate data items (e.g. arrays, structures, code units) to be contained in separate segments and addressed by their own segment addresses, in new programs that are not ported from earlier 8-bit processors with 16-bit address spaces.

===Unreal mode===

Unreal mode is used by some 16-bit operating systems and some 32-bit boot loaders.

===System Management Mode===

The System Management Mode (SMM) is only used by the system firmware (BIOS/UEFI), not by operating systems and applications software. The SMM code is running in SMRAM.

===Protected mode===

In addition to real mode, the Intel 80286 supports protected mode, expanding addressable physical memory to 16 MB and addressable virtual memory to 1 GB, and providing protected memory, which prevents programs from corrupting one another. This is done by using the segment registers only for storing an index into a descriptor table that is stored in memory. There are two such tables, the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and the Local Descriptor Table (LDT), each holding up to 8192 segment descriptors, each segment giving access to 64 KB of memory. In the 80286, a segment descriptor provides a 24-bit base address, and this base address is added to a 16-bit offset to create an absolute address. The base address from the table fulfills the same role that the literal value of the segment register fulfills in real mode; the segment registers have been converted from direct registers to indirect registers. Each segment can be assigned one of four ring levels used for hardware-based computer security. Each segment descriptor also contains a segment limit field which specifies the maximum offset that may be used with the segment. Because offsets are 16 bits, segments are still limited to 64 KB each in 80286 protected mode.

Each time a segment register is loaded in protected mode, the 80286 must read a 6-byte segment descriptor from memory into a set of hidden internal registers. Thus, loading segment registers is much slower in protected mode than in real mode, and changing segments very frequently is to be avoided. Actual memory operations using protected mode segments are not slowed much because the 80286 and later have hardware to check the offset against the segment limit in parallel with instruction execution.

The Intel 80386 extended offsets and also the segment limit field in each segment descriptor to 32 bits, enabling a segment to span the entire memory space. It also introduced support in protected mode for paging, a mechanism making it possible to use paged virtual memory (with 4 KB page size). Paging allows the CPU to map any page of the virtual memory space to any page of the physical memory space. To do this, it uses additional mapping tables in memory called page tables. Protected mode on the 80386 can operate with paging either enabled or disabled; the segmentation mechanism is always active and generates virtual addresses that are then mapped by the paging mechanism if it is enabled. The segmentation mechanism can also be effectively disabled by setting all segments to have a base address of 0 and size limit equal to the whole address space; this also requires a minimally-sized segment descriptor table of only four descriptors (since the FS and GS segments need not be used).

Paging is used extensively by modern multitasking operating systems. Linux, 386BSD and Windows NT were developed for the 386 because it was the first Intel architecture CPU to support paging and 32-bit segment offsets. The 386 architecture became the basis of all further development in the x86 series.

x86 processors that support protected mode boot into real mode for backward compatibility with the older 8086 class of processors. Upon power-on (a.k.a. booting), the processor initializes in real mode, and then begins executing instructions. Operating system boot code, which might be stored in read-only memory, may place the processor into the protected mode to enable paging and other features. Conversely, segment arithmetic, a common practice in real mode code, is not allowed in protected mode.

====Virtual 8086 mode====
There is also a sub-mode of operation in 32-bit protected mode (a.k.a. 80386 protected mode) called &quot;virtual 8086 mode&quot;, also known as &quot;V86 mode&quot;. This is basically a special hybrid operating mode that allows real mode programs and operating systems to run while under the control of a protected mode supervisor operating system. This allows for a great deal of flexibility in running both protected mode programs and real mode programs simultaneously. This mode is exclusively available for the 32-bit version of protected mode; it does not exist in the 16-bit version of protected mode, or in long mode.

===Long mode===
In the mid 1990s, it was obvious that the 32-bit address space of the x86 architecture was limiting its performance in applications requiring large data sets. A 32-bit address space would allow the processor to directly address only 4 GB of data, a size surpassed by applications such as video processing and database engines. Using 64-bit addresses, it is possible to directly address 16 EiB of data, although most 64-bit architectures do not support access to the full 64-bit address space; for example, AMD64 supports only 48 bits from a 64-bit address, split into four paging levels.

In 1999, AMD published a (nearly) complete specification for a 64-bit extension of the x86 architecture which they called &quot;x86-64&quot; with claimed intentions to produce. That design is currently used in almost all x86 processors, with some exceptions intended for embedded systems.

Mass-produced &quot;x86-64&quot; chips for the general market were available four years later, in 2003, after the time was spent for working prototypes to be tested and refined; about the same time, the initial name &quot;x86-64&quot; was changed to &quot;AMD64&quot;. The success of the AMD64 line of processors coupled with lukewarm reception of the IA-64 architecture forced Intel to release its own implementation of the AMD64 instruction set. Intel had previously implemented support for AMD64 but opted not to enable it in hopes that AMD would not bring AMD64 to market before Itanium&#x27;s new IA-64 instruction set was widely adopted. It branded its implementation of AMD64 as &quot;EM64T&quot;, and later rebranded it &quot;Intel 64&quot;.

In its literature and product version names, Microsoft and Sun refer to AMD64/Intel 64 collectively as &quot;x64&quot; in the Windows and Solaris operating systems. Linux distributions refer to it either as &quot;x86-64&quot;, its variant &quot;x86_64&quot;, or &quot;amd64&quot;. BSD systems use &quot;amd64&quot; while macOS uses &quot;x86_64&quot;.

Long mode is mostly an extension of the 32-bit instruction set, but unlike the 16–to–32-bit transition, many instructions were dropped in the 64-bit mode. This does not affect actual binary backward compatibility (which would execute legacy code in other modes that retain support for those instructions), but it changes the way assembler and compilers for new code have to work.

This was the first time that a major extension of the x86 architecture was initiated and originated by a manufacturer other than Intel. It was also the first time that Intel accepted technology of this nature from an outside source.

==Extensions==

===Floating-point unit===

Early x86 processors could be extended with floating-point hardware in the form of a series of floating-point numerical co-processors with names like 8087, 80287 and 80387, abbreviated x87. This was also known as the NPX (&quot;Numeric Processor eXtension&quot;), an apt name since the coprocessors, while used mainly for floating-point calculations, also performed integer operations on both binary and decimal formats. With very few exceptions, the 80486 and subsequent x86 processors then integrated this x87 functionality on chip which made the x87 instructions a de facto integral part of the x86 instruction set.

Each x87 register, known as ST(0) through ST(7), is 80 bits wide and stores numbers in the IEEE floating-point standard double extended precision format. These registers are organized as a stack with ST(0) as the top. This was done in order to conserve opcode space, and the registers are therefore randomly accessible only for either operand in a register-to-register instruction; ST0 must always be one of the two operands, either the source or the destination, regardless of whether the other operand is ST(x) or a memory operand. However, random access to the stack registers can be obtained through an instruction which exchanges any specified ST(x) with ST(0).

The operations include arithmetic and transcendental functions, including trigonometric and exponential functions, and instructions that load common constants (such as 0; 1; e, the base of the natural logarithm; log2(10); and log10(2)) into one of the stack registers. While the integer ability is often overlooked, the x87 can operate on larger integers with a single instruction than the 8086, 80286, 80386, or any x86 CPU without to 64-bit extensions can, and repeated integer calculations even on small values (e.g., 16-bit) can be accelerated by executing integer instructions on the x86 CPU and the x87 in parallel. (The x86 CPU keeps running while the x87 coprocessor calculates, and the x87 sets a signal to the x86 when it is finished or interrupts the x86 if it needs attention because of an error.)

===MMX===
MMX is a SIMD instruction set designed by Intel and introduced in 1997 for the Pentium MMX microprocessor. The MMX instruction set was developed from a similar concept first used on the Intel i860. It is supported on most subsequent IA-32 processors by Intel and other vendors. MMX is typically used for video processing (in multimedia applications, for instance).

MMX added 8 new registers to the architecture, known as MM0 through MM7 (henceforth referred to as &quot;MMn&quot;). In reality, these new registers were just aliases for the existing x87 FPU stack registers. Hence, anything that was done to the floating-point stack would also affect the MMX registers. Unlike the FP stack, these MMn registers were fixed, not relative, and therefore they were randomly accessible. The instruction set did not adopt the stack-like semantics so that existing operating systems could still correctly save and restore the register state when multitasking without modifications.

Each of the MMn registers are 64-bit integers. However, one of the main concepts of the MMX instruction set is the concept of &quot;packed data types&quot;, which means instead of using the whole register for a single 64-bit integer (quadword), one may use it to contain two 32-bit integers (doubleword), four 16-bit integers (word) or eight 8-bit integers (byte). Given that the MMX&#x27;s 64-bit MMn registers are aliased to the FPU stack and each of the floating-point registers are 80 bits wide, the upper 16 bits of the floating-point registers are unused in MMX. These bits are set to all ones by any MMX instruction, which correspond to the floating-point representation of NaNs or infinities.

===3DNow!===

In 1997, AMD introduced 3DNow!. The introduction of this technology coincided with the rise of 3D entertainment applications and was designed to improve the CPU&#x27;s vector processing performance of graphic-intensive applications. 3D video game developers and 3D graphics hardware vendors use 3DNow! to enhance their performance on AMD&#x27;s K6 and Athlon series of processors.

3DNow! was designed to be the natural evolution of MMX from integers to floating point. As such, it uses exactly the same register naming convention as MMX, that is MM0 through MM7. The only difference is that instead of packing integers into these registers, two single-precision floating-point numbers are packed into each register. The advantage of aliasing the FPU registers is that the same instruction and data structures used to save the state of the FPU registers can also be used to save 3DNow! register states. Thus no special modifications are required to be made to operating systems which would otherwise not know about them.

=== and AVX===
In 1999, Intel introduced the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instruction set, following in 2000 with SSE2. The first addition allowed offloading of basic floating-point operations from the x87 stack and the second made MMX almost obsolete and allowed the instructions to be realistically targeted by conventional compilers. Introduced in 2004 along with the &quot;Prescott&quot; revision of the Pentium 4 processor, SSE3 added specific memory and thread-handling instructions to boost the performance of Intel&#x27;s HyperThreading technology. AMD licensed the SSE3 instruction set and implemented most of the SSE3 instructions for its revision E and later Athlon 64 processors. The Athlon 64 does not support HyperThreading and lacks those SSE3 instructions used only for HyperThreading.

SSE discarded all legacy connections to the FPU stack. This also meant that this instruction set discarded all legacy connections to previous generations of SIMD instruction sets like MMX. But it freed the designers up, allowing them to use larger registers, not limited by the size of the FPU registers. The designers created eight 128-bit registers, named XMM0 through XMM7. (In AMD64, the number of SSE XMM registers has been increased from 8 to 16.) However, the downside was that operating systems had to have an awareness of this new set of instructions in order to be able to save their register states. So Intel created a slightly modified version of Protected mode, called Enhanced mode which enables the usage of SSE instructions, whereas they stay disabled in regular Protected mode. An OS that is aware of SSE will activate Enhanced mode, whereas an unaware OS will only enter into traditional Protected mode.

SSE is a SIMD instruction set that works only on floating-point values, like 3DNow!. However, unlike 3DNow! it severs all legacy connection to the FPU stack. Because it has larger registers than 3DNow!, SSE can pack twice the number of single precision floats into its registers. The original SSE was limited to only single-precision numbers, like 3DNow!. The SSE2 introduced the capability to pack double precision numbers too, which 3DNow! had no possibility of doing since a double precision number is 64-bit in size which would be the full size of a single 3DNow! MMn register. At 128 bits, the SSE XMMn registers could pack two double precision floats into one register. Thus SSE2 is much more suitable for scientific calculations than either SSE1 or 3DNow!, which were limited to only single precision. SSE3 does not introduce any additional registers.
The Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) doubled the size of SSE registers to 256-bit YMM registers. It also introduced the VEX coding scheme to accommodate the larger registers, plus a few instructions to permute elements. AVX2 did not introduce extra registers, but was notable for the addition for masking, gather, and shuffle instructions.

AVX-512 features yet another expansion to 32 512-bit ZMM registers and a new EVEX scheme. Unlike its predecessors featuring a monolithic extension, it is divided into many subsets that specific models of CPUs can choose to implement.

===Physical Address Extension (PAE)===

Physical Address Extension or PAE was first added in the Intel Pentium Pro, and later by AMD in the Athlon processors, to allow up to 64 GB of RAM to be addressed. Without PAE, physical RAM in 32-bit protected mode is usually limited to 4 GB. PAE defines a different page table structure with wider page table entries and a third level of page table, allowing additional bits of physical address. Although the initial implementations on 32-bit processors theoretically supported up to 64 GB of RAM, chipset and other platform limitations often restricted what could actually be used. x86-64 processors define page table structures that theoretically allow up to 52 bits of physical address, although again, chipset and other platform concerns (like the number of DIMM slots available, and the maximum RAM possible per DIMM) prevent such a large physical address space to be realized. On x86-64 processors PAE mode must be active before the switch to long mode, and must remain active while long mode is active, so while in long mode there is no &quot;non-PAE&quot; mode. PAE mode does not affect the width of linear or virtual addresses.

===x86-64===

By the 2000s, 32-bit x86 processors&#x27; limits in memory addressing were an obstacle to their use in high-performance computing clusters and powerful desktop workstations. The aged 32-bit x86 was competing with much more advanced 64-bit RISC architectures which could address much more memory. Intel and the whole x86 ecosystem needed 64-bit memory addressing if x86 was to survive the 64-bit computing era, as workstation and desktop software applications were soon to start hitting the limits of 32-bit memory addressing. However, Intel felt that it was the right time to make a bold step and use the transition to 64-bit desktop computers for a transition away from the x86 architecture in general, an experiment which ultimately failed.

In 2001, Intel attempted to introduce a non-x86 64-bit architecture named IA-64 in its Itanium processor, initially aiming for the high-performance computing market, hoping that it would eventually replace the 32-bit x86. While IA-64 was incompatible with x86, the Itanium processor did provide emulation abilities for translating x86 instructions into IA-64, but this affected the performance of x86 programs so badly that it was rarely, if ever, actually useful to the users: programmers should rewrite x86 programs for the IA-64 architecture or their performance on Itanium would be orders of magnitude worse than on a true x86 processor. The market rejected the Itanium processor since it broke backward compatibility and preferred to continue using x86 chips, and very few programs were rewritten for IA-64.

AMD decided to take another path toward 64-bit memory addressing, making sure backward compatibility would not suffer. In April 2003, AMD released the first x86 processor with 64-bit general-purpose registers, the Opteron, capable of addressing much more than 4 GB of virtual memory using the new x86-64 extension (also known as AMD64 or x64). The 64-bit extensions to the x86 architecture were enabled only in the newly introduced long mode, therefore 32-bit and 16-bit applications and operating systems could simply continue using an AMD64 processor in protected or other modes, without even the slightest sacrifice of performance and with full compatibility back to the original instructions of the 16-bit Intel 8086. The market responded positively, adopting the 64-bit AMD processors for both high-performance applications and business or home computers.

Seeing the market rejecting the incompatible Itanium processor and Microsoft supporting AMD64, Intel had to respond and introduced its own x86-64 processor, the &quot;Prescott&quot; Pentium 4, in July 2004. As a result, the Itanium processor with its IA-64 instruction set is rarely used and x86, through its x86-64 incarnation, is still the dominant CPU architecture in non-embedded computers.

x86-64 also introduced the NX bit, which offers some protection against security bugs caused by buffer overruns.

As a result of AMD&#x27;s 64-bit contribution to the x86 lineage and its subsequent acceptance by Intel, the 64-bit RISC architectures ceased to be a threat to the x86 ecosystem and almost disappeared from the workstation market. x86-64 began to be utilized in powerful supercomputers (in its AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon incarnations), a market which was previously the natural habitat for 64-bit RISC designs (such as the IBM Power microprocessors or SPARC processors). The great leap toward 64-bit computing and the maintenance of backward compatibility with 32-bit and 16-bit software enabled the x86 architecture to become an extremely flexible platform today, with x86 chips being utilized from small low-power systems (for example, Intel Quark and Intel Atom) to fast gaming desktop computers (for example, Intel Core i7 and AMD FX/Ryzen), and even dominate large supercomputing clusters, effectively leaving only the ARM 32-bit and 64-bit RISC architecture as a competitor in the smartphone and tablet market.

===Virtualization===

Prior to 2005, x86 architecture processors were unable to meet the Popek and Goldberg requirements – a specification for virtualization created in 1974 by Gerald J. Popek and Robert P. Goldberg. However, both proprietary and open-source x86 virtualization hypervisor products were developed using software-based virtualization. Proprietary systems include Hyper-V, Parallels Workstation, VMware ESX, VMware Workstation, VMware Workstation Player and Windows Virtual PC, while free and open-source systems include QEMU, Kernel-based Virtual Machine, VirtualBox, and Xen.

The introduction of the AMD-V and Intel VT-x instruction sets in 2005 allowed x86 processors to meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.

===AES===
=== APX (Advanced Performance Extensions) ===
APX (Advanced Performance Extensions) are extensions to double the number of general-purpose registers from 16 to 32 and add new features to improve general-purpose performance. These extensions have been called &quot;generational&quot; and &quot;the biggest x86 addition since 64 bits&quot;. Intel contributed APX support to GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 14.

According to the architecture specification, the main features of APX are:

* 16 additional general-purpose registers, called the Extended GPRs (EGPRs)
* Three-operand instruction formats for many integer instructions
* New conditional instructions for loads, stores, and comparisons with common instructions that do not modify flags
* Optimized register save/restore operations
* A 64-bit absolute direct jump instruction

Extended GPRs for general purpose instructions are encoded using 2-byte REX2 prefix, while new instructions and extended operands for existing AVX/AVX2/AVX-512 instructions are encoded with extended EVEX prefix which has four variants used for different groups of instructions.

<doc id="34199" wikidata="Q191448" url="?curid=34199" title="Xiangqi">
<text>Xiangqi (; ), commonly known as Chinese chess or elephant chess, is a strategy board game for two players. It is the most popular board game in China. Xiangqi is in the same family of games as shogi, janggi, Western chess, chaturanga, and Indian chess. Besides China and areas with significant ethnic Chinese communities, this game is also a popular pastime in Vietnam, where it is known as , literally &#x27;General&#x27;s chess&#x27;, in contrast with Western chess or &quot;&quot;, literally &#x27;King&#x27;s chess&#x27;.

The game represents a battle between two armies, with the primary object being to checkmate the enemy&#x27;s general (king). Distinctive features of xiangqi include the cannon (&quot;pao&quot;), which must jump to capture; a rule prohibiting the generals from facing each other directly; areas on the board called the &quot;river&quot; and &quot;palace&quot;, which restrict the movement of some pieces but enhance that of others; and the placement of the pieces on the intersections of the board lines, rather than within the squares.
==Board==

Xiangqi is played on a board nine lines wide and ten lines long. As in the game Go (; &quot;or Wéi qí&quot; ), the pieces are placed on the intersections, which are known as &quot;points&quot;. The vertical lines are known as &quot;files&quot; (), and the horizontal lines are known as &quot;ranks&quot; ().

Centred at the first to third and eighth to tenth ranks of the board are two zones, each three points by three points, demarcated by two diagonal lines connecting opposite corners and intersecting at the centre point. Each of these areas is known as , a palace.

Dividing the two opposing sides, between the fifth and sixth ranks, is &quot;hé&quot;, the &quot;river&quot;. The river is usually marked with the phrases , meaning &quot;River of the Chu&quot;, and , meaning &quot;Border of the Han&quot;, a reference to the Chu–Han War. Although the river (or &quot;Hanchu boundary&quot;) provides a visual division between the two sides, only two pieces are affected by its presence: soldiers have an enhanced move after crossing the river, and elephants cannot cross it. The starting points of the soldiers and cannons are usually, but not always, marked with small crosses.

==Rules==
The pieces start in the position shown in the diagram above. Which player moves first has varied throughout history and from one part of China to another. Different xiangqi books advise either that the black or red side moves first. Some books refer to the two sides as north and south; which direction corresponds to which colour also varies from source to source. Generally, Red moves first in most modern tournaments.

Each player in turn moves one piece from the point it occupies, to another point. Pieces are generally not permitted to move through points occupied by other pieces, the exception being the cannon’s capturing move. A piece can be moved onto a point occupied by an enemy piece, in which case the enemy piece is captured and removed from the board. A player cannot capture one of their own pieces. Pieces are never promoted (converted into other pieces), although the soldier gains the ability to move sideways after it crosses the river. Almost all pieces capture using their normal moves, while the cannon has a special capture move described below.

The game ends when one player checkmates the other&#x27;s general. When the general is in danger of being captured by the enemy player on their next move, the enemy player has &quot;delivered a check&quot; (, abbreviated as ), and the general is &quot;in check&quot;. A check should be announced. If the general&#x27;s player can make no move to prevent the general&#x27;s capture, the situation is called &quot;checkmate&quot; (). Unlike in chess, in which stalemate is a draw, in xiangqi, it is a loss for the stalemated player.

In xiangqi, a player—often with a material or positional disadvantage—may attempt to check or chase pieces in a way such that the moves fall in a cycle, preventing the opponent from winning. While this is accepted in Western chess, in xiangqi, the following special rules are used to make it harder to draw the game by endless checking or chasing, regardless of whether the positions of the pieces are repeated or not:
* Perpetual checks with one piece or several pieces are not allowed; doing so results in a loss.
* Perpetual chases of any one unprotected piece with one or more pieces, excluding generals and soldiers, are similarly prohibited.
* If one side perpetually checks and the other side perpetually chases, the checking side has to stop or be ruled to have lost.
* When neither side violates the rules and both persist in not making an alternate move, the game can be ruled as a draw.
* When both sides violate the same rule at the same time (note that unlike in western chess, a mutual perpetual check is possible) and both persist in not making an alternate move, the game can be ruled as a draw.

Different sets of rules set different limits on what is considered perpetual. For example, club xiangqi rules allow a player to check or chase six consecutive times using one piece, twelve times using two pieces, and eighteen times using three pieces before considering the action perpetual.

The above rules to prevent perpetual checking and chasing, while popular, are not the only ones; there are numerous end game situations.

===Pieces===
Each player controls an army of 16 pieces; the armies are usually coloured red and black. Pieces are flat circular disks labelled or engraved with a Chinese character identifying the piece type, and in a colour indicating which player has ownership. The black pieces are marked with somewhat different characters from the corresponding red pieces.

Even in mainland China, most sets still use traditional Chinese characters (as opposed to simplified Chinese characters). Modern pieces are usually plastic, though some sets are wooden, and more expensive sets may use jade. In more ancient times, many sets were simple unpainted woodcarvings; thus, to distinguish between pieces of the two sides, most corresponding pieces used characters that were similar but varied slightly. This practice may have originated in situations where there was only one material available to make the pieces from and no colouring material available to distinguish the opposing armies. The oldest xiangqi piece found to date is a (chariot) piece. It is kept in the Three Gorges Museum.

====General====

Generals (or kings) are labelled 將 (trad.) / 将 (simp.) (&quot;general&quot;) on the black side and 帥 (trad.) / 帅 (simp.) (&quot;marshal&quot;) on the red side.

The general starts the game at the midpoint of the back edge, within the palace. The general may move and capture one point orthogonally and may not leave the palace, with the following exception.

If the two generals face each other along the same file with no intervening pieces, the 飛將 (&quot;flying general&quot;) move may be executed, in which the general to move crosses the board to capture the enemy general. In practice, this rule means that creating this situation in the first place means moving into check, and is therefore not allowed.

The Indian name &quot;king&quot; for this piece was changed to &quot;general&quot; because of Chinese naming taboos; China&#x27;s rulers objected to their royal titles being given to game pieces. Despite this, the general is sometimes called the &quot;king&quot; by English-speaking players, due to their similar functions as royal pieces.

====Advisor====

Advisors (also known as guards and less commonly as assistants, mandarins, ministers or warriors) are labelled 士 (&quot;scholar&quot;, &quot;gentleman&quot;, &quot;officer&quot;, &quot;guardian&quot;) for Black and 仕 (&quot;scholar&quot;, &quot;official&quot;, &quot;guardian&quot;) for Red. Rarely, sets use the character 士 for both colours.

The advisors start on either side of the general. They move and capture one point diagonally and may not leave the palace, which confines them to five points on the board. The advisor is probably derived from the mantri in chaturanga, like the queen in Western chess.

There is some controversy about whether &quot;士&quot; really is intended to mean &quot;scholar&quot;, &quot;gentleman&quot; which would be &quot;士人&quot;, or &quot;guard&quot;, &quot;guardian&quot; which would be &quot;衛士&quot; (simplified Chinese: 卫士). One argument for the latter is that their functionality seems to be to guard/protect the general. The common Western translation &quot;advisor&quot; does not reflect this layer of meaning.

====Elephant====

Elephants (or bishops) are labeled &quot;xiàng&quot; (&quot;elephant&quot;) for Black and 相 &quot;xiàng&quot; (&quot;minister&quot;) for Red. They are located next to the advisors. These pieces move and capture exactly two points diagonally and may not jump over intervening pieces; the move is described as being like the character 田 &quot;Tián&quot; (&quot;field&quot;), in reference to the board&#x27;s squares. Blocking an elephant with a diagonally adjacent piece is known as &quot;blocking the elephant&#x27;s eye&quot; ().

Elephants may not cross the river to attack the enemy general, and serve as defensive pieces. Because an elephant&#x27;s movement is restricted to just seven board positions, it can be easily trapped or threatened. The two elephants are often used to defend each other.

The Chinese characters for &quot;minister&quot; and &quot;elephant&quot; are homophones in Mandarin () and both have alternative meanings as &quot;appearance&quot; or &quot;image&quot;. However, in English, both are referred to as elephants, and less commonly as &quot;bishops&quot;, due to their similar movements.

====Horse====

Horses (or knights) are labelled 馬 for Black and 傌 &quot;mǎ&quot; for Red in sets marked with Traditional Chinese characters and 马 &quot;mǎ&quot; for both Black and Red in sets marked with Simplified Chinese characters. Some sets use 馬 for both colours. Horses begin the game next to the elephants, on their outside flanks. A horse moves and captures one point orthogonally and then one point diagonally away from its former position, a move which is traditionally described as being like the character 日 &quot;Rì&quot;. The horse does not jump as the knight does in Western chess, and can be blocked by a piece of either colour located one point horizontally or vertically adjacent to it. Blocking a horse is called &quot;hobbling the horse&#x27;s leg&quot; (蹩馬腿). The diagram on the right illustrates the horse&#x27;s movement.

Since horses can be blocked, and the path of a horse from one point to another is not the same as the reverse move, it is possible for one player&#x27;s horse to have an asymmetric attack advantage if an opponent&#x27;s horse is blocked, as seen in the diagram on the right.

The horse is sometimes called the &quot;knight&quot; by English-speaking players, due to their similar movements.

====Chariot====

Chariots (or rooks or cars) are labelled 車 for Black and 俥 for Red in sets marked with Traditional Chinese characters and 车 for both Black and Red in sets marked with Simplified Chinese characters. Some traditional sets use 車 for both colours. In the context of xiangqi, all of these characters are pronounced as (instead of the common pronunciation &quot;chē&quot;). The chariot moves and captures any distance orthogonally, but may not jump over intervening pieces. The chariots begin the game on the points at the corners of the board. The chariot is often considered to be the strongest piece in the game due to its freedom of movement and lack of restrictions.

The chariot is sometimes called the &quot;rook&quot; by English-speaking players, since it moves identically to the rook in Western chess. Chinese players (and others) often call this piece a car, since that is one modern meaning of the character 車.

====Cannon====

Cannons are labelled 砲 (&quot;catapult&quot;) for Black and &quot;pào&quot; (&quot;cannon&quot;) for Red. The names are homophones, though sometimes 炮 is used for both Red and Black. The 石 &quot;shí&quot; radical of 砲 means &quot;stone&quot;, and the 火 &quot;huǒ&quot; radical of 炮 means &quot;fire&quot;. Both colours&#x27; pieces are normally referred to as cannons in English. The black piece is sometimes labelled bāo.

Each player has two cannons, which start on the row behind the soldiers, two points in front of the horses. Cannons move like chariots, any distance orthogonally without jumping, but can only capture by jumping a single piece of either colour along the path of attack. The piece over which the cannon jumps is called the 炮臺 (trad.) / 炮台 (simp.) &quot;pào tái&quot; (&quot;cannon platform&quot; or &quot;screen&quot;). Any number of unoccupied spaces, including none, may exist between the cannon, screen, and the piece to be captured. Cannons can be exchanged for horses immediately from their starting positions.

====Soldier====

Soldiers (or pawns) are labelled 卒 (&quot;pawn&quot; or &quot;private&quot;) for Black and 兵 (&quot;soldier&quot;) for Red. Each side starts with five soldiers. Soldiers begin the game located on every other point one row back from the edge of the river. They move and capture by advancing one point. Once they have crossed the river, they may also move and capture one point horizontally. Soldiers cannot move backward, and therefore cannot retreat; after advancing to the last rank of the board, however, a soldier may still move sideways at the enemy&#x27;s edge. The soldier is sometimes called the &quot;pawn&quot; by English-speaking players, due to the pieces&#x27; similar movements.

==Approximate relative values of the pieces==


These approximate values do not take into account the position of the piece in question (except the soldier in a general sense), the positions of other pieces on the board, or the number of pieces remaining. In what follows, “minor piece” will refer to horses and cannons, and &quot;defensive piece&quot;, unless otherwise specified, will refer to the non-royal pieces that cannot cross the river, namely advisors and elephants.

Other common rules of assessment:
* A horse plus a cannon is generally better than two horses or two cannons.
* The chariot is not only the strongest piece, but it is also generally stronger than any combination of two minor pieces. When the relative values of both sides&#x27; pieces are approximately even, the side with more chariots generally has the advantage, especially when one side has a chariot and one side does not (Chinese: 有車壓無車). However, the chariot is not particularly strong in basic endgames: for example, chariot versus four defensive pieces is generally a draw, while if the offensive side instead has two horses or even three unadvanced soldiers it is a win.
* In the earlier stages, the cannon is stronger than the horse, because platforms are plentiful and the horse is often blocked by the multitude of pieces on the board. In the endgame, the horse is stronger as an attacking piece, not needing any platforms, but the cannon generally has better defensive abilities.
* The values of soldiers vary in different stages of the game. In the opening and the middlegame, the initiative and mobility of pieces often require sacrificing soldiers. In these stages, soldiers closer to the middle file are generally more valuable, since they can effectively join the offence. With few attacking pieces on the board, soldiers have more power and can cross the river more easily. In this stage, advanced soldiers are generally less powerful, since soldiers cannot move backward. In basic endgames, three soldiers starting on the seventh rank are approximately equal to a chariot: they can force a win against four defensive pieces or a horse/cannon plus two elephants, while instead a chariot cannot, and a chariot cannot force a win against three soldiers on the seventh rank when well-defended. At the other extreme, even five soldiers all on the tenth rank cannot on their own force checkmate or stalemate on a bare general due to insufficient material.

==Notation==
There are several types of notation used to record xiangqi games. In each case the moves are numbered and written with the same general pattern.

# (first move) (first response)
# (second move) (second response)

It is clearer but not required to write each move pair on a separate line.

===System 1===
The book &quot;The Chess of China&quot; describes a move notation method in which the ranks of the board are numbered 1 to 10 from closest to farthest away, followed by a digit 1 to 9 for files from right to left. Both values are relative to the moving player. Moves are then indicated as follows:

codice_1

Thus, the most common opening in the game would be written as:

# 炮 (32)–35 馬 (18)–37

===System 2===
A notation system partially described in &quot;A Manual of Chinese Chess&quot; and used by several computer software implementations describes moves in relative terms as follows:

codice_2

The file numbers are counted from each player&#x27;s right to each player&#x27;s left.

In case there are two identical pieces in one file, symbols + (front) and – (rear) are used instead of former file number. Direction of movement is indicated via an operator symbol. A plus sign is used to indicate forward movement. A minus sign is used to indicate backward movement. A dot or period or equals sign is used to indicate horizontal or lateral movement. For a piece that moves diagonally (such as the horse or elephant), the plus or minus sign is used rather than the period.

Thus, the most common opening in the game would be written as:

# C2.5 H8+7

According to World Xiangqi Federation (WXF), in the case of tripled, quadrupled, or quintupled soldiers (pawns), the S for soldier or P for pawn is omitted. Instead, the soldiers are numbered starting from the frontmost soldier, and this number replaces the usual piece abbreviation. The file number is given immediately after as usual. 

Thus the notation to move the middle of a set of tripled soldiers on the 5th file to the 4th file would be:

# 25=4

In older books written in Chinese the system is the same, except that: 
the names of the pieces are written in Chinese;
the name for the cannon on both sides is 炮;
the name for the horse on both sides is 馬;
forward motion is indicated with 進 (pronounced &quot;jìn&quot;); 
backward motion is indicated with 退 (&quot;tuì&quot;); 
sideways motion is indicated with 平 (&quot;píng&quot;);
and numbers are written in Chinese either for both players or for just Black.

Thus, the most common opening in the game might be written as:

# 炮二平五 馬8進7

===System 3===
This system is unofficial and principally used by Western players. It is similar to algebraic notation for Western chess. Letters are used for files and numbers for ranks. File &quot;a&quot; is on Red&#x27;s left and rank &quot;1&quot; is nearest to Red. A point&#x27;s designation does not depend on which player moves; for both sides &quot;a1&quot; is the lowest left point from Red&#x27;s side.

codice_3

Pieces are abbreviated as in notation system 2, except that no letter is used for the soldier.

Former position is only indicated if necessary to distinguish between two identical pieces that could have made the move. If they share the same file, indicate which rank moves; if they share the same rank, indicate which file moves. If they share neither rank nor file, then the file is indicated.

Capture is indicated by &quot;x&quot;. No symbol is used to indicate a non-capturing move.

Check is indicated by &quot;+&quot;, double check by &quot;++&quot;, triple check by &quot;+++&quot;, and quadruple check by &quot;++++&quot;. Checkmate is indicated by &quot;#&quot;.

For analysis purposes, bad moves are indicated by &quot;?&quot; and good moves by &quot;!&quot;. These can be combined if the analysis is uncertain (&quot;!?&quot; might be either but is probably good; &quot;?!&quot; is probably bad) or repeated for emphasis (&quot;??&quot; is a disaster).

Thus, the most common opening in the game would be written as:

# Che3 Hg8
=== Example ===
For example, the following game is tied with several others as the shortest possible xiangqi game (analogously to Fool&#x27;s Mate), written in each of the three notations:


System 1:
#炮(38)–37 砲(38)–33
#炮(37)–77 士(16)–25
#炮(77)–107
System 2:
#C8=7 C8=3
#C7+4 A6+5
#C7+3
System 3:
# Cbc3 Chc8
# Cxc7 Afe9??
# Cxc10#

Black is mated and therefore loses. Red&#x27;s cannon cannot be captured, and the advisor on e9 blocks both Black&#x27;s general from escaping there and the advisor on d10 from unbecoming a platform for the cannon.

==Gameplay==
Because of the size of the board and the low number of long-range pieces, there is a tendency for the battle to focus on a particular area of the board.

===Tactics===
Xiangqi involves several tactics common to games in the chess family. Some common ones are briefly discussed here.

* In a &quot;fork&quot;, one piece attacks two or more enemy pieces at once.
* A piece is &quot;pinned&quot; when it cannot move without exposing a more important piece to capture. Every piece except soldiers and advisors can pin, but only chariot pins exactly resemble pins in western chess; pins by other pieces in xiangqi take on many unique forms: Cannons can pin two pieces at once on one file or rank, horses can pin because they can be blocked, and generals can pin because of the &quot;flying general&quot; move rule. In pins by horses and elephants, the pinning piece never attacks the pinned piece, while in a pin by a cannon, only one of the pieces is directly attacked by the cannon. A general can only pin pieces to the enemy general, and the pinning general can never capture the pinned piece, since that would place it in check from the enemy general.
* A piece is &quot;skewered&quot; when it is attacked and, by moving, exposes a less important piece to be captured. In contrast to pins, only cannons and chariots can skewer.

* A &quot;discovered check&quot; occurs when an attacking piece moves so that it unblocks a line for a chariot, cannon, and/or horse to check the enemy general.
* A &quot;double check&quot; occurs when two pieces simultaneously threaten the enemy general. Unlike a Western chess double check, a double check in xiangqi may be blockable or, in one case, possibly met with a capture by a piece other than the general. The only blockable cases are either a chariot and cannon on the same file as the general, with the chariot acting as a screen for the cannon, two horses giving discovered check after another piece unblocks the attack from both, or a cannon using an enemy piece as a platform uncovered by a horse (see below). Double checks delivered by other means are not blockable. In one exceptional case, if a horse moves to give a double check by uncovering a cannon, and the cannon’s platform is an enemy chariot or defensive piece (advisor or elephant), the enemy chariot or defensive piece might be able to capture the horse, which removes the cannon’s platform at the same time. Otherwise, capturing either checking piece is insufficient to remove the threat, unless the general makes the capture.

* Unique to xiangqi is a &quot;triple check&quot;, which arises in four combinations. In the first case of a cannon, a chariot or soldier, and a horse, the horse moves to give check, uncovering a double check from the chariot and the cannon. In the second, rarer case of a chariot or soldier and two horses, the chariot moves to give check, uncovering a double check from the two horses. In the third case of two cannons and two horses, one cannon may uncover a double check from the horses and act as a screen for the other cannon. Finally, a chariot or soldier can move to give check, uncovering a check from a horse while acting as a platform for a cannon to give another check. &quot;Quadruple check&quot; is also possible, arising with two horses, a chariot, and a cannon. Triple and quadruple check cannot be blocked or met by captures (again, unless the general makes the capture).

In contrast to the ubiquity of pawn chains in western chess, soldiers typically do not support each other until the endgame, because from the initial position it takes a minimum of five moves of a soldier to allow mutual protection between two of them, and they are often prone to capture by other pieces.

Soldiers, horses, cannons and chariots can form up formations that protect each other. However, lining up chariots must be done with caution, as this risks losing one chariot to an enemy&#x27;s inferior piece. Horses that support each other are called Linked Horses (Chinese: 連環馬), which is a relatively safe formation of the horses, though it can still be threatened with a soldier, a chariot plus another minor piece, or a piece blocking one of the horses thus making the protection one-sided.

It is common to use cannons independently to control particular ranks and files. Using a cannon to control the middle file is often considered vital strategy, because it pins pieces such as the advisors and elephants to the general, which in turn restrict their general’s movement. The two files adjacent to the middle file are also considered important and horses and chariots can be used to push for checkmate there.

Since the general is usually safest in its original position before the endgame phase, attacking the general commonly involves forcing the general out of its original position with check or with threats. Thus, specific points and formations are very important in xiangqi.

For an attacking (Red) horse, the most fatal points are c9 and g9 (Chinese: 臥槽馬), especially since without proper defence a quick mate can follow with an extra chariot or cannon.
For a cannon, one of the most fatal formations is the exposed cannon (Chinese: 空心炮), where the cannon directly controls the middle file with no other pieces between the cannon and the general. This formation is particularly dangerous since the defensive side cannot move any piece in front of the cannon; while with an extra cannon joining the attack, mate can follow on the spot, and with an extra rook, the offensive side can mount a double check (with the rook in front of the cannon) followed by a windmill (as when the check is blocked, the rook moving laterally discovers a new check from the cannon), often winning at least a piece afterwards. If the defensive side cannot chase the cannon away or capture it, it must move the general forward to avoid these threats, leaving the general vulnerable to attacks.

Another fatal formation, called the &quot;cannon-controlled centroid horse&quot; (Chinese: 炮鎮窩心馬, diagram at right), also requires particularly bad coordination of the enemy pieces. In the diagram, Black&#x27;s &quot;centroid horse&quot; occupies the centre of the palace, blocking Black&#x27;s own general and advisors, and being pinned to the general by the red cannon, cannot move. Black&#x27;s cannon at e8 is also pinned to its own general; it too is unable to move and restricts the movement of Black&#x27;s two elephants, making them unable to protect each other. Such a formation in the middlegame often produces deadly threats of smothered mates, while in the endgame, as in the diagram, Red&#x27;s cannon cannot be chased away, rendering Black&#x27;s general, advisors, cannon on e8, and horse all permanently immobilized. Even though Black is up a minor piece, Red has a clear win: The game concluded 41.Hg7 (forking the elephant and pinned cannon and creating a mating threat) Eg10 42.Hh9 Ci9 43.Hf8+ Cf9 (if not for the other black cannon, it is instant mate) 44.Hxg6, and Black resigned: Black&#x27;s only active piece (the cannon on f9) is absolutely helpless to stop Red&#x27;s horse and soldiers, which will soon invade the palace.

A common defensive configuration is to leave the general at its starting position, deploy one advisor and one elephant on the two points directly in front of the general, and to leave the other advisor and elephant in their starting positions, to the side of the general. In this setup, the advisor and elephant pairs support each other, and the general is immune from attacks by cannons. Losing any defensive pieces makes the general vulnerable to cannon attack, and the setup may need to be abandoned. The defender may move defensive pieces away from the general, or even sacrifice them intentionally, to ward off attack by a cannon.
Long sequences of checks leading to mate or gain of material are common both in chess compositions and in actual play. A skilled xiangqi player would often have to calculate several steps, or even tens of steps ahead for a forced sequence. In the diagram on the right, Black has an immediate mating threat which cannot be parried, forcing Red to check Black on every move. Although it requires 11 moves to mate, its general idea is clear: Induce a smothered check by sacrificing a chariot at the centre of the palace (e9), then force Black to open the centre file, enabling the Red general to assist the attack, and finally mate by facing generals.
===Openings===
Since the left and right flanks of the starting setup are symmetrical, it is customary to make the first move on the right flank. Starting on the left flank is considered needlessly confusing.

The most common opening is to move the cannon to the central column, an opening known as 當頭炮 (trad.) / 当头炮 (simp.) &quot;dāng tóu pào&quot; or &quot;Central Cannon&quot;. The most common reply is to advance the horse on the same flank. Together, this move-and-response is known by the rhyme 當頭炮，馬來跳 (trad.) / 当头炮，马来跳 (simp.) . The notation for this is &quot;1. 炮 (32)–35, 馬 (18)–37&quot;, &quot;1. C2.5 H8+7&quot;, or &quot;1. Che3 Hg8&quot; (diagram at right). After Black&#x27;s 1. ...H8+7 (Hg8) response, the game can develop into a variety of openings, the most common being the 屏風馬 (trad.) / 屏风马 (simp.) or &quot;Screen Horses (Defence)&quot; in which Black develops the other horse to further protect their middle pawn (...H2+3 or ...Hc8) either immediately on their second move, or later when Black transposes the game into this opening.

Alternative common first moves by Black are developing either cannons (1. ...C8.5/1. ...Che8, or 1. ...C2.5/1. ...Cbe8); note that after either of these moves, taking the central soldier with the cannon (2. C5+4 or 2. Cxe7+) is a beginner&#x27;s trap that impedes development and coordination of Red&#x27;s pieces if Black plays correctly (for example, 1. Che3 Che8 2. Cxe7+?? Ade9 3. Hg3 Hg8 4. Ce5 Rh10 when Black develops the rook first, and the loss of Black&#x27;s middle pawn actually enabled Black&#x27;s horses to occupy the centre on the next moves).

Other common first moves by Red include moving an elephant to the central column (1. Ege3), advancing the soldier on the third or seventh file (1. c5), moving a horse forward (1. Hg3), and moving either cannon to the 4th or 6th (d- or f-) file (1. Chd3 or 1. Chf3). Compared to the Central Cannon openings, these openings are generally less restricted by theory.

General advice for the opening includes rapid development of at least one chariot and putting it on open files and ranks, as it is the most powerful piece with a long attack range. There is a saying that only a poor player does not move a chariot in the first three moves (Chinese: 三步不出車，必定要輸棋); however this is not to be taken literally, and is in fact often violated in modern Xiangqi games. Attacking and defending the centre, especially the central soldiers / central pawns, are common themes in the opening, hence the Central Cannon openings. Usually, at least one horse should be moved to the middle in order to defend the central soldier; however undefended central soldiers can also become &quot;poisoned pawns&quot; in the early moves, especially if the attacking side does not have an immediate follow-up to retain the pressure on the central file.

===Middlegame strategy===
Xiangqi strategy shares common themes with chess, but has some differences:
* Occupying the centre is relatively less important in xiangqi, but controlling and attacking the middle file is still one of the vital themes. Since the middle file is often well defended, players would then seek to mount an offense on either of the flanks on the enemy side, especially when the defense of one flank is neglected.
* The significance of pawn formation in xiangqi and chess are different. In xiangqi, soldiers (pawns) are often pushed to avoid blocking their own horses, and it is uncommon for them to defend each other (in contrast with a Western chess pawn chain). Successfully getting a soldier to cross a river as an attacking force can often tilt the scales of the middlegame by a large margin.
* In high-level play, the initiative is highly important, and a minor mistake can doom a game.
* Sacrifices are common in xiangqi, however they are more often tactical rather than positional. Usually, at most a minor piece is sacrificed for positional advantages, or a semi-tactical attack.

Like in chess, xiangqi piece values depend highly on the position on the board. The following study from Volume 42 of the Elegant Pastime Manual, dating from the Ming Dynasty, illustrates this dramatically. It is Red to play and win.

In this position, Red is up two soldiers and a cannon but Black threatens seemingly unstoppable mate with ...Rf1#, since 1.Ec5? Ad8! renews the mate threat. Note that the red chariot is nearly useless, having only two legal moves, in stark contrast to the very active black chariot. However, Red averts the checkmate by sacrificing both the cannon and chariot: 1.Ca10+!! Hxa10 2.Ea3! Rxa1 (or the chariot is lost, since the general protects the elephant on e3, which in turn guards g1, and the red horse guards e2) 3.Eec1:

Despite the substantial sacrifice of material by Red, Black&#x27;s chariot has now become useless as it is permanently immobilized by the red elephants and horse; the red general prevents the black soldier on g2 from moving laterally to free the chariot (for example 3...g1 4.Gf2). Black&#x27;s horse similarly has no safe move due to the red soldier on c8, which also, along with the soldier on f9, prevents the black general from attacking the soldier on f9 from the behind. In addition, the black soldier on g6 is undefended and has no safe move, so Red can win it by pushing the soldier on c4 to c6 and moving it laterally to the g-file, after which the position is effectively an endgame of three soldiers against two advisers, an easy win for Red (see below) despite being down a chariot for three soldiers.

===Endgame===
Though xiangqi endgames require remarkable skill to be played well, there are a number of widely known book wins and book draws. Without a counterpart to pawn promotion, xiangqi endgames instead focus more directly on forcing checkmate or stalemate, and in this regard resemble pawnless chess endgames. Since stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player instead of a draw, most book draws in xiangqi are due to fortresses, with a few draws due to insufficient material.

A general rule in xiangqi endgames for the advantageous side is that, when there&#x27;s less material on the board, do not trade pieces easily, as with fewer attacking pieces on the board, defending is easier (in contrast to Western chess, where it is almost always advantageous to trade pieces when up on material). Hence, if a certain type of endgame can transpose, by trading pieces, into another type of endgame which is a book win, then this endgame itself is a book win.

====Zugzwang in xiangqi endgames====

Inducing zugzwang is a crucial theme in winning simple endgames, and almost exclusively in simple endgames. In the general + soldier vs general endgame shown on the right, Red&#x27;s first main goal is to occupy the middle file. Red wins with 1. Gd1, a waiting move, and Black is in zugzwang. Black must proceed with 1. ...Ge8, as 1. ...Ge10 instantly loses after 2. f9#. After 1. ...Ge8 2. f9 Gf8 3. e9 Ge8 4. d9 Gf8 5. Ge1, Red&#x27;s general successfully occupies the middle file. The game would conclude with 5. ...Gf9 6. e9+, and regardless of Black&#x27;s reply, 7. Ge2# (stale)mates Black.
Reciprocal zugzwang is possible, but very rare and usually seen in endgame compositions. In this endgame shown on the right, whoever moves loses, since when either of the two generals moves to an open d- or f- file, it threatens unstoppable mate, while the player to move only helps the enemy general occupy one of the files. For instance, Red can only move their two soldiers if he is to move. Moving the f-(or d-)soldier allows the enemy general to occupy the f-file(d-file). Even if 1. fe9+ Gf10 2. d10, when Red threatens mate in 1, Black still mates immediately with either 2. ...fe2# or 2. ...f1#.
====Soldier (pawn) endgames====

* A soldier, as long as it does not reach the opposite rank, wins against a bare general easily. With any extra defensive piece on the defensive side, it is a draw; however, soldier vs advisor requires skill to play well. Any number of soldiers on the opposing back rank are also a draw due to insufficient material.
* Two unadvanced (i.e., on the 6th or 7th ranks) soldiers win against the following combinations: Two advisors, two elephants, a bare horse/cannon. Generally a draw against one advisor plus one elephant, or a horse/cannon plus a defending piece.
* Three unadvanced soldiers win against the following combinations: All 4 defensive pieces (2 advisors plus 2 elephants, Chinese: 士象全), a horse plus two advisors/two elephants, a cannon plus two elephants.
====Horse endgames====
* A bare horse wins against a bare advisor, but not a bare elephant.
* A horse plus an unadvanced soldier wins against both combinations of 3 defensive pieces, or any combination of a minor piece plus a defensive piece except horse + elephant. This combination draws against all 4 defensive pieces.
* A horse plus an advanced soldier(on the 8th or 9th rank) draws against either combination of 3 defensive pieces, but defending requires precise positions.
* A horse plus a soldier on the 10th rank wins against two advisors, or one advisor plus one elephant. This combination draws against 2 elephants.
* A horse plus two soldiers can win against one minor piece + one advisor + two elephants. With an extra advisor on the defensive side, it is a book draw.
* Two horses win against all 4 defensive pieces, or any combination of a minor piece plus 2 defensive pieces except cannon + 2 elephants.
====Cannon endgames====
* A bare cannon, or a cannon with elephants, cannot win against a bare general due to insufficient material. Cannons without other offensive pieces need defensive pieces to act as platforms, especially the advisor, since the advisor can act as a platform on any of the three central files, while an elephant can only act as a platform on the centermost file.
* A cannon needs only one advisor to win against two advisors, or a single elephant. Meanwhile, even with all 4 defensive pieces, it is a book draw against two elephants, one advisor + one elephant, one soldier + one advisor, or any minor piece.
* A cannon with all 4 defensive pieces needs at least an extra soldier to win against 4 defensive pieces. A bare cannon with a soldier on the 6th rank wins against any combination of 2 defensive pieces.
* A cannon + 4 defensive pieces + 2 unadvanced soldiers generally draw against one minor piece + 4 defensive pieces. But if the defensive side lacks a single piece, it is a book win.
====Horse+Cannon endgames====
This type of endgame is considered one of the more complex endgames. Commonly known book wins and book draws are:
* Horse + Cannon + 4 defensive pieces vs a minor piece vs 4 defensive pieces: A win if the minor piece is a horse (the attacking side does not need all 4 defensive pieces to win), a draw if it is a cannon.
* With the same combination of the two minor pieces and all 4 defensive pieces on both sides, one needs two extra soldiers for a book win.
* If both sides have 2 minor pieces and 4 defensive pieces, and the advantegeous side only has one extra soldier, then regardless of the combination of the two minor pieces, it is a book draw.
====Chariot endgames====

Single chariot endgames:
* A single chariot generally cannot win against 4 defensive pieces, but with 3 or fewer defensive pieces, it is a forced win.
* Chariot vs one minor piece plus 2 defensive pieces: A win if the 2 defensive pieces are not the same, or if the combination is horse + two advisors. If the defensive side has horse + two elephants, a specific fortress is required to draw.
* Chariot vs one minor piece plus 3 defensive pieces: A draw.
* Chariot vs two minor pieces with no defensive pieces: A draw, but requires good defensive positions.
Chariot + soldiers (unadvanced):
* Chariot + soldier, with sufficient defensive pieces on their own side, wins against a chariot plus an advisor, a chariot plus two elephants, or a chariot plus a soldier.
* Chariot + soldier wins against any 2 minor pieces + 2 advisors. This combination also wins against horse + 4 defensive pieces, but not cannon + 4 defensive pieces.
* Chariot + soldier vs 2 unadvanced soldiers + 4 defensive pieces: If the offensive side has no defensive piece, it is a draw since the 2 enemy soldiers can still be a formidable force. If the offensive side has one advisor, it is a win.
* Chariot + 2 soldiers cannot force a win against chariot + 4 defensive pieces. In this endgame, both attacking and defending require great skill.
Chariot + horse:
* A chariot plus a horse needs one advisor on their own side to win against a chariot plus two advisors.
* Chariot + horse vs chariot + two elephants: With enough defensive pieces for the attacking side, it is generally a win if the move limit is not taken into consideration.
Chariot + cannon:
* A chariot plus a cannon cannot win against a bare chariot, as long as the defending chariot occupies the middle file. However, with any extra defensive piece on the attacking side, it is a win.
* Chariot + cannon + 2 advisors would win against chariot + two elephants.
* Chariot + cannon + 4 defensive pieces vs chariot + 4 defensive pieces: Draw.
Two chariots:
* Two chariots vs chariot + 4 defensive pieces: A draw with good defensive positions.
* Two chariots vs chariot + minor piece + 2 defensive pieces: The only drawing combination is chariot + cannon + 2 advisors.
* Two chariots vs 2 minor pieces + 4 defensive pieces: A win if the 2 minor pieces are 2 horses.

==History==
A game called &quot;xiangqi&quot; was mentioned as dating to the Warring States period; according to the first-century-BC text &quot;Shuo Yuan&quot; (說苑/说苑), it was one of Lord Mengchang of Qi&#x27;s interests. However, the rules of that game are not described, and it was not necessarily related to the present-day game. Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou wrote a book in AD 569 called &quot;Xiang Jing&quot;. It described the rules of an astronomically themed game called &quot;xiangxi&quot; (). Ancient reports state that &quot;the pieces ... were called after the sun, the moon, the planets and the star-houses&quot;, in contrast with modern xiangqi. In addition, there are mentions of shuffling of pieces, which does not occur in xiangqi either. For these reasons, Murray argued that &quot;in China [chess] took over the board and name of a game called 象棋 in the sense of &#x27;Astronomical Game&#x27;, which represented the apparent movements of naked-eye-visible astronomical objects in the night sky, and that the earliest Chinese references to 象棋 meant the Astronomical Game and not Chinese chess&quot;. Previous games called xiàngqí may have been based on the movements of sky objects. In contrast, present-day xiangqi developed from Indian chaturanga according to Murray; this is also the predominant opinion among historians.

Some Sinologists and Chinese historians prefer an alternative hypothesis, according to which xiangqi originated in China and then spread westwards, giving rise to Indian and Persian chess. Specifically, it has been claimed that Xiangqi arose during the Warring States period and was patterned after the array of troops at the time. David H. Li, for example, argues that the game was developed by Han Xin in the winter of 204–203 BC to prepare for an upcoming battle. His theories, however, have been questioned by other chess researchers. The earliest description of the game&#x27;s rules appears in the story &quot;Cén Shùn&quot; (岑順) in the collection &quot;Xuanguai lu&quot; (玄怪錄), written by Niu Sengru in the middle part of the Tang dynasty.

Xiangqi is the same as it is today from Southern Song dynasty.

Janggi of the Korean Peninsula originated from xiangqi.

With the popularization of xiangqi, many different schools of circles and players came into prominence, many books and manuals on the techniques of playing the game were also published, they played an important role in popularizing xiangqi and improving the techniques of play in modern times. With the economic and cultural development during the Qing dynasty, xiangqi entered a new stage. A Western-style &quot;Encyclopedia of Chinese Chess Openings&quot; was written in 2004. 
==Modern play==
===Tournaments and leagues===
Although xiangqi has its origin in Asia, there are xiangqi leagues and clubs all over the world. Each European nation generally has its own governing league; for example, in Britain, xiangqi is regulated by the United Kingdom Chinese Chess Association. Asian countries also have nationwide leagues, such as the Malaysia Chinese Chess Association.

In addition, there are several international federations and tournaments. The Chinese Xiangqi Association hosts several tournaments every year, including the Yin Li and Ram Cup Tournaments. Other organizations include the Asian Xiangqi Federation and a World Xiangqi Federation, which hosts tournaments and competitions bi-annually, with most limited to players from member nations.

There are Europeanized versions of boards (10 × 9) and figures of xiangqi.

===Rankings===
The Asian Xiangqi Federation (AXF) and its corresponding member associations rank players in a format similar to the Elo rating system of chess. According to the XiangQi DataBase, the top-ranking female and male players in China, as of June 2012, were Tang Dan and Jiang Chuan, with ratings of 2529 and 2667, respectively. Other strong players include Zhao GuanFang (female), Xu Yinchuan (male), Lu Qin (male), and Wang LinNa (female).

The Asian Xiangqi Federation also bestows the title of grandmaster to select individuals around the world who have excelled at xiangqi or made special contributions to the game. There are no specific criteria for becoming a grandmaster and there are only approximately 100 grandmasters as of 2020. The titles of grandmaster is bestowed by bodies such as the AXF and the Chinese Xiangqi Association (CXA).

===Computers===
The game-tree complexity of xiangqi is approximately 10150; in 2004 it was projected that a human top player would be defeated before 2010. Xiangqi is one of the more popular computer-versus-computer competitions at the Computer Olympiads.

Computer programs for playing xiangqi show the same development trend as has occurred for international chess: they are usually console applications (called engines) which communicate their moves in text form through some standard protocol. For displaying the board graphically, they then rely on a separate graphical user interface (GUI). Through such standardization, many different engines can be used through the same GUI, which can also be used for automated play of different engines against each other. Popular protocols are UCI (Universal Chess Interface), UCCI (Universal Chinese Chess Interface), Qianhong (QH) protocol, and WinBoard/XBoard (WB) protocol (the latter two named after the GUIs that implemented them). There now exist many dozens of xiangqi engines supporting one or more of these protocols, including some commercial engines.

==Variations==
Blitz chess Each player only has around 5–10 minutes each.

Manchu chess&lt;br&gt;Invented during the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. Red horses, cannons, and one of the chariots are absent, but the remaining chariot can be played as horses and cannons as well.

Supply chess Similar to the Western chess variant Bughouse chess, this variant features the ability to re-deploy captured pieces, similar to a rule in shogi. Four players play as two-person teams in two side-by-side games. One teammate plays Black and other plays Red. Any piece obtained by capturing the opponent&#x27;s piece is given to the teammate for use in the other game. These pieces can be deployed by the teammate to give him an advantage over the other player, so long as the piece starts on the player&#x27;s own side of the board and does not cause the opponent to be in check.

Formation Similar to Fischer Random Chess, one player&#x27;s pieces are placed randomly on one side of the river, except for the generals and advisors, which must be at their usual positions, and the elephants, which must start at two of the seven points they can normally reach. The other player&#x27;s pieces are set up to mirror the first&#x27;s. All other rules are the same.

Banqi This variation is more well known in Hong Kong than in mainland China. It uses the xiangqi pieces and board, but does not follow any of its rules, bearing more of a resemblance to the Western game Stratego as well as the Chinese game Luzhanqi.

==Variations played with special boards or pieces==
There are many versions of three-player xiangqi, or &quot;san xiangqui&quot;, all played on special boards.

San Guo Qi &quot;Game of the Three Kingdoms&quot; is played on a special hexagonal board with three xiangqi armies (red, blue, and green) vying for dominance. A Y-shaped river divides the board into three gem-shaped territories, each containing the grid found on one side of a xiangqi board, but distorted to make the game playable by three people. Each player has eighteen pieces: the sixteen of regular xiangqi, plus two new ones that stand on the same rank as the cannons. The new pieces have different names depending on their side: &quot;huo&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;) for Red, &quot;qi&quot; (&quot;flag&quot;) for Blue, and &quot;feng&quot; (&quot;wind&quot;) for Green. They move two spaces orthogonally, then one space diagonally. The generals each bear the name of a historical Chinese kingdom—Shu for Red, Wei for Blue, and Wu for Green—from China&#x27;s Three Kingdoms period. It is likely that San Guo Qi first appeared under the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279).

San You Qi &quot;Three Friends Chess&quot; was invented by Zheng Jinde from Shexian in the Anhui province during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty (1661–1722). It is played on a Y-shaped board with a full army of xiangqi pieces set up at the end of each of the board&#x27;s three wide radii. In the centre of the board sits a triangular zone with certain features, such as ocean, mountain, or city walls, each of which is impassable by certain pieces. Two of an army&#x27;s five soldiers are replaced by new pieces called &quot;huo&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;) pieces, which move one space diagonally forward. Two &quot;qi&quot; (&quot;flag&quot;) pieces are positioned on the front corners of the palace; they move two spaces forward inside their own camp, and then one space in any direction inside an enemy camp.

Sanrenqi &quot;Three Men Chess&quot; is a riverless, commercial variant played on a cross-shaped board with some special rules, including a fourth, neutral country called &quot;Han.&quot; Han has three Chariots, one Cannon, and one General named &quot;Emperor Xian of Han&quot;, but these pieces do not move and do not belong to any of the players until a certain point in the game when two players team up against the third player. At that point the third player gets to also control Han.

Si Guo Qi &quot;Four Kingdoms Chess&quot; is also played on a riverless, cross-shaped board, but with four players. Because there are no rivers, elephants may move about the board freely.

Qi Guo Xiang Qi &quot;Game of the Seven Kingdoms&quot; is based symbolically on the Warring States Period.

==In Unicode==
Xiangqi pieces were added to Unicode version 11.0 in June 2018. They are assigned to the codepoints U+1FA60–U+1FA6D in the Chess Symbols block. For legibility, the red pieces are filled white, while black pieces are filled black.

<text>XFS is a high-performance 64-bit journaling file system created by Silicon Graphics, Inc (SGI) in 1993. It was the default file system in SGI&#x27;s IRIX operating system starting with its version 5.3. XFS was ported to the Linux kernel in 2001; as of June 2014, XFS is supported by most Linux distributions; Red Hat Enterprise Linux uses it as its default file system.

XFS excels in the execution of parallel input/output (I/O) operations due to its design, which is based on allocation groups (a type of subdivision of the physical volumes in which XFS is used- also shortened to &quot;AGs&quot;). Because of this, XFS enables extreme scalability of I/O threads, file system bandwidth, and size of files and of the file system itself when spanning multiple physical storage devices. XFS ensures the consistency of data by employing metadata journaling and supporting write barriers. Space allocation is performed via extents with data structures stored in B+ trees, improving the overall performance of the file system, especially when handling large files. Delayed allocation assists in the prevention of file system fragmentation; online defragmentation is also supported.

==History==
=== First generation XFS ===
Silicon Graphics began development of XFS (&quot;X&quot; was meant to be filled in later but never was) in 1993 for its UNIX System V based IRIX operating system. The file system was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in May 1999.

=== Second generation XFS ===
A team led by Steve Lord at SGI ported XFS to Linux, and first support by a Linux distribution came in 2001. This support gradually became available in almost all Linux distributions.

Initial support for XFS in the Linux kernel came through patches from SGI. It merged into the Linux kernel mainline for the 2.6 series, and separately merged in February 2004 into the 2.4 series in version 2.4.25, making XFS almost universally available on Linux systems. Gentoo Linux became the first Linux distribution to introduce an option for XFS as the default filesystem in mid-2002.

FreeBSD added read-only support for XFS in December 2005, and in June 2006 introduced experimental write support. However, this was intended only as an aid in migration from Linux, not as a &quot;main&quot; file system. FreeBSD 10 removed support for XFS.

In 2009, version 5.4 of 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Linux distribution contained the necessary kernel support for the creation and usage of XFS file systems, but lacked the corresponding command-line tools. The tools available from CentOS could operate for that purpose, and Red Hat also provided them to RHEL customers on request. RHEL 6.0, released in 2010, includes XFS support for a fee as part of Red Hat&#x27;s &quot;scalable file system add-on&quot;. Oracle Linux 6, released in 2011, also includes an option for using XFS.

RHEL 7.0, released in June 2014, uses XFS as its default file system, including support for using XFS for the codice_1 partition, which previously was not practical due to bugs in the GRUB bootloader.

Linux kernel 4.8 in August 2016 added a new feature, &quot;reverse mapping&quot;. This is the foundation for a large set of planned features: snapshots, copy-on-write (COW) data, data deduplication, reflink copies, online data and metadata scrubbing, highly accurate reporting of data loss or bad sectors, and significantly improved reconstruction of damaged or corrupted filesystems. This work required changes to XFS&#x27;s on-disk format.

=== Third generation XFS===

Linux kernel 5.10, released in December 2020, included the new on-disk format XFS v5. This was a hard break, since the deprecated XFS v4 can not be converted to XFS v5. Data on partitions formatted with XFS v4 has to be backed up to another partition or media in order to restore it after formatting the old partition with XFS v5, which completely wipes all data on it. The support for XFS v4 will be removed from the Linux kernel in September 2030.

XFS v5 introduced &quot;bigtime&quot;, to store inode timestamps as a 64-bit nanosecond counter instead of the traditional 32-bit seconds counter. This postpones the previous Year 2038 problem until the year 2486. It also introduced metadata checksums.

The Gentoo Handbook, Gentoo Linux&#x27;s official installation manual, has recommended XFS as the &quot;all-purpose all-platform filesystem&quot; since 28 Jun 2023, succeeding Ext4.

==Features==

===Capacity===
XFS is a 64-bit file system and supports a maximum file system size of 8 exbibytes minus one byte (263 − 1 bytes), but limitations imposed by the host operating system can decrease this limit. 32-bit Linux systems limit the size of both the file and file system to 16 tebibytes.

===Journaling===
In modern computing, journaling is a capability which ensures consistency of data in the file system, despite any power outages or system crash that may occur. XFS provides journaling for file system metadata, where file system updates are first written to a serial journal before the actual disk blocks are updated. The journal is a circular buffer of disk blocks that is not read in normal file system operation.

The XFS journal can be stored within the data section of the file system (as an internal log), or on a separate device to minimize disk contention.

In XFS, the journal primarily contains entries that describe the portions of the disk blocks changed by filesystem operations. Journal updates are performed asynchronously to avoid a decrease in performance speed.

In the event of a system crash, file system operations which occurred immediately prior to the crash can be reapplied and completed as recorded in the journal, which is how data stored in XFS file systems remain consistent. Recovery is performed automatically the first time the file system is mounted after the crash. The speed of recovery is independent of the size of the file system, instead depending on the amount of file system operations to be reapplied.

===Allocation groups===
XFS file systems are internally partitioned into &quot;allocation groups&quot;, which are equally sized linear regions within the file system. Files and directories can span allocation groups. Each allocation group manages its own inodes and free space separately, providing scalability and parallelism so multiple threads and processes can perform I/O operations on the same file system simultaneously.

This architecture helps to optimize parallel I/O performance on systems with multiple processors and/or cores, as metadata updates can also be parallelized. The internal partitioning provided by allocation groups can be especially beneficial when the file system spans multiple physical devices, allowing optimal usage of throughput of the underlying storage components.

===Striped allocation===
If an XFS file system is to be created on a striped RAID array, a &quot;stripe unit&quot; can be specified when the file system is created. This maximizes throughput by ensuring that data allocations, inode allocations and the internal log (the journal) are aligned with the stripe unit.

===Extent-based allocation===
Blocks used in files stored on XFS file systems are managed with variable length extents where one extent describes one or more contiguous blocks. This can shorten the list of blocks considerably, compared to file systems that list all blocks used by a file individually.

Block-oriented file systems manage space allocation with one or more block-oriented bitmaps; in XFS, these structures are replaced with an extent oriented structure consisting of a pair of B+ trees for each file system allocation group. One of the B+ trees is indexed by the length of the free extents, while the other is indexed by the starting block of the free extents. This dual indexing scheme allows for the highly efficient allocation of free extents for file system operations.

===Variable block sizes===
The file system block size represents the minimum allocation unit. XFS allows file systems to be created with block sizes ranging between 512 bytes and 64 KB, allowing the file system to be tuned for the expected degree of usage. When many small files are expected, a small block size would typically maximize capacity, but for a system dealing mainly with large files, a larger block size can provide a performance efficiency advantage.

===Delayed allocation===
XFS makes use of lazy evaluation techniques for file allocation. When a file is written to the buffer cache, rather than allocating extents for the data, XFS simply reserves the appropriate number of file system blocks for the data held in memory. The actual block allocation occurs only when the data is finally flushed to disk. This improves the chance that the file will be written in a contiguous group of blocks, reducing fragmentation problems and increasing performance.

===Sparse files===
XFS provides a 64-bit sparse address space for each file, which allows both for very large file sizes, and for &quot;holes&quot; within files in which no disk space is allocated. As the file system uses an extent map for each file, the file allocation map size is kept small. Where the size of the allocation map is too large for it to be stored within the inode, the map is moved into a B+ tree which allows for rapid access to data anywhere in the 64-bit address space provided for the file.

===Extended attributes===
XFS provides multiple data streams for files; this is made possible by its implementation of extended attributes. These allow the storage of a number of name/value pairs attached to a file. Names are nul-terminated printable character strings which are up to 256 bytes in length, while their associated values can contain up to 64 KB of binary data.

They are further subdivided into two namespaces: codice_2 and codice_3. Extended attributes stored in the root namespace can be modified only by the superuser, while attributes in the user namespace can be modified by any user with permission to write to the file.

Extended attributes can be attached to any kind of XFS inode, including symbolic links, device nodes, directories, etc. The codice_4 utility can be used to manipulate extended attributes from the command line, and the codice_5 and codice_6 utilities are aware of extended attributes, and will back up and restore their contents. Many other backup systems do not support working with extended attributes.

===Direct I/O===
For applications requiring high throughput to disk, XFS provides a direct I/O implementation that allows non-cached I/O operations to be applied directly to the userspace. Data is transferred between the buffer of the application and the disk using DMA, which allows access to the full I/O bandwidth of the underlying disk devices.

===Snapshots===
XFS does not yet provide direct support for snapshots, as it currently expects the snapshot process to be implemented by the volume manager. Taking a snapshot of an XFS filesystem involves temporarily halting I/O to the filesystem using the codice_7 utility, having the volume manager perform the actual snapshot, and then resuming I/O to continue with normal operations. The snapshot can then be mounted read-only for backup purposes.

Releases of XFS in IRIX incorporated an integrated volume manager called XLV. This volume manager has not been ported to Linux, and XFS works with standard LVM in Linux systems instead.

In recent Linux kernels, the codice_7 functionality is implemented in the VFS layer, and is executed automatically when the Volume Manager&#x27;s snapshot functionality is invoked. This was once a valuable advantage as the ext3 file system could not be suspended and the volume manager was unable to create a consistent &quot;hot&quot; snapshot to back up a heavily busy database. Fortunately this is no longer the case. Since Linux 2.6.29, the file systems ext3, ext4, GFS2 and JFS have the freeze feature as well.

===Online defragmentation===
Although the extent-based nature of XFS and the delayed allocation strategy it uses significantly improves the file system&#x27;s resistance to fragmentation problems, XFS provides a filesystem defragmentation utility (codice_9, short for XFS filesystem reorganizer) that can defragment the files on a mounted and active XFS filesystem.

===Online growth===
XFS provides the codice_10 utility to perform online expansion of XFS file systems. XFS filesystems can be grown so long as there is remaining unallocated space on the device holding the filesystem. This feature is typically used in conjunction with volume management, as otherwise the partition holding the filesystem will need enlarging separately.

===IRIX-only features===

====DMAPI====
XFS implemented the DMAPI interface to support Hierarchical Storage Management in IRIX. As of October 2010, the Linux implementation of XFS supported the required on-disk metadata for DMAPI implementation, but the kernel support was reportedly not usable. For some time, SGI hosted a kernel tree which included the DMAPI hooks, but this support has not been adequately maintained, although kernel developers have stated an intention to bring this support up to date.

====Guaranteed-rate I/O====
The XFS guaranteed-rate I/O system provides an API that allows applications to reserve bandwidth to the filesystem. XFS dynamically calculates the performance available from the underlying storage devices, and will reserve bandwidth sufficient to meet the requested performance for a specified time. This is a feature unique to the XFS file system. Guaranteed rates can be &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;soft&quot;, representing a trade off between reliability and performance; however, XFS will only allow &quot;hard&quot; guarantees if the underlying storage subsystem supports it. This facility is used mostly for real-time applications, such as video streaming.

Guaranteed-rate I/O was only supported under IRIX, and required special hardware for that purpose.

==Disadvantages==
* XFS filesystems cannot () be shrunk in place, although several possible workarounds have been discussed.

* Journaling cannot be disabled. However, XFS can write to an external journal on a separate block device instead.

===Historic Disadvantages===
* Metadata operations in XFS were slower compared to journaling file systems implemented later and designed to work with much larger logs resulting in, for example, slower performance with operations such as deletions of large numbers of files. However, a new XFS feature implemented by Dave Chinner and called &quot;delayed logging&quot;, available since version 2.6.39 of the Linux kernel mainline, is said to resolve this; performance benchmarks done by the developer in 2010 revealed performance levels to be similar to ext4 at low thread counts, and superior at high thread counts.
