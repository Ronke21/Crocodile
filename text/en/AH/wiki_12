<text>The Zilog Z80 is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Zilog that played an important role in the evolution of early computing. Launched in 1976, it was designed to be software-compatible with the Intel 8080, offering a compelling alternative due to its better integration and increased performance. In addition to the 8080&#x27;s seven registers and flags register, the Z80 featured an alternate register set, two 16-bit index registers, and additional instructions, including bit manipulation and block copy/search.

Originally intended for use in embedded systems like the 8080, the Z80’s combination of compatibility, affordability, and superior performance led to widespread adoption in video game systems and home computers throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, helping to fuel the personal computing revolution. The Z80 was used in iconic products such as the Osborne 1, Radio Shack TRS-80, ColecoVision, ZX Spectrum, Sega&#x27;s Master System and the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; arcade cabinet. It continued to be utilized in portable devices, including the Game Gear and the TI-83 series of graphing calculators.

The Z80 was the brainchild of Federico Faggin, a key figure behind the creation of the Intel 8080. After leaving Intel in 1974, Faggin co-founded Zilog with Ralph Ungermann. The Z80 was released in July 1976. With the revenue from the Z80, the company built its own chip factories. Zilog licensed the Z80 to the US-based Synertek and Mostek, which assisted with initial production, as well as to a European second-source manufacturer SGS. The design was also copied by various Japanese, Eastern European, and Soviet manufacturers, gaining global market acceptance as major companies like NEC, Toshiba, Sharp, and Hitachi produced their own versions or compatible clones of the Z80.

The Z80 remained in use in embedded systems for decades after its introduction, with ongoing improvements. The latest iteration, the eZ80, was introduced in 2001 and continues to be available for purchase. Zilog announced the discontinuation of the Z80 in April 2024 and officially ceased production in June 2024, after nearly five decades.

== History ==


=== Early history ===
At Fairchild Semiconductor, and later at Intel, physicist and engineer Federico Faggin had been working on fundamental transistor and semiconductor manufacturing technology. He also developed the basic design methodology used for memories and microprocessors at Intel and led the work on the Intel 4004, the Intel 8080 and several other ICs. Masatoshi Shima was the principal logic and transistor-level designer of the 4004 and the 8080 under Faggin&#x27;s supervision, while Ralph Ungermann was in charge of custom integrated circuit design.

In early 1974, Intel viewed their microprocessors not so much as products to be sold on their own but as a way to sell more of their main products, static RAM and ROM. A reorganization placed many of the formerly independent sections under the direction of Les Vadasz, further diluting the microprocessor&#x27;s place in the company. That year, the 1973–1975 recession reached a peak and Intel laid off a number of employees. All of this led to Faggin becoming restless, and he invited Ungermann out for drinks and asked if he would be interested in starting their own company. Ungermann immediately agreed, and as he had less to do at Intel, left in August or September, followed by Faggin, whose last day at Intel was Halloween 1974. When Shima heard, he asked to come to the new company as well, but having no actual product design or money, they told him to wait.

The newly formed and unnamed company initially began designing a single-chip microcontroller called the 2001. They met with Synertek to discuss fabrication on their lines, and when Faggin began to understand the costs involved it became clear that a low-cost product like this would not be able to compete with a design from a company with its own production lines, like Intel. They then began considering a more complex microprocessor instead, initially known as the Super 80, with the main feature being its use of a +5 V bus instead of the more common −5, +5 and 12 V used by designs like the 8080. The new design was intended to be compatible with the 8080, but add many of the nice features of the Motorola 6800, including index registers and improved interrupts.

=== Exxon investment, detailed development begins ===
While still being set up, the industry newsletter &quot;Electronic News&quot; heard of them and published a story on the newly formed company. This attracted the attention of Exxon Enterprises, Exxon&#x27;s high-tech investment arm. At the time, in the midst of the recession, there was very little venture capital available, with a total of $10 million for the entire industry being spent in all of 1975 (equivalent to $ million in ). Someone from Exxon contacted the still-unnamed company, and arranged a meeting that eventually led to them providing an initial $500,000 funding in June 1975 (equivalent to $ million in ).

With funding being discussed, and a design to be built, Shima joined in February 1975. Shima immediately set about producing a high-level design, adding several concepts of his own. In particular, he used his experience on NEC minicomputers to add the concept of two sets of processor registers so they could quickly respond to interrupts. Ungerman began the development of a series of related controllers and peripheral chips that would complement the design.

Through this period, Shima developed a legendary reputation for being able to convert logic concepts into physical design in realtime; while discussing a proposed feature, he would often interrupt and state how much room that would take on the chip and veto its addition if it was too large. The first pass at the design was complete by April 1975. Shima had completed a logic layout by the beginning of May. A second version of the logic design was issued on August 7 and the bus details by September 16. Tape-out was completed in November and converting the tape into a production mask required two more months.

Faggin had already started looking for a production partner. By this time, Synertek and Mostek had both set up the depletion-mode production lines that could be used to produce the design. Having talked to Synertek previously, Faggin approached them first. However, the president of Synertek demanded that the company be given a second source license, allowing them to sell the design directly. Faggin thought this would mean they could never compete even if they set up their own lines, and the agreement fell through. He then turned to Mostek, who agreed to a term of exclusivity while Zilog got their lines set up, and were eventually given the second source agreement.

After considering many names for the new company, and finding them so unmemorable they could not recall them even a day later, Faggin and Ungermann were kicking around ideas based on &quot;integrated logic&quot; when Ungermann said &quot;how about Zilog?&quot; Faggin immediately agreed, stating they could say it was the &quot;last word in integrated logic&quot;. When they met the next day and both immediately recalled it, the company had its name.

=== Into production ===
The first samples were returned from Mostek on March 9, 1976. By the end of the month, they had also completed an assembler-based development system. Some of the Z80 support and peripheral ICs were under development at this point, and many of them were launched during the following year. Among them were the Z80 CTC (counter/timer), Z80 DMA (direct memory access), Z80 DART (dual asynchronous receiver–transmitter), Z80 SIO (synchronous communication controller), and Z80 PIO (parallel input/output).

The Z80 was officially launched in July 1976. One of the first customers was a buyer who, unknown to Zilog, worked for NEC. At the time, the Japanese electronics companies were well known for taking US chip designs and producing them without a license. The Zilog team had worried about this, and Faggin had come up with the idea of adding transistors that would be subtly modified to operate differently than a visual inspection would suggest. Shima added six of these &quot;traps&quot; around the design. Sometime later, Shima was told by an engineer within NEC that the traps had delayed their copying efforts by six months.

The successful launch allowed Faggin and Ungermann to approach Exxon looking for funding to build their own fab. The company agreed, and Zilog built a production line very rapidly. This allowed them to capture about 60 to 70% of the total market for Z80 sales. With their own line running, Mostek was given the go-ahead to start sales of their own versions, the MK3880, which provided a second-source for customers which Intel lacked. At the time, a second-source was considered extremely important as a start-up like Zilog might go out of business and leave potential customers stranded.

=== Comparison with the 8080 ===
Faggin designed the instruction set to be binary compatible with the 8080 so that most 8080 code, notably the CP/M operating system and Intel&#x27;s PL/M compiler for 8080 (as well as its generated code), would run unmodified on the new Z80 CPU. Masatoshi Shima designed most of the microarchitecture as well as the gate and transistor levels of the Z80 CPU, assisted by a small number of engineers and layout people. CEO Federico Faggin was actually heavily involved in the chip layout work, together with two dedicated layout people. According to Faggin, he worked 80 hours a week in order to meet the tight schedule given by the financial investors.

The Z80 offered many improvements over the 8080:
* An enhanced instruction set including:
** a more logical, comprehensible and readable system of assembler instruction mnemonics
** more flexible 16-bit data movement (load, or LD) instructions, crucially including the stack pointer SP
** more flexible addressing modes for input/output to external peripheral ports
** single-bit addressing of all registers and memory, including bit testing
** shifts/rotates on memory and registers other than the accumulator
** improved and more accurate (than the previous 8080) BCD arithmetic
** rotate instructions for BCD number strings in memory
** 16-bit subtraction and 8-bit negation
** program looping
** program counter (PC) relative jumps
** block copy, block input/output (I/O), and byte search instructions.
* An overflow flag with better support for signed 8- and 16-bit arithmetics.
* New IX and IY index registers with instructions for direct &quot;base+offset&quot; addressing
* A better interrupt system:
** A more automatic and general vectorized interrupt system, &quot;mode 2&quot;, primarily intended for Zilog&#x27;s line of counter/timers, DMA and communications controllers, as well as a fixed vector interrupt system, &quot;mode 1&quot;, for simple systems with minimal hardware (with &quot;mode 0&quot; being the 8080-compatible mode).
** A non-maskable interrupt (NMI), which can be used to respond to power-down situations or other high-priority events (and allowing a minimalistic Z80 system to easily implement a two-level interrupt scheme in &quot;mode 1&quot;).
* A complete duplicate register file, which could be quickly switched, to speed up response to interrupts such as fast asynchronous event handlers or a multitasking dispatcher. Although they were not intended as extra registers for general code, they were nevertheless used that way in some applications.
* Less hardware required for power supply, clock generation and interface to memory and I/O
* Single 5-volt power supply (the 8080 needed −5 V, +5 V, and +12 V).
* Single-phase 5-volt clock (the 8080 needed a high-amplitude (9 to 12 volts) non-overlapping two-phase clock).
* Built-in DRAM refresh, which would otherwise require external circuitry, unless SRAM, more expensive and less dense (but faster), was used.
* Non-multiplexed buses (the 8080 had state signals multiplexed onto the data bus).
* A special reset that zeroes only the program counter, so that a single Z80 CPU could be used in a development system such as an in-circuit emulator.

=== Success in the market ===
The Z80 took over from the 8080 and its offspring, the 8085, in the processor market and became one of the most popular and widely used 8-bit CPUs. Some organizations such as British Telecom remained loyal to the 8085 for embedded applications, owing to their familiarity with it and to its on-chip serial interface and interrupt architecture. Likewise, Zenith Data Systems paired the 8085 with the 16-bit Intel 8088 in its first MS-DOS computer, the Zenith Z-100, despite having previous experience with its pioneering Z80-based Heathkit H89 and Zenith Z-89 products. However, other computers were made integrating the Z80 with other CPUs: the Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 16 with a Motorola 68000, the DEC Rainbow with an 8088, and the Commodore 128 with a MOS Technology 8502.

Zilog was later producing a low-power Z80 suitable for the growing laptop computer market of the early 1980s. Intel produced a CMOS 8085 (80C85) used in battery-powered portable computers, such as the Kyocera-designed laptop from April 1983, also sold by Tandy (as TRS-80 Model 100), Olivetti, and NEC. In following years, however, CMOS versions of the Z80 (from both Zilog and Japanese manufacturers) would dominate this market as well, in products such as the Amstrad NC100, Cambridge Z88 and Tandy&#x27;s own WP-2.

Perhaps a key to the initial success of the Z80 was the built-in DRAM refresh, at least in markets such as CP/M and other office and home computers. (Most Z80 embedded systems use static RAM that do not need refresh.) It may also have been its minimalistic two-level interrupt system, or conversely, its general multi-level daisy-chain interrupt system useful in servicing multiple Z80 IO chips. These features allowed systems to be built with less support hardware and simpler circuit board layouts.

However, others claim that its popularity was due to the duplicated registers that allowed fast context switches or more efficient processing of things like floating-point math compared to 8-bit CPUs with fewer registers. (The Z80 can keep several such numbers internally, using HL&#x27;HL, DE&#x27;DE and BC&#x27;BC as 32-bits registers, avoiding having to access them from slower RAM during computation.)

For the original NMOS design, the specified upper clock-frequency limit increased successively from the introductory 2.5 MHz, via the well known 4 MHz (Z80A), up to 6 MHz (Z80B) and 8 MHz (Z80H). An NMOS version was produced as a 10 MHz part beginning in the late 1980s. CMOS versions were developed with specified upper frequency limits ranging from 4 MHz up to 20 MHz for the version sold today. The CMOS versions allowed low-power standby with internal state retained, having no &quot;lower&quot; frequency limit. The fully compatible derivatives HD64180/Z180 and eZ80 are currently specified for up to 33 MHz and 50 MHz, respectively.

== Design ==
=== Programming model and register set ===
The programming model and register set of the Z80 are fairly conventional, ultimately based on the register structure of the Datapoint 2200. The Z80 was designed as an extension of the Intel 8080, created by the same engineers, which in turn was an extension of the 8008. The 8008 was basically a PMOS implementation of the TTL-based CPU of the Datapoint 2200.

The 2200 design allowed 8-bit registers H and L (High and Low) to be paired into a 16-bit address register HL. In the 8080, this pairing was added to the BC and DE pairs as well, while HL was generalized to allow use as a 16-bit accumulator, not just an address register. The 8080 also introduced immediate 16-bit data for BC, DE, HL, and SP loads. Furthermore, direct 16-bit copying between HL and memory was now possible, using a direct address.

The Z80 orthogonalized this further by making all 16-bit register pairs, including IX and IY, more general purpose, as well as allowing 16-bit copying directly to and from memory for all of these pairs. The 16-bit IX and IY registers in the Z80 are primarily intended as base address-registers, where a particular instruction supplies a constant offset that is added to the previous values, but they are also usable as 16-bit accumulators, among other things. A limitation is that all operand references involving IX or IY require an extra instruction prefix byte, adding at least four clock cycles over the timing of an instruction using HL instead; this sometimes makes using IX or IY less efficient than a method using only the 8080-model registers. The Z80 also introduced a new signed overflow flag and complemented the fairly simple 16-bit arithmetics of the 8080 with dedicated instructions for &quot;signed&quot; 16-bit arithmetics.The 8080-compatible registers AF, BC, DE, HL are duplicated as a separate register file in the Z80, where the processor can quickly (in four t-states, the least possible execution time for any Z80 instruction) switch from one bank to the other; a feature useful for speeding up responses to single-level, high-priority interrupts. The dual register-set is very useful in the embedded role, as it improves interrupt handling performance, but found widespread use in the personal computer role as an additional set of general registers for complex code like floating-point arithmetic or home computer games.

The duplicate register file is often referred to as the &quot;alternate register set&quot; (by some, the &quot;primed&quot; register file since the apostrophe character is used to denote them in assembler source code and the Zilog documentation). This emphasizes that only one set is addressable at any time. However, the 8-bit accumulator A with its flag register F is bifurcated from the &quot;general purpose&quot; register pairs HL, DE and BC. This is accomplished with two separate instructions used to swap their accessibilities: codice_1 exchanges only register pair AF with AF&#x27;, while the codice_2 instruction exchanges the three general purpose register pairs HL, DE and BC with their alternates HL&#x27;, DE&#x27; and BC&#x27;. Thus the accumulator A can interact independently with any of the general purpose 8-bit registers in the alternate (or primed) register file, or, if HL&#x27; contains a pointer to memory, some byte there (DE&#x27; and BC&#x27; can also transfer 8-bit data between memory and accumulator A).

This can become confusing for programmers because after executing codice_1 or codice_2, the contents of the alternate (primed) registers are now in the main registers, and vice versa. The only way for the programmer to understand and track this swapped condition is to trace through the code flow, noting each occurrence of a register swap instruction. Obviously if jump and call instructions are made within these code segments it can quickly become difficult to tell which register file is in context unless carefully commented. Thus it is advisable that exchange instructions be used directly and in short discrete code segments. The Zilog Z280 instruction set includes codice_5 and codice_6 instructions which jump to a destination address if the alternate registers are in context (thus officially recognizing this programming complication).

==== Registers ====
As on the 8080, 8-bit registers are typically paired to provide 16-bit versions. The 8080 compatible registers are:
* codice_7: 8-bit accumulator (A) and flag bits (F) carry, zero, minus, parity/overflow, half-carry (used for BCD), and an Add/Subtract flag (usually called N) also for BCD
* codice_8: 16-bit data/address register or two 8-bit registers
* codice_9: 16-bit data/address register or two 8-bit registers
* codice_10: 16-bit accumulator/address register or two 8-bit registers
* codice_11: stack pointer, 16 bits
* codice_12: program counter, 16 bits
The new registers introduced with the Z80 are:
* codice_13: 16-bit index or base register for 8-bit immediate offsets
* codice_14: 16-bit index or base register for 8-bit immediate offsets
* codice_15: interrupt vector base register, 8 bits
* codice_16: DRAM refresh counter, 8 bits (msb does not count)
* codice_17: alternate (or shadow) accumulator and flags (&quot;toggled in and out with EX AF,AF&#x27; &quot;)
* codice_18, codice_19 and codice_20: alternate (or shadow) registers (&quot;toggled in and out with EXX&quot;)
* Four bits of interrupt status and interrupt mode status

The &quot;refresh register&quot;, codice_16, increments each time the CPU fetches an opcode (or an opcode prefix, which internally executes like a 1-byte instruction) and has no simple relationship with program execution. This has sometimes been used to generate pseudorandom numbers in games, and also in software protection schemes. It has also been employed as a &quot;hardware&quot; counter in some designs; an example of this is the ZX81, which lets it keep track of character positions on the TV screen by triggering an interrupt at wrap around (by connecting INT to A6).

The &quot;interrupt vector register&quot;, codice_15, is used for the Z80 specific mode 2 interrupts (selected by the codice_23 instruction). It supplies the high byte of the base address for a 128-entry table of service routine addresses which are selected via an index sent to the CPU during an interrupt acknowledge cycle; this index is simply the low byte part of the pointer to the tabulated indirect address pointing to the service routine. The pointer identifies a particular peripheral chip or peripheral function or event, where the chips are normally connected in a so-called daisy chain for priority resolution. Like the refresh register, this register has also sometimes been used creatively; in interrupt modes 0 and 1 (or in a system not using interrupts) it can be used as simply another 8-bit data register.

The instructions codice_24 and codice_25 affect the Z80 flags register, unlike all the other codice_26 (load) instructions. The Sign (bit 7) and Zero (bit 6) flags are set according to the data loaded from the Refresh or Interrupt source registers. For both instructions, the Parity/Overflow flag (bit 2) is set according to the current state of the IFF2 flip-flop.

==== Microarchitecture ====
Although the Z80 is generally considered an eight-bit CPU, it has a four-bit ALU, so calculations are done in two steps.

=== Z80 assembly language ===

==== Datapoint 2200 and Intel 8008 ====
The first Intel 8008 assembly language was based on a very simple (but systematic) syntax inherited from the Datapoint 2200 design. This original syntax was later transformed into a new, somewhat more traditional, assembly language form for this same original 8008 chip. At about the same time, the new assembly language was also extended to accommodate the additional addressing modes in the more advanced Intel 8080 chip (the 8008 and 8080 shared a language subset without being binary compatible; however, the 8008 was binary compatible with the Datapoint 2200).

In this process, the mnemonic codice_27, for &quot;LOAD&quot;, was replaced by various abbreviations of the words &quot;LOAD&quot;, &quot;STORE&quot; and &quot;MOVE&quot;, intermixed with other symbolic letters. The mnemonic letter codice_28, for &quot;memory&quot; (referenced by HL), was lifted out from within the instruction mnemonic to become a syntactically freestanding &quot;operand&quot;, while registers and combinations of registers became very inconsistently denoted; either by abbreviated operands (MVI D, LXI H and so on), within the instruction mnemonic itself (LDA, LHLD and so on), or both at the same time (LDAX B, STAX D and so on).

&quot;Illustration of four syntaxes, using samples of equivalent, or (for 8086) very similar, load and store instructions. The Z80 syntax uses parentheses around an expression to indicate that the value should be used as a memory address (as mentioned below), while the 8086 syntax uses brackets instead of ordinary parentheses for this purpose. Both Z80 and 8086 use the + sign to indicate that a constant is added to a base register to form an address. Note that the 8086 is not a complete superset of the Z80. BX is the only 8086 register pair that can be used as a pointer.&quot;

==== New syntax ====
Because Intel claimed a copyright on their assembly mnemonics, a new assembly syntax had to be developed for the Z80. This time a more systematic approach was used:
* All registers and register pairs are explicitly denoted by their full names
* Parentheses are consistently used to indicate &quot;memory contents at&quot; (constant address or variable pointer dereferencing) with the exception of one jump instruction JP (HL). JP (XY) is merely a variation of JP (HL) loading the new PC address.
* All load and store instructions use the same mnemonic name, LD, for LOAD (a return to the simplistic Datapoint 2200 vocabulary); other common instructions, such as ADD and INC, use the same mnemonic regardless of addressing mode or operand size. This is possible because the operands themselves carry enough information.

These principles made it straightforward to find names and forms for all new Z80 instructions, as well as orthogonalizations of old ones, such as codice_29.

Apart from naming differences, and despite a certain discrepancy in basic register structure, the Z80 and 8086 syntax are virtually isomorphic for a large portion of instructions. Only quite superficial similarities (such as the word MOV, or the letter X, for extended register) exist between the 8080 and 8086 assembly languages, although 8080 programs can be translated to 8086 assembly language by translator programs.

=== Instruction set and encoding ===
The Z80 uses 252 out of the available 256 codes as single byte opcodes (&quot;root instruction&quot; most of which are inherited from the 8080); the four remaining codes are used extensively as opcode prefixes: CB and ED enable extra instructions, and DD or FD select IX+d or IY+d respectively (in some cases without displacement d) in place of HL. This scheme gives the Z80 a large number of permutations of instructions and registers; Zilog categorizes these into 158 different &quot;instruction types&quot;, 78 of which are the same as those of the Intel 8080 (allowing operation of all 8080 programs on a Z80). The Zilog documentation further groups instructions into the following categories (most from the 8080, others entirely new like the block and bit instructions, and others 8080 instructions with more versatile addressing modes, like the 16-bit loads, I/O, rotates/shifts and relative jumps):
* Load and exchange
* Block transfer and search
* Arithmetic and logical
* Rotate and shift
* Bit manipulation (set, reset, test)
* Jump, call and return
* Input/output
* Basic CPU control

No explicit multiply instructions are available in the original Z80, though registers A and HL can be multiplied by powers of two with ADD A,A and ADD HL,HL instructions (similarly IX and IY also). Shift instructions can also multiply or divide by powers of two.

Different sizes and variants of additions, shifts, and rotates have somewhat differing effects on flags because most of the flag-changing properties of the 8080 were copied. However, the parity flag bit P of the 8080 (bit 2) is called P/V (parity/overflow) in the Z80 as it serves the additional purpose of a twos complement overflow indicator, a feature lacking in the 8080. Arithmetic instructions on the Z80 set it to indicate overflow rather than parity, while bitwise instructions still use it as a parity flag. (This introduces a subtle incompatibility of the Z80 with code written for the 8080, as the Z80 sometimes indicates signed overflow where the 8080 would indicate parity, possibly causing the logic of some practical 8080 software to fail on the Z80.) This new overflow flag is used for all new Z80-specific 16-bit operations (, ) as well as for 8-bit arithmetic operations, while the 16-bit operations inherited from the 8080 (, , ) do not affect it. Also, bit 1 of the flags register (a spare bit on the 8080) is used as a flag N that indicates whether the last arithmetic instruction executed was a subtraction or addition. The Z80 version of the instruction (decimal adjust accumulator for BCD arithmetic) checks the N flag and behaves accordingly, so a (hypothetical) subtraction followed later by will yield a different result on an old 8080 than on the Z80. However, this would likely be erroneous code on the 8080, as was defined for addition only on that processor.

The Z80 has six new instructions that can load the DE, BC, and SP register pairs from memory, and load memory from these three register pairs—unlike the 8080. As on the 8080, load instructions do not affect the flags (except for the special-purpose I and R register loads). A result of a regular encoding (common with the 8080) is that each of the 8-bit registers can be loaded from themselves (e.g. ). This is effectively a .

New block transfer instructions can move up to 64 kilobytes from memory to memory or between memory and I/O peripheral ports. Block instructions and (load, increment/decrement, repeat) use HL to point to the source address, DE to the destination address, and BC as a byte counter. Bytes are copied from source to destination, the pointers are incremented or decremented, and the byte counter is decremented until BC reaches zero. Non-repeating versions and move a single byte and bump the pointers and byte counter, which if it becomes zero resets the P/V flag. Corresponding memory-to-I/O instructions , , , , , , and operate similarly, except that B, not BC, is used as the byte counter. The Z80 can input and output any register to an I/O port using register C to designate the port. (The 8080 only performs I/O through the accumulator A, using a direct port address specified in the instruction; a self-modifying code technique is required to use a variable 8080 port address.)

The last group of block instructions perform a compare operation between the byte at (HL) and the accumulator A. Register pair DE is not used. The repeating versions and only terminate if BC goes to zero or a match is found. HL is left pointing to the byte after () or before () the matching byte. If no match is found the Z flag is reset. There are non-repeating versions and .

Unlike the 8080, the Z80 can jump to a relative address ( instead of ) using a signed 8-bit displacement. Only the zero and carry flags can be tested for these new two-byte instructions. (All 8080 jumps and calls, conditional or not, are three-byte instructions.) A two-byte instruction specialized for program looping is also new to the Z80: (decrement jump if non-zero) takes a signed 8-bit displacement as an immediate operand. The B register is decremented, and if the result is nonzero, then program execution jumps relative to PC; the flags remain unaltered. To perform an equivalent loop on an 8080 requires separate and conditional jump (to a two-byte absolute address) instructions (totalling four bytes), and the alters the flag register.

The index register (IX/IY, often abbreviated XY) instructions can be useful for accessing data organised in fixed heterogenous structures (such as records) or at fixed offsets relative a variable base address (as in recursive stack frames) and can also reduce code size by removing the need for multiple short instructions using non-indexed registers. However, although they may save speed in some contexts when compared to long/complex &quot;equivalent&quot; sequences of simpler operations, they incur a lot of additional CPU time (e.g., 19 T-states to access one indexed memory location vs. as little as 11 to access the same memory using HL and to point to the next). Thus, for simple or linear accesses of data, use of IX and IY tend to be slower and occupy more memory. Still, they may be useful in cases where the &quot;main&quot; registers are all occupied, by removing the need to save/restore registers. Their officially undocumented 8-bit halves (see below) can be especially useful in this context, for they incur less slowdown than their 16-bit parents. Similarly, instructions for 16-bit additions are not particularly fast (11 clocks) in the original Z80 (being 1 clock slower than in the 8080/8085); nonetheless, they are about twice as fast as performing the same calculations using 8-bit operations, and equally important, they reduce register usage. It was not uncommon for programmers to &quot;poke&quot; different offset displacement bytes (which were typically calculated dynamically) into indexed instructions; this is an example of self-modifying code, which was regular practice on nearly all early 8-bit processors with non-pipelined execution units.

The index registers have a parallel instruction to , which is . This is often seen in stack-oriented languages like Forth, which at the end of every Forth word (atomic subroutines comprising the language) must jump unconditionally back to their thread interpreter routines. Typically this jump instruction appears many hundreds of times in an application, and using rather than saves a byte and two T-states for each occurrence. This naturally makes the index register unavailable for any other use, or else the need to constantly reload it would negate its efficiency.

The 10-year-newer microcoded Z180 design could initially afford more &quot;chip area&quot;, permitting a slightly more efficient implementation (using a wider ALU, among other things); similar things can be said for the Z800, Z280, and Z380. However, it was not until the fully pipelined eZ80 was launched in 2001 that those instructions finally became approximately as cycle-efficient as it is technically possible to make them, i.e. given the Z80 encodings combined with the capability to do an 8-bit read or write every clock cycle.

==== Undocumented instructions ====
The index registers, IX and IY, were intended as flexible 16-bit pointers, enhancing the ability to manipulate memory, stack frames and data structures. Officially, they were treated as 16-bit only. In reality they were implemented as a pair of 8-bit registers, in the same fashion as the HL register, which is accessible either as 16 bits or separately as the &quot;H&quot;igh and &quot;L&quot;ow registers. The binary opcodes (machine language) were identical, but preceded by a new opcode prefix. Zilog published the opcodes and related mnemonics for the intended functions, but did not document the fact that every opcode that allowed manipulation of the H and L registers was equally valid for the 8 bit portions of the IX and IY registers. For example, the opcode 26h followed by an immediate byte value will load that value into the H register. Preceding this two-byte instruction with the IX register&#x27;s opcode prefix, DD, would instead result in the most significant 8 bits of the IX register being loaded with that same value. A notable exception to this would be instructions similar to which make use of both the HL and IX or IY registers in the same instruction; in this case the DD prefix is only applied to the (IX+d) portion of the instruction. The halves of the XY registers could also hold operands for 8-bit arithmetic, logical and compare instructions, sparing the regular 8-bit registers for other use. The undocumented ability to increment and decrement the upper half of an index register made it easy to expand the range of the normal indexed instructions, without having to resort to the documented or .

There are several other undocumented instructions as well. Undocumented or illegal opcodes are not detected by the Z80 and have various effects, some of which are useful. However, as they are not part of the formal definition of the instruction set, different implementations of the Z80 are not guaranteed (or especially likely) to work the same way for every undocumented opcode.

==== Bugs ====
The instruction does not conform to the Z80 documentation. Both the and instructions are supposed to leave the carry (C) flag unmodified. The instruction operates correctly; however, during the execution of the instruction, the carry flag takes the results of a spurious compare between the accumulator (A) and the last output of the instruction.

=== Example code ===
The following Z80 assembly source code is for a subroutine named codice_30 that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. Important: the example code does not handle the case where the destination block overlaps the source; a serious limitation, but one that is irrelevant for some applications—such as, especially, when the source is in ROM and the destination in RAM, so they can never overlap. The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations. It demonstrates a variety of instructions but in practice it would not be coded this way as the Z80 has a single instruction that will replace this entire subroutine: codice_31. The sample code will move one byte every 46 T-states. Substituting the codice_31 instruction will move each byte in only 21 T-states. Note that the assembled code is binary-compatible with the Intel 8080 and 8085 CPUs.

=== Instruction execution ===
Each instruction is executed in steps that are usually termed machine cycles (M-cycles), each of which can take between three and six clock periods (T-states). Each M-cycle corresponds roughly to one memory access or internal operation. Many instructions actually end during the M1 of the &quot;next&quot; instruction which is known as a &quot;fetch/execute overlap&quot;.

The Z80 machine cycles are sequenced by an internal state machine which builds each M-cycle out of 3, 4, 5 or 6 T-states depending on context. This avoids cumbersome asynchronous logic and makes the control signals behave consistently at a wide range of clock frequencies. It also means that a higher frequency crystal must be used than without this subdivision of machine cycles (approximately 2–3 times higher). It does not imply tighter requirements on memory access times, since a high resolution clock allows more precise control of memory timings and so memory can be active in parallel with the CPU to a greater extent, allowing more efficient use of available memory bandwidth.

One central example of this is that, for opcode fetch, the Z80 combines two full clock cycles into a memory access period (the M1-signal). In the Z80 this signal lasts for a relatively larger part of the typical instruction execution time than in a design such as the 6800, 6502, or similar, where this period would typically last typically 30-40% of a clock cycle. With memory chip affordability (i.e. access times around 450-250 ns in the 1980s) typically determining the fastest possible access time, this meant that such designs were locked to a significantly longer clock cycle (i.e. lower internal clock speed) than the Z80.

Memory was generally slow compared to the state machine sub-cycles (clock cycles) used in contemporary microprocessors. The shortest machine cycle that could safely be used in embedded designs has therefore often been limited by memory access times, not by the maximum CPU frequency (especially so during the home computer era). However, this relation has slowly changed during the last decades, particularly regarding SRAM; cacheless, single-cycle designs such as the eZ80 have therefore become much more meaningful recently.

The content of the refresh register R is sent out on the lower half of the address bus along with a refresh control signal while the CPU is decoding and executing the fetched instruction. During refresh the contents of the Interrupt register I are sent out on the upper half of the address bus.

=== Compatible peripherals ===
Zilog introduced a number of peripheral parts for the Z80, which all support the Z80&#x27;s interrupt handling system and I/O address space. These include the counter/timer channel (CTC), the SIO (serial input/output), the DMA (direct memory access), the PIO (parallel input/output) and the DART (dual asynchronous receiver–transmitter). As the product line developed, low-power, high-speed and CMOS versions of these chips were introduced.

Like the 8080, 8085 and 8086 processors, but unlike processors such as the Motorola 6800 and MOS Technology 6502, the Z80 and 8080 has a separate control line and address space for I/O instructions. While some Z80-based computers such as the Osborne 1 used &quot;Motorola-style&quot; memory mapped input/output devices, usually the I/O space was used to address one of the many Zilog peripheral chips compatible with the Z80. During the timing for an I/O read or an I/O write operation, a single wait cycle is automatically inserted by the Z80. Zilog I/O chips supported the Z80&#x27;s new mode 2 interrupts which simplified interrupt handling for large numbers of peripherals.

The Z80 was officially described as supporting 16-bit (64 KB) memory addressing, and 8-bit (256 ports) I/O-addressing. All I/O instructions actually assert the entire 16-bit address bus. OUT (C),reg and IN reg,(C) places the contents of the entire 16-bit BC register on the address bus; OUT (n),A and IN A,(n) places the contents of the A register on b8–b15 of the address bus and n on b0–b7 of the address bus. A designer could choose to decode the entire 16-bit address bus on I/O operations in order to take advantage of this feature, or use the high half of the address bus to select subfeatures of the I/O device. This feature has also been used to minimise decoding hardware requirements, such as in the Amstrad CPC/PCW and ZX81.

== Second sources and derivatives ==

=== Second sources ===
Mostek, which produced the first Z80 for Zilog, offered it as second-source as MK3880. SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics) was a second-source, too, with their Z8400. Sharp and NEC developed second sources for the NMOS Z80, the LH0080 and μPD780C, respectively. The LH0080 was used in various home computers and personal computers made by Sharp and other Japanese manufacturers, including Sony MSX computers, and a number of computers in the Sharp MZ series. Sharp developed the LH0080A and LH0080B to operate at frequencies of 4 MHz and 6 MHz, respectively. Sharp also developed LH0083 compatible with Z80 DMA.

Toshiba made a CMOS-version, the TMPZ84C00, which is believed (but not verified) to be the same design also used by Zilog for its own CMOS Z84C00. There were also Z8400, Z80-chips made by GoldStar (now LG) and the BU18400 series of Z80-clones (including DMA, PIO, CTC, DART and SIO) in NMOS and CMOS made by ROHM Electronics. The LH5080, LH5081, and LH5082, which are CMOS versions of the Z80, PIO, and CTC respectively, are manufactured by Sharp.

In East Germany, an unlicensed clone of the Z80, known as the U880, was manufactured. It was used extensively in Robotron&#x27;s and VEB Mikroelektronik Mühlhausen&#x27;s computer systems (such as the KC85-series) and also in many self-made computer systems. In Romania another unlicensed clone could be found, named MMN80CPU and produced by Microelectronica, used in home computers like TIM-S, HC, COBRA.

Also, several clones of Z80 were created in the Soviet Union, notable ones being the T34BM1, also called КР1858ВМ1 (parallelling the Soviet 8080-clone KR580VM80A). The first marking was used in pre-production series, while the second had to be used for a larger production. Though, due to the collapse of Soviet microelectronics in the late 1980s, there are many more T34BM1s than КР1858ВМ1s.

=== Derivatives ===
; Compatible with the original Z80:
* Hitachi developed the HD64180, a microcoded and partially dynamic Z80 in CMOS, with on-chip peripherals and a simple MMU, giving a 1 MB address space. It was later second sourced by Zilog, initially as the Z64180, and then in the form of the slightly modified Zilog Z180 which has bus protocol and timings better adapted to Z80 peripheral chips. Z180 has been maintained and further developed under Zilog&#x27;s name, the newest versions being based on the fully static S180/L180 core with very low power draw and EMI (noise).
* Toshiba developed the 84-pin Z84013 / Z84C13 and the 100 pin Z84015 / Z84C15 series of &quot;intelligent peripheral controllers&quot;, basically ordinary NMOS and CMOS Z80 cores with Z80 peripherals, watchdog timer, power on reset, and wait state generator on the same chip. Manufactured by Sharp as well as Toshiba. These products are today second sourced by Zilog.
* The 32-bit Z80 compatible Zilog Z380, introduced 1994, is used in telecom equipment.
* Zilog&#x27;s fully pipelined Z80 compatible eZ80 with an 8/16/24-bit word length and a linear 16 MB address space was introduced in 2001. It exists in versions with on-chip SRAM or Flash memory, as well as with integrated peripherals. One variant has an on-chip medium access controller (MAC), and available software include a TCP/IP stack. In contrast with the Z800 and Z280, there are only a few added instructions (primarily load Effective Address (LEA), Push Effective Address (PEA), and variable-address 16/24-bit loads), but instructions are instead executed between 2 and 11 times as clock cycle efficiently as on the original Z80, with a mean value around 3-5 times. It is currently specified for clock frequencies up to 50 MHz.
* Kawasaki developed the binary compatible KL5C8400 which is approximately 1.2-1.3 times as clock cycle efficient as the original Z80 and can be clocked at up to 33 MHz. Kawasaki also produces the KL5C80A1x family, which has peripherals as well as a small RAM on chip; it is approximately as clock cycle efficient as the eZ80 and can be clocked at up to 10 MHz (2006).
* The NEC μPD9002 was a hybrid CPU compatible with both Z80 and x86 families.
* The Chinese Actions Semiconductor&#x27;s audio processor family of chips (ATJ2085 and others) contains a Z80-compatible MCUs together with a 24-bit dedicated DSP processor. These chips are used in many MP3 and media player products.
* The T80 (VHDL) and TV80 (Verilog) synthesizable soft cores are available from OpenCores.org.
* The National Semiconductor NSC800 announced in 1980 is used in many TeleSecurity Timmann (TST) electronic cipher machines and the Canon X-07. The NSC800 is fully compatible with the Z-80 instruction set. The NSC800 uses a multiplexed bus like the 8085 but has a different pinout than the Z80.
; Non-compatible:
* The Toshiba TLCS 900 series of high volume, mostly one-time programmable microcontrollers are based on the Z80. They share the same basic BC,DE,HL,IX,IY register structure, and largely the same instructions, but are not binary compatible, while the previous TLCS 90 is Z80-compatible.
* The NEC 78K series microcontrollers are based on the Z80. They share the same basic BC,DE,HL register structure, and has similar, but differently named instructions; not binary compatible.
; Partly compatible:
* Rabbit Semiconductor&#x27;s Rabbit 2000/3000/4000 microprocessors/microcontrollers are based on the HD64180/Z180 architecture, although they are not fully binary compatible.
; No longer produced:
* The ASCII Corporation R800 was a fast 16-bit processor used in MSX TurboR computers; it was software-, but not hardware-compatible with the Z80 (signal timing, pinout and function of pins differ from the Z80).
* Zilog&#x27;s NMOS Z800 and CMOS Z280 were 16-bit Z80 implementations (before the HD64180/Z180) with a 16 MB-paged MMU address space; they added many orthogonalizations and addressing modes to the Z80 instruction set. Minicomputer features — such as user and system modes, multiprocessor support, on chip MMU, on chip instruction and data cache, and so on — were seen rather as more complexity than as functionality and support for the (usually electronics-oriented) embedded systems designer; it also made it very hard to predict instruction execution times.
* Certain arcade games, such as Pang/Buster Bros., use an encrypted &quot;Kabuki&quot; Z80 CPU manufactured by VLSI Technology, where the decryption keys are stored in its internal battery-backed memory, to avoid piracy and illegal bootleg games.

== Notable uses ==

=== Desktop computers ===
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Z80 was used in a great number of fairly anonymous business-oriented machines with the CP/M operating system, a combination that dominated the market at the time. Four well-known examples of Z80 business computers running CP/M are the Heathkit H89, the portable Osborne 1, the Kaypro series, and the Epson QX-10. Less well-known was the expensive high-end Otrona Attache. Some systems used multi-tasking operating system software (like MP/M or Morrow&#x27;s Micronix) to share the one processor between several concurrent users.
Multiple home computers were introduced that used the Z80 as the main processor or as a plug-in option to allow access to software written for the Z80. Notable are the TRS-80 series, including the original model (later retronymed &quot;Model I&quot;), Model II, Model III, and Model 4, which were equipped with a Z80 as their main processor, and some (but not all) other TRS-80 models which used the Z80 as either the main or a secondary processor. Other notable machines were the DEC Rainbow 100, and the Seequa Chameleon, both of which featured both an Intel 8088 and a Z80 CPU, to support either 8-bit CP/M-80 applications running on the Z80, or a custom MS-DOS that was not fully compatible with PC DOS applications running on the 8088.

In 1981, Multitech (later to become Acer) introduced the Microprofessor I, a simple and inexpensive training system for the Z80 microprocessor. Currently, it is still manufactured and sold by Flite Electronics International Limited in Southampton, England.

In 1984 Toshiba introduced the Toshiba MSX HX-10 in Japan and Australia.

In 1985, Sharp introduced the Hotbit and Gradiente introduced the Expert, which became the dominant 8-bit home computers in Brazil until the late 1980s.

=== Portable and handheld computers ===
Use of the Z80 in lighter, battery-operated devices became more widespread with the availability of CMOS versions of the processor. It also inspired the development of other CMOS based processors, such as the LH5801 from Sharp. The Sharp PC-1500, a BASIC-programmable pocket computer was released in 1981, followed by the improved Sharp PC-1600 in 1986 and the Sharp PC-E220 in 1991. Later models of the Sharp Wizard series of personal organizers also were Z80 based. Laptops which could run the CP/M operating system just like the desktop machines followed with Epson PX-8 Geneva in 1984, and in 1985 the Epson PX-4 and Bondwell-2. While the laptop market in subsequent years moved to more powerful Intel 8086 processors and the MS-DOS operating system, light-weight Z80-based systems with a longer battery life were still being introduced, such as the Cambridge Z88 in 1988 and the Amstrad NC100 in 1992. The Z80-derived Z8S180 also found its way into an early pen-operated personal digital assistant, the Amstrad PenPad PDA600 in 1993. Hong Kong-based VTech produced a line of small laptop computers called &#x27;Lasers&#x27; based on a Z80. The last two were the Laser PC5 and PC6.
The Cidco MailStation Mivo 100, first released in 1999, was a stand-alone portable email device, with a Z80-based microcontroller. Texas Instruments produced a line of pocket organizers (ending in 2000) using Toshiba processors built around a Z80 core; the first of these was the TI PS-6200 and after a lengthy production run of some dozen models culminated in their PocketMate series.

=== Embedded systems and consumer electronics ===
The Zilog Z80 has long been a popular microprocessor in embedded systems and microcontroller cores, where it remains in widespread use today. Applications of the Z80 include uses in consumer electronics, industrial products, and electronic musical instruments. For example, Z80 was used in the groundbreaking music synthesizer Prophet-5, as well as in the first MIDI-equipped synthesizer, the Prophet 600. The Z80 was the basis for all E-mu Systems instruments from 1976 to 1986. Casio used the Z80A in its PV-1000 video game console.

A good number of early-1980s arcade video games, including the arcade game Pac-Man, contain Z80 CPUs.

The Z80 was used in Sega&#x27;s Master System and Game Gear consoles. The Sega Genesis contains a Z80, with its own 8 KB of RAM, which runs in parallel with the MC68000 main CPU, has direct access to the system&#x27;s sound chips and I/O (controller) ports, and has a switched data path to the main memory bus of the 68000 (providing access to the 64 KB main RAM, the software cartridge, and the whole video chip); in addition to providing backward compatibility with Master System games, the Z80 is often used to control and play back audio in Genesis software.

Z80 CPUs were also used in the trailblazing and popular TI-8x series of graphing calculators from Texas Instruments, beginning in 1990 with the TI-81, which features a Z80 clocked at 2 MHz. Most higher-line calculators in the series, starting with the TI-82 and TI-85, clock their Z80 CPUs at 6 MHz or higher. (A few models with TI-8x names use other CPUs, such as the M68000, but the vast majority are Z80-based. On those, it is possible to run assembled or compiled user programs in the form of Z80 machine-language code.) The TI-84 Plus series, introduced in 2004, is still in production as of 2023. The TI-84 Plus CE series, introduced in 2015, uses the Z80-derived Zilog eZ80 processor and is also still in production as of 2024.

In the late 1980s, a series of Soviet landline phones called &quot;AON&quot; featured the Z80; these phones expanded the feature set of the landline with caller ID, different ringtones based on the caller, speed dial and so forth. In the second half of the 1990s however, manufacturers of these phones switched to 8051 compatible MCUs to reduce power consumption, and prevent compact wall power adapters from overheating.

== Discontinuation ==
On April 15, 2024, Zilog announced the discontinuation of the Z80 processor, with orders being accepted until June 14, 2024. The announcement included 13 variants of the Z80 processor, many of which being DIP40 variants of the chip. Zilog will continue to manufacture the upgraded eZ80 version of the processor.

<text>The Sinclair ZX80 is a home computer launched on 29 January 1980 by Science of Cambridge Ltd. (later to be better known as Sinclair Research). It is notable for being one of the first computers available in the United Kingdom for less than a hundred pounds. It was available in kit form for £79.95, where purchasers had to assemble and solder it together, and as a ready-built version at £99.95.

The ZX80 was advertised as the first personal computer for under £100 and received praise for its value and documentation. However, it faced criticism for screen blanking during program execution, small RAM size, and the keyboard design. It was very popular straight away, and for some time there was a waiting list of several months for either version of the machine.

== Name ==

The ZX80 was named after the Z80 processor with the &#x27;X&#x27; meaning &quot;the mystery ingredient&quot;.

== Hardware ==

Internally, the machine was designed by Jim Westwood around a Z80 central processing unit with a clock speed of 3.25 MHz, and was equipped with 1 KB of static RAM and 4 KB of read-only memory (ROM). It had no sound output.

The ZX80 was designed around readily available TTL ICs, without any custom chips; the only proprietary technology was the firmware.

The machine was mounted in a small white plastic case, with a one-piece blue membrane keyboard on the front. There were problems with durability, reliability and overheating (despite appearances, the black stripes visible on the top rear of the case are merely cosmetic, and are not ventilation slots).

Video output was black-and-white, character-based. However, the ZX80 character set included some simple block-based graphics glyphs, allowing basic graphics to be accomplished, with some effort. One advantage to using monochrome video is that different colour broadcast standards (e.g. PAL, SECAM) simply weren&#x27;t an issue when the system was sold outside the UK.

Display was over an RF connection to a household television, and simple offline program storage was possible using a cassette recorder. The video display generator of the ZX80 used minimal hardware plus a combination of software to generate a video signal. (Some say this was an idea popularised by Don Lancaster in his 1978 book &quot;The TV Cheap Video Cookbook&quot; and his &quot;TV Typewriter&quot;. However, that design didn&#x27;t involve a microprocessor for video generation, and it wasn&#x27;t really similar to the ZX80 in other aspects either. The ZX80 and ZX81 also employed very specific traits of the Z80 processor.)

Unlike the later follow up, ZX81, the ZX80 could only generate a picture when it was idle, i.e. waiting for a key to be pressed. When running a BASIC program, or when pressing a key during editing, the tv-display would therefore blank out (lose synchronisation) momentarily while the processor was busy. So a BASIC program had to introduce a pause for input to display the next change in graphical output, making smooth moving graphics impossible. This could be overcome only by very clever machine code tricks. These had to effectively replace the video rountines in ROM and embed the same in the normal program logic with exact timing, which is extremely cumbersome. However, a few such games were developed by skilled users or programmers later on.

== Firmware ==
The 4 KB ROM contained the Sinclair BASIC programming language, editor, and operating system. BASIC commands were not entered by typing them out but were instead selected somewhat similarly to a programmable graphing calculator - each key had a few different functions selected by both context and modes as well as with the shift key.

== Expansion ==
Other than the built-in cassette and video ports, the only provided means of expansion was a slot opening at the rear of the case, which exposed an expansion bus edge connector on the motherboard. The same slot bus was continued on the ZX81, and later the ZX Spectrum, which encouraged a small cottage industry of expansion devices, including memory packs, printers and even floppy drives. The original Sinclair ZX80 RAM Pack held either 1, 2 or 3 KB of static RAM and a later model held 16 KB of dynamic RAM (DRAM).

Following the ZX81&#x27;s release, a ZX81 8 KB ROM was available to upgrade the ZX80 at a cost of around 20% of a real ZX81. It came with a thin keyboard overlay and a ZX81 manual. By simply taking off the top cover of the ZX80 and prying the old ROM from its socket and carefully inserting the new ROM and adding the keyboard overlay, the ZX80 would now function almost identically to the proper ZX81 – except for SLOW mode, due to the differences in hardware between the two models. The process was easily reversed to return the ZX80 to its original configuration.

One common modification by hobbyist users was to attach a full-size keyboard, optionally moving the motherboard into a larger case. This had the dual advantages of making the machine easier to type on, while increasing ventilation to the motherboard.

== Versions ==

The UK version of the machine was the standard, and only changes that were absolutely necessary to sell units in other markets were made. In fact, the only real change made in most markets involved the video output frequency (the ZX80 used an external power transformer, so differences in AC line frequency and outlet were not an issue to the machine itself). One outcome of this is that the machine had some keyboard keys and characters that were distinctly British: was used instead of , instead of or , and the character set and keyboard included the Pound symbol.

== Reception ==

The ZX80 was widely advertised as the first personal computer for under £100 GBP (US$200.) &quot;Kilobaud Microcomputing&quot; liked the design of the preassembled version, and said that the screen flickering during input or output was annoying but useful as an undocumented feature, indicating the computer functioning correctly. It praised the documentation as excellent for novices, and noted that purchasing the computer was cheaper than taking a college class on BASIC. The magazine concluded, &quot;The ZX-80 is a real computer and an excellent value&quot;, but only for beginners who could learn from the documentation or programmers experienced with writing Z-80 software. &quot;BYTE&quot; called the ZX80 a &quot;remarkable device&quot;. It praised the real-time, interactive BASIC syntax checking, and reported that the computer performed better on benchmarks than some competitors, including the TRS-80 Model I. The magazine criticised the screen blanking during program execution, small RAM size, inadequate built-in Sinclair BASIC, and keyboard, and recommended against buying the kit given difficulty of assembly and because purchasers did not save money. &quot;BYTE&quot; concluded that &quot;the ZX80 might be summarized as a high-performance, very low-cost, portable personal computer system ... a good starting point&quot;.

Sales of the ZX80 reached about 50,000, which contributed significantly to the UK leading the world in home computer ownership through the 1980s. Owing to the unsophisticated design and the tendency for the units to overheat, surviving machines in good condition are sought after and can fetch high prices by collectors.

== Clones ==
There were also clones of the ZX80, such as the MicroAce, and from Brazil the Nova Eletrônica/Prológica NE-Z80 and the Microdigital TK80.

<text>The ZX Spectrum () is an 8-bit home computer developed and marketed by Sinclair Research. One of the most influential computers ever made and one of the all-time bestselling British computers, with over five million units sold. It was released in the United Kingdom on 23 April 1982, and around the world in the following years, most notably in Europe, the United States, and Eastern Bloc countries.

The machine was designed by English entrepreneur and inventor Sir Clive Sinclair and his small team in Cambridge, and was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was made to be small, simple, and most importantly inexpensive, with as few components as possible. The addendum &quot;Spectrum&quot; was chosen to highlight the machine&#x27;s colour display, which differed from the black-and-white display of its predecessor, the ZX81. Rick Dickinson designed its distinctive case, rainbow motif, and rubber keyboard. Video output is transmitted to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor, while application software is loaded and saved onto compact audio cassettes.

The ZX Spectrum was initially distributed by mail order, but after severe backlogs it was sold through High Street chains in the United Kingdom. It was released in the US as the Timex Sinclair 2068 in 1983, and in some parts of Europe as the Timex Computer 2048. Ultimately the Spectrum was released as seven models, ranging from the entry level with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128 KB RAM and built-in floppy disk drive in 1987. Throughout its life, the machine primarily competed with the Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Dragon 32, and the Amstrad CPC range. Over 24,000 software products were released for the ZX Spectrum.

The Spectrum played a pivotal role in the early history of personal computing and video gaming, leaving a legacy that influenced generations. Its introduction led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware, the effects of which are still seen. It was among the first home computers aimed at a mainstream UK audience, with some crediting it for launching the British information technology industry. The Spectrum was Britain&#x27;s top-selling computer until the Amstrad PCW surpassed it in the 1990s. It was discontinued in 1992.

==History==
The ZX Spectrum was conceived and designed by engineers at Sinclair Research, founded by English entrepreneur and inventor Clive Sinclair, who was well known for his eccentricity and pioneering ethic. On 25 July 1961, three years after passing his A-levels, he founded Sinclair Radionics Ltd as a vehicle to advertise his inventions and buy components. In 1972, Sinclair had competed with Texas Instruments to produce the world&#x27;s first pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive. By the mid 1970s, Sinclair Radionics was producing handheld electronic calculators, miniature televisions, and the ill-fated digital Black Watch wristwatch. Due to financial losses, Sinclair sought investors from the National Enterprise Board (NEB), who had bought a 43% interest in the company and streamlined his product line. Sinclair&#x27;s relationship with the NEB had worsened, however, and by 1979 it opted to break up Sinclair Radionics entirely, selling off its television division to Binatone and its calculator division to ESL Bristol.

After incurring a £7 million investment loss, Sinclair was given a golden handshake and an estimated £10,000 severance package. He had a former employee, Christopher Curry, establish a &quot;corporate lifeboat&quot; company named Science of Cambridge Ltd, in July 1977, called such as they were located near the University of Cambridge. By this time inexpensive microprocessors had started appearing on the market, which prompted Sinclair to start producing the MK14, a computer teaching kit which sold well at a very low price. Encouraged by this success, Sinclair renamed his company to Sinclair Research, and started looking to manufacture personal computers. Keeping the cost low was essential for Sinclair to avoid his products from becoming outpriced by American or Japanese equivalents as had happened to several of the previous Sinclair Radionics products. On 29 January 1980, the ZX80 home computer was launched to immediate popularity; notable for being one of the first computers available in the United Kingdom for less than £100. The company conducted no market research whatsoever prior to the launch of the ZX80; according to Sinclair, he &quot;simply had a hunch&quot; that the public was sufficiently interested to make such a project feasible and went ahead with ordering 100,000 sets of parts so that he could launch at high volume.

On 5 March 1981, the ZX81 was launched worldwide to immense success with more than 1.5 million units sold, 60% of which was outside Britain. According to Ben Rosen, by pricing the ZX81 so low, the company had &quot;opened up a completely new market among people who had never previously considered owning a computer&quot;. After its release, computing in Britain became an activity for the general public rather than the preserve of office workers and hobbyists. The ZX81&#x27;s commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain&#x27;s leading computer manufacturers, with Sinclair himself reportedly &quot;amused and gratified&quot; by the attention the machine received.

===Development===
Development of the ZX Spectrum began in September 1981, a few months after the release of the ZX81. Sinclair resolved to make his own products obsolete before his rivals developed the products that would do so. Parts of designs from the ZX80 and ZX81 were reused to ensure a speedy and cost-effective manufacturing process. The team consisted of 20 engineers housed in a small office at 6 King&#x27;s Parade, Cambridge. During early production, the machine was known as the ZX81 Colour or the ZX82 to highlight the machine&#x27;s colour display, which differed from the black and white of its predecessors. The addendum &quot;Spectrum&quot; was added later on, to emphasise its 15-colour palette. Aside from a new crystal oscillator and extra chips to add additional kilobytes of memory, the ZX Spectrum was intended to be, as quoted by Sinclair&#x27;s marketing manager, essentially a &quot;ZX81 with colour&quot;. According to Sinclair, the team also wanted to combine the ZX81&#x27;s separate random-access memory sections for audio and video into a single bank.

Chief engineer Richard Altwasser was responsible for the ZX Spectrum&#x27;s hardware design. His main contribution was the design of the semi-custom uncommitted logic array (ULA) integrated circuit, which integrated, on a single chip, the essential hardware functions. Altwasser designed a graphics mode that required less than 7 kilobytes of memory and implemented it on the ULA. Vickers wrote most of the ROM code. Lengthy discussions between Altwasser and Sinclair engineers resulted in a broad agreement that the ZX Spectrum must have high-resolution graphics, 16 kilobytes of memory, an improved cassette interface, and an impressive colour palette. To achieve this, the team had to divorce the central processing unit (CPU) away from the main display to enable it to work at full efficiency – a method which contrasted with the ZX81&#x27;s integrated CPU. The inclusion of colour to the display proved a major obstacle to the engineers. A Teletext-like approach was briefly considered, in which each line of text would have colour-change codes inserted into it. However, this was ruled out, as it was deemed unsuitable for high-resolution graphs or diagrams that involved multiple colour changes. Altwasser devised the idea of allocating a colour attribute to each character position on the screen. This ultimately used eight bits of memory for each character position; three bits to provide any one of eight foreground colours and three bits for the eight background colours, one bit for extra brightness and one bit for flashing. Overall, the system took up slightly less than 7 kilobytes of memory, leaving an additional 9 kilobytes to write programs — a figure that pleased the team.

Much of the firmware was written by computer scientist Steve Vickers from Nine Tiles, who compiled all control routines to produce the Sinclair BASIC interpreter, a custom variant of the general purpose BASIC programming language. Making a custom interpreter made it possible to fit all of its functionality into a very small amount of read-only memory (ROM). The development process of the software was marked by disagreements between Nine Tiles and Sinclair Research. Sinclair placed an emphasis on expediting the release of the Spectrum, primarily by minimising alterations in the software from the ZX81, which had in turn been based on the ZX80&#x27;s software. The software architecture of the ZX80, however, had been tailored for a severely constrained memory system, and in Nine Tiles&#x27; opinion was unsuitable for the enhanced processing demands of the ZX Spectrum. Sinclair favoured solving this with expansion modules on the existing framework like with the ZX81, which Nine Tiles disagreed with. Ultimately, both designs were developed, but Vickers and Nine Tiles were unable to finish their version before the launch of the Spectrum and it was not used.
The distinctive case and colourful design of the ZX Spectrum was the creation of Rick Dickinson, a young British industrial designer who had been hired by Sinclair to design the ZX81. Dickinson was tasked to design a sleeker and more &quot;marketable&quot; appearance to the new machine, whilst ensuring all 192 BASIC functions could fit onto 40 physical keys. Early sketches from August 1981 showed the case was to be more angular and wedge-like, in similar vein to an upgraded ZX81 model. Dickinson later settled on a flatter design with a raised rear section and rounded sides in order to depict the machine as &quot;more advanced&quot; as opposed to a mere upgrade. In drawing up potential logos, Dickinson proposed a series of different logotypes which all featured rainbow slashes across the keyboard.

The design of the Spectrum&#x27;s rubber keyboard was simplified from several hundred components to a conventional moving keyboard down to &quot;four to five&quot; moving parts using a new technology. The keyboard was still undergoing changes as late as February 1982; some sketches included a roundel-on-square key design which was later featured on the later Spectrum+ model. Dickinson recalled in 2007 that &quot;everything was cost driven&quot; and that the minimalist, Bauhaus approach to the Spectrum gave it an elegant yet &quot;[non] revolutionary&quot; form. The drawing board on which Dickinson designed the ZX Spectrum is now on display in the Science Museum in London.

The need for an improved cassette interface was apparent from the number of complaints received from ZX81 users, who encountered problems when trying to save and load programs. To increase the data transfer speed, the team significantly decreased the length of tones that represent binary data. To increase the reliability, a leading period of constant tone was introduced, which allowed the cassette recorder&#x27;s automatic gain control to settle itself down, eliminating hisses on the tape. A Schmitt trigger was added inside the ULA to reduce noise of the received signal. Originally, the team aimed for data transfer speed of 1000 baud, but succeeded in getting it to work at a considerably faster 1500 baud. Unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum was able to maintain its display during loading and saving operations, and programmers took advantage of this to show a splash screen whilst loading took place in the background.

As with the ZX81, the ZX Spectrum was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, by Timex Corporation at the company&#x27;s Dryburgh factory. Prior to the manufacture of the ZX81, however, Timex had little experience in assembling electronics and had not originally been an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis at the beginning of the 1980s; profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex&#x27;s director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas and signed a contract with Sinclair.

===Launch===
The ZX Spectrum was officially revealed before journalists by Sinclair at the Churchill Hotel in Marylebone, London, on 23 April 1982. Later that week, the machine was officially presented in a &quot;blaze of publicity&quot; at the Earl&#x27;s Court Computer Show in London, and the ZX Microfair in Manchester. The ZX Spectrum was launched with two models: a 16KB &#x27;basic&#x27; version, and an enhanced 48KB variant. The former model had an undercutting price of £125, significantly lower than its main competitor the BBC Micro, whilst the latter model&#x27;s price of £175 was comparable to a third of an Apple II computer. Upon release, the keyboard surprised many users due to its use of rubber keys, described as offering the feel of &quot;dead flesh&quot;. Sinclair himself remarked that the keyboard&#x27;s rubber mould was &quot;unusual&quot;, but consumers were undeterred.

Despite very high demand, Sinclair Research was &quot;notoriously late&quot; in delivering the ZX Spectrum. Their practice of offering mail-order sales before units were ready ensured a constant cash flow, but meant a lacking distribution. Nigel Searle, the newly-appointed chief of Sinclair&#x27;s computer division, said in June 1982 the company had no plans to stock the new machine in WHSmith, which was at the time Sinclair&#x27;s only retailer. Searle explained that the mail-order system was in place due to there being no &quot;obvious&quot; retail outlets in the United Kingdom which could sell personal computers, and it made &quot;better sense&quot; financially to continue selling through mail-order. The company&#x27;s conservative approach to distributing the machine was criticised, with disillusioned customers telephoning and writing letters. Demand sky-rocketed beyond Sinclair&#x27;s planned 20,000 monthly unit output to a backlog of 30,000 orders by July 1982. Due to a scheduled holiday at the Timex factory that summer, the backlog had risen to 40,000 units. Sinclair issued a public apology in September that year, and promised that the backlog would be cleared by the end of that month. Supply did not return to normal until the 1982 Christmas season, however.

Production of the machine rapidly increased with the arrival of the less expensive Issue 2 motherboard, a redesign of the main circuit board which addressed hardware manufacturing defects that affected production of the first model. Sales of the ZX Spectrum reached 200,000 in its first nine months, rising to 300,000 for the whole of the first year. By August 1983 total sales in Britain and Europe had exceeded 500,000, with the millionth Spectrum manufactured on 9 December 1983. By this point, an average of 50,000 units were being purchased each month.

In July 1983, an enhanced version of the ZX Spectrum was launched in the United States as the Timex Sinclair 2068. Advertisements described it as offering 72 kilobytes of memory, having a full range of colour and sound for a price under $200. Despite the improvements upon its British counterpart, sales proved poor and Timex Sinclair collapsed the following year.

===Success and market domination===

A crucial part of the company&#x27;s marketing strategy was to implement regular price-cutting at strategic intervals to maintain market share. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy noted that Sinclair&#x27;s method was driven by securing his leading position through &quot;panicking&quot; the competition. While most companies at the time reduced prices of their products while their market share was dwindling, Sinclair Research discounted theirs shortly after sales had peaked, throwing the competition into &quot;utter disarray&quot;. Sinclair Research made a profit of £14 million in 1983, compared to £8.5 million the previous year. Turnover doubled from £27.2 million to £54.5 million, which equated to roughly £1 million for each person employed directly by the company.

Clive Sinclair became a focal point during the ZX Spectrum&#x27;s marketing campaign by putting a human face onto the business. Sinclair Research was portrayed in the media as a &quot;plucky&quot; British challenger taking on the technical and marketing might of giant American and Japanese corporations. As David O&#x27;Reilly noted in 1986, &quot;by astute use of public relations, particularly playing up his image of a Briton taking on the world, Sinclair has become the best-known name in micros.&quot; The media latched onto Sinclair&#x27;s image; his &quot;Uncle Clive&quot; persona is said to have been created by the gossip columnist for &quot;Personal Computer World&quot;. The press praised Sinclair as a visionary genius, with &quot;The Sun&quot; lauding him as &quot;the most prodigious inventor since Leonardo da Vinci&quot;. Adamson and Kennedy wrote that Sinclair outgrew the role of microcomputer manufacturer and &quot;accepted the mantle of pioneering boffin leading Britain into a technological utopia&quot;. Sinclair&#x27;s contribution to the technology sector resulted in him being knighted upon the recommendation of Margaret Thatcher in the Queen&#x27;s 1983 Birthday Honours List.

The United Kingdom was largely immunised from the effects of the video game crash of 1983, due to the saturation of home computers such as the ZX Spectrum. The microcomputer market continued to grow and game development was unhindered despite the turbulence in the American markets. Indeed, computer games remained the dominant sector of the British home video game market up until they were surpassed by Sega and Nintendo consoles in 1991. By the end of 1983 there were more than 450 companies in Britain selling video games on cassette, compared to 95 the year before. An estimated 10,000 to 50,000 people, mostly young men, were developing games out of their homes based on advertisements in popular magazines. The growth of video games during this period has been compared to the punk subculture, fuelled by young people making money from their games.

By the mid 1980s, Sinclair Research&#x27;s share of the British home computer market had climbed to a high of 40 per cent. Sales in the 1984 Christmas season were described as &quot;extremely good&quot;. In early 1985 the British press reported the home computer boom to have ended, leaving many companies slashing prices of their hardware to anticipate lower sales. Despite this, celebration of Sinclair&#x27;s success in the computing market continued at the &quot;Which Computer?&quot; show in Birmingham, where the five-millionth Sinclair machine (a gold coloured QL) was issued as a prize.

===Later years and company decline===

The ZX Spectrum&#x27;s successor, the Sinclair QL, was officially announced on 12 January 1984, shortly before the Macintosh 128K went on sale. Contrasting with its predecessors, the QL was aimed at more serious, professional home users. It suffered from several design flaws; fully operational QLs were not available until the late summer, and complaints against Sinclair concerning delays were upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in May of that year. Particularly serious were allegations that Sinclair was cashing cheques months before machines were shipped. By autumn 1984, Sinclair was still publicly forecasting that it would be a &quot;million seller&quot; and that 250,000 units would be sold by the end of the year. QL production was suspended in February 1985, and the price was halved by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timex/Sinclair history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It ultimately flopped, with 139,454 units being manufactured.

The ZX Spectrum+, a rebranded ZX Spectrum with identical technical specifications except for the QL-like keyboard, was introduced in October 1984 and made available in WHSmith&#x27;s stores the day after its launch. Retailers stocked the device in high quantities, anticipating robust Christmas sales. Nevertheless, the product did not perform as well as projected, leading to a significant drop in Sinclair&#x27;s income from orders in January, as retailers were left with surplus stock. Subsequently, an upgraded model, the ZX Spectrum 128, was released in Spain in September 1985, with development financed by the Spanish distributor Investrónica. The launch of this model in the UK was postponed until January 1986 due to the substantial leftover inventory of the prior model.

While the Sinclair QL was in development, Sinclair also hoped to repeat his success with the Spectrum in the fledgling electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. On 10 January 1985, Sinclair unveiled the Sinclair C5, a small one-person battery electric recumbent tricycle. It marked the culmination of Sir Clive&#x27;s long-running interest in electric vehicles. The C5 turned out to be a significant commercial failure, selling only 17,000 units and losing Sinclair £7 million. It has since been described as &quot;one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry&quot;. The ASA ordered Sinclair to withdraw advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company&#x27;s claims about its safety could not be proved or justified.

The combined failures of the C5 and QL caused investors to lose confidence in Sinclair&#x27;s judgement. In May 1985, Sinclair Research announced their intention to raise an additional £10 to £15 million to restructure the organisation. Given the loss of confidence in the company, securing the funds proved to be a challenging task. In June 1985, business magnate Robert Maxwell disclosed a takeover bid for Sinclair Research through Hollis Brothers, a subsidiary of his Pergamon Press. However, the deal was terminated in August 1985. The future of Sinclair Research remained uncertain until 7 April 1986, when the company sold their entire computer product range, along with the &quot;Sinclair&quot; brand name, to Alan Sugar&#x27;s Amstrad for £5 million. The takeover sent ripples through the London Stock Exchange, but Amstrad&#x27;s shares soon recovered, with one stock broker affirming that &quot;the City appears to have taken the news in its stride&quot;. Amstrad&#x27;s acquisition of the brand name saw the release of three ZX Spectrum models throughout the late 1980s, each with varying improvements.

By 1990, Sinclair Research consisted of Sinclair and two other employees down from 130 employees at its peak in 1985. The ZX Spectrum was officially discontinued in 1992, after ten years on the market. Sinclair Research continued to exist as a one-man company, marketing Sir Clive Sinclair&#x27;s inventions until his death in September 2021.

== Hardware ==
=== Technical specifications ===

The central processing unit is a Zilog Z80, an 8-bit microprocessor, with a clock rate of 3.5 MHz. The original model Spectrum has 16 KB of ROM and either 16 kB or 48 kB of RAM.

===Graphics===

Video output is channelled through an RF modulator, intended for use with contemporary television sets, to provide a simple colour graphic display. Text is displayed using a grid of 32 columns × 24 rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set, or from a custom set. The machine features a colour palette of 15 colours, consisting of seven saturated colours at two levels of brightness, along with black. The image resolution is 256×192 pixels, subject to the same colour limitations. To optimise memory usage, colour is stored separately from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practical terms, this means that all pixels within an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour. Altwasser received a patent for this design.

An &quot;attribute&quot; consists of a foreground and a background colour, a brightness level (normal or bright) and a flashing &quot;flag&quot; which, when set, causes the two colours to swap at regular intervals. This scheme leads to what was dubbed &quot;colour clash&quot; or attribute clash, where a desired colour of a specific pixel could not be selected, but only the colour attributes of an 8x8 block. This became a distinctive feature of the Spectrum, requiring programs, especially games, to be designed with this limitation in mind. In contrast, other machines available at the same time, such as the Amstrad CPC or the Commodore 64, did not suffer from this limitation. While the Commodore 64 also employed colour attributes, it utilised a special multicolour mode and hardware sprites to circumvent attribute clash.

===Sound===
Sound output is produced through a built-in beeper capable of generating a single channel with ten octaves. It is controlled by a single bit. By toggling it on and off, simple sounds are generated. This speaker, capable of producing just one note at a time, was governed by the BASIC command &#x27;BEEP&#x27;, where programmers could manipulate parameters for pitch and duration. Furthermore, the processor remained occupied exclusively with the BASIC BEEPs until their completion, limiting concurrent operations. Despite these constraints, it marked a significant step forward from the ZX81, which lacked any sound capabilities. Resourceful programmers swiftly devised workarounds; its rudimentary audio functionality compelled developers to explore unconventional methods such as programming the beeper to emit multiple pitches.

Later software became available that allowed for two-channel sound playback. The machine includes an expansion bus edge connector and 3.5 mm audio in/out ports, facilitating the connection of a cassette recorder for loading and saving programs and data. The port has a higher output than the and is recommended for headphones, while the port is intended for attachment to other audio devices as a line-in source.

===Other integrated peripherals===
The ZX Spectrum integrated elements from the ZX81. The keyboard decoding and cassette interfaces are nearly identical, although the latter was programmed for higher-speed loading and saving. The central ULA integrated circuit shares some resemblance with that of the ZX81, but it features a hardware-based television raster generator with colour support. This indirectly provides the new machine with roughly four times the processing power of the ZX81, as the Z80 is relieved of video generation tasks. An initial ULA design flaw occasionally led to incorrect keyboard scanning, which was resolved by adding a small circuit board mounted upside down next to the CPU in Issue 1 ZX Spectrums.

=== Firmware ===

The machine&#x27;s Sinclair BASIC interpreter is stored in 16 KiB ROM, along with essential system routines. The ROM code, responsible for tasks such as floating point calculations and expression parsing, exhibited significant similarities to ZX81, although a few outdated routines remained in the Spectrum ROM. The Spectrum&#x27;s keyboard is imprinted with BASIC keywords. To input a command in BASIC, many keywords require a single keyboard stroke. Other keywords require a change of keyboard mode by a few keystrokes.

The BASIC interpreter is derived from the one used on the ZX81. A BASIC program for ZX81 can be entered into a ZX Spectrum with minimal modifications. However, Spectrum BASIC introduced numerous additional features, enhancing its usability. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded compared to that of the ZX81, which lacked lowercase letters. Spectrum BASIC incorporated extra keywords for better graphics and sound functionality, and support for multi-statement lines was added. The built-in ROM tape modulation software routines for cassette data storage enable data transfers at an average speed of 171 bits per second (bit/s), with a theoretical peak speed of 256 bit/s. The tape modulation is significantly more advanced than the ZX81, with approximately four times faster average speeds.

=== ZX Spectrum 16K/48K ===
The original ZX Spectrum is remembered for its rubber chiclet keyboard, diminutive size and distinctive rainbow motif. It was originally released on 23 April 1982 with 16 KB of RAM for or with 48 KB for ; these prices were reduced to and respectively in 1983. Owners of the 16 KB model could purchase an internal 32 KB RAM upgrade, which for early &quot;Issue 1&quot; machines consisted of a daughterboard. Later issue machines required the fitting of 8 dynamic RAM chips and a few TTL chips. Users could mail their 16K Spectrums to Sinclair to be upgraded to 48 KB versions. Later revisions contained 64 KB of memory but were configured such that only 48 KB were usable. External 32 KB RAM packs that mounted in the rear expansion slot were available from third parties. Both machines had 16 KB of onboard ROM.

An &quot;Issue 1&quot; ZX Spectrum can be distinguished from Issue 2 or 3 models by the colour of the keys – light grey for Issue 1, blue-grey for later machines. Although the official service manual states that approximately 26,000 of these original boards were manufactured, subsequent serial number analysis shows that only 16,000 were produced, almost all of which fell in the serial number range 001-000001 to 001-016000. An online tool now exists to allow users to ascertain the likely issue number of their ZX Spectrum by inputting the serial number.

These models experienced numerous changes to its motherboard design throughout its life; mainly to improve manufacturing efficiencies, but also to correct bugs from previous boards. Another issue was with the Spectrum&#x27;s power supply. In March 1983, Sinclair issued an urgent recall warning for all owners of models bought after 1 January 1983. Plugs with a non-textured surface were at risk of causing shock, and were asked to be sent back to a warehouse in Cambridgeshire which would supply a replacement within 48 hours.

=== ZX Spectrum+ ===
Development of the &quot;ZX Spectrum+&quot; began in June 1984, and was released on 15 October that year at £179. It was assembled by AB Electronics in South Wales and Samsung in South Korea. This 48 KB Spectrum introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that functions as a switch shorting across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48 KB model. The machine outsold the rubber-key model two to one, however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more typical 5–6% for the older model. In early 1985, the original Spectrum was officially discontinued, and the ZX Spectrum+ was reduced in price to £129.

=== ZX Spectrum 128 ===
In 1985, Sinclair developed the ZX Spectrum 128 (codenamed &quot;Derby&quot;) in conjunction with their Spanish distributor Investrónica (a subsidiary of El Corte Inglés department store group). Investrónica had helped adapt the ZX Spectrum+ to the Spanish market after their government introduced a special tax on all computers with 64 KB RAM or less, and a law which obliged all computers sold in Spain to support the Spanish alphabet and show messages in Spanish.

The appearance of the ZX Spectrum 128 is similar to the ZX Spectrum+, with the exception of a large external heatsink for the internal 7805 voltage regulator added to the right hand end of the case, replacing the internal heatsink in previous versions. This external heatsink led to the system&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Toast Rack&quot;. New features included 128 KB RAM with RAM disc commands, three-channel audio via the AY-3-8912 chip, MIDI compatibility, an RS-232 serial port, an RGB monitor port, 32 KB of ROM including an improved BASIC editor, and an external keypad.

The machine was simultaneously unveiled for the first time and launched in September 1985 at the SIMO &#x27;85 trade show in Spain, with a price of 44,250 pesetas. Sinclair later presented the ZX Spectrum 128 at The May Fair Hotel&#x27;s Crystal Rooms in London, where he acknowledged that entertainment was the most common use of home computers. Due to the large number of unsold Spectrum+ models, Sinclair decided not to start it selling in the United Kingdom until January 1986 at a price of £179.

The Zilog Z80 processor used in the Spectrum has a 16-bit address bus, which means only 64 KB of memory can be directly addressed. To facilitate the extra 80 KB of RAM the designers used bank switching so the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16 KB at the top of the address space. The same technique was used to page between the new 16 KB editor ROM and the original 16 KB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the address space.

The new sound chip and MIDI out abilities were exposed to the BASIC programming language with the command codice_1 and a new command codice_2 was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although there is no command to switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80 KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs. Unlike its predecessors, it has no internal speaker, and can only produce sound from a television speaker.

== Amstrad models ==

=== ZX Spectrum +2 ===
The &quot;ZX Spectrum +2&quot; marked Amstrad&#x27;s entry into the Spectrum market shortly after their acquisition of the Spectrum range and &quot;Sinclair&quot; brand in 1986. This machine featured a brand-new grey case with a spring-loaded keyboard, dual joystick ports, and an integrated cassette recorder known as the &quot;Datacorder,&quot; akin to the Amstrad CPC 464. The ROM was updated so that the screen on boot-up showed an Amstrad copyright message (&quot;© 1986 Amstrad&quot; in place of the previous &quot;© 1982 Sinclair Research Ltd&quot;). However, it was largely identical to the ZX Spectrum 128 in most technical aspects. The machine retailed for £149.

The new keyboard did not feature the BASIC keyword markings seen on earlier Spectrums, except for the keywords codice_3&quot;,&quot; codice_4&quot;,&quot; and codice_5&quot;,&quot; which were useful for loading software. Instead, the +2 introduced a menu system, almost identical to that of the ZX Spectrum 128, allowing users to switch between 48K BASIC programming with keywords and 128K BASIC programming, where all words, both keywords and others, needed to be typed out in full (though keywords were still stored internally as one character each). Despite these changes, the layout remained identical to that of the 128.

=== ZX Spectrum +3 ===

The &quot;ZX Spectrum +3&quot;, which was launched in 1987, bore a resemblance to its predecessor but introduced a built-in 3-inch floppy disk drive instead of the cassette drive. Initially priced at £249, it later retailed for £199. It was the only Spectrum model capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware. Unlike its predecessors, the ZX Spectrum +3 power supply utilised a DIN connector and featured &quot;Sinclair +3&quot; branding on the case.

Significant alterations caused a series of incompatibilities, such as the removal of several lines on the expansion bus edge connector. This resulted in complications for various peripherals. Additionally, changes in memory timing led to certain RAM banks being contended, causing failures in high-speed colour-changing effects. The keypad scanning routines from the ROM were also eliminated, rendering some older 48K and 128K games incompatible with the machine. The ZX Interface 1 was also rendered incompatible due to disparities in ROM and expansion connectors, making it impossible to connect and use the Microdrive units.

Production of the +3 was discontinued in December 1990, reportedly in response to Amstrad&#x27;s relaunch of their CPC range, with an estimated 15% of ZX Spectrums sold being +3 models at the time. The +2B model, the only other model still in production at this point, continued to be manufactured, as it was believed not to be in direct competition with other computers in Amstrad&#x27;s product range.

=== ZX Spectrum +2A, +2B and +3B ===
The ZX Spectrum +2A was a new version of the Spectrum +2 using the same circuit board as the Spectrum +3. It was sold from late 1988 and unlike the original grey +2 was housed inside a black case. The Spectrum +2A/+3 motherboard (AMSTRAD part number Z70830) was designed so that it could be assembled with a +2 style &quot;datacorder&quot; connected instead of the floppy disk controller. The power supply of the ZX Spectrum +2A used the same pinout as the +3 and has &quot;Sinclair +2&quot; written on the case.

1989 saw the release of the ZX Spectrum +2B and ZX Spectrum +3B. They are functionally similar in design to the Spectrum +2A and +3, though changes to the generation of the audio output signal were made to resolve problems with clipping. The +2B board has no provision for floppy disk controller circuitry, while the +3B motherboard has no provision for connecting an internal tape drive. Production of all Amstrad Spectrum models ended in 1992.

== Licences and clones ==
===Official licences===

Following Amstrad&#x27;s acquisition of Sinclair Research&#x27;s computer business, Sir Clive Sinclair formed the mail order company Cambridge Computer, which he used to release the portable Cambridge Z88 in February 1987. This ill-fated Spectrum clone incorporated a ULA that introduced the high-resolution video mode originally pioneered in the Timex Sinclair 2068. The &quot;Pandora&quot; was designed with a flat-screen monitor and Microdrives, intended as Sinclair&#x27;s solution for portable business computing.

Timex of Portugal developed and produced several branded computers, including a PAL region-compatible version of the Timex Sinclair 2068, known as the Timex Computer 2048. This variant features distinct buffers for both the ULA and the CPU, significantly enhancing compatibility with ZX Spectrum software compared to the American model. Software developed for the Portuguese-made 2048 remained fully compatible with its American counterpart, as the ROMs were left unaltered. Timex of Portugal also created a ZX Spectrum &quot;emulator&quot; in cartridge form. Several other upgrades were introduced, including a BASIC64 cartridge enabling it to utilise high-resolution (512x192) modes. This model saw significant success in both Portugal and Poland.

In India, Deci Bells Electronics Limited based in Pune, introduced a licensed version of the Spectrum+ in 1988. Dubbed the &quot;dB Spectrum+&quot;, it performed well in the Indian market, selling over 50,000 units and achieving an 80% market share.

=== Unofficial clones ===
Numerous unofficial Spectrum clones were produced, especially in Eastern Europe. Many small start-ups in the Soviet Union assembled various clones, distributed through poster adverts and street stalls. Over 50 such clone models existed in total. In Czechoslovakia, the first production ZX Spectrum clone was the Didaktik Gama, sporting two switched 32 KB memory banks and 16 KB of slower RAM containing graphical data for video output, followed by Didaktik M, with later availability of a 5.25&quot;/3.5&quot; floppy disk drives; and a Didaktik Kompakt clone with a built-in floppy drive. There were also clones produced in South America, such as the Brazilian-made TK90X and TK95, as well as the Argentine Czerweny CZ models.

In the United Kingdom, Spectrum peripheral vendor Miles Gordon Technology (MGT) released the SAM Coupé 8-bit home computer in December 1989. It was designed to be fully compatible with the ZX Spectrum 48K, housing a Zilog Z80B processor clocked at 6 MHz and 256KB of RAM. By this point, the Amiga and Atari ST had taken hold of the market, leaving MGT in eventual receivership in June 1990. In his book &quot;Retro Tech&quot;, Peter Leigh considers the Sam Coupé to be the &quot;true&quot; successor of the ZX Spectrum.

== Peripherals ==
Several peripherals were developed and marketed by Sinclair. The ZX Printer, a small spark printer, was already on the market upon the ZX Spectrum&#x27;s release, as its computer bus was partially backward-compatible with that of its predecessor, the ZX81. It uses two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay.

The ZX Interface 1 add-on module, launched in 1983, includes 8 kB of ROM, an RS-232 serial port, a proprietary local area network (LAN) interface known as ZX Net, and a port for connecting up to eight ZX Microdrives — tape-loop cartridge storage devices released in July 1983, known for their speed, albeit with some reliability concerns. Sinclair Research also introduced the ZX Interface 2, which added two joystick ports and a ROM cartridge port. Although the ZX Microdrives were initially greeted with good reviews, they never became a popular distribution method due to fears over cartridge quality and piracy.

Third-party hardware add-ons were available throughout the machine&#x27;s life, including the Kempston joystick interface, the Morex Peripherals Centronics/RS-232 interface, the Currah Microspeech unit for speech synthesis, Videoface Digitiser, the SpecDrum drum machine, and the Multiface, a snapshot and disassembly tool from Romantic Robot. After the original ZX Spectrum&#x27;s keyboard received criticism for its &quot;dead flesh&quot; feel, external keyboards became popular. In 1983, DK&#x27;Tronics launched a Light Pen compatible with some drawing software.

The Abbeydale Designers/Watford Electronics SPDOS and KDOS disk drive interfaces were bundled with office productivity software, including the Tasword word processor, Masterfile database, and Omnicalc spreadsheet. This bundle, along with OCP&#x27;s Stock Control, Finance, and Payroll systems, introduced small businesses to streamlined computerised operations. In 1987 and 1988, Miles Gordon Technology released the DISCiPLE and +D systems. These systems had the capability to store memory images as disk snapshots, allowing users to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state. Both systems were compatible with the Microdrive command syntax, simplifying the porting of existing software.

In the mid-1980s, Telemap Group launched a fee-based service allowing ZX Spectrum users to connect their machines to the Micronet 800 information provider via a Prism Micro Products VTX5000 modem. Micronet 800, hosted by Prestel, provided news and information about microcomputers and offered a form of instant messaging and online shopping.

== Software ==

Most Spectrum software was originally distributed on audio cassette tapes, intended to work with a normal domestic cassette recorder. Software was mainly distributed through print media such as magazines and books. To load software onto the machine, the reader would type the BASIC program listing by hand, run it, and save it to the cassette for later use. Some magazines distributed 7&quot; 33 rpm flexi disc records, or &quot;Floppy ROMs&quot;, a variant of regular vinyl records which could be played on a standard record player. Some radio stations would broadcast audio stream data via frequency modulation or medium wave so that listeners could directly record it onto an audio cassette themselves. ZX Spectrum-focused radio programmes existed in the United Kingdom, which were received over long distances on domestic radio receivers.

Different types of software released for the machine include programming language implementations, databases, word processors (&quot;Tasword&quot; being the most prominent), spreadsheets, drawing and painting tools (e.g. OCP Art Studio), 3D-modelling (e.g. VU-3D) and archaeology software. Over 24,000 different software titles were released for the ZX Spectrum throughout its lifespan. The ZX Spectrum had an extensive library of video games, including iconic titles such as &quot;Manic Miner&quot;, &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot;, &quot;Chuckie Egg&quot;, &quot;Elite&quot;, &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Many of the popular ZX81 titles were rewritten for the Spectrum to take advantage of the newer machine&#x27;s colour and sound capabilities (Psion&#x27;s &quot;Flight Simulation&quot; being a notable example). These games were instrumental in establishing the machine as a prominent gaming platform during the 1980s. Hardware limitations of the machine required a particular level of creativity from video game designers. From August 1982 the ZX Spectrum came bundled with &quot;&quot;, a software compilation which included ten demonstration programs.

Some ZX Spectrum games hold a number of industry-firsts and Guinness World Records. These include &quot;Ant Attack&quot;, the first home computer game to use isometric graphics, &quot;Turbo Esprit&quot;, the first open world driving game, and &quot;Redhawk&quot;, which featured the first superhero created specifically for a video game.

== Reception ==
Initial reception of the ZX Spectrum was generally positive. Critics in Britain welcomed the new machine as a worthy successor to the ZX81; Robin Bradbeer of &quot;Sinclair User&quot; praised the additional keyboard functions the Spectrum had to offer, and lauded the &quot;strength&quot; of its ergonomic and presentable design. Tim Hartnell from &quot;Your Computer&quot; noted that Sinclair had improved on the shortcomings of the ZX80 and ZX81 by revamping the Spectrum&#x27;s load and save functions, noting that it made working with the machine &quot;a pleasure&quot;. Hartnell concluded that despite minor faults, the machine was &quot;way ahead&quot; of its competitors, and its specification exceeded that of the BBC Micro Model A.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;″ Terry Pratt compared the Spectrum&#x27;s keyboard negatively to the typewriter-style used on the BBC Micro, opining that it was an improvement over the ZX81 but unsuited for &quot;typists&quot;. In similar vein, David Tebbutt from &quot;Personal Computer World&quot; felt that the Spectrum&#x27;s keyboard felt more like a calculator than typewriter, but praised its functional versatility. Likewise, Gregg Williams from &quot;BYTE&quot; criticised the keyboard, declaring that despite the machine&#x27;s attractive price the layout &quot;is impossible to justify&quot; and &quot;poorly designed&quot; in several respects. Williams was sceptical of the computer&#x27;s appeal to American consumers if sold for  — &quot;hardly competitive with comparable low-cost American units&quot; — and expected that Timex would sell it for . A more negative review came from Jim Lennox of &quot;Technology Week&quot;, who wrote that &quot;after using it [...] I find Sinclair&#x27;s claim that it is the most powerful computer under £500 unsustainable. Compared to more powerful machines, it is slow, its colour graphics are disappointing, its BASIC limited and its keyboard confusing&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The importance of the ZX Spectrum and its role in the early history of personal computing and video gaming has left it regarded as the most important and influential computer of the 1980s. Some observers credit it as being responsible for launching the British information technology industry during a period of recession, while introducing home computing to the masses. , it is also one of the best-selling British computers of all time, with over five million units sold by the end of the Spectrum&#x27;s lifespan in 1992. It retained the title of Britain&#x27;s top-selling computer until the Amstrad PCW surpassed it in the 1990s, with eight million units sold by the end of the PCW&#x27;s lifespan in 1998. The ZX Spectrum is affectionately known as the &quot;Speccy&quot; by elements of its fan following.

The ZX Spectrum was popular in communist Czechoslovakia, with an estimated 100,000 in the country by 1988 making it the most popular home computer of the time. This was despite only briefly being officially distributed, and never advertised. Its small size made it easier to smuggle into the country to avoid high customs fees.

A number of notable games developers began their careers on the ZX Spectrum. Tim and Chris Stamper founded Ultimate Play the Game in 1982, who found success with their blockbuster hits &quot;Jetpac&quot; (1983), &quot;Atic Atac&quot; (1983), &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; (1984), and &quot;Knight Lore&quot; (1984). The Stamper brothers later founded Rare, which became Nintendo&#x27;s first Western third-party developer. David Perry, the founder of Shiny Entertainment, moved from Northern Ireland to England to focus on developing games for the ZX Spectrum.

Some programmers have continued to code for the platform by using emulators. A homebrew community continues into the present day, with several games being released commercially from new software houses such as Cronosoft. In 2020, a museum dedicated to the ZX Spectrum and other Sinclair products opened in Cantanhede, Portugal.

=== Recreations ===
In 2013, an FPGA-based redesign of the original ZX Spectrum known as the ZX Uno, was formally announced. All of its hardware, firmware and software are open source, released as Creative Commons licence Share-alike. The use of a Spartan FPGA allows the system to not only re-implement the ZX Spectrum, but many other 8-bit computers and games consoles. The device also runs modern open FPGA machines such as the Chloe 280SE. The Uno was successfully crowdfunded in 2016 and the first boards went on sale the same year.

In January 2014, Elite Systems, who produced a successful range of software for the original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices. The company used a crowdfunding campaign to fund the &quot;Recreated ZX Spectrum&quot;, which would be compatible with games the company had already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original software that they had not been paid for the content. &quot;Wired UK&quot; described the finished device, which was styled as an original Spectrum 48k keyboard, as &quot;absolutely gorgeous&quot; but said it was ultimately more of an expensive novelty than an actual Spectrum. In July 2019, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; reported that many of the orders had yet to be delivered due to a dispute between Elite Systems and their manufacturer, Eurotech.

Later in 2014, the ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on Indiegogo with the backing of Clive Sinclair. The Vega, released in 2015, took the form of a handheld TV game but the lack of a full keyboard led to criticism from reviewers due to the large number of text adventures supplied with the device. Most reviewers branded the device cheap and uncomfortable to use. The follow-up, the ZX Spectrum Vega+ was designed as a handheld game console. Despite reaching its crowdfunding target in March 2016, the company failed to fulfil the majority of orders. Reviewing the Vega+, &quot;The Register&quot; criticised numerous aspects and features of the machine, including its design and build quality and summed up by saying that the &quot;entire feel is plasticky and inconsequential&quot;. Retro Computers Ltd was placed into liquidation in 2019.

The ZX Spectrum Next is an expanded and updated version of the ZX Spectrum computer implemented with FPGA technology funded by a Kickstarter campaign in April 2017, with the board-only computer delivered to backers later that year. The finished machine, including a case designed by Rick Dickinson who died during the development of the project, was released to backers in February 2020. &quot;MagPi&quot; called it &quot;a lovely piece of kit&quot;, noting that it is &quot;well-designed and well-built: authentic to the original, and with technology that nods to the past while remaining functional and relevant in the modern age&quot;. PC Pro magazine called the Next &quot;undeniably impressive&quot; while noting that some features are &quot;not quite ready&quot;. A further Kickstarter for an improved revision of the hardware was funded in August 2020.

In August 2024, Retro Games announced that they would be releasing a recreation of the ZX Spectrum titled &quot;The Spectrum&quot; which would include 48 built-in games, a save game option, rewind mode and pre-owned titles load up. It is set to be released on 22 November 2024.

=== In popular culture ===
A running gag in &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; features character Julie Powers being censored with the sound effects of the ZX Spectrum. The director of the film, Edgar Wright, who was a big fan of the Spectrum, stated that he always used to wait for Spectrum games to load when he was a teenager. 

On 23 April 2012, a Google doodle honoured the 30th anniversary of the Spectrum. As it coincided with St George&#x27;s Day, the Google logo was of St George fighting a dragon in the style of a Spectrum loading screen. 

One of the alternate endings in the interactive film &quot;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&quot; (2018) included the main character playing data tape audio that, when loaded into a ZX Spectrum software emulator, generates a QR code leading to a website with a playable version of the &quot;Nohzdyve&quot; game featured in the film.

<text>Zechariah was a person in the Hebrew Bible traditionally considered the author of the Book of Zechariah, the eleventh of the Twelve Minor Prophets.

== Prophet ==

The Book of Zechariah introduces him as the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo. The Book of Ezra names Zechariah as the son of Iddo, but it is likely that Berechiah was Zechariah&#x27;s father and Iddo his grandfather. Targum Lamentations 2:20 names this Zechariah son of Iddo, as does the book of Matthew 23:35. This is not the same person as Iddo the Seer, who lived during the reigns of Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijah, and is most likely the Iddo mentioned in Ezra 8:17. His name means &quot;Yah remembers&quot;.

Zechariah&#x27;s prophetical career probably began in the second year of Darius the Great, king of the Achaemenid Empire (520 BCE). His greatest concern appears to have been with the building of the Second Temple. He features in chapters 1–8 of the book of Zechariah but he does not appear in the remaining chapters of the book (chapters 9–14).

==Liturgical commemoration==
On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, his feast day is 8 February. He is commemorated in the calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on the Tuesday after the fifth Sunday of Pentecost and, with the other Minor Prophets, on 31 July. The Catholic Church honors him with a feast day assigned to 6 September.

<doc id="34470" wikidata="Q8069709" url="?curid=34470" title="Zeta Instrument Processor Interface">
<text>Zeta Instrument Processor Interface (ZIPI) was a research project initiated by Zeta Instruments and UC Berkeley&#x27;s CNMAT (Center for New Music and Audio Technologies). Introduced in 1994 in a series of publications in Computer Music Journal from MIT Press, ZIPI was intended as the next-generation transport protocol for digital musical instruments, designed with compliance to the OSI model.

== Concept ==
The draft working version of ZIPI was primarily aimed at addressing many limitations of MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface). Unlike MIDI which uses a peer-to-peer serial port connection, ZIPI was designed to run over a star network with a hub in the center. This allowed for faster connection and disconnection, because there was no need to daisy-chain multiple devices. 10BASE-T was used at the physical layer, but the protocol did not depend on any physical implementation.

There were proposals for querying device capabilities, patch names and other system and patch parameters, as well as uploading and downloading samples into device memory.

== MPDL ==
ZIPI used completely new message system and a complex note addressing scheme based on Music Parameter Description Language (MPDL) protocol, which was a direct replacement to MIDI events.

Instead of MIDI Channels, there were three-level address hierarchy of 63 &quot;Families&quot; consisting of 127 &quot;Instruments&quot;, each having 127 notes, resulting in up to 1,016,127 individual note addresses. Instruments in a Family could be assembled from different physical devices. This arrangement allowed fine per-note control of synthesis parameters, especially useful for non-standard scenarios such as MIDI wind controller or MIDI guitar controller.

For example, instant note-on capability could mask the deficiencies of note detection (tracking) in guitar MIDI systems, especially on lower strings. When triggered, the note would begin sounding as a noise or an arbitrary low note until the controller logic had tracked the actual pitch, which would be sent by a follow-up message without the need to retrigger the note. Conventionally, messages could also address a whole Instrument or an entire Family, as an equivalent to channel messages.

Some MDPL messages were direct carryovers from MIDI, given more pronounceable names in order to avoid ambiguity, but most messages were new and based on a very different, although innovative, control logic. The resolution of message parameters could be any multiple of 8-bit, potentially extending 7-bit resolution typical of MIDI to 32 or more bits.

There were also some higher-level messages corresponding to advanced program parameters, such as modulation, envelopes and 3D spatialization of voices, as well as instrument-specific messages for guitar, wind, and drum controllers.

===Message types===
The basic synthesis control messages were:
* Articulation - &#x27;note on/off&#x27; in MIDI
* Pitch (note number and offset in 0.2 cents)
* Frequency (in Hz)
* Loudness - &#x27;velocity&#x27; in MIDI
* Amplitude - &#x27;volume&#x27; in MIDI
* Even/Odd Harmonic balance
* Pitched/Unpitched balance
* Roughness
* Attack character
* Inharmonicity
* Pan Left/Right, Up/Down, Front/Back
* Spatialization distance and azimuth/elevation angles
* Program Change - immediately and future notes
* Timbre space X/Y/Z
* Multiple output levels
* Time tag
* Modulation rate/depth/wavetype

Controller (performance-oriented) messages included:
* Key Velocity/Number/Pressure
* Pitch Bend Wheel 
* Mod Wheel 1/2/3
* Switch pedal 1 (Sustain)/ 2 (Soft pedal) /3 /4
* Continuous pedal 1 (Volume)/2 /3 /4
* Pick/bow Velocity/Position/Pressure
* Fret/fingerboard Position/Pressure
* Wind flow or pressure (breath controller) 
* Embouchure (bite) 
* Wind controller keypads 
* Lip pressure/frequency
* Drum head striking point X/Y position and distance/angle from center
* X/Y/X position in space
* Velocity in X/Y/Z dimension 
* Acceleration in X/Y/Z dimension

== Outcome of the project ==
Although ZIPI provided many outstanding new features, they did not line up well with existing MIDI-based implementations. The unusual addressing scheme which required substantial increase in complexity was the main factor in the lack of its adoption. Maintaining 1,016,127 individual synthesis states was far beyond the capabilities of synth hardware of the time, even though ZIPI developers hinted that there would be some practical limits upon the number of simultaneously available programs and notes. In comparison, MIDI defined only 16 channels that accumulated common channel control messages like program change, volume and pitch, and most digital synthesizers of the time could only provide from 12 to 128 simultaneously sounding notes.

As no commercial devices were released supporting ZIPI, the sufficiency of MIDI for most applications and the introduction of the &quot;FireWire&quot; (IEEE1394) as the alternative physical layer soon led to the practical demise of the project. ZIPI web site at CNMAT asserts that IEEE1394 &quot;supersedes ZIPI in every respect,&quot; mainly because it has simpler interface requirements: it does not require a hub, supports hot plugging (devices may be added or removed more conveniently), and includes an isolated power distribution scheme.

The developers continued on to work on Open Sound Control protocol, currently supported in a wide variety of musical instruments, sensors and software.

<doc id="34471" wikidata="Q205388" url="?curid=34471" title="Zohar">
<text>The Zohar (, &quot;Zōhar&quot;, lit. &quot;Splendor&quot; or &quot;Radiance&quot;) is a foundational work of Kabbalistic literature. It is a group of books including commentary on the mystical aspects of the Torah and scriptural interpretations as well as material on mysticism, mythical cosmogony, and mystical psychology. The &quot;Zohar&quot; contains discussions of the nature of God, the origin and structure of the universe, the nature of souls, redemption, the relationship of ego to darkness and &quot;true self&quot; to &quot;the light of God&quot;.

The &quot;Zohar&quot; was first publicized by Moses de León (c. 1240 – 1305 CE), who claimed it was a Tannaitic work recording the teachings of Simeon ben Yochai (). This claim is universally rejected by modern scholars, most of whom believe de León, also an infamous forger of Geonic material, wrote the book himself between 1280 and 1286. Some scholars argue that the &quot;Zohar&quot; is the work of multiple medieval authors and/or contains a small amount of genuinely antique novel material. Later additions to the &quot;Zohar&quot;, including &quot;Tiqqune hazZohar&quot; and &quot;Ra&#x27;ya Meheimna&quot;, were composed by a 14th century imitator.

==Language==

=== Zoharic Aramaic ===
According to Gershom Scholem and other modern scholars, Zoharic Aramaic is an artificial dialect largely based on a linguistic fusion of the Babylonian Talmud and Targum Onkelos, but confused by de León&#x27;s simple and imperfect grammar, his limited vocabulary, and his reliance on loanwords, including from contemporaneous medieval languages. The author further confused his text with occasional strings of Aramaic-seeming gibberish, in order to give the impression of obscure knowledge.

=== Zoharic Hebrew ===
The original text of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, as cited by various early Kabbalists beginning around the 14th century (e.g. Isaac b. Samuel of Acre, David b. Judah the Pious, Israel Alnaqua, Alfonso de Zamora) was partly in Hebrew and partly in Aramaic. By the time of the first edition (1558) the text was entirely in Aramaic, with the exception of the &quot;Midrash haNe&#x27;elam&quot;, where Hebrew words and phrases are often employed as in the Babylonian Talmud. &quot;The Hebrew of the &quot;Midrash haNe&#x27;elam&quot; is similar in its overall form to the language of the early midrashim, but its specific vocabulary, idioms, and stylistic characteristics bear the imprint of medieval Hebrew, and its midrashic manner is clearly that of a later imitation.&quot;

==Authorship==

===Initial view===
Authorship of the &quot;Zohar&quot; was questioned from the outset, due to the claim that it was discovered by one person and referred to historical events of the post-Talmudic period while purporting to be from an earlier date. Abraham Zacuto&#x27;s 1504 work &quot;Sefer Yuhasin&quot; (first printed 1566) quotes from the Kabbalist Isaac ben Samuel of Acre&#x27;s 13th century memoir &quot;Divre hayYamim&quot; (lost), which claims that the widow and daughter of de León revealed that he had written it himself and only ascribed the authorship to Simeon ben Yochai for personal profit:
Isaac goes on to say that he obtained mixed evidence of Zohar&#x27;s authenticity from other Spanish Kabbalists, but the fragment ends abruptly, mid-sentence, without any conclusion. Though Isaac is willing to quote it in his &quot;Otzar haChayyim&quot; and his &quot;Meirat Einayim&quot;, he does so rarely. Isaac&#x27;s testimony was censored from the second edition (1580) and remained absent from all editions thereafter until its restoration nearly 300 years later in the 1857 edition. In 1243 a different Jew had reportedly found a different ancient mystical book in a cave near Toledo, which may have been de Leon&#x27;s inspiration.

Within fifty years of its appearance in Spain it was quoted by Kabbalists, including the Italian mystical writer Menahem Recanati and Todros ben Joseph Abulafia. However, Joseph ben Waqar harshly attacked the &quot;Zohar&quot;, which he considered inauthentic, and some Jewish communities, such as the Dor Daim from Yemen, Andalusian (Western Sefardic or Spanish and Portuguese Jews), and some Italian communities, never accepted it as authentic. Other early Kabbalists, such as David b. Judah the Pious (fl. c. 1300), Abraham b. Isaac of Granada, (fl. c. 1300), and David b. Amram of Aden (fl. c. 1350), so readily imitate its pseudepigraphy by ascribing contemporaries&#x27; statements to Zoharic sages that it is obvious they understood its nature. The manuscripts of the &quot;Zohar&quot; are from the 14th-16th centuries.

===Late Middle Ages===
By the 15th century, the &quot;Zohar&quot;&#x27;s authority in the Iberian Jewish community was such that Joseph ibn Shem-Tov drew arguments from it in his attacks against Maimonides, and even representatives of non-mystical Jewish thought began to assert its sacredness and invoke its authority in the decision of some ritual questions. In Jacobs&#x27; and Broyde&#x27;s view, they were attracted by its glorification of man, its doctrine of immortality, and its ethical principles, which they saw as more in keeping with the spirit of Talmudic Judaism than are those taught by the philosophers, and which was held in contrast to the view of Maimonides and his followers, who regarded man as a fragment of the universe whose immortality is dependent upon the degree of development of his active intellect. The &quot;Zohar&quot; instead declared Man to be the lord of creation, whose immortality is solely dependent upon his morality.

Conversely, Elia del Medigo (), in his &quot;Beḥinat ha-Dat&quot;, endeavored to show that the &quot;Zohar&quot; could not be attributed to Simeon ben Yochai, by a number of arguments. He claims that if it were his work, the &quot;Zohar&quot; would have been mentioned by the Talmud, as has been the case with other works of the Talmudic period; he claims that had ben Yochai known by divine revelation the hidden meaning of the precepts, his decisions on Jewish law from the Talmudic period would have been adopted by the Talmud, that it would not contain the names of rabbis who lived at a later period than that of ben Yochai; he claims that if the Kabbalah were a revealed doctrine, there would have been no divergence of opinion among the Kabbalists concerning the mystic interpretation of the precepts.

Believers in the authenticity of the &quot;Zohar&quot; countered that the lack of references to the work in Jewish literature was because ben Yochai did not commit his teachings to writing but transmitted them orally to his disciples over generations until finally the doctrines were embodied in the &quot;Zohar&quot;. They found it unsurprising that ben Yochai should have foretold future happenings or made references to historical events of the post-Talmudic period.

By the late 16th century, the &quot;Zohar&quot; was present in one-tenth of all private Jewish libraries in Mantua. The authenticity of the &quot;Zohar&quot; was accepted by such 16th century Jewish luminaries as Joseph Karo (d. 1575), and Solomon Luria (d. 1574), who wrote nonetheless that Jewish law does not follow the &quot;Zohar&quot; when it is contradicted by the Babylonian Talmud.

Luria writes that the &quot;Zohar&quot; cannot even override a minhag. Moses Isserles (d. 1572) writes that he &quot;heard&quot; that the author of the &quot;Zohar&quot; is ben Yochai. Elijah Levita (d. 1559) did not believe in its antiquity, nor did Joseph Scaliger (d. 1609) or Louis Cappel (d. 1658) or Johannes Drusius (d. 1616). David ibn abi Zimra (d. 1573) held that one can follow the &quot;Zohar&quot; only when it does not conflict with any other source and records that &quot;You asked me about scribes modifying torah scrolls to accord with the &quot;Zohar&quot; ... and I was shocked, for how can they consider the &quot;Zohar&quot; better than the Talmud Bavli, which has come down to us? ... So I went myself to the house of the scribe and I found three scrolls which he had edited, and I fixed them, and I restored the Torah to its proper glory.&quot;

===Enlightenment Period===
Debate continued over the generations; del Medigo&#x27;s arguments were echoed by Leon of Modena (d. 1648) in his &quot;Ari Nohem&quot;, by Jean Morin (d. 1659), and by Jacob Emden (d. 1776).

Emden—who may have been familiar with Modena through Morin&#x27;s arguments—devoted a book to the criticism of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, called &quot;Mitpachas Sefarim&quot; (מטפחת ספרים), in an effort against the remaining adherents of the Sabbatean movement (in which Sabbatai Zevi, a Jewish apostate, cited Messianic prophecies from the &quot;Zohar&quot; as proof of his legitimacy). Emden argued that the book on which Zevi based his doctrines was a forgery, arguing that the &quot;Zohar&quot;:

* misquotes passages of Scripture 
* misunderstands the Talmud
* contains some ritual observances that were ordained by later rabbinical authorities
* mentions the Crusades against Muslims (who did not exist in the 2nd century)
* uses the expression &quot;esnoga&quot;, a Portuguese term for the synagogue
* gives a mystical explanation of the Hebrew vowel points, which were not introduced until long after the Talmudic period.

Saul Berlin (d. 1794) argued that the presence of an introduction in the &quot;Zohar&quot;, unknown to the Talmudic literary genre, itself indicates a medieval date.

In the Ashkenazi community of Eastern Europe, religious authorities including Elijah of Vilna (d. 1797) and Shneur Zalman of Liadi (d. 1812) believed in the authenticity of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, while Ezekiel Landau (d. 1793), in his sefer &quot;Derushei HaTzlach&quot; (דרושי הצל&quot;ח), argued that the &quot;Zohar&quot; is to be considered unreliable as it was made public many hundreds of years after Ben Yochai&#x27;s death and lacks an unbroken tradition of authenticity, among other reasons.

Isaac Satanow accepted Emden&#x27;s arguments and referred to the &quot;Zohar&quot; as a forgery, also offering new evidence. By 1813 Samuel David Luzzatto had concluded that &quot;these books [the Zohar and the Tiqqunei Zohar] are utter forgeries,&quot; in part because they repeatedly discuss the Hebrew cantillation marks, which were not invented until the 9th century. In 1817 Luzzatto published these arguments, and in 1825 he penned a fuller treatise, giving many reasons why the &quot;Zohar&quot; could not be ancient. However, he did not publish this until 1852, when he felt it justified by the rise of Hasidism. Moses Landau (d. 1852), Ezekiel&#x27;s grandson, published the same conclusion in 1822. Isaac Haver (d. 1852) admits the vast majority of content comes from the 13th century but argues that there was a genuine core. Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport (d. 1867) spoke against the &quot;Zohar&quot;&#x27;s antiquity. Eliakim ha-Milzahgi (d. 1854) accepted Emden&#x27;s arguments.

The influence of the &quot;Zohar&quot; in Yemen contributed to the formation of the Dor Deah movement, led by Yiḥyah Qafiḥ in the later part of the 19th century. Among its objects was the opposition of the influence of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, as presented in Qafiḥ&#x27;s &quot;Milhamoth Hashem&quot; (Wars of the Lord) and &quot;Da&#x27;at Elohim&quot;.

Shlomo Zalman Geiger (d. 1878), in his book &quot;Divrei Kehilot&quot; on the liturgical practice of Frankfurt am Main, records that &quot;We do not say &quot;brikh shmei&quot; in Frankfurt, because its source is in the &quot;Zohar&quot;, and the sages of Frankfurt refused to accept Qabbalah.&quot;

===Modern religious views===

In 1892, Adolf Neubauer called on the Orthodox rabbinate to reject the &quot;Zohar&quot; as a forgery and to remove Zoharic prayers from the liturgy. However, Yechiel Michel Epstein (d. 1908) and Yisrael Meir Kagan (d. 1933) both believed in the authenticity of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, as did Menachem Mendel Kasher (d. 1983), Aryeh Kaplan (d. 1983), David Luria (d. 1855), and Chaim Kanievsky (d. 2022). Aryeh Carmell (d. 2006) did not, and Eliyahu Dessler (d. 1953) accepted the possibility that it was composed in the 13th century. Gedaliah Nadel (d. 2004) was unsure if the &quot;Zohar&quot; were genuine but was sure that it is acceptable to believe that it is not. Ovadia Yosef (d. 2013) held that Orthodox Jews should accept the &quot;Zohar&quot;&#x27;s antiquity in practice based on medieval precedent, but agreed that rejecting it is rational and religiously valid. Joseph Hertz (d. 1946) called the claim of ben Yochai&#x27;s authorship &quot;untenable&quot;, citing Gershom Scholem&#x27;s evidence. Samuel Belkin (d. 1976) argued that the Mystical Midrash section, specifically, predated de León. Joseph B. Soloveitchik (d. 1993) apparently dismissed the &quot;Zohar&quot;&#x27;s antiquity. Moses Gaster (d. 1939) wrote that the claim of ben Yochai&#x27;s authorship was &quot;untenable&quot; but that Moses de León had compiled earlier material. Meir Mazuz (alive) accepts Emden&#x27;s arguments. Yeshayahu Leibowitz wrote (1990) that &quot;Moses de León composed the &quot;Zohar&quot; in the 1270s as certainly as Theodor Herzl composed &quot;Der Judenstaat&quot; in the 1890s ... the &quot;Zohar&quot; was influential because in every generation the idolatrous influence outpowers the true faith&quot;.

===Modern critical views===
Early attempts included M. H. Landauer&#x27;s &quot;Vorläufiger Bericht über meine Entdeckung in Ansehung des Sohar&quot; (1845), which fingered Abraham Abulafia as the author, and Samuel David Luzzatto&#x27;s &quot;ויכוח על חכמת הקבלה&quot; (1852), but the first systematic and critical academic proof for the authorship of Moses de León was given by Adolf Jellinek in his 1851 monograph &quot;Moses ben Shem-tob de León und sein Verhältnis zum Sohar&quot;. Jellinek&#x27;s proofs, which combined previous analyses with Isaac of Acre&#x27;s testimony and comparison of the &quot;Zohar&quot; to de Leon&#x27;s Hebrew works, were accepted by every other major scholar in the field, including Heinrich Graetz (&quot;History of the Jews&quot;, vol. 7), Moritz Steinschneider, Bernhard Beer, Leopold Zunz, and Christian David Ginsburg. Ginsburg summarized Jellinek&#x27;s, Graetz&#x27;s, and other scholars&#x27; proofs for the English-reading world in 1865, also introducing several novel proofs, including that the &quot;Zohar&quot; includes a translation of a poem by Solomon ibn Gabirol (d. 1058) and that it includes a mystical explanation of a mezuzah style only introduced in the 13th century. Adolf Neubauer and Samuel Rolles Driver were convinced by these arguments, but Edward Bouverie Pusey held to a Tannaitic date.

By 1913, the critical view had apparently lost some support: Israel Abrahams recalls that &quot;Zunz, like Graetz, had little patience with the Zohar . . . at this date we are much more inclined to treat the Kabbalah with respect.&quot;

Gershom Scholem, who was to found modern academic study of Kabbalah, began his career at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1925 with a lecture in which he promised to refute Graetz and Jellinek. However, after years of research, he came to conclusions similar to theirs by 1938, when he argued again that de León was the most likely author. Scholem noted the &quot;Zohar&#x27;s&quot; frequent errors in Aramaic grammar, its suspicious traces of Arabic and Spanish words and sentence patterns, and its lack of knowledge of the Land of Israel, among other proofs.

Scholem&#x27;s views are widely held as accurate among historians of Kabbalah, but they are not uncritically accepted. Scholars who continue to research the background of the &quot;Zohar&quot; include Yehuda Liebes (who wrote his doctorate thesis for Scholem on the subject, &quot;Dictionary of the Vocabulary of the Zohar&quot; in 1976), and Daniel C. Matt, a student of Scholem&#x27;s who has published a critical edition of the &quot;Zohar&quot;.

==== Influences ====
Academic studies of the &quot;Zohar&quot; show that many of its ideas are based in the Talmud, various works of midrash, and earlier Jewish mystical works. Scholem writes:

:The writer had expert knowledge of the early material and he often used it as a foundation for his expositions, putting into it variations of his own. His main sources were the Babylonian Talmud, the complete Midrash Rabbah, the Midrash Tanhuma, and the two Pesiktot (Pesikta De-Rav Kahana or Pesikta Rabbati), the Midrash on Psalms, the Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, and the Targum Onkelos. Generally speaking, they are not quoted exactly, but translated into the peculiar style of the &quot;Zohar&quot; and summarized. [...]
:Less use is made of the halakhic Midrashim, the Jerusalem Talmud, and the other Targums, nor of the Midrashim like the Aggadat Shir ha-Shirim, the Midrash on Proverbs, and the Alfabet de-R. Akiva. It is not clear whether the author used the Yalkut Simeoni, or whether he knew the sources of its aggadah separately. Of the smaller Midrashim he used the Heikhalot Rabbati, the Alfabet de-Ben Sira, the Sefer Zerubabel, the Baraita de-Ma&#x27;aseh Bereshit, [and many others] [...]
At the same time, Scholem says, the author &quot;invent[ed] a number of fictitious works that the &quot;Zohar&quot; supposedly quotes, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the Sifra de-Adam, the Sifra de-Hanokh, the Sifra di-Shelomo Malka, the Sifra de-Rav Hamnuna Sava, the Sifra de-Rav Yeiva Sava, the Sifra de-Aggadeta, the Raza de-Razin and many others.&quot;

The &quot;Zohar&quot; also draws from the Bible commentaries written by medieval rabbis, including Rashi, Abraham ibn Ezra, David Kimhi and even authorities as late as Nachmanides and Maimonides, and earlier mystical texts such as the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; and the &quot;Bahir&quot; and the medieval writings of the Hasidei Ashkenaz.

Another influence that Scholem, and scholars like Yehudah Liebes and Ronit Meroz have identified was a circle of Spanish Kabbalists in Castile who dealt with the appearance of an evil side emanating from within the world of the sefirot. Scholem saw this dualism of good and evil within the Godhead as a kind of gnostic inclination within Kabbalah, and as a predecessor of the &quot;Sitra Ahra&quot; (the other, evil side) in the &quot;Zohar&quot;. The main text of the Castile circle, the &quot;Treatise on the Left Emanation&quot;, was written by Jacob ha-Cohen around 1265.

==Contents==
===Printings, editions, and indexing===
&quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot; was first printed in Mantua in 1557. The main body of the &quot;Zohar&quot; was printed in Cremona in 1558 (a one-volume edition), in Mantua in 1558-1560 (a three-volume edition), and in Salonika in 1597 (a two-volume edition). Each of these editions included somewhat different texts. When they were printed there were many partial manuscripts in circulation that were not available to the first printers. These were later printed as &quot;Zohar Chadash&quot; (lit. &quot;New Radiance&quot;), but &quot;Zohar Chadash&quot; actually contains parts that pertain to the &quot;Zohar&quot;, as well as &quot;Tikunim&quot; (plural of &quot;Tikun&quot;, &quot;Repair&quot;, see also &quot;Tikkun olam&quot;) that are akin to &quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot;, as described below. The term &quot;Zohar&quot;, in usage, may refer to just the first &quot;Zohar&quot; collection, with or without the applicable sections of &quot;Zohar Chadash&quot;, or to the entire &quot;Zohar&quot; and Tikunim.
Citations referring to the &quot;Zohar&quot; conventionally follow the volume and page numbers of the Mantua edition, while citations referring to &quot;Tikkunei haZohar&quot; follow the edition of Ortakoy (Constantinople) 1719 whose text and pagination became the basis for most subsequent editions. Volumes II and III begin their numbering anew, so citation can be made by &quot;parashah&quot; and page number (e.g. &quot;Zohar: Nasso&quot; 127a), or by volume and page number (e.g. &quot;Zohar&quot; III:127a).

===The &quot;New Zohar&quot; (זוהר חדש)===
After the book of the &quot;Zohar&quot; had been printed (in Mantua and in Cremona, in the Jewish years 5318–5320 or 1558–1560? CE), many more manuscripts were found that included paragraphs pertaining to the &quot;Zohar&quot; which had not been included in printed editions. The manuscripts pertained also to all parts of the &quot;Zohar&quot;; some were similar to &quot;Zohar&quot; on the Torah, some were similar to the inner parts of the &quot;Zohar&quot; (&quot;Midrash haNe&#x27;elam, Sitrei Otiyot&quot; and more), and some pertained to &quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot;. Some thirty years after the first edition of the &quot;Zohar&quot; was printed, the manuscripts were gathered and arranged according to the &quot;parashiyot&quot; of the Torah and the megillot (apparently the arrangement was done by the Kabbalist, Avraham haLevi of Tsfat), and were printed first in Salonika in Jewish year 5357 (1587? CE), and then in Kraków (5363), and afterwards in various editions.

=== Structure ===
According to Scholem, the &quot;Zohar&quot; can be divided into 21 types of content, of which the first 18 (a.–s.) are the work of the original author (probably de Leon) and the final 3 (t.–v.) are the work of a later imitator.

a. Untitled Torah commentary

A &quot;bulky part&quot; which is &quot;wholly composed of discursive commentaries on various passages from the Torah&quot;.

b. Book of Concealment (ספרא דצניעותא)

A short part of only six pages, containing a commentary to the first six chapters of Genesis. It is &quot;highly oracular and obscure,&quot; citing no authorities and explaining nothing.

c. Greater Assembly (אדרא רבא)

This part contains an explanation of the oracular hints in the previous section. Ben Yochai&#x27;s friends gather together to discuss secrets of Kabbalah. After the opening of the discussion by ben Yochai, the sages rise, one after the other, and lecture on the secret of Divinity, while ben Yochai adds to and responds to their words. The sages become steadily more ecstatic until three of them die. Scholem calls this part &quot;architecturally perfect.&quot;

d. Lesser Assembly (אדרא זוטא)

Ben Yochai dies and a speech is quoted in which he explains the previous section.

e. Assembly of the Tabernacle (אדרא דמשכנא)

This part has the same structure as c. but discusses instead the mysticism of prayer.

f. Palaces (היכלות)

Seven palaces of light are described, which are perceived by the devout in death. This description appears again in another passage, heavily embellished.

g. Secretum Secretorum (רזא דרזין)

An anonymous discourse on physiognomy and a discourse on chiromancy by ben Yochai.

h. Old Man (סבא)

An elaborate narrative about a speech by an old Kabbalist.

i. Child (ינוקא)

A story of a prodigy and his Kabbalistic speech.

k. Head of the Academy (רב מתיבתא)

A Pardes narrative in which a head of the celestial academy reveals secrets about the destinies of the soul.

l. Secrets of Torah (סתרי תורה)

Allegorical and mystical interpretations of Torah passages.

m. Mishnas (מתניתין)

Imitations of the Mishnaic style, designed to introduce longer commentaries in the style of the Talmud.

n. Zohar to the Song of Songs

Kabbalistic commentary to the Song of Songs.

o. Standard of Measure (קו המידה)

Profound interpretation of Deut. 6:4.

p. Secrets of Letters (סתרי אותיות)

A monologue by ben Yochai on the letters in the names of God and their use in creation.

q. Commentary to the Merkabah

r. Mystical Midrash (מדרש הנעלם)

A Kabbalistic commentary on the Torah, citing a wide variety of Talmudic sages. According to Ramaz, it is fit to be called &quot;Midrash haNe&#x27;elam&quot; because &quot;its topic is mostly the &quot;neshamah&quot; (an upper level of soul), the source of which is in &quot;Beri&#x27;ah&quot;, which is the place of the upper Gan Eden; and it is written in the &quot;Pardes&quot; that drash is in &quot;Beri&#x27;ah&quot;... and the revealed midrash is the secret of externality, and &quot;Midrash haNe&#x27;elam&quot; is the secret of internality, which is the neshamah. And this derush is founded on the neshamah; its name befits it—&quot;Midrash haNe&#x27;elam&quot;.

The language of &quot;Midrash haNe&#x27;elam&quot; is sometimes Hebrew, sometimes Aramaic, and sometimes both mixed. Unlike the body of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, its &quot;drashot&quot; are short and not long. Also, the topics it discusses—the work of Creation, the nature of the soul, the days of Mashiach, and &quot;Olam Haba&quot;—are not of the type found in the &quot;Zohar&quot;, which are the nature of God, the emanation of worlds, the &quot;forces&quot; of evil, and more.

s. Mystic Midrash on Ruth

A commentary on the Book of Ruth in the same style.

t. Faithful Shepherd (רעיא מהימנא)

By far the largest &quot;book&quot; included in the &quot;Zohar&quot;, this is a Kabbalistic commentary on Moses&#x27; teachings revealed to ben Yochai and his friends. Moshe Cordovero said, &quot;Know that this book, which is called &quot;Ra&#x27;aya Meheimna&quot;, which ben Yochai made with the tzadikim who are in Gan Eden, was a repair of the Shekhinah, and an aid and support for it in the exile, for there is no aid or support for the Shekhinah besides the secrets of the Torah... And everything that he says here of the secrets and the concepts—it is all with the intention of unifying the Shekhinah and aiding it during the exile.

u. Rectifications of the Zohar (תקוני זוהר)
&quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot;, which was printed as a separate book, includes seventy commentaries called &quot;Tikunim&quot; (lit. Repairs) and an additional eleven &quot;Tikunim&quot;. In some editions, &quot;Tikunim&quot; are printed that were already printed in the &quot;Zohar Chadash&quot;, which in their content and style also pertain to &quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot;.

Each of the seventy &quot;Tikunim&quot; of &quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot; begins by explaining the word &quot;Bereishit&quot; (בראשית), and continues by explaining other verses, mainly in &quot;parashat Bereishit&quot;, and also from the rest of Tanakh. And all this is in the way of &quot;Sod&quot;, in commentaries that reveal the hidden and mystical aspects of the Torah.

&quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot; and &quot;Ra&#x27;aya Meheimna&quot; are similar in style, language, and concepts, and are different from the rest of the &quot;Zohar&quot;. For example, the idea of the Four Worlds is found in &quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot; and &quot;Ra&#x27;aya Meheimna&quot; but not elsewhere, as is true of the very use of the term &quot;Kabbalah&quot;. In terminology, what is called Kabbalah in &quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot; and &quot;Ra&#x27;aya Meheimna&quot; is simply called &quot;razin&quot; (clues or hints) in the rest of the &quot;Zohar&quot;. In &quot;Tikunei haZohar&quot; there are many references to &quot;chibura kadma&#x27;ah&quot; (meaning &quot;the earlier book&quot;). This refers to the main body of the &quot;Zohar&quot;.

v. Further Additions

These include later &quot;Tikkunim&quot; and other texts in the same style.

==Influence==
===Judaism===
On the one hand, the &quot;Zohar&quot; was lauded by many rabbis because it opposed religious formalism, stimulated one&#x27;s imagination and emotions, and for many people helped reinvigorate the experience of prayer. In many places prayer had become a mere external religious exercise, while prayer was supposed to be a means of transcending earthly affairs and placing oneself in union with God.

According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;On the other hand, the Zohar was censured by many rabbis because it propagated many superstitious beliefs, and produced a host of mystical dreamers, whose overexcited imaginations peopled the world with spirits, demons, and all kinds of good and bad influences.&quot; Many classical rabbis, especially Maimonides, viewed all such beliefs as a violation of Jewish principles of faith. Its mystic mode of explaining some commandments was applied by its commentators to all religious observances, and produced a strong tendency to substitute mystic Judaism in the place of traditional Rabbinic Judaism. For example, Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, began to be looked upon as the embodiment of God in temporal life, and every ceremony performed on that day was considered to have an influence upon the superior world.

Elements of the &quot;Zohar&quot; crept into the liturgy of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the religious poets not only used the allegorism and symbolism of the &quot;Zohar&quot; in their compositions, but even adopted its style, e.g. the use of erotic terminology to illustrate the relations between man and God. Thus, in the language of some Jewish poets, the beloved one&#x27;s curls indicate the mysteries of the Deity; sensuous pleasures, and especially intoxication, typify the highest degree of divine love as ecstatic contemplation; while the wine-room represents merely the state through which the human qualities merge or are exalted into those of God.

The &quot;Zohar&quot; is also credited with popularizing de Leon&#x27;s PaRDeS codification of biblical exegesis.

===Christian mysticism===
According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;The enthusiasm felt for the Zohar was shared by many Christian scholars, such as Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Johann Reuchlin, Aegidius of Viterbo, etc., all of whom believed that the book contained proofs of the truth of Christianity. They were led to this belief by the analogies existing between some of the teachings of the &quot;Zohar&quot; and certain Christian dogmas, such as the fall and redemption of man, and the dogma of the Trinity, which seems to be expressed in the &quot;Zohar&quot; in the following terms:

The Ancient of Days has three heads. He reveals himself in three archetypes, all three forming but one. He is thus symbolized by the number Three. They are revealed in one another. [These are:] first, secret, hidden &#x27;Wisdom&#x27;; above that the Holy Ancient One; and above Him the Unknowable One. None knows what He contains; He is above all conception. He is therefore called for man &#x27;Non-Existing&#x27; [&quot;Ayin&quot;] (Zohar, iii. 288b).
According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;This and other similar doctrines found in the Zohar are now known to be much older than Christianity, but the Christian scholars who were led by the similarity of these teachings to certain Christian dogmas deemed it their duty to propagate the Zohar.&quot;

<text>Zope is a family of free and open-source web application servers written in Python, and their associated online community. Zope stands for &quot;Z Object Publishing Environment&quot;, and was the first system using the now common object publishing methodology for the Web. Zope has been called a Python killer app, an application that helped put Python in the spotlight.

Over the last few years, the Zope community has spawned several additional web frameworks with disparate aims and principles, but sharing philosophy, people, and source code. Zope 2 is still the most widespread of these frameworks, largely thanks to the Plone content management system, which runs on Zope 2. BlueBream (earlier called Zope 3) is less widespread but underlies several large sites, including Launchpad. Grok was started as a more programmer-friendly framework, &quot;Zope 3 for cavemen&quot;, and in 2009 Pyramid gained popularity in the Zope community as a minimalistic framework based on Zope principles.

==History==
The Zope Corporation was formed in 1995 in Fredericksburg, Virginia under the name Digital Creations, as a joint venture with InfiNet (a joint newspaper chain venture). The company developed a classified advertisement engine for the Internet. In 1997, the company became independently owned and private. The company&#x27;s software engineers are led by CTO Jim Fulton. PythonLabs, creators of Python, became part of the company in 2000 (Python founder Guido van Rossum left Zope Corp in 2003).

What is now known as Zope 2 began with the merging of three separate software products – Bobo, Document Template, and BoboPOS – into the Principia application server. At the behest of its largest investor, Opticality Ventures, Principia was re-released as free software under the name Zope in 1998. Bobo, and therefore Zope, was the first Web object publishing solution.

In November 2004, Zope 3 was released. Zope 3 is a complete rewrite that preserves only the original ZODB object database. It is directly intended for enterprise Web application development using the newest development paradigms. Zope 3 is, however, not compatible with Zope 2, so Zope 2 applications do not run on Zope 3. It was originally intended to introduce a backwards-compatibility layer so that Zope 2 software would run on Zope 3. Instead a module known as Five introduced the new Zope 3 paradigms into Zope 2, although full compatibility isn&#x27;t possible that way either.

The existence of two incompatible Web frameworks called Zope has caused a lot of confusion. In response, in January 2010, Zope 3 was renamed &quot;BlueBream&quot;. &quot;Zope&quot; and &quot;blue bream&quot; are names of a kind of fish, Ballerus ballerus.

==Zope Foundation==

The Zope Foundation is an organization that promotes the development of the Zope platform by supporting the community that develops and maintains the relevant software components. The community includes both open source software, documentation and web infrastructure contributors, as well as business and organization consumers of the software platform. It manages the zope.org websites, an infrastructure for open source collaboration.

==Zope versions==
===Zope 2===

A Zope website is usually composed of objects in a Zope Object Database, not files on a file system, as is usual with most web servers. This allows users to harness the advantages of object technologies, such as encapsulation. Zope maps URLs to objects using the containment hierarchy of such objects; methods are considered to be contained in their objects as well. Data can be stored in other databases as well, or on the file system, but ZODB is the most common solution.

Zope provides two mechanisms for HTML templating: Document Template Markup Language (DTML) and Zope Page Templates (ZPT). DTML is a tag-based language that allows implementation of simple scripting in the templates. DTML has provisions for variable inclusion, conditions, and loops. However, DTML can be problematic: DTML tags interspersed with HTML form non-valid HTML documents, and its use requires care when including logic into templates, to retain code readability. The use of DTML is discouraged by many leading Zope developers. ZPT is a technology that addresses the shortcomings of DTML. ZPT templates can be either well-formed XML documents or HTML documents, in which all special markup is presented as attributes in the TAL (Template Attribute Language) namespace. ZPT offers a very limited set of tools for conditional inclusion and repetition of XML elements. Consequently, the templates are usually quite simple, with most logic implemented in Python code. One significant advantage of ZPT templates is that they can be edited in most graphical HTML editors. ZPT also offers direct support for internationalization.

Zope 2 underlies the Plone content management system, as well as the ERP5 open source enterprise resource planning system.

===BlueBream===

BlueBream is a rewrite by the Zope developers of the Zope 2 web application server. It was created under the name &quot;Zope 3&quot;, but the existence of two incompatible frameworks with the same name caused much confusion, and Zope 3 was renamed &quot;BlueBream&quot; in January 2010. BlueBream is distributed under the terms of the Zope Public License and is thus free software.

Zope 2 has proven itself as a useful framework for Web applications development, but its use revealed some shortcomings. To name a few, creating Zope 2 products involves copying a lot of boilerplate code – &quot;magic&quot; code – that just has to be there, and the built-in management interface is difficult to modify or replace. Zope 3 was a rewrite of the software that attempts to address these shortcomings while retaining the advantages of Zope that led to its popularity. BlueBream is based on a component architecture that makes it easy to mix software components of various origins written in Python. Although originally intended as a replacement for Zope 2, the Zope Component Architecture has instead been backported to Zope 2, starting with Zope 2.8. Many Zope platforms such as Plone are going through the same type of piece-by-piece rewriting. The first production release of the new software, Zope X3 3.0.0, was released on November 6, 2004.

====History====
The Zope 3 project started in February 2001 as an effort to develop a new version of Zope as an almost complete rewrite, with the goal to retain the successful features of Zope 2 while trying to fix some of its shortcomings. The goal was to create a more developer-friendly and flexible platform for programming web applications than Zope 2 is. The project began with the development of a component architecture, which allows the structuring of code into small, composable units with introspectable interfaces. The interfaces are supported by an interface package in order to provide the functionality of explicitly declared interfaces to the Python language. The first production release of the software, Zope X3, was released on November 6, 2004. In January 2010 Zope 3 was renamed BlueBream.

====Technology====
The goal of the project was to enable programmers to use Zope in order to expose arbitrary Python objects as model objects to the web without the need to make these objects fulfill particular behavior requirements. In Zope 2 there had been many behavior requirements to allow objects to participate in the framework, which resulted in a large amount of mixin base classes and special attributes. BlueBream uses a model/view architecture, separating the presentation code from the problem domain code. Views and models are linked together by the component architecture.

The libraries underlying BlueBream have been evolving into a collection of useful libraries for web application development rather than a single, monolithic application server. BlueBream includes separate packages for interfaces, component architecture, HTTP server, publisher, Zope Object Database (ZODB), Zope Page Templates, I18N, security policy, and so on. The component architecture is used to glue these together. The component architecture is configured using a ZCML (Zope Configuration Markup Language), an XML based configuration file language.

The Zope 3 project pioneered the practice of sprints for open source software development. Sprints are intensive development sessions when programmers, often from different countries, gather in one room and work together for a couple of days or even several weeks. During the sprints various practices drawn from agile software development are used, such as pair programming and test-driven development. Besides the goal of developing software, sprints are also useful for geographically separated developers to meet in person and attracting new people to the project. They also serve as a way for the participants to learn from each other.

BlueBream is considered a stable framework, used on production projects worldwide, most notably Launchpad.

===Zope Toolkit===

As a result of the development of Zope 3 / BlueBream, there are now many independent Python packages used and developed as a part of BlueBream, and although many of these are usable outside of BlueBream, many are not. The Zope Toolkit (ZTK) project was started to clarify which packages were usable outside BlueBream, and to improve the re-usability of the packages. Thus the Zope Toolkit is a base for the Zope frameworks. Zope 2.12 is the first release of a web framework that builds on Zope Toolkit, and Grok and BlueBream were set to have releases based on the ZTK during 2010.

===Grok===

In 2006 the Grok project was started by a number of Zope 3 developers who wanted to make Zope 3 technology more agile in use and more accessible to newcomers. Grok has since then seen regular releases and its core technology (Martian, grokcore.component) is also finding uptake in other Zope 3 and Zope 2 based projects.

===Zope 4===
In late 2017, development began on Zope 4. Zope 4 is a successor to Zope 2.13, making many changes that are not backwards compatible with Zope 2.

===Zope 5===
Zope 5 was released in 2020.

==Zope page templates==
As mentioned previously, Zope page templates are themselves XHTML documents, which means they can be viewed and edited using normal HTML editors or XHTML compliant tools (a big advantage compared to other template languages used for Web applications). Templates can also be checked for XHTML compliance so you can be fairly confident that they will automatically expand into proper XHTML.

However, these page templates are not meant to be rendered as is. Instead they are marked up with additional elements and attributes in special XML namespaces (see below). This additional information is used to describe how the page template should ultimately be processed.

Here are some basic examples. To conditionally include a particular element, like a codice_1 element, simply add the codice_2 attribute to the element as follows:
&lt;div tal:condition=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
To control what appears inside an element, use the codice_3 attribute like this:
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span tal:content=&quot;...&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;


Finally, to introduce or replace values of attributes use the codice_4 attribute as below. You can use Python to alter the href at runtime.
&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; tal:attributes=&quot;href python:&#x27;http://someurl.com/%s&#x27;%someobject&quot;&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
This is a very cursory explanation of Zope Page Templates. The behavior of Zope Page Templates is almost completely described by a template language, fixed on TAL, TALES, and METAL specifications:
* Template Attribute Language (TAL),
* Template Attribute Language Expression Syntax (TALES),
* Macro Expansion Template Attribute Language (METAL).

==Notable software using Zope==
* SchoolTool is an open source student information system that uses Zope.
* Plone is an open source content management system that uses Zope.

<doc id="34474" wikidata="Q3112905" url="?curid=34474" title="Nguni stick-fighting">
<text>Nguni stick-fighting (also known as &quot;donga&quot;, or &quot;dlala &#x27;nduku&quot;, which literally translates as &#x27;playing sticks&#x27;) is a martial art traditionally practiced by teenage Nguni herdboys in South Africa. Each combatant is armed with two long sticks, one of which is used for defense and the other for offense. Little armor is used. For up to five hours, players alternate between offense and defense to score points based on which body part is struck.

Although Nguni/Xhosa styles of fighting may use only two sticks, variations of Bantu/Nguni stick-fighting throughout Southern Africa incorporate shields as part of the stick-fighting weaponry. Zulu stick-fighting uses an &quot;isikhwili&quot; or attacking stick, an &quot;ubhoko&quot; or defending stick and an &quot;ihawu&quot; or defending shield. 

The object is for two opposing warriors to fight each other to establish which of them is the strongest or the &quot;Bull&quot; (Inkunzi). In modern times this usually occurs as part of the wedding ceremony where warriors from the bridegroom&#x27;s household and area welcome warriors from the bride&#x27;s household and area to meet to &quot;get to know each other&quot;, other groups of warriors may also be welcome to join in. Warriors do this by engaging in combat with one another. An &quot;induna&quot; or War Captain / Referee from each group of warriors keeps his crew in check and keeps order between fighters. 

This tradition is one which arguably developed in societies, cultures and civilisations that used herding as part of their systems of survival; where there are cows, there are stick-fighters. The old regimental structures of the great uShaka KaSenzangakhona KaJama dominate current modern Zulu stick-fighting.

Film maker SiyaBonga Makhathini has directed the film &quot;We Still are Warriors&quot; which captures the essence of the modern-day Zulu stick-fighter, descendant of the kings of old. 

Nelson Mandela practiced Nguni stick-fighting as a child, and it was featured on the Discovery and BBC reality TV show &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;. It has been featured in Season 1 of the television series &quot;Deadliest Warrior.&quot;

Nguni stick-fighting is resurfacing and attracting crowds despite being previously banned in some parts of South Africa.

<text>The ZX81 is a home computer that was produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair&#x27;s ZX80 and designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful; more than 1.5 million units were sold. In the United States it was initially sold as the ZX-81 under licence by Timex. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81: the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorized ZX81 clones were produced in several countries.

The ZX81 was designed to be small, simple, and above all, inexpensive, with as few components as possible. Video output is to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data are loaded and saved onto compact audio cassettes. It uses only four silicon chips and 1 KB of memory. It has no power switch or moving parts, with the exception of a VHF TV channel selector switch present in some models. It has a pressure-sensitive membrane keyboard. The ZX81&#x27;s limitations prompted a market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought designer Rick Dickinson a Design Council award.

The ZX81 could be bought by mail order preassembled or, for a lower price, in kit form. It was the first inexpensive mass-market home computer to be sold by high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the point when computing in Britain became an activity for the general public rather than the preserve of businessmen and electronics hobbyists. It produced a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on to have roles in the British computer industry. The ZX81&#x27;s commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain&#x27;s leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company&#x27;s founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.

== Features ==
The ZX81 has a base configuration of 1 KB of on-board memory that can officially be expanded externally to 16 KB. Its single circuit board is housed inside a wedge-shaped plastic case measuring wide by high. The memory is provided by either a single 4118 (1024 bit × 8) or two 2114 (1024 bit × 4) RAM chips. There are only three other onboard chips: a 3.5 MHz Z80A 8-bit microprocessor from NEC, an uncommitted logic array (ULA) chip from Ferranti, and an 8 KB ROM providing a simple Sinclair BASIC interpreter. The entire machine weighs just . Early versions of the external RAM cartridge contain 15 KB of memory using an assortment of memory chips, while later versions contain 16 KB chips with the lowest addressed kilobyte disabled.

The front part of the case is occupied by an integrated 40-key membrane keyboard. The keyboard is mechanically very simple, consisting of 40 pressure-pad switches and 8 diodes under a plastic overlay, connected in a matrix of 8 rows and 5 columns.

The ZX81 uses a standard QWERTY keyboard layout displaying 20 graphic and 54 inverse video characters. However ZX81 BASIC commands are not typed in letter by letter, instead each key has up to five key functions. This is how the user displays the ZX81&#x27;s BASIC keywords, functions, mathematical operations and graphics.

The ZX81 key&#x27;s function is determined by a combination of context in the command and mode selection e.g. codice_1 and codice_2 keys to select the red keyboard functions. For example, the P key combines the letter codice_3, the codice_4 character, and the BASIC commands codice_5 and codice_6.

Context mode feedback is displayed by the cursor displaying an inverted letter;
* codice_7 for Keywords, 
* codice_8 for Letters, 
* codice_9 for Function keys (show in red) or 
* codice_10 for Graphics characters.
The fact that to effect a codice_11 or backspace/delete operation took 2 key presses encouraged ZX81 programmers to be brief and type carefully when entering text or code.

The ZX81&#x27;s primary input/output is delivered via four sockets on the left side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine&#x27;s character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5 mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This stores each data bit as a number of pulses followed by an inter-bit silence of 1300 μs. Each pulse is a 150 μs &quot;high&quot; then a 150 μs &quot;low&quot;. A &quot;0&quot; bit consists of four pulses while a &#x27;1&#x27; bit is nine pulses, so the baud rate varies between 400 bit/s for all &quot;0&quot;s and 250 bit/s for all &quot;1&quot;s. A file with equal amounts of &#x27;0&#x27;s and &quot;1&quot;s would be stored at 307 bit/s (38 B/s). This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of current at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.

The ULA chip, described by the ZX81 manual as the &quot;dogsbody&quot; of the system, has a number of key functions that competing computers share between multiple chips and integrated circuits. These comprise the following:
* Synchronising the screen display;
* Generating a 6.5 MHz clock, from which a 3.25 MHz clock is derived for the processor;
* Outputting an audio signal to a cassette recorder in SAVE mode;
* Processing the incoming cassette audio signal in LOAD mode;
* Sensing keystrokes;
* Using memory addresses provided by the CPU to decide when ROM and RAM should be active;
* Controlling general system timing.

The ZX81&#x27;s built-in RF modulator can output a video picture to a UHF 625-line television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France and Luxembourg required a slightly modified version of the machine to match the positive video modulation of CCIR System L sets, while the United States and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback in the way that they handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.

The ZX81&#x27;s designers adopted an improved approach, involving the use of two modes called SLOW and FAST respectively. In SLOW mode, also called &quot;compute and display&quot; mode, the ZX81 concentrates on driving the display. It runs the current program for only about a quarter of the time – in effect slowing the machine down fourfold, although in practice the speed difference between FAST and SLOW modes depends on what computation is being done. In FAST mode, processing occurs continuously, but the display is abandoned to its own devices – equivalent to the ZX80&#x27;s standard operating mode.

Another hardware quirk produced one of the most distinctive aspects of the ZX81&#x27;s screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.

The unexpanded ZX81&#x27;s tiny memory presents a major challenge to programmers. Simply displaying a full screen takes up to 793 bytes, the system variables take up another 125 bytes, and the program, input buffer and stacks need more memory on top of that. Nonetheless, ingenious programmers are able to achieve a surprising amount with just 1 KB. One example is the &quot;Super Micro Chess Engine&quot; by Stefano Maragò, which includes all of the rules of chess. The ZX81 conserves its memory to a certain extent by representing entire BASIC commands as one-byte tokens, stored as individual &quot;characters&quot; in the upper reaches of the machine&#x27;s unique (non-ASCII) character set.

The edge connector or external interface at the rear of the ZX81 is an extension of the main printed circuit board. This provides a set of address, control, and data lines that can be used to communicate with external devices. Enthusiasts and a variety of third-party companies make use of this facility to create a wide range of add-ons for the ZX81.

=== Comparisons with other computing devices ===

== History ==
=== Background ===

Clive Sinclair, a former radio kit salesman, established his first company, Sinclair Radionics, in 1962. The company made its name producing a wide range of cheap electronics aimed at the hobbyist market. Its products include amplifiers, radios, multimeters and other items which were generally sold in kit form to hi-fi enthusiasts and other electronics hobbyists. The company entered a new market in 1972 when it launched the first &quot;slimline&quot; pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive. Radionics followed up by launching a wide range of pocket calculators. The company&#x27;s subsequent expansion made it Europe&#x27;s biggest calculator manufacturer by 1975.

By the late 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was experiencing serious difficulties. It lost its ability to compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch of a new generation of Japanese-produced calculators with liquid-crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair&#x27;s LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.

Clive Sinclair&#x27;s relationship with the NEB was fraught due to conflicting notions about which direction the company should go. Radionics had begun a project to develop a home computer but the NEB wanted to concentrate on the instrument side of the business, which was virtually the only area where Radionics was profitable. Sinclair disagreed vehemently with what he characterised as the view &quot;that there was no future in consumer electronics&quot;. This and other disputes led to Sinclair resigning from Radionics in July 1979.

While he was struggling with the NEB, Clive Sinclair turned to a &quot;corporate lifeboat&quot; in the shape of an existing corporate shell under his exclusive control – a company called Ablesdeal Ltd, which he had established in 1973 and later renamed Science of Cambridge. It became a vehicle through which he could pursue his own projects, free of the interference of the NEB. Despite his later success in the field, Sinclair saw computers as merely a means to an end. As he told the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in April 1985, &quot;We only got involved in computers in order to fund the rest of the business&quot;, specifically the development of the ultimately unsuccessful TV80 pocket television and C5 electric vehicle. In an interview with &quot;Practical Computing&quot;, Sinclair explained:

=== Precursors: the MK14 and ZX80 ===
By the late 1970s, American companies were producing simple home computer kits such as the MITS Altair and IMSAI 8080. This aroused interest among electronics hobbyists in the UK but relatively high prices and lower disposable income reduced the appeal of the American products. &quot;New Scientist&quot; stated in 1977 that &quot;the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain&quot;. Off-the-shelf personal computers were also available for the high end of the market but were extremely expensive; Olivetti&#x27;s offering cost £2,000, and the Commodore PET, launched in 1979, sold for £700. There was nothing for the hobbyist at the low end of the market. Sinclair realised that this provided a useful commercial opportunity.

Sinclair&#x27;s first home computer was the MK14, which was launched in kit form in June 1978. It was a long way from being a mass-market product. Its very name – MK standing for &quot;Microcomputer Kit&quot; – was indicative of its origins as a product developed by, and for, hobbyists.

It had no screen but instead used an LED segment display (though Science of Cambridge did produce an add-on module allowing it to be hooked up to a UHF TV); it had no case, consisting of an exposed circuit board; it had no built-in storage capabilities and only 256 bytes of memory; and input was via a 20-key hexadecimal keyboard.

Despite the limitations of the machine it sold a respectable 10–15,000 units; by comparison, the much more expensive Apple II had only sold 9,000 units in the United States, a much bigger market, in 1978. This success convinced Clive Sinclair that there was an untapped market for low-cost computers that could profitably be exploited.

Sinclair followed up the MK14 by producing the ZX80, at the time the world&#x27;s smallest and cheapest computer, which was launched in January 1980 costing £99.95 (equivalent to £390 at 2021 prices.) The company conducted no market research whatsoever prior to the launch of the ZX80; according to Clive Sinclair, he &quot;simply had a hunch&quot; that the general public was sufficiently interested to make such a project feasible and went ahead with ordering 100,000 sets of parts so that he could launch at high volume.

The ZX80&#x27;s design introduced many key features that were carried over to the ZX81; as Sinclair himself later said, &quot;the ZX80 was very much a stepping stone to the ZX81&quot;. The design was driven entirely by the desired price – the machine had to cost less than £100 but still make a healthy profit. Its distinctive wedge-shaped white case concealing the circuitry and the touch-sensitive membrane keyboard were the brainchild of Rick Dickinson, a young British industrial designer who had recently been hired by Sinclair. As he later recalled of Sinclair&#x27;s approach, &quot;Everything was cost driven. The design was the face of the machine.&quot; The unconventional keyboard was the outcome of Sinclair&#x27;s cost-cutting. It made use of a sheet of plastic, on which the keys were printed, overlaying a metallic circuit that registered when a key was pressed. This avoided the expense of providing a typewriter-style keyboard, though the design had many drawbacks when it came to usability and &quot;feel&quot;.

Inside the case, there were many more similarities with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1 KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. The main difference between the two machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.

The ZX80 was an immediate success, selling 20,000 units over the following nine months. Science of Cambridge was producing ZX80s at the rate of 9,000 a month by the end of 1980 and within 18 months of its launch the company had sold 100,000 units. The commercial success of the ZX80 made a follow-up product inevitable. The company was renamed Sinclair Computers in November 1980, reflecting its new focus, and became Sinclair Research in March 1981.

=== BBC Micro bid ===
The launch of the ZX81 was catalysed in part by the BBC Computer Literacy Project&#x27;s plan to produce The Computer Programme TV series, to be broadcast in 1982, aimed at popularising computing and programming. The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC-branded home computer to tie in with the series. When Clive Sinclair heard of the project in December 1980, he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing a new version of the ZX80, to be called the ZX81, in early 1981. It would remedy some of the ZX80&#x27;s deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced. Sinclair wanted the ZX81 to be a candidate for the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption. He pointed out that there were already 40,000 users of the ZX80 and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of 100,000 ZX81 users.

A prototype ZX81 was demonstrated to BBC representatives in January 1981, while Sinclair&#x27;s local rival Acorn Computers put forward their proposed Proton computer, a design – of which a prototype did not yet exist – based on the Acorn Atom. To Sinclair&#x27;s dismay, the contract to produce the BBC Micro went to Acorn, which launched the machine in January 1982. Paul Kriwaczek, the producer of &quot;The Computer Programme&quot;, explained his reservations in a March 1982 interview with &quot;Your Computer:&quot;

Sinclair was critical of the BBC&#x27;s decision, accusing it of incompetence and arrogance. Shortly after Acorn won the BBC contract the Government issued a recommended list of computers, including the BBC Micro and Research Machines 380Z, that schools could purchase, with the aid of a grant, for half price; Sinclair&#x27;s computers were not included on the list. Sinclair responded by launching his own half-price deal, offering schools the chance to buy a ZX81 and 16 KB RAM pack for £60, plus a ZX Printer at half price, for a total cost of £90. As the cheapest Government-approved system was £130, this was an attractive offer for some schools and about 2,300 bought Sinclair&#x27;s package, although 85% adopted the BBC Micro.

=== Development and manufacture ===

The development of the ZX81 got under way even before the ZX80 had been launched. Sinclair&#x27;s chief engineer, Jim Westwood, was given the task of improving the ZX80&#x27;s hardware to reduce the number of components and thus bring down the cost. He also sought to fix some of the more annoying problems with the ZX80. Westwood and his colleagues found that the component count could be reduced greatly by combining eighteen of the ZX80&#x27;s chips into a single uncommitted logic array (ULA), a type of general-purpose chip full of logic gates that were connected up as the customer required during chip manufacture. This short-lived technology of the day was cheaper and quicker than the design of a customised logic chip, which typically required very high volumes to recoup its development cost. Ferranti produced the new chip for Sinclair, who hailed Westwood&#x27;s design as a triumph of innovation: &quot;The ZX81 had four chips when our nearest competitor in this respect, the TRS-80, had 44.&quot; Only 70% of the logic gates on the ULA were supposed to be used, but Sinclair decided to use them all to squeeze more functions in. This resulted in the machine becoming uncomfortably warm during usage. Computing folklore held that the ZX81 had to be refrigerated by balancing a carton of cold milk on top of the case.

The ZX81&#x27;s ROM was doubled to 8 KB, from the ZX80&#x27;s 4 KB ROM. This enabled a fuller implementation of a version of ANSI Minimal BASIC (termed Sinclair BASIC by the company). Clive Sinclair re-commissioned a company called Nine Tiles, which had produced the ZX80 ROM, to develop the new ROM software for the ZX81. The code was written by John Grant, the owner of Nine Tiles, and Steve Vickers, who had joined the company in January 1980. Grant concentrated on the software that drove the ZX81&#x27;s hardware, while Vickers developed the new BASIC and the accompanying manual. Sinclair&#x27;s brief to the pair was fairly non-specific but primarily concerned remedying a key defect of the ZX80 so that the new machine could be used for practical programming and calculations. Vickers later recalled:

The new ROM incorporated trigonometric and floating-point functions, which its predecessor had lacked – the ZX80 could only deal with whole numbers. Grant came up with one of the ZX81&#x27;s more novel features, a syntax checker that indicated errors in BASIC code as soon as it was entered (rather than, as was standard at the time, only disclosing coding errors when a program was run). Unfortunately for Vickers, he introduced a briefly notorious error – the so-called &quot;square-root bug&quot; that caused the square root of 0.25 to be returned erroneously as 1.3591409 – as a result of problems with integrating the ZX Printer code into the ROM. Although it was eventually fixed, the bug became the subject of controversy and Sinclair was forced to replace some of the ZX81s sold to early customers. On a more positive note, Vickers&#x27; work on the manual was received favourably, being described in 1983 as &quot;one of the classic texts on BASIC&quot;. Max Phillips commented in a &quot;What Micro?&quot; retrospective:

The task of designing the ZX81&#x27;s case again fell to Rick Dickinson, who produced an updated version of the ZX80&#x27;s wedge-shaped case. This time round, the design team were able to use injection moulding, which enabled them to deliver a higher-quality case. Dickinson originally envisaged the ZX81 as &quot;an expandable range of boxes following a vaguely modular approach with a common width&quot;, though this approach was eventually dropped. From start to finish, the design process took about six months.
The ZX81 was launched on 5 March 1981 in two versions (though with identical components) – a pre-assembled machine or a cheaper kit version, which the user could assemble themself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company&#x27;s Dryburgh factory. Timex had not been an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor, as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis at the beginning of the 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex&#x27;s director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business.

This shift by Timex came at an ideal time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved more popular than expected and Sinclair&#x27;s existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources to deal with the demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order. It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty-eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded; anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81&#x27;s launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra £20 ROM chip into the circuit board.

The reliability of the ZX81 was controversial. W.H. Smith, one of the machine&#x27;s key distributors, had a company policy of ordering a third more ZX81s than were actually required for sale, so that it would have enough replacements for faulty machines. Similar problems were reported in the US market, where contemporary reports suggested that only a third of the ZX81s shipped actually worked. However, figures released by Sinclair claimed that only 2.4 per cent of pre-assembled machines were returned, although 13 per cent of kits were returned. Clive Sinclair strongly denied any problem with reliability:

Sinclair attributed the higher failure rate of the kits to customers breaking the components by inserting or soldering them the wrong way, though the company admitted that there was a persistent problem with power supplies that affected both kits and pre-assembled ZX81s. The bigger problem was perhaps Sinclair&#x27;s lack of after-sales service, which Robin Clarke of &quot;New Scientist&quot; described as &quot;one of the worst after-sales performance records of any company ever established.&quot; The &quot;Financial Times&quot; observed that &quot;Clive Sinclair&#x27;s offices are filled with returned computers which can take months to be repaired.&quot; The company&#x27;s slowness in replacing returns and delivering freshly ordered machines meant that Sinclair Research gained a reputation for poor customer service.

=== Marketing ===
The marketing of the ZX81 was handled by Sinclair&#x27;s long-standing marketing agency Primary Contact (now part of Ogilvy &amp; Mather), which had provided marketing services for Sinclair since 1971 and was to continue doing so until 1985. Sinclair&#x27;s entry into the nascent home computing market gave Primary Contact a major challenge – how to market a product simultaneously at hobbyists and at the &quot;man on the street&quot;, who probably had little or no computer literacy. The answer was to pursue what the journalist David O&#x27;Reilly of &quot;MicroScope&quot; magazine described as a single-minded &quot;user-friendly strategy.&quot; Chris Fawkes, one of Primary Contact&#x27;s directors, explained: &quot;We brought personal computers to the mass market by showing that you didn&#x27;t have to be a whizzkid to use one.&quot; As Clive Sinclair put it in a 1982 interview with &quot;Your Computer&quot;,

According to Ben Rosen, by pricing the ZX81 so low, &quot;Sinclair has opened up a completely new market among people who had never previously considered owning a computer.&quot; Clive Sinclair acknowledged the role that guesswork had played in his decision to launch the ZX81 on such a large scale: &quot;It was a surmise that the man in the street would want such a computer. He does, and our information is that a lot of people are using the machines avidly.&quot; A &quot;New Scientist&quot; retrospective published in 1986 commented:


High-profile advertising was central to the marketing campaign. Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company, it had a long-standing policy of using large-scale advertisements that stood out in stark contrast to the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers. Superlatives, exhortations, appeals to patriotism, testimonials, eye-catching drawings and photographs on double-page spreads, varying from month to month, were used to drum up mail order business for Sinclair. The launch advertising for the ZX81 illustrates this approach. A photograph of the ZX81 alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a double-page spread. The value for money of Sinclair&#x27;s products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread. The ZX81&#x27;s benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan &quot;Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer – the heart of a system that grows with you&quot;. The advertisement highlighted &quot;ZX81 BASIC Programming&quot;, the manual written by Steve Vickers, as &quot;a complete course in BASIC programming, from first principles to complex programs.&quot; The educational benefits of the ZX81 were stressed (&quot;it&#x27;s still very simple to teach yourself computing&quot;) and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non-technical terms. For instance, the ZX81&#x27;s idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single keystroke – the result of the memory-saving method of using one-byte tokens to represent keywords – was presented as &quot;eliminat[ing] a great deal of tiresome typing&quot;. The ZX81&#x27;s British character was emphasised; it was &quot;designed by Sinclair and custom-built in Britain.&quot; Sinclair&#x27;s advertising in the United States provides an illustration of how the company perceived the ZX81&#x27;s purpose:

This approach to advertising was driven by Sinclair&#x27;s reliance on mail-order marketing. It came with a high up-front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it had the advantage of ensuring that all sales were firm and pre-paid. A big splash on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign, though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand. The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over-the-counter sales by &quot;getting the story across&quot;, as Clive Sinclair put it: &quot;Not that big a proportion do buy on mail order, but they see the ads, and that helps to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops.&quot;

Sinclair himself became a focal point for the marketing campaign, putting a human face on the business, while Sinclair Research was portrayed in the media as a plucky British challenger taking on the technical and marketing might of giant American and Japanese corporations. As David O&#x27;Reilly noted, &quot;by astute use of public relations, particularly playing up his image of a Briton taking on the world, Sinclair has become the best-known name in micros.&quot; The popular press soon latched onto the image. His &quot;Uncle Clive&quot; persona is said to have been created by the gossip columnist for &quot;Personal Computer World&quot;, while the media praised Sinclair as a visionary genius (or even, in the words of &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;the most prodigious inventor since Leonardo.&quot;) As Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy put it, Sinclair outgrew &quot;the role of microcomputer manufacturer and accepted the mantle of pioneering boffin leading Britain into a technological utopia.&quot;

Pricing was central to the marketing strategy, as it had been through Sinclair&#x27;s career. The ZX81 had been designed to meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 in the case of the Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair&#x27;s own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.

According to Sinclair himself, the £69.95 price was chosen after applying the &quot;experience curve&quot; developed by the Boston Consulting Group. Sinclair&#x27;s prior experience in the calculator market had highlighted the fact that a product will be more profitable selling at (for instance) twice the manufactured cost than at three times. He could have launched the ZX81 at a higher price, marketing it in a more traditional way as a premium product, but chose not to. In effect, he used the lower price to establish an unassailable lead before the competition moved in.

An essential part of Sinclair&#x27;s marketing strategy was to use regular cost-cutting at strategic intervals to maintain market share. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy comment that Sinclair&#x27;s approach was &quot;to secure and extend [his] market lead and panic the competition. While most companies reduce prices when their products are in steep decline, Sinclair tends to discount shortly after sales have peaked. The advantage of his approach is that vacillating customers are drawn into the fold while the product&#x27;s promotion retains a commercial urgency, and the costings of the competition are thrown into utter disarray.&quot;

This tactic proved highly successful, with Sinclair announcing by March 1982 that it had sold 250,000 ZX81s worldwide. 50,000 computers were sold each month, 60% outside the UK, despite Sinclair and W. H. Smith being the only distributors. Despite the launch of its successor, the ZX Spectrum, Sinclair reportedly intended to increase ZX81 production to 150,000 a month. When sales fell after the Spectrum&#x27;s debut, Sinclair reduced the price of the pre-assembled version to £49.95 in May 1982. It was cut by another £10 the following April. Despite the increased competition from much more capable computers, the ZX81 was still shipping in excess of 30,000 units a month even as late as July 1983, more than two years after it had been launched. By that time, according to Sinclair Research, over 1.5 million ZX81s had been sold.

=== Distribution ===

The ZX81&#x27;s distribution arrangements were an essential part of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail-order retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to do just that was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.

Smith&#x27;s had begun selling audio and photographic equipment and calculators at the end of the 1970s, with a modest degree of success. In 1980 its marketing development manager, John Rowland, hit upon the idea of creating &quot;Computer Know-How&quot; sections in major branches to sell computer books and magazines. Most of the items on display were imports from the United States but their relatively high cost reduced their attractiveness to the casual buyer. The commercial success and mass market potential of the ZX80 caught Rowland&#x27;s interest; he approached Sinclair, saw a prototype ZX81 and agreed to market the machine through Smith&#x27;s on an exclusive basis for the first six months after launch. As Rowland put it, &quot;what we&#x27;ve done now is bring the computer-orientated publications together with an actual computer, to create the Computer Know-How section of the store&quot;, alongside computer software and blank cassette tapes. The ZX81 would be sold in 112 stores around the UK and would serve as the centrepiece of the &quot;Computer Know-How&quot; sections.

Selling the ZX81 over the counter was seen as something of a gamble and Rowland&#x27;s colleagues were initially unenthusiastic about the scheme. Branch buyers thought that the ZX81 was unlikely to sell more than 10–15 units per branch at launch. Rowland himself thought that the ZX81 would sell about 10,000 units during the first five months of the retail agreement, equivalent to one month&#x27;s mail order sales by Sinclair. In the event, the ZX81 was a massive success for Smith&#x27;s, it went on sale for making it the first home PC in the UK to retail for under . The &quot;Computer Know-How&quot; sections were swamped with eager customers, overwhelming the 300 staff who had been trained to demonstrate the machines; a &quot;Financial Times&quot; correspondent wrote of being &quot;dazed and bewildered by the crowds of schoolchildren clustered round the ZX81 in your local branch of W.H. Smith.&quot; Within a year, Smith&#x27;s had sold 350,000 ZX81s, making an estimated net profit of . Sales of peripherals, software, books and magazines netted even more profit.
The British chain stores Boots, John Menzies and Currys began selling the ZX81 as soon as Smith&#x27;s exclusive distribution deal expired and a number of companies secured overseas distribution rights for the ZX81, which was being sold in 18 countries by March 1982. Sinclair launched the ZX81 in the United States in November 1981 at a price of assembled and in kit form, initially selling directly to the American market by mail order. To be useful the computer needed an extra RAM pack which cost . Sales reached 15,000 a month by January 1982, while American Express sold thousands more to its own customers. In February 1982 Timex obtained a licence from Sinclair to sell the ZX81 directly through thousands of retail outlets in the US, paying Sinclair Research a 5 per cent royalty on all Sinclair hardware and software sold by Timex. The company was later to produce its own licensed clones and variants of the ZX81. By August 1982 Sinclair had lowered the American mail-order price of the assembled ZX81 to and kit to , and its advertisements stated that &quot;more than 10,000 are sold every week&quot;. In December 1981 Mitsui obtained rights to distribute the ZX81 in Japan, selling it by mail order for (equivalent to £83 in 1982 prices), and had sold 5,000 units by July 1982. The Japanese market&#x27;s favourable reaction to the ZX81 led Mitsui to begin selling the ZX81 over the counter in large bookshops from September 1982, with annual sales of 20,000 units predicted. In the Netherlands, the regular Sinclair ZX81 was for sale as well as a Bang &amp; Olufsen branded version called &quot;Beocomp&quot;.

The ZX81 was also sold for a while in duty-free shops at UK airports. However, this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states&#x27; industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, where they would be assembled for the Chinese market.

== Reception ==

Reviews of the ZX81 highlighted the great value for money offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings. As Tim Hartnell put it in &quot;Your Computer&quot;, &quot;the ZX81 is both a delight and a disappointment&quot;. He applauded the improvements that had been made over the ZX80, such as a much better manual, display and string handling, and called the ZX81 &quot;a very good first computer&quot; that &quot;will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost.&quot; However, the built-in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was &quot;mandatory for any worthwhile use&quot;. He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable, having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly.

&quot;New Scientist&#x27;s&quot; Malcolm Peltu commented that it was &quot;great technical value for money particularly for computing enthusiasts&quot; but thought that others were &quot;likely to be bored very quickly by the basic system&quot;. He highlighted weaknesses in the manual and Sinclair&#x27;s accompanying software, criticising them for &quot;a misconceived design and sloppiness in execution which make the machine seem harder to use and more limited than it should&quot; and questioned whether it might be more worthwhile to save up for a more powerful computer such as Acorn or Commodore&#x27;s offerings. Overall, he concluded, the ZX81 might have a limited value in helping to teach BASIC programming and overcoming psychological barriers to computing, but &quot;the Sinclair systems have a long way to go before they raise the quality and level of understanding of the nature and use of computer-based information systems among computer unbelievers.&quot;

While the editor of &quot;Personal Computer World&quot; was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine&#x27;s review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a chimpanzee with the machine above the strapline &quot;Editor benchtests the ZX81&quot;. (The chimp returned in later issues to &quot;benchtest&quot; all of Sinclair&#x27;s subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by &quot;PCW&quot; staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented &quot;absolutely amazing value for money&quot;. He described the ZX81 as &quot;a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting to find out more about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg&quot; and concluded: &quot;If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun.&quot;

Paul Taylor of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; found the ZX81 to be &quot;a powerful and flexible little computer ideally suited as a fun introduction to the mysteries of home computing&quot; but cautioned readers about its limitations. It lacked ready-made software, the keyboard was not easy to use, it did not have sufficiently advanced graphics to be able to replicate arcade-style games and its built-in memory was inadequate. Even so, he suggested, &quot;the ZX81 is a unique British product, part toy, part puzzle, part learning tool and I think that, provided one accepts its limitations and recognises that any computer will only do what it is told to do, it is good value as an introduction to the hobby of home computing.&quot;

&quot;The Age&quot; described the ZX81 as &quot;not extremely sophisticated, and its memory capability is rather limited. It also has a rather toy-like appearance&quot;. It concluded that the computer was &quot;an ideal toy for youngsters who want to become acquainted with the computer world. It is responsive, cheap, and very easy to use&quot;.

Billy Garrett of &quot;Byte&quot;, who already owned a ZX80, complimented the Timex/Sinclair 1000&#x27;s manual (although he regretted the removal of the British original&#x27;s humour), the &quot;state-of-the-art circuitry&quot;, and the BASIC for being &quot;remarkably powerful&quot; despite the small ROM size. He concluded that &quot;the major use ... will probably be for learning about BASIC or computers in general. [It] has limited expansion capabilities, and the keyboard is too small and cramped for any serious work&quot;.

Phillip Robinson of &quot;InfoWorld&quot; had no trouble using a $25 &quot;department-store special&quot; cassette recorder with his Timex/Sinclair 1000, but reported that friends could not use theirs. While also experiencing and having to compensate for the memory-expansion wobble, he stated his amazement at being able to purchase a complete computer with keyboard and BASIC &quot;at digital-watch prices&quot;, approved of the documentation&#x27;s quality, and surmised that Timex &quot;is obviously gunning for the computer-literacy market ... at a price the masses can afford and are willing to spend&quot;. Robinson described the 1000&#x27;s performance as &quot;no slouch&quot;, especially its floating-point precision, and suggested using it as a single-purpose device devoted to one task while using another, larger computer.

David Babsky described the ZX81 as &quot;a wonderfully brainy little micro which won&#x27;t let you waste your time and make a fool of yourself&quot;. In a comparison between the ZX81 and IBM PC published in &quot;Which Micro?&quot;, he commended the ZX81&#x27;s user-friendliness and its on-the-fly syntax checking of BASIC programs, which he described as &quot;the feature that I, as a newcomer to computing, want to see incorporated into every micro.&quot;

== Peripherals and software ==
The success of the ZX81 led almost immediately to enthusiasts producing a huge variety of peripherals and software. Clive Sinclair was &quot;amused and gratified&quot; by the attention the machine received but other than what Clarke described as &quot;a few remarkably poor programs on cassette&quot;, his company made little effort to exploit the demand, effectively ceding a very lucrative market to third party suppliers, a decision that undoubtedly forfeited a lot of potential earnings. W.H. Smith, for instance, was able to exploit a peculiarity of the ZX81; owners found that technically obsolete low-fidelity mono tape cassette recorders worked better as storage devices than higher-quality music systems. Smith&#x27;s purchased cheap &quot;shoebox&quot; cassette recorders in the Far East and sold them with the W.H. Smiths logo as &quot;data recorders&quot;. Over 100,000 were sold in 18 months.

Sinclair released only two official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16 KB RAM pack (actually the same one previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged) and the ZX Printer, both of which plug into the edge connector at the rear of the ZX81. They retailed at a launch price of £49.95 each but both have notable flaws. The RAM pack is top-heavy and supported only by the edge connector. It falls out of its socket at crucial points and crashes the ZX81, losing anything that the user has typed in. Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum, double-sided tape, or Blu-Tack to cure what became known as the &quot;RAM pack wobble&quot; problem. The ZX Printer is a tiny spark printer that uses two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It works reasonably well at first but its output deteriorates rapidly after a time.

Many non-Sinclair peripherals aimed to remedy the ZX81&#x27;s flaws and provide many new capabilities. These included RAM packs providing up to 64 KB of extra memory and promising to &quot;fit snugly ... giving a firm connection&quot; to the computer, typewriter-style keyboards, more advanced printers and sound generators. A wide range of software was also published. Within only a year of the ZX81&#x27;s launch, around 200 independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair-compatible hardware. The people behind the ZX81 cottage industry were very often not computer professionals but were, as the &quot;Financial Times&quot; noted, &quot;school teachers, civil servants, electrical engineers and technicians [who] have set up small operations in their own time&quot;.

The ZX81&#x27;s popularity was publicly demonstrated in January 1982 when civil servant Mike Johnstone organised a &quot;ZX Microfair&quot; at Westminster Central Hall. Seventy exhibitors set up stalls with only a few hundred visitors expected in a hall with a capacity of 650 people. Tens of thousands, mostly youths, came from around Britain, and the police had to control the crowd. They queued for three hours around the hall, with a group of 50 entering as another group left. About 12,000 entered the hall; Clarke, who was only able to enter after identifying himself as a journalist, wrote that &quot;no one knows how many gave up in despair&quot;. The exhibitors sold thousands of pounds&#x27; worth of software and hardware &quot;as fast as three pairs of hands on each stall could hand them over and stuff the fivers into improvised overflowing cash boxes&quot;, he added. The fair also showed Sinclair Research&#x27;s relatively unimportant role in the computer&#x27;s success, with only small crowds at its booth compared to the &quot;rugby scrum&quot; elsewhere. By August 1983 seven more ZX Microfairs were held, with the 14th ZX Microfair at Alexandra Palace in November 1984, still organised by Johnstone.
Thousands of ZX81 programs were published, either as type-in programs or as ready-made applications that could be loaded from cassette tape. Many computer magazines featured ZX81 program listings – some, such as &quot;Sinclair Programs&quot;, were dedicated entirely to listings – while many individuals became the archetypal &quot;bedroom programmers&quot;, producing games and applications which they produced, marketed, recorded, and sold from their own homes. Some went on to found their own software houses, employing teams of programmers – some still at school – to produce programs for the ZX81 and other computers. Existing companies also sold software; Psion produced a series of ZX81 programs in close association with Sinclair, including a flight simulator, while ICL&#x27;s range of ZX81 programs sold over 100,000 cassettes in less than three months. Psion&#x27;s success with the ZX81 had a profound effect on the future of the company. Its work on the ZX81 database program &quot;Vu-File&quot; led to Psion switching its focus to the development of personal digital assistants, which resulted in the launch in 1984 of the Psion Organiser, the world&#x27;s first handheld personal computer. Some of the most popular ZX81 games (Psion&#x27;s &quot;Flight Simulation&quot; being an example) were rewritten for the Spectrum to take advantage of the newer machine&#x27;s colour and sound capabilities.

Enterprising programmers were able to produce games for the ZX81 using nothing more than text characters and the machine&#x27;s limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as &quot;3D Monster Maze&quot;, a tense first-person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark in the history of computer and video games.

One of the more bizarre software products for the ZX81 came about as a result of music companies attempting to capitalise on the popularity of Sinclair&#x27;s computers. In 1983, EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX81 program recorded on the B-side. Island Records responded with &quot;XL1&quot; by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley, packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum.

== Clones and variants ==

Sinclair&#x27;s licensing agreement with Timex enabled the American company to produce three clones or offshoots of Sinclair machines for the US market. These were the Timex Sinclair 1000, Timex Sinclair 1500 (both variants of the ZX81) and the Timex Sinclair 2068 (a variant of the ZX Spectrum). The TS1000 was launched in July 1982 and sparked a massive surge of interest; at one point, the Timex phoneline was receiving over 5,000 calls an hour, 50,000 a week, inquiring about the machine or about microcomputers in general. It was virtually identical to the ZX81 save for re-branding and the addition of an extra 1 KB of memory, totalling 2 KB. In the five months following the TS1000&#x27;s launch, the company sold 550,000 machines, earning Sinclair over $1.2 million in royalties.

Timex produced a second version of the ZX81 in the form of the TS1500, essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983. It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum, incorporating 16 KB of on-board memory. It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum. However, it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after-effects of Timex&#x27;s botched marketing of the TS1000. Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success, Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS1000. Consumers would take the machine home, plug it in and find that it would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory.

In addition, consumers&#x27; attitude in the US was quite different from that in the UK. Clive Sinclair told &quot;Informatics&quot; magazine in June 1981 that &quot;our competitors thought that consumers didn&#x27;t want to learn programming. We [Sinclair Research] think they failed because of this and because of price.&quot; Timex evidently shared this belief but events proved it to be a false assumption. The TS1000/ZX81&#x27;s price advantage was erased when its main rivals – the TI-99/4A and the VIC-20 – had their prices cut to below the all-important $100 mark. Competitors such as Apple, Atari, Commodore and Texas Instruments promoted their machines as being for business or entertainment rather than education, highlighting the value of computers with ready-made applications and more advanced features such as graphics, colour and sound.

By late 1983 Wayne Green reported a &quot;rising chorus of frustrated Timex users who are telling friends not to waste their money.&quot; &quot;Hard core&quot; early adopters, he wrote, &quot;became discouraged with the quality of the product, with the poverty of software available and with the almost total lack of information on how to cope with it.&quot; Consumers deserted the TS1000 once its novelty value had worn off and, as publishers of programming guides found to their cost, the American public showed little interest in using the machine to learn about computer programming. American retailers were left with large stocks of unsold machines. Burned by this experience, many were unwilling to stock the later Timex Sinclair machines in large numbers and the big chain stores dropped the Timex Sinclair line altogether.

Some companies outside the US and UK produced their own &quot;pirate&quot; versions of the ZX81 and Timex Sinclair computers, aided by weak intellectual property laws in their countries of origin. Several Brazilian companies produced ZX81 clones, notably the TK series (such as the TK85) from Microdigital Eletronica of Brazil) and Prológica&#x27;s CP-200. Czerweny Electrónica of Argentina produced the CZ1000 and CZ1500, clones of the ZX81 and TS1500 respectively. Lambda Electronics of Hong Kong produced the Lambda 8300, based on the ZX81, which was itself widely copied by other Chinese manufacturers.

The machines were not all straight copies of the ZX81; some, such as the CP-200, came with extra memory and a larger case (often with a chiclet keyboard in place of the original membrane keyboard). One clone, the TL801 from TELLAB of Italy, could emulate either the ZX80 or ZX81 and switch between the two machines via a jumper.

== Impact and legacy ==
The ZX81 had an immediate impact on the fortunes of Sinclair Research and Clive Sinclair himself. The company&#x27;s profitability rose enormously, from a pretax profit of £818,000 on a turnover of £4.6 million in 1980–81 to £8.55 million on a turnover of £27.17 million in 1981–82. Clive Sinclair became one of the UK&#x27;s highest-profile businessmen and a millionaire, receiving a £1 million bonus on top of a salary of £13,000. He received a knighthood in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours and the Young Businessman of the Year award in 1983.

The machine also had a widespread and lasting social impact in the United Kingdom, according to Clive Sinclair, purchasers of the ZX81 came from &quot;a reasonably broad spectrum&quot; that ranged from readers of the upmarket &quot;Observer&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; newspapers to the more downmarket but numerous &quot;Sun&quot; readers. The largest age group was around 30 years old. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported in March 1982 that most Sinclair computers were being bought for educational purposes, both for adults and children, though the children were usually able to learn much more quickly. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy note that the popularity of the ZX81 was &quot;subtly different from the run-of-the-mill social fad&quot;; although most enthusiasts were in their teens or early twenties, many were older users – often parents who had become fascinated by the ZX81s that they had bought for their children. However, the ZX81 boom was overwhelmingly male-dominated.

One of the ZX81&#x27;s key legacies was that it spurred large numbers of people to try programming for the first time. The ZX81 plays a significant part in the plot of William Gibson&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;. One character, an artist using old ZX81s as a sculptural medium, explains the cultural and intellectual impact that the machine had on British society:

Among those whose first experience of home computing was provided by the ZX81 are Terry Pratchett (who used it for &quot;very primitive word processing&quot;), Edward de Bono and – perhaps proving William Gibson&#x27;s point – many video game developers including Charles Cecil, Raffaele Cecco, Pete Cooke, David Perry (whose first published game, a driving game, involved &quot;a black blob avoiding other black blobs&quot;), Rhianna Pratchett, and Jon Ritman.

Even 30 years after launch, the ZX81 has a German user forum, and one in English.

New hardware and software continue to be developed for the ZX81, including a ZX81-based webserver; the &quot;ZXpand&quot;, a combined SD card interface, 32K configurable memory expansion, and optional joystick port and AY sound interface; and new games on cassette tape by Cronosoft, such as &quot;Tut-Tut&quot;, &quot;Virus&quot;, &quot;One Little Ghost&quot;, and many more, as well as releases by Revival Studios, such as &quot;Avalanche&quot;, &quot;Mayhem&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Stairrunner&quot; and more.

<text>A Ziegler–Natta catalyst, named after Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta, is a catalyst used in the synthesis of polymers of 1-alkenes (alpha-olefins). Two broad classes of Ziegler–Natta catalysts are employed, distinguished by their solubility:
* Heterogeneous supported catalysts based on titanium compounds are used in polymerization reactions in combination with cocatalysts, organoaluminum compounds such as triethylaluminium, Al(C2H5)3. This class of catalyst dominates the industry.
* Homogeneous catalysts usually based on complexes of the group 4 metals titanium, zirconium or hafnium. They are usually used in combination with a different organoaluminum cocatalyst, methylaluminoxane (or methylalumoxane, MAO). These catalysts traditionally contain metallocenes but also feature multidentate oxygen- and nitrogen-based ligands.

Ziegler–Natta catalysts are used to polymerize terminal alkenes (ethylene and alkenes with the vinyl double bond):
:&quot;n&quot; CH2=CHR → −[CH2−CHR]&quot;n&quot;−;

==History==
The 1963 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to German Karl Ziegler, for his discovery of first titanium-based catalysts, and Italian Giulio Natta, for using them to prepare stereoregular polymers from propylene. Ziegler–Natta catalysts have been used in the commercial manufacture of various polyolefins since 1956. As of 2010, the total volume of plastics, elastomers, and rubbers produced from alkenes with these and related (especially Phillips) catalysts worldwide exceeds 100 million tonnes. Together, these polymers represent the largest-volume commodity plastics as well as the largest-volume commodity chemicals in the world.

In the early 1950s workers at Phillips Petroleum discovered that chromium catalysts are highly effective for the low-temperature polymerization of ethylene, which launched major industrial technologies culminating in the Phillips catalyst. A few years later, Ziegler discovered that a combination of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and diethylaluminium chloride (Al(C2H5)2Cl) gave comparable activities for the production of polyethylene. Natta used crystalline α-TiCl3 in combination with Al(C2H5)3 to produce first isotactic polypropylene. Usually Ziegler catalysts refer to titanium-based systems for conversions of ethylene and Ziegler–Natta catalysts refer to systems for conversions of propylene. 

Also, in the 1960s, BASF developed a gas-phase, mechanically-stirred polymerization process for making polypropylene. In that process, the particle bed in the reactor was either not fluidized or not fully fluidized. In 1968, the first gas-phase fluidized-bed polymerization process, the Unipol process, was commercialized by Union Carbide to produce polyethylene. In the mid-1980s, the Unipol process was further extended to produce polypropylene.

In the 1970s, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) was discovered to greatly enhance the activity of the titanium-based catalysts. These catalysts were so active that the removal of unwanted amorphous polymer and residual titanium from the product (so-called deashing) was no longer necessary, enabling the commercialization of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) resins and allowed the development of fully amorphous copolymers.

The fluidized-bed process remains one of the two most widely used processes for producing polypropylene.

Natta first used polymerization catalysts based on titanium chlorides to polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes. He discovered that these polymers are crystalline materials and ascribed their crystallinity to a special feature of the polymer structure called stereoregularity. 

The concept of stereoregularity in polymer chains is illustrated in the picture on the left with polypropylene. Stereoregular poly(1-alkene) can be isotactic or syndiotactic depending on the relative orientation of the alkyl groups in polymer chains consisting of units −[CH2−CHR]−, like the CH3 groups in the figure. In the isotactic polymers, all stereogenic centers CHR share the same configuration. The stereogenic centers in syndiotactic polymers alternate their relative configuration. A polymer that lacks any regular arrangement in the position of its alkyl substituents (R) is called atactic. Both isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene are crystalline, whereas atactic polypropylene, which can also be prepared with special Ziegler–Natta catalysts, is amorphous. The stereoregularity of the polymer is determined by the catalyst used to prepare it.

==Classes==
===Heterogeneous catalysts===

The first and dominant class of titanium-based catalysts (and some vanadium-based catalysts) for alkene polymerization can be roughly subdivided into two subclasses:
* catalysts suitable for homopolymerization of ethylene and for ethylene/1-alkene copolymerization reactions leading to copolymers with a low 1-alkene content, 2–4 mol% (LLDPE resins), and
* catalysts suitable for the synthesis of isotactic 1-alkenes.
The overlap between these two subclasses is relatively small because the requirements to the respective catalysts differ widely.

Commercial catalysts are supported by being bound to a solid with a high surface area. Both TiCl4 and TiCl3 give active catalysts. The support in the majority of the catalysts is MgCl2. A third component of most catalysts is a carrier, a material that determines the size and the shape of catalyst particles. The preferred carrier is microporous spheres of amorphous silica with a diameter of 30–40 mm. During the catalyst synthesis, both the titanium compounds and MgCl2 are packed into the silica pores. All these catalysts are activated with organoaluminum compounds such as Al(C2H5)3.

All modern supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts designed for polymerization of propylene and higher 1-alkenes are prepared with TiCl4 as the active ingredient and MgCl2 as a support. Another component of all such catalysts is an organic modifier, usually an ester of an aromatic diacid or a diether. The modifiers react both with inorganic ingredients of the solid catalysts as well as with organoaluminum cocatalysts. These catalysts polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes to highly crystalline isotactic polymers.

===Homogeneous catalysts===
A second class of Ziegler–Natta catalysts are soluble in the reaction medium. Traditionally such homogeneous catalysts were derived from metallocenes, but the structures of active catalysts have been significantly broadened to include nitrogen-based ligands.
====Metallocene catalysts====

These catalysts are metallocenes together with a cocatalyst, typically MAO, −[O−Al(CH3)]&quot;n&quot;−. The idealized metallocene catalysts have the composition Cp2MCl2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) such as titanocene dichloride. Typically, the organic ligands are derivatives of cyclopentadienyl. In some complexes, the two cyclopentadiene (Cp) rings are linked with bridges, like −CH2−CH2− or &gt;SiPh2. Depending on the type of their cyclopentadienyl ligands, for example by using an &quot;ansa&quot;-bridge, metallocene catalysts can produce either isotactic or syndiotactic polymers of propylene and other 1-alkenes.

====Non-metallocene catalysts====

Ziegler–Natta catalysts of the third class, non-metallocene catalysts, use a variety of complexes of various metals, ranging from scandium to lanthanoid and actinoid metals, and a large variety of ligands containing oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S). The complexes are activated using MAO, as is done for metallocene catalysts.

Most Ziegler–Natta catalysts and all the alkylaluminium cocatalysts are unstable in air, and the alkylaluminium compounds are pyrophoric. The catalysts, therefore, are always prepared and handled under an inert atmosphere.

==Mechanism of Ziegler–Natta polymerization==
The structure of active centers in Ziegler–Natta catalysts is well established only for metallocene catalysts. An idealized and simplified metallocene complex Cp2ZrCl2 represents a typical precatalyst. It is unreactive toward alkenes. The dihalide reacts with MAO and is transformed into a metallocenium ion Cp2CH3, which is ion-paired to some derivative(s) of MAO. A polymer molecule grows by numerous insertion reactions of C=C bonds of 1-alkene molecules into the Zr–C bond in the ion:

Many thousands of alkene insertion reactions occur at each active center resulting in the formation of long polymer chains attached to the center. The Cossee–Arlman mechanism describes the growth of stereospecific polymers. This mechanism states that the polymer grows through alkene coordination at a vacant site at the titanium atom, which is followed by insertion of the C=C bond into the Ti−C bond at the active center.

===Termination processes===
On occasion, the polymer chain is disengaged from the active centers in the chain termination reaction. Several pathways exist for termination:
:Cp2−(CH2−CHR)&quot;n&quot;−CH3 + CH2=CHR → Cp2−CH2−CH2R + CH2=CR–polymer

Another type of chain termination reaction called a β-hydride elimination reaction also occurs periodically: 
:Cp2−(CH2−CHR)n−CH3 → Cp2−H + CH2=CR–polymer

Polymerization reactions of alkenes with solid titanium-based catalysts occur at special titanium centers located on the exterior of the catalyst crystallites. Some titanium atoms in these crystallites react with organoaluminum cocatalysts with the formation of Ti–C bonds. The polymerization reaction of alkenes occurs similarly to the reactions in metallocene catalysts:

:L&quot;n&quot;Ti–CH2−CHR–polymer + CH2=CHR → L&quot;n&quot;Ti–CH2-CHR–CH2−CHR–polymer

The two chain termination reactions occur quite rarely in Ziegler–Natta catalysis and the formed polymers have a too high molecular weight to be of commercial use. To reduce the molecular weight, hydrogen is added to the polymerization reaction:

:L&quot;n&quot;Ti–CH2−CHR–polymer + H2 → L&quot;n&quot;Ti−H + CH3−CHR–polymer

Another termination process involves the action of protic (acidic) reagents, which can be intentionally added or adventitious.

<text>Ziad Samir Jarrah (11 May 197511 September 2001) was a Lebanese terrorist hijacker. He was one of the four hijackers of United Airlines Flight 93, which was crashed into a field in a rural area near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, following a passenger revolt, as part of the September 11 attacks.

After a wealthy upbringing, Jarrah moved to Germany in 1996. He became involved in the planning of the 9/11 attacks while attending Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW) in the late 1990s, meeting Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, forming what is now known as the Hamburg cell. Jarrah was recruited by Osama bin Laden for the attacks in 1999. He was reportedly the only hijacker who had any apprehensions about carrying out the attacks.

Jarrah arrived in the United States in June 2000. He trained at Huffman Aviation together with Atta and Al-Shehhi with their flight instructor Rudi Dekkers from June 2000 to January 2001, after relocating to Florida from New Jersey. On 7 September 2001, Jarrah flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark. Four days later, he boarded United Airlines Flight 93, and was believed to have taken over as the pilot of the aircraft along with his team of hijackers, which included Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Nami and Ahmed al-Haznawi, who together made an attempt to crash the plane into either the United States Capitol or the White House, which was thwarted when the passengers revolted against the hijackers.

== Early life and education ==
Ziad Samir al-Jarrah was born on 11 May 1975 in Beirut, Lebanon to a wealthy and secular Muslim family. He was brought up in a working class quarter of the city, Tariq al-Jadida, and received his primary and secondary education from schools in that area. His father, Samir Jarrah, worked as a social service inspector for the Lebanese government and his mother taught at an elementary school. His parents were nominally Sunni Muslim, although they lived a secular lifestyle. In his childhood, he had always wanted to fly planes, but his family discouraged this. &quot;I stopped him from being a pilot,&quot; his father told the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; a week after the attacks. &quot;I only have one son and I was afraid that he would crash.&quot;

From 1995 to 1996, while Jarrah was still living in Yemen, according to his family, somebody of the same name rented an apartment in Brooklyn, New York. The landlords claimed it was the same Jarrah as in the FBI photographs.

In the spring of 1996, Jarrah moved to Germany with his cousin, Salim. They were there to take a certificate course in German at the University of Greifswald, which was required of foreigners studying in Germany who do not speak the language. While sharing an apartment with his cousin, he reportedly attended discos and beach parties, and his attendance at the mosque fell off. He met Aysel Şengün, a German-born woman of Turkish ancestry studying dentistry, and the two became good friends. They dated on and off for the remainder of his life and lived together briefly, which vexed his more religious friends.

In September 1997, Jarrah left Greifswald and instead began studying aerospace engineering at the Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences) in Hamburg, while working at a Volkswagen paint shop in nearby Wolfsburg. While in Hamburg, he rented an apartment from Rosemarie Canel, who would paint a portrait of him that he would bring back as a gift for his mother that December.

The 9/11 Commission Report states that Jarrah was a member of the Hamburg cell, along with Mohamed Atta and the others. He did not live with any of the others, however, and can be confirmed to have met with any of them in Hamburg only on a single occasion: that of Said Bahaji&#x27;s wedding at the al-Quds Mosque in October 1999.

== Training in Afghanistan ==
In late 1999, Jarrah, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Said Bahaji, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh decided to travel to Chechnya to fight Russian soldiers in the Second Chechen War. Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi convinced them at the last minute to travel instead to Afghanistan to meet with Osama bin Laden and train for terrorist attacks. Jarrah was given the &quot;&quot; (teknonym) (&quot;father of Tariq&quot;) likely in honor of Tariq ibn Ziyad, the commander who led the Muslim conquest of Spain.

They were told they were on a highly secret mission and were instructed to return to Germany after the operation and enroll in flight school. In October 1999, Jarrah was filmed at Said Bahaji&#x27;s wedding with other 9/11 hijackers, including al-Shehhi. 

In 2006, a video surfaced showing Jarrah, still bearded, reading his will in January 2000 along with Mohamed Atta. Not long after this, Jarrah shaved his beard and began to act in a more secular way, according to Şengün. Many of the future hijackers attempted to hide their radicalism and blend in with the population. To hide his travels to Afghanistan (which may have concerned security officials at international airports) Jarrah reported his passport stolen in February 2000 and received a blank duplicate, just as hijackers Atta and Shehhi had done the previous month.

Jarrah dropped out of the Fachhochschule and began looking at flight schools. He claimed that this was to fulfill his childhood dream of being a pilot. After looking in several countries, he decided that none of the flight schools in Europe were adequate. On the advice of a childhood friend, he prepared to move to the United States.

== In the United States ==

Jarrah apparently entered the United States on seven occasions, more than any other hijacker. On 25 May 2000, he applied for and received a five-year US B-1/B-2
(tourist/business) visa in Berlin. On 27 June 2000, he went to the US for the first time, arriving at Newark International Airport. He then traveled to Florida together with al-Shehhi and Atta, where the three men enrolled full-time at Huffman Aviation, in Venice. Jarrah did not apply for a change in his status, from a tourist visa to a student visa, thus violating his immigration status.

Jarrah was enrolled in flight school for six months, from June 2000 to 15 January 2001. At the flight school, many of his classmates remember him fondly, describing him as kind and trustworthy, and remember him drinking beer occasionally. Jarrah was unique among the hijackers in that he did not live with any other hijackers, but rather with a German student named Thorsten Biermann. Biermann did not observe Jarrah acting particularly religiously or overtly politically. Jarrah occasionally flew back to Germany to visit Aysel Şengün (alternate spelling Aysel Senguen), his Turkish-German girlfriend, and called or e-mailed her nearly every day.

Rudi Dekkers, a Dutchman and the flight instructor of Huffman Aviation (died in 2024), was interviewed after the attacks in 2001 by authorities. According to Dekkers, both Jarrah and al-Shehhi were good students, unlike Atta, who misbehaved and refused to follow instructions. Dekkers told Atta that he was going to kick him out of the school if his behavior did not change, and as a response, Atta&#x27;s behavior began to improve. Dekkers also said that he went with al-Shehhi and Jarrah to a bar in Sarasota, Florida named Shamrock Pub after one of their flight lessons. At the bar, they talked to Dekkers about their plans after getting their pilot licenses, and Jarrah said to Dekkers &quot;I got a job lined up and we are planning to become pilots.&quot;

Jarrah had obtained his license to fly small aircraft in August 2000, and began training to fly large jets later that year. He flew to Beirut to visit his family, and then to Germany to visit his girlfriend, Şengün. He brought her back to the United States for a ten-day visit, and she even attended a flight school session with him. In late January 2001, he again flew to Beirut to visit his father, who was ill, and then to Germany to visit his girlfriend. He returned to the United States once again in late February. His behavior was markedly different from the other hijackers, who broke off all familial and romantic relations.

On his way back to the US, he passed through the United Arab Emirates, according to that country&#x27;s officials, where he was initially reported as having been interviewed by authorities on 30 January 2001, at the request of the CIA. He allegedly admitted to having been to Afghanistan and Pakistan, although the CIA has since denied the claim and the 9/11 Commission Report does not mention it. The Florida flight school where Jarrah had been studying also said he was in school there until 15 January 2001.

On 6 May, Jarrah registered for a two-month membership at the US1 Fitness Center, a gym in Dania Beach, Florida—he would later renew his membership for two more months, and eventually had lessons in close-quarters combat. It is believed that sometime in that month, Ahmed al-Haznawi, who arrived on June 8, moved in with Jarrah. Jarrah rented a new apartment in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea after both men gave the landlord photocopies of their German passports, which he later turned over to the FBI.

On 25 June, Jarrah took Haznawi to Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on the advice of his landlord. Haznawi was treated by Dr. Christos Tsonas, who gave him antibiotics for a cut on his left calf. While he told staff that he had bumped into a suitcase, the media briefly reported it as a sign of cutaneous anthrax, hoping to show a link to the 2001 anthrax attacks, although the FBI later addressed the rumors, stating that &quot;exhaustive testing did not support that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been.&quot;

In mid-July 2001, some of the hijackers and members of the Hamburg cell gathered near Salou, Spain, for a period of a few days up to a couple of weeks. There seemed to be tension between Jarrah and Atta about the plot in its late stages. Atta had complained to Ramzi bin al-Shibh about his difficulty in getting through to Jarrah and his fear that Jarrah might withdraw from the plot completely. On 25 July, Jarrah flew to Germany on a one-way ticket and again met with his girlfriend, the last time she saw him (though they would talk by telephone at least once more). Later, he met with bin al-Shibh who convinced Jarrah to go through with the operation. Jarrah arrived back in the United States on 5 August, though other sources indicate that he took his pilot&#x27;s test on 2 August, having missed his sister&#x27;s wedding to do so. On 27 August, he checked into the Pin-Del Motel in Laurel, Maryland, only a mile away from the Valencia Motel, where four other hijackers were staying. On 7 September 2001, all four of the Flight 93 hijackers flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark International Airport aboard Spirit Airlines.

In the early morning hours of 9 September 2001, Jarrah was pulled over for speeding in Maryland and received a ticket. Jarrah phoned his parents later that day, mentioning that he had received the money order they had sent five days earlier. He told them he intended to see them on 22 September for his cousin&#x27;s wedding.

On 10 September, Jarrah spent his final evening writing a letter to Şengün, with whom he had made marriage plans. This letter is widely interpreted as a suicide note. The letter did not reach Şengün; she had entered witness protection shortly after the attacks and her apartment was unattended. The letter was returned to the United States by the German postal service, where it was discovered and delivered to the FBI. The note contained the phrases &quot;I did what I had to&quot; and &quot;It is a great honour and you will see the result, and everyone will be celebrating.&quot;

According to one source, Jarrah had set up a large mock cockpit made of cardboard boxes in his apartment just before the attacks.

== 9/11 attacks ==


At 5:01 AM on 11 September 2001, Jarrah in Newark placed a phone call to United Airlines Flight 175 hijacker pilot Marwan al-Shehhi in Boston; the pair spoke for less than a minute, likely to confirm that the plan for the attacks was ready to proceed. While Jarrah made a similar call to American Airlines Flight 11 hijacker pilot Mohamed Atta, this did not occur between Jarrah and American Airlines Flight 77 hijacker pilot Hani Hanjour. Later that morning, Jarrah, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Nami and Ahmed al-Haznawi boarded United Airlines Flight 93 from Newark International Airport at gate A17 without incident, and sat in first-class seats near the cockpit. Before boarding, Jarrah called his girlfriend Aysel Şengün from a public telephone at the airport, repeating the words &quot;I love you&quot; over and over. Due to a delay, the plane took off at 8:42, four minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center. The pilot and crew were notified of the first two hijackings that day, and were told to be on alert. Within minutes, around 9:28a.m., Flight 93 was hijacked as well. The 9/11 Commission stated that Jarrah was the pilot.

The voice of a pilot was heard by air traffic control telling passengers to remain seated. Jarrah announcing, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen: here the captain. Please sit down, keep remaining seating. We have a bomb on board. So sit.&quot; At 9:39 a.m., the pilot announced over the radio, &quot;This is the captain. Would like you all to remain seated. There is a bomb on board and we are going back to the airport, and to have our demands, so please remain quiet.&quot;

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, and indicated that one of the men, believed to be either al-Haznawi or al-Nami, had a box tied around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside. Passengers on the plane had learned the fates of the other hijacked planes through telephone calls; some decided to act, fearing their plane, too, would be used as a missile. A passenger uprising foiled the terrorists&#x27; plans, but failed to save the plane. Jarrah and the other hijackers were attacked. According to the August 8, 2003, analysis of the plane&#x27;s cockpit recording by the United States investigators, a group of passengers tried to break into the cockpit. To knock them off balance, Jarrah rolled the plane to the left and right. When this failed, he then pitched the nose forward and back. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, &quot;Is that it? Shall we finish it off?&quot; Another hijacker responded, &quot;No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off.&quot; The voice recorder recorded the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the &quot;takbir&quot; several times. He then asked another hijacker, &quot;Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?&quot; The other hijacker responded, &quot;Yes, put it in it, and pull it down.&quot; The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, &quot;Turn it up!&quot; A second later, a hijacker said, &quot;Pull it down! Pull it down!&quot; At 10:02:33, Jarrah made a desperate plea in Arabic, screaming &quot;Hey! Hey! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me!&quot;, possibly referring to the plane&#x27;s yoke. The plane crashed just outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 10:03:11, 125 miles (200 km) from Washington, D.C. All aboard died instantly. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the flight impacted at .

After 11 September, Jarrah&#x27;s girlfriend, Şengün, filed a missing person report in Bochum. Jarrah became a suspect as FBI agents found a &quot;Ziad Jarrahi&quot; in the flight manifest (the additional &quot;i&quot; at the end a possible misspelling).

== Mistaken identity claims ==

There have been claims that Jarrah was not a hijacker but rather an innocent passenger or that he was not present on the plane and his identity was stolen. It has been pointed out that his behavior deviated from the profile presented by the other hijackers and that the passengers reported three and not four hijackers. However, the October 2006 emergence of a video shot on 18 January 2000, showing Jarrah recording his will alongside Mohamed Atta has cast heavy doubt on such claims.

Shortly after the 11 September attacks, family and friends claimed that Jarrah did not exhibit the same &quot;smoldering political resentments&quot; or &quot;cultural conservatism&quot; as Mohamed Atta and the other hijackers. Although his family was Sunni Muslim, Jarrah was not raised with a background of religious conviction and did not hold to an obviously conservative lifestyle. Personnel at the flight school Jarrah attended described him as &quot;a normal person&quot;. Jarrah called his family two days, and his girlfriend Aysel Şengün three hours, before boarding United Airlines Flight 93; Şengün described the conversation as &quot;pleasant&quot; and &quot;normal&quot;. She also claimed that he never mentioned any names of the other hijackers. In his call two days before the attack, Jarrah told his family he would be coming home for a cousin&#x27;s wedding. &quot;It makes no sense,&quot; his uncle Jamal claimed. &quot;He said he had even bought a new suit for the occasion.&quot; Jarrah&#x27;s family in Lebanon claimed in September 2001 that he was an innocent passenger on the plane. His uncle, Jamal Jarrah, is currently a deputy in the Lebanese parliament and was appointed minister on 18 December 2016, and a member of the Future Movement, a pro-Saudi Arabian political party led by Saad Hariri. On 2 January 2012, in a televised interview on Future TV, MPJarrah denied his nephew&#x27;s involvement in the 9/11 attacks, alluding to a conspiracy.

On 23 October 2001, John Ashcroft claimed that Jarrah had shared a Hamburg apartment with Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, though German authorities that same day told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that they had no evidence that any of Jarrah&#x27;s three apartments in Hamburg had been connected with the other hijackers. One high-ranking German police official stated, &quot;The only information we have connecting the three Hamburg suspects is the FBI&#x27;s assertion that there is a connection.&quot; In October 2006, however, a video surfaced showing Atta and Jarrah together in Afghanistan, clearly connecting Jarrah to the members of the Hamburg cell.

The 9/11 Commission concluded without qualification that Jarrah was a hijacker on the plane when it crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

In October 2006, an al-Qaeda video was released showing Jarrah and Mohamed Atta recording their wills in January 2000 in Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Tarnak Farms base near Kandahar, Afghanistan.

== In popular culture ==
* Jarrah is the central character in the film &quot;The Hamburg Cell&quot; (2004), in which he is portrayed by French-Lebanese actor Karim Saleh. The film, while showing the formation of the radical Muslims group of the same name as well as preparations for the 9/11 attacks, presents the events from Jarrah&#x27;s perspective and also features his indoctrination to extremism.
* Television film &quot;The Flight That Fought Back&quot; (2005) portrays the passenger uprising inside the hijacked United Airlines 93, with Iranian-American actor Pej Vahdat portraying Jarrah.
* Iranian-American actor Dominic Rains portrayed Jarrah in the television film &quot;Flight 93&quot; (2006), which focuses on the hijacking of United Airlines 93.
* Jarrah is portrayed by Egyptian-British actor Khalid Abdalla in the award-winning film &quot;United 93&quot; (2006), also featuring the hijacking of United Airlines 93, and the authorities&#x27; attempts to save the four hijacked planes during 9/11.
* The 2021 German-French film &quot;Copilot&quot; (German title: &quot;Die Welt Wird Eine Andere Sein,&quot; Lit. trans. &quot;The World Will Be Different&quot;) is based on Jarrah&#x27;s relationship with Aysel Şengün, prior to the events of 11 September 2001. Portrayed by Lebanese actor Roger Azar, Jarrah is renamed as Saeed Awaad to distance the film from being a docudrama. It was an official Panorama entry at the 71st Berlin International Film Festival, and was theatrically released on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
* The 2016 album &quot;Media in the Service of Terror&quot; by the industrial techno act Vatican Shadow opens with the track &#x27;Ziad Jarrah Studied Mathematics&#x27;.

<text>Zionism is an ethnocultural nationalist movement that emerged in Europe in the late 19th century that aimed to establish a national home for the Jewish people, pursued through the colonization of Palestine, a region roughly corresponding to the Land of Israel in Judaism, with central importance in Jewish history. Zionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and as few Palestinian Arabs as possible.

Zionism initially emerged in Central and Eastern Europe as a secular nationalist movement in the late 19th century, in reaction to newer waves of antisemitism and in response to the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. The arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine during this period is widely seen as the start of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Zionist claim to Palestine was based on the notion that the Jews&#x27; historical right to the land outweighed that of the Arabs.

In 1917 the Balfour Declaration established Britain&#x27;s support for the movement. In 1922, the British Mandate for Palestine governed by Britain explicitly privileged Jewish settlers over the local Palestinian population. In 1948, the State of Israel was established and the first Arab-Israeli war broke out. During the war, Israel expanded its territory to control over 78% of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, an estimated 160,000 of 870,000 Palestinians in the territory remained, forming a Palestinian minority in Israel.

The Zionist mainstream has historically included liberal, labor, revisionist, and cultural Zionism, while groups like Brit Shalom and Ihud have been dissident factions within the movement. Mainstream Zionist groups for the most part differ more in style than substance, having in some cases adopted similar strategies to achieve their goals, such as violence or compulsory transfer to deal with the Palestinians. Religious Zionism is a variant of Zionist ideology that brings together secular nationalism and religious conservatism. Advocates of Zionism have viewed it as a national liberation movement for the repatriation of an indigenous people (that were subject to persecution and share a national identity through national consciousness), to the homeland of their ancestors. Criticism of Zionism includes its characterization as a supremacist, colonialist, racist, or exceptionalist ideology or as a settler colonialist movement.

== Terminology ==
The first time the term &quot;Zion&quot; was associated with a mass movement was as the &quot;Hovevei Zion&quot; (lit &#x27;Lovers of Zion&#x27;) also known as the &quot;Hibbat Zion&quot; (lit. &#x27;Love of Zion&#x27;), that came together at the 1884 Katowice Conference, inspired by Leon Pinsker&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Auto-Emancipation&quot;. The first use of the term as an -ism is attributed to the Austrian Nathan Birnbaum, in an 1890 article in his periodical , itself named after Pinsker&#x27;s pamphlet. This form was subsequently popularized by Herzl in convening the 1897 First Zionist Congress and the Zionist Organization founded there.

&quot;Zion&quot; or Mount Zion is a hill in Jerusalem and a term used in the Hebrew Bible. It has been used poetically as a synecdoche to refer to the Land of Israel since the period of the Babylonian Exile with particular importance in Jewish messianic belief.

== Beliefs ==
===National self-determination===

Fundamental to Zionism is the belief that Jews constitute a nation, and have a moral and historic right and need for self-determination in Palestine. This belief developed out of the experiences of European Jewry, which the early Zionists believed demonstrated the danger inherent to their status as a minority. In contrast to the Zionist notion of nationhood, the Judaic sense of being a nation was rooted in religious beliefs of unique chosenness and divine providence, rather than in ethnicity. Specifically, prayers emphasized distinctiveness from other nations where a connection to Eretz Israel and the anticipation of restoration were based on messianic beliefs and religious practices, not modern nationalist conceptions.

=== Claim to a Jewish demographic majority and a Jewish state in Palestine ===
The Zionist claim to Palestine was based on the notion that Jews had a historical right to the land that outweighed the rights of the Arabs. The establishment of a Jewish demographic majority was an essential aspect of Zionism. Israeli historian Yosef Gorny argues that this demographic change required annulling the majority status of the Arabs. Gorny argues that the Zionist movement regarded Arab motives in Palestine as lacking both moral and historical significance. According to Israeli historian Simha Flapan, the view expressed by the proclamation &quot;there was no such thing as Palestinians&quot; is a cornerstone of Zionist policy. This perspective was also shared by those on the far-left of the Zionist movement, including Martin Buber and other members of Brit Shalom. British officials supporting the Zionist effort also held similar beliefs.

Unlike other forms of nationalism, the Zionist claim to Palestine was aspirational and required a mechanism by which the claim could be realized. The territorial concentration of Jews in Palestine and the subsequent goal of establishing a Jewish majority there was the main mechanism by which Zionist groups sought to realize this claim. By the time of the 1936 Arab Revolt, the political differences between the various Zionist groups had shrunk further, with almost all Zionist groups seeking a Jewish state in Palestine. While not every Zionist group openly called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, every group in the Zionist mainstream was wedded to the idea of establishing a Jewish demographic majority there.

In pursuing a Jewish demographic majority, the Zionist movement encountered the demographic problem posed by the presence of the local Arab population, which was predominantly non-Jewish. The practical issue of establishing a Jewish state in a majority non-Jewish region was an issue of fundamental importance for the Zionist movement. Zionists used the term &quot;transfer&quot; as a euphemism for the removal, or what would now be called ethnic cleansing, of the Palestinian population. According to Morris, the idea of transfer was to play a large role in Zionist ideology from the inception of the movement and was seen as the main method of maintaining the &quot;Jewishness&quot; of the Zionist&#x27;s state. He explains that &quot;transfer&quot; was &quot;inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism&quot; and that a land that was primarily Arab could not be transformed into a Jewish state without displacing the Arab population. Further, the stability of the Jewish state could not be ensured given the Arab population&#x27;s fear of displacement. He explains that this would be the primary source of conflict between the Zionist movement and the Arab population.

The concept of &quot;transfer&quot; had a long pedigree in Zionist thought, with moral considerations rarely entering into the discussions of what was viewed as a logical solutionopposition to transferring the Arab population outside Palestine was typically expressed on practical, rather than moral grounds. The concept of removing the non-Jewish population from Palestine was a notion that garnered support across the entire spectrum of Zionist groups, including its farthest left factions, from early in the movement&#x27;s development. &quot;Transfer&quot; was not only seen as desirable but also as an ideal solution by the Zionist leadership.

=== Zionism, antisemitism and an &quot;existential need&quot; for self-determination ===
From the perspective of some early Zionist thinkers, Jews living amongst non-Jews suffer from impediments that can be addressed only by rejecting the Jewish identity that developed while living amongst non-Jews. Accordingly, the early Zionists sought to develop a nationalist Jewish political life in a territory where Jews constitute a demographic majority. The early Zionist thinkers saw the integration of Jews into non-Jewish society as both unrealistic (or insufficient to address the deficiencies associated with demographic minority status) and undesirable, since assimilation was accompanied by the dilution of Jewish cultural distinctiveness. The Zionist solution to the perceived deficiencies of diasporic life (or the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;) was dependent on the territorial concentration of Jews in Palestine, with the longer-term goal of establishing a Jewish demographic majority there.

=== Racial conceptions of Jewish identity ===

In the late 19th century, amid attempts to apply science to notions of race, the founders of Zionism (Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau, among others) sought to reformulate conceptions of Jewishness in terms of racial identity and the &quot;race science&quot; of the time. They believed that this concept would allow them to build a new framework for collective Jewish identity, and thought that biology might provide &quot;proof&quot; for the &quot;ethnonational myth of common descent&quot; from the biblical land of Israel. Countering antisemitic claims that Jews were both aliens and a racially inferior people, these Zionists drew on and appropriated elements from various race theories, to argue that only a home for the Jewish people could enable the physical regeneration of the Jewish people and a renaissance of pride in their ancient cultural traditions.

The contrasting assimilationist viewpoint was that Jewishness consisted in an attachment to Judaism as a religion and culture. Both the orthodox and liberal establishments often rejected this idea. Subsequently, Zionist and non-Zionist Jews vigorously debated aspects of this proposition in terms of the merits or otherwise of diaspora life. While Zionism embarked on its project of social engineering in Mandatory Palestine, ethnonationalist politics on the European continent strengthened and, by the 1930s, some German Jews, acting defensively, asserted Jewish collective rights by redefining Jews as a race after Nazism rose to power. The Holocaust&#x27;s policies of genocidal ethnic cleansing utterly discredited race as the lethal product of pseudoscience.

With the establishment of Israel in 1948, the &quot;ingathering of the exiles&quot;, and the Law of Return, the question of Jewish origins and biological unity came to assume particular importance during early nation building. Conscious of this, Israeli medical researchers and geneticists were careful to avoid any language that might resonate with racial ideas. Themes of &quot;blood logic&quot; or &quot;race&quot; have nevertheless been described as a recurrent feature of modern Jewish thought in both scholarship and popular belief. Despite this, many aspects of the role of race in the formation of Zionist concepts of a Jewish identity were rarely addressed until recently.

Questions of how political narratives impact the work of population genetics, and its connection to race, have a particular significance in Jewish history and culture. Genetic studies on the origins of modern Jews have been criticized as &quot;being designed or interpreted in the framework of a &#x27;Zionist narrative&#x27;&quot; and as an essentialist approach to biology in a similar manner to criticism of the interpretation of archaeology in the region. According to Israeli historian of science Nurit Kirsh and Israeli geneticist Raphael Falk, the interpretation of the genetic data has been unconsciously influenced by Zionism and anti-Zionism. Falk wrote that every generation has witnessed efforts by both Zionist and non-Zionist Jews to seek a link between national and biological aspects of Jewish identity.
=== Conquest of labor ===

In the early 20th century a more ideologically motivated wave of Zionist immigrants arrived in Palestine. With them, the Zionist movement began to emphasize the so-called &quot;conquest of labor&quot;, the belief that the employment of exclusively Jewish labor was the pre-condition for the development of an independent Jewish society in Palestine. The goal was to build a &quot;pure Jewish settlement&quot; in Palestine on the basis of &quot;100 per cent Jewish labor&quot; and the claim to an exclusively Jewish, highly productive economy. The Zionist leadership aimed to establish a fully autonomous and independent Jewish economic sector to create a new type of Jewish society. This new society was intended to reverse the traditional economic structure seen in the Jewish Diaspora, characterized by a high number of middlemen and a scarcity of productive workers. By developing fundamental sectors such as industry, agriculture, and mining, the goal was to &quot;normalize&quot; Jewish life that had grown &quot;abnormal&quot; as a result of living amongst non-Jews. Most of the Zionist leadership saw it as imperative to employ strictly Jewish workers in order to ensure the Jewish character of the colonies. Another factor, according to Benny Morris, was the worry that that &quot;employment of Arabs would lead to &#x27;Arab values&#x27; being passed on to Zionist youth and nourish the colonists&#x27; tendency to exploit and abuse their workers&quot;, as well as security concerns.

The employment of exclusively Jewish labor was also intended to avoid the development of a national conflict in conjunction with a class-based conflict. The Zionist leadership believed that by excluding Arab workers they would stimulate class conflict only within Arab society and prevent the Jewish-Arab national conflict from attaining a class dimension. While the Zionist settlers of the First Aliyah had ventured to create a &quot;pure Jewish settlement,&quot; they did grow to rely on Arab labor due to the lack of availability of Jewish laborers during this period. With the arrival of the more ideologically driven settlers of the second aliyah, the idea of &quot;avoda ivrit&quot; would become more central. The future leaders of the Zionist movement saw an existential threat in the employment of Arab labor, motivating the movement to work towards a society based on purely Jewish labor.

=== Negation of the life in the Diaspora ===

Zionism rejected traditional Judaic definitions of what it means to be Jewish, but struggled to offer a new interpretation of Jewish identity independent of rabbinical tradition. Jewish religion is viewed as an essentially negative factor, even in religious Zionist ideology, and as responsible for the diminishing status of Jews living as a minority. Responding to the challenges of modernity, Zionism sought to replace religious and community institutions with secular-nationalistic ones. Indeed, Zionism maintained primarily the outward symbols of Jewish tradition, redefining them in a nationalistic context. Zionism saw itself as bringing Jews into the modern world by redefining what it means to be Jewish in terms of identification with a sovereign state, rather than Judaic faith and tradition.

==== Zionism and secular Jewish identity ====
Zionism sought to reconfigure Jewish identity and culture in nationalist and secular terms. This new identity would be based on a rejection of the life of exile. Zionism portrayed the Diaspora Jew as mentally unstable, physically frail, and prone to engaging in transient businesses. They were seen as detached from nature, purely materialistic, and focused solely on their personal gains. In contrast, the vision for the new Jew was radically different: an individual of strong moral and aesthetic values, not shackled by religion, driven by ideals and willing to challenge degrading circumstances; a liberated, dignified person eager to defend both personal and national pride.

The Zionist goal of reframing of Jewish identity in secular-nationalist terms meant primarily the decline of the status of religion in the Jewish community. Prominent Zionist thinkers frame this development as nationalism serving the same role as religion, functionally replacing it. Zionism sought to make Jewish ethnic-nationalism the distinctive trait of Jews rather than their commitment to Judaism. Zionism instead adopted a racial understanding of Jewish identity. Framed this way, Jewish identity is only secondarily a matter of tradition or culture. Zionist nationalism embraced pan-Germanic ideologies, which stressed the concept of das völk: people of shared ancestry should pursue separation and establish a unified state. Zionist thinkers view the movement as a &quot;revolt against a tradition of many centuries&quot; of living parasitically at the margins of Western society. Indeed, Zionism was uncomfortable with the term &quot;Jewish,&quot; associating it with passivity, spirituality and the stain of &quot;galut&quot;. Instead, Zionist thinkers preferred the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; to describe their identity. In Zionist thought, the new Jew would be productive and work the land, in contrast to the diaspora Jew. Zionism linked the term &quot;Jewish&quot; with negative characteristics prevalent in European anti-Semitic stereotypes, which Zionists believed could be remedied only through sovereignty.

=== Revival of the Hebrew language ===
The revival of the Hebrew language in Eastern Europe as a secular literary medium marked a significant cultural shift among Jews, who per Judaic tradition used Hebrew only for religious purposes. The primary motivator for establishing modern Hebrew as a national language was the sense of legitimacy it gave the movement, by suggesting a connection between the Jews of ancient Israel and the Jews of the Zionist movement. These developments are seen in Zionist historiography as a revolt against tradition, with the development of Modern Hebrew providing the basis on which a Jewish cultural renaissance might develop.

The revival of the Hebrew language and the establishment of Modern Hebrew is most closely associated with the linguist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda and the Committee of the Hebrew Language (later replaced by the Academy of the Hebrew Language).

== History ==

=== Historical and religious background ===
The transformation of a religious and primarily passive connection between Jews and Palestine into an active, secular, nationalist movement arose in the context of ideological developments within modern European nations in the 19th century. The concept of the &quot;return&quot; remained a powerful symbol within religious Jewish belief, emphasizing that their return should be determined by Divine Providence rather than human action. The religious Judaic notion of being a nation was distinct from the modern European notion of nationalism. Ultra-Orthodox and Reform Some Jewish groups and authorities opposed collective Jewish settlement in Palestine. Ultra-orthodox Jews viewed it as a violation of the three oaths sworn to God: not to force their way into the homeland, not to hasten the end times, and not to rebel against other nations. They believed that any attempt to achieve redemption through human actions, rather than divine intervention and the coming of the Messiah, constituted a rebellion against divine will and a dangerous heresy.

The cultural memory of Jews in the diaspora revered the Land of Israel. Religious tradition held that a future messianic age would usher in their return as a people, a &#x27;return to Zion&#x27; commemorated particularly at Passover and in Yom Kippur prayers. The biblical prophecy of &quot;Kibbutz Galuyot&quot;, the ingathering of exiles in the Land of Israel as foretold by the Prophets, became a central idea in Zionism.

=== Forerunners of Zionism ===

The forerunners of Zionism, rather than being causally connected to the later development of Zionism, are thinkers and activists who expressed some notion of Jewish national consciousness or advocated for the migration of Jews to Palestine. These attempts were not continuous as national movements typically are. The most notable Proto-Zionists were thinkers such as Judah Alkalai and Zvi Hirsch Kalischer (who were both rabbinical figures). Their idea of Jews as a collective was strongly tied to religious notions distinct from the secular movement referred to as Zionism that developed at the end of the century.

In contrast, Moses Hess, who is regarded as the first modern Jewish nationalist, advocated for the establishment of an independent Jewish state in pursuit of the economic and social normalization of the Jewish people. Hess believed that emancipation alone was not a sufficient solution to the problems faced by European Jewry.

Christian restorationist ideas promoting the migration of Jews to Palestine contributed to the ideological and historical context that gave a sense of credibility to these pre-Zionist initiatives. Restorationist ideas were a prerequisite for the success of Zionism, since although it was created by Jews, Zionism was dependent on support from Christians, although it is unclear how much Christian ideas influenced the early Zionists. Zionism was also dependent on the thinkers of the &quot;Haskalah&quot; or Jewish enlightenment, such as Peretz Smolenskin in 1872, although it often depicted it as its opponent.

=== Establishment of the Zionist movement ===
==== Jewish nationalism and emancipation ====

Ideas of Jewish cultural unity developed a specifically political expression in the 1860s as Jewish intellectuals began promoting the idea of Jewish nationalism. This emerged amid the late 19th century European trend of national revivals.

Zionism emerged towards the end of the &quot;best century&quot; for Jews who for the first time were allowed as equals into European society and gained access to schools, universities, and professions that were previously closed to them. By the 1870s, Jews had achieved almost complete civic emancipation in all the states of western and central Europe. By 1914, Jews had moved from the margins to the forefront of European society. In the urban centers of Europe and America, Jews played an influential role in professional and intellectual life. During this period as Jewish assimilation was still progressing most promisingly, some Jewish intellectuals and religious traditionalists framed assimilation as a humiliating negation of Jewish cultural distinctiveness. The development of Zionism and other Jewish nationalist movements grew out of these sentiments. In this sense, Zionism can be read as a response to the Haskala and the challenges of modernity and liberalism, rather than purely a response to antisemitism.

Emancipation in Eastern Europe progressed more slowly, to the point that Deickoff writes &quot;social conditions were such that they made the idea of individual assimilation pointless&quot;. Antisemitism, pogroms and official policies in Tsarist Russia led to the emigration of three million Jews in the years between 1882 and 1914, only 1% of which went to Palestine. Those who went to Palestine were driven primarily by ideas of self-determination and Jewish identity, rather than just in response to pogroms or economic insecurity. Zionism&#x27;s emergence in the late 19th century was among assimilated Central European Jews who, despite their formal emancipation, still felt excluded from high society. Many of these Jews had moved away from traditional religious observances and were largely secular, mirroring a broader trend of secularization in Europe. Despite their efforts to integrate, the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe were frustrated by continued lack of acceptance by the local national movements that tended toward intolerance and exclusivity. For the early Zionists, if nationalism posed a challenge to European Jewry, it also proposed a solution.

==== Leon Pinsker, Theodor Herzl and the birth of modern political Zionism ====
In the wake of the 1881 Russian pogroms, Leo Pinsker, who was previously an assimilationist, came to the conclusion that the root of the Jewish problem was that Jews formed a distinctive element that could not be assimilated. For Pinsker, emancipation could not resolve the problems of the Jewish people. In Pinsker&#x27;s analysis, Judeophobia was the cause of antisemitism and was primiarily driven by Jews&#x27; lack of a homeland. The solution Pinsker proposed in his pamphlet &quot;Autoemancipation&quot; was for Jews to become a &quot;normal&quot; nation and acquire a homeland over which Jews would have sovereignty. Pinsker primarily viewed Jewish emigration a solution for dealing with the &quot;surplus of Jews, the inassimilable residue&quot; from Eastern Europe who had arrived in Germany in response to the pogroms.

The pogroms motivated a small number of Jews to establish various groups in the Pale of Settlement and Poland aimed at supporting Jewish emigration to Palestine. The publication of &quot;Autoemancipation&quot; provided these groups with an ideological charter around which they would be confederated into Hibbat Zion (&quot;Lovers of Zion&quot;) in 1887 where Pinsker would take a leading role. The settlements established by Hibbat Zion lacked sufficient funds and were ultimately not very successful but are seen as the first of several aliyahs, or waves of settlement, that led to the eventual establishment of the state of Israel. The conditions in Eastern Europe would eventually provide Zionism with a base of Jews seeking to overcome the challenges of external ostracism, from the Tsarist regime, and internal changes within the Jewish communities there. The groups that formed Hibbat Zion included the Bilu group, which began its settlements in 1882. Anita Shapira describes the Bilu as serving the role of a prototype for the settlement groups that followed. At the end of the 19th century, Jews remained a small minority in Palestine.

At this point, Zionism remained a scattered movement. In the 1890s, Theodor Herzl (the father of political Zionism) infused Zionism with a practical urgency and worked to unify the various strands of the movement. The title of Herzl&#x27;s 1896 manifesto providing the ideological basis for Zionism, , is typically translated as The Jewish State. Herzl sought to establish a state where Jews would be the majority and as a result, politically dominant. Ahad Ha&#x27;am, the founder of cultural Zionism, criticized the lack of Jewish cultural activity and creativity in Herzl&#x27;s envisioned state, which Ahad Ha&#x27;am referred to as &quot;the state of the Jews.&quot; Specifically, he points to the envisioned European and German culture of the state where Jews were simply the transmitters of imperialist culture rather than producers or creators of culture. Like Pinsker, Herzl saw antisemitism as a reality that could only be addressed by the territorial concentration of Jews in a Jewish state.

Herzl&#x27;s project was purely secular; the selection of Palestine, after considering other locations, was motivated by the credibility the name would give to the movement. From early on, Herzl recognized that Zionism could not succeed without the support of a Great Power. His view was that this would serve the interests of the Great Powers, and would &quot;form part of a defensive wall for Europe in Asia, an outpost of civilization against barbarism.&quot;

Herzl&#x27;s efforts would lead to the First Zionist Congress at Basel in 1897, which created the Zionist Organization (ZO), renamed in 1960 as World Zionist Organization (WZO), and adopted the Basel Program, which served as the formal platform of the movement until the 1950s, including the official objective of establishing a legally recognized home for the Jewish people in Palestine. The Zionist Organization was to be the main administrative body of the movement and would go on to establish the Jewish Colonial Trust, whose objectives were to encourage European Jewish emigration to Palestine and to assist with the economic development of the colonies.

==== Territories considered ====

Throughout the first decade of the Zionist movement, there were several instances where some Zionist figures, including Herzl, considered a Jewish state in places outside Palestine, such as &quot;Uganda&quot; (actually parts of British East Africa today in Kenya), Argentina, Cyprus, Mesopotamia, Mozambique, and the Sinai Peninsula. Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, was initially content with any Jewish self-governed state. Jewish settlement of Argentina was the project of Maurice de Hirsch. It is unclear if Herzl seriously considered this alternative plan; however, he later affirmed that Palestine would have greater attraction because of the historic ties of Jews with that area. A major concern and driving reason for considering other territories was the Russian pogroms, in particular the Kishinev massacre, and the resulting need for quick resettlement in a safer place.

=== Early Zionist settlement ===

In the early twentieth century, Zionism advanced by establishing towns, colonies, and an independent monetary system to channel Jewish capital into Palestine. Due to the unstable local economy and fluctuating currency values under Ottoman rule, Zionists created their own financial institutions. Despite their small numbers, the Zionists instilled a fear of territorial displacement in the local Palestinian population. This fear would be the main driver of antagonism from the Arabs, leading to physical resistance and the eventual use of military force by settlers. Initially, the impact on rural Palestinians was minimal, with only a few villages encountering Jewish colonies. However, after World War I and as Zionist land purchases increased, the rural population began to experience dramatic changes. From almost the beginning of Zionist settlement, the Palestinians viewed Zionism as an expansionist endeavor. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, Zionism was inherently expansionist and always had the goal of turning the entirety of Palestine into a Jewish state. In addition, Morris describes the Zionists as intent on politically and physically dispossessing the Arabs. Early warnings from local leaders in the 1880s about the destabilizing effects of Jewish immigration went largely unheeded until these later developments. By the early 20th century, there were fourteen Zionist settlements in Palestine, established through land purchases from both local and external landowners.

From the outset, the Zionist leadership saw land acquisition as essential to achieving their goal of establishing a Jewish state. This acquisition was strategic, aiming to create a continuous area of Jewish land. The World Zionist Organization established the Jewish National Fund (JNF) in 1901, with the stated goal &quot;to redeem the land of Palestine as the inalienable possession of the Jewish people.&quot; The notion of land &quot;redemption&quot; entailed that the land could not be sold and could not be leased to a non-Jew nor should the land be worked by Arabs. The land purchased was primarily from absentee landlords, and upon purchase of the land, the tenant farmers who traditionally had rights of usufruct were often expelled. Herzl publicly opposed this dispossession, but wrote privately in his diary: &quot;We shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our country... Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.&quot; Support for expulsion of the Arab population in Palestine was one of the main currents in Zionist ideology from the movement&#x27;s inception.

The arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine in the late 19th century is widely seen as the start of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
Zionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and as few Palestinian Arabs as possible.

In 1903, &#x27;the Eretz Israel assembly&#x27; was held by Menachem Ussishkin. This assembly marked the beginning of a more formalized Zionist colonization effort. Under his leadership, both professional and political organizations were established, paving the way for a sustained Zionist presence in the region. Ussishkin delineated three methods for the Zionist movement to acquire land: by force and conquest, by expropriation via governmental authority, and by purchase. The only option available to the movement at the moment in his perspective was the last one, &quot;until at some point we become rulers&quot;.

==== Second Aliyah ====

The second wave of Zionist settlement came with the Second Aliyah starting in 1904. The settlers of this period laid the foundational elements for the Jewish society in Palestine envisioned by the Zionist movement. They established the first two political parties, the socialist Po&#x27;alei Zion and the non-socialist Ha-Po&#x27;el Ha-Tza&#x27;ir and initiated the first collective agricultural settlements known as kibbutzim, which were fundamental in the formation of the Israeli state. They also formed the first underground military group, Ha-Shomer, which later evolved into the Haganah and eventually became the core of the Israeli army. Many leaders of the Zionist national movement were products of the Second Aliyah. The Zionists of the second aliyah were also more ideologically motivated than those of the first aliyah. In particular, they sought the &quot;conquest of labor&quot;, which entailed the exclusion of Arabs from the labor market.

=== The Balfour Declaration and World War I ===
At the start of World War I, the Zionist leadership attempted to persuade the British government of the benefits of sponsoring a Jewish colony in Palestine. Their main initial success was in establishing a lobbying group centered around the Rothschild family, largely driven by Chaim Weizmann. In the 1917 Balfour declaration, Britain declared its support for &quot;the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people&quot;. The declaration was largely motivated by war-time considerations and antisemitic preconceptions about the putative influence Jews had on the Tsarist government and in the shaping of American policy. Though his decision was also motivated by religious convictions, Balfour himself had passed the Aliens Act 1905, which aimed to keep Eastern European Jews out of Britain. More decisive were Britain&#x27;s colonial and imperial geopolitical goals in the region, specifically in retaining control over the Suez Canal by establishing a pro-British state in the region. Weizmann&#x27;s role in obtaining the Balfour Declaration led to his election as the Zionist movement&#x27;s leader. He remained in that role until 1948, and then was elected as the first President of Israel after the nation gained independence.

Weizmann&#x27;s ultimate goal was the establishment of a Jewish state, even beyond the borders of &quot;Greater Israel.&quot; For Weizmann, Palestine was a Jewish and not an Arab country. The state he sought would contain the east bank of the Jordan River and extend from the Litani River (in present-day Lebanon). Weizmann&#x27;s strategy involved incrementally approaching this goal over a long period, in the form of settlement and land acquisition. Weizmann was open to the idea of Arabs and Jews jointly running Palestine through an elected council with equal representation, but he did not view the Arabs as equal partners in negotiations about the country&#x27;s future. In particular, he was steadfast in his view of the &quot;moral superiority&quot; of the Jewish claim to Palestine over the Arab claim and believed these negotiations should be conducted solely between Britain and the Jews. According to Zionist Israeli historian Simha Flapan, the essential assumptions of Weizmann&#x27;s strategy were later adopted by David Ben-Gurion and subsequent Zionist leaders.

==== King-Crane Commission ====
 In 1919, the US-based King–Crane Commission started with a strongly sympathetic disposition towards Zionism but concluded that the maximum Zionist demands implied subjection of Palestinians to Jewish rule and that this was a violation of the principle of self-determination, given the anti-Zionist sentiment of the non-Jewish population. The report stated that &quot;The initial claim, often submitted by Zionist representatives, that they have a &#x27;right&#x27; to Palestine based on occupation of two thousand years ago, can barely be seriously considered.&quot; Consequently, it recommended a considerably &quot;modified&quot; or &quot;reduced&quot; version of the Zionist programme, with Palestine as a Jewish national home but not a Jewish state.

==== The Development of Revisionist Zionism ====
Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky founded the Revisionist Party in 1925, which took on a more militant ethos and openly maximalist agenda than Weizmann and Ben-Gurion. Jabotinsky rejected Weizmann&#x27;s strategy of incremental state building, instead preferring to immediately declare sovereignty over the entire region, which extended to both the East and West bank of the Jordan river. Like Weizmann and Herzl, Jabotinsky also believed that the support of a great power was essential to the success of Zionism. From early on, Jabotinksy openly rejected the possibility of a &quot;voluntary agreement&quot; with the Arabs of Palestine. He instead believed in building an &quot;iron wall&quot; of Jewish military force to break Arab resistance to Zionism, at which point an agreement could be established. Jabotinsky&#x27;s &quot;iron wall&quot; strategy would have a lasting effect on the Zionist perspective towards the demographic problem posed by the presence of the local Palestinian population. Both the left and right factions of Zionism would rely on this strategy of leveraging military strength in pursuit of political aspirations.

=== British Mandate and development of the Zionist quasi-state ===
After the war, the plan for a greater Arab kingdom under the Hashemite family was abandoned when King Feisal was expelled from Damascus by the French in 1920. In parallel, the Zionist demand for a clear British acknowledgment of the entirety of Palestine as the Jewish national home was rejected. Instead, Britain committed only to establishing a Jewish national home &quot;in Palestine&quot; and promised to facilitate this without prejudicing the rights of existing &quot;non-Jewish communities&quot;these qualifying statements aroused the concern of Zionist leaders at the time.

The British mandate over Palestine, established in 1922, was based on the Balfour declaration, explicitly privileging the Jewish minority over the Arab majority. In addition to declaring British support for the establishment of a &quot;Jewish national home&quot; in Palestine, the mandate included provisions facilitating Jewish immigration, and granting the Zionist movement the status of representing Jewish national interests. In particular, the Jewish Agency, the embodiment of the Zionist movement in Palestine, was made a partner of the mandatory government, acquiring international diplomatic status and representing Zionist interests before the League of Nations and other international venues.

The British mandate effectively established a Jewish quasi-state in Palestine, lacking only full sovereignty. This lack of sovereignty was crucial for Zionism at this early stage, as the Jewish population was too small to defend itself against the Arabs of Palestine. The British presence provided a necessary safeguard for Jewish nationalism. To achieve political independence, Jews needed Britain&#x27;s support, particularly in land purchase and immigration. Following the Balfour declaration, Jewish immigration to Palestine grew from 9,149 immigrants in 1921 to 33,801 in 1925—by the end of the mandate period, the Jewish population in Palestine would have nearly tripled, eventually reaching one third of the country&#x27;s population.

The mandatory administration implemented policies that favored the development of the capitalist sector, predominantly associated with the Jewish community, while disadvantaging the Arab non-capitalist sector. Between 1933 and 1937, government spending was concentrated in two main areas — development and economic services, and defense — with the former focusing on infrastructural improvements (such as railways, roads, bridges, and other public works) that were particularly beneficial for capitalist production. In contrast to the Jewish population, the Arabs did not benefit from any government protections such as social security, employment benefits, trade union protection, job security and training opportunities. Arab wages were one third of their Jewish counterparts (including when paid by the same employer). The mandate also included an article describing self-governing institutions intended only for the Jewish population of Palestine. No similar support or recognition was provided to the Palestinian majority during the time of the mandate.
By enabling the Zionist institutions to serve as a parallel government to the Mandate, the British facilitated the separation of the economy and legitimized their quasi-state status. Accordingly, these institutions, which purported to act in the interests of Jews everywhere, were able to funnel resources into the Jewish sector in Palestine, heavily subsidizing the dominate Jewish economy. The nucleus of the Jewish quasi-state was the Histadrut, established in 1920 as an independent social, political and economic institution. The Histadrut also exercised significant control over the Haganah, a Jewish defense force formed in 1920 in reaction to Arab riots. Originally created to defend the community, Haganah evolved into a permanent underground reserve army fully integrated into the Jewish political structure. Although the British authorities disapproved of the Haganah, particularly its method of stealing arms from British bases, they did not disband it. The Histadrut operated as a completely independent entity, without interference from the British mandate authorities. Ben-Gurion saw the Histadrut&#x27;s detachment from socialist ideology to be one of its key strengths; indeed it was the General Organization of Workers in Israel. In particular, the Histadrut worked towards national unity and aimed to dominate the capitalist system en route to gaining political power, not to create a socialist utopia.

As secretary general of the Histadrut and leader of the Zionist labor movement, Ben-Gurion adopted similar strategies and objectives as Weizmann during this period, disagreeing primarily on issues of specific tactical moves up until 1939. The middle class grew dramatically in size with the arrival of the fourth aliyah in 1924, motivating a political shift within the labor movement. It was during this period that the political strategy of the labor movement would solidify. The founding of the Mapai party unified the labor movement, making it the dominant force. The party saw economic control as essential to facilitating Zionist settlement and achieving political power: &quot;the economic question is not one of class; it is a national question&quot;. For Ben-Gurion, the transformation from &quot;working class to nation&quot; was intertwined with his rejection of diaspora life, as he would declare: the &quot;weak, unproductive, parasitical Jewish masses&quot; must be converted &quot;to productive labor&quot; in service of the nation.

=== Zionist policies and the 1936–1939 Arab Revolt ===
For the Zionist movement, economic development and policies were a mechanism by which political aims could be achieved. A new economic sector exclusively for Jews, controlled by the Labor Zionist movement, was established with support from the Jewish National Fund and the agricultural workers&#x27; Histadrut. Despite the universalist ideals of Zionist pioneering, this new Jewish economic sector was fundamentally based on exclusionary practices. The goal of achieving &quot;100 percent of Hebrew labour&quot; was the primary driver of the territorial, economic and social separation between Jews and Arabs.

The Zionist economic platform was partially based on the assumption (eventually demonstrated incorrect) that economic benefits to the Arabs of Palestine would pacify opposition to the movement. For the Zionist leadership, the economic status and development of the Arabs of Palestine should be compared with Arabs of other countries, rather than with the Jews of Palestine. Accordingly, disproportionate gains in Jewish development were be acceptable as long as the status of the Arab sector did not worsen. While British support for Zionist aspirations in Palestine established the parameters within which the Arab economy could develop, Zionist policies reinforced these limitations. Most notable are the exclusion of Arab labor from Jewish enterprise and the expulsion of Arab peasants from Jewish-owned land. Both of these had limited impact in scope but reinforced the structural limitations put in place by British policies.

With the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, the Jewish community was increasingly persecuted and driven out. The discriminatory immigration laws of the US, UK and other countries preferable to German Jews, led to in 1935 alone more than 60,000 Jews arriving in Palestine (more than the total number of Jews in Palestine as of the establishment of the Balfour declaration in 1917). Ben-Gurion would subsequently declare that immigration at this rate would allow for the maximalist Zionist goal of a Jewish state in all of Palestine. The Arab community openly pressured the mandatory government to restrict Jewish immigration and land purchases.

Sporadic attacks in the countryside (described by Zionists and the British as &quot;banditry&quot;) reflected widespread anger over the Zionist land purchases that displaced local peasants. Meanwhile, in urban areas, protests against British rule and the increasing influence of the Zionist movement intensified and became more militant in the early 1930s. 

The 1936 Arab Revolt was a turning point in Jewish-Arab relations, unifying previously divided factions within the Zionist movement and reshaping their political outlook. The dominant feeling within the Zionist movement was that Jewish considerations took precedence over those of the Arabs and the movement was in a struggle for survival. From this perspective, the leadership believed that they could not afford to compromise. According to Gorny, these considerations would drive the Zionist belief in the necessity of the use of force against the Arabs whose motives &quot;were of no moral or historical significance&quot;. 

During the revolt, the Irgun Zvai Leumi engaged in the use of terror attacks against the Arabs of Palestine. Similarly, for the labor Zionist Palmah, the lines delineating what was acceptable and unacceptable while dealing with Arab villagers were &quot;vague and intentionally blurred&quot;. These ambiguous limits practically did not differ from those of the self-described &quot;terrorist&quot; group, Irgun. According to Anita Shapira, beginning in this period, Labor Zionism&#x27;s use of violence against Palestinians for political means was essentially the same as that of radical conservative Zionist groups.

=== The Peel Commission partition proposal ===

In response to the revolt the British appointed in 1937 a commission of inquiry that eventually recommended the partition of the land. The proposal included creating a small Jewish state occupying 17 percent of Mandatory Palestine&#x27;s territory, while Jerusalem and a corridor to the sea would remain under British control, and the remaining 75 percent of the territory would form a Palestinian state connected to Transjordan under King Abdullah&#x27;s rule. At this point, Jews owned 5.6% of the land in Palestine; the land allocated to the Jewish state would contain 40 percent of the country&#x27;s fertile land.
The commission also proposed a population transfer of the Palestinian Arabs from the areas designated for the Jewish state, based on the precedent of the 1923 Greek-Turkish population exchange. For Ben-Gurion, the transfer proposal was the most appealing recommendation put forward by the commission. Indeed, this sentiment was deeply ingrained to the extent that Ben Gurion&#x27;s acceptance of partition was contingent upon the removal of the Palestinian population.

The Zionist leadership viewed the mass transfer of the Arabs as morally permissible, but were unsure of its political effectiveness. Much of the Zionist leadership spoke in strong support of the transfer plan, asserting that there is nothing immoral about it. Within the Zionist movement, two perspectives developed with respect to the partition proposal; the first was a complete rejection of partition, the second was acceptance of the idea of partition on the basis that it would eventually allow for expansion to all territories within &quot;the boundaries of Zionist aspirations.&quot;. It was the right wing of the Zionist movement that put forward the main arguments against transfer, with Jabotinsky strongly objecting it on moral grounds, and others mainly focusing on its impracticality. However, in his last book &quot;The Jewish War Front&quot; published in 1940, after the outbreak of WWII, Jabotinsky no longer ruled out the possibility of voluntary population transfer, though he still didn&#x27;t view as a necessary solution. Some leaders, such as Ruppin, Motzkin, and writers such as Israel Zangwill, also referred to transfer as a &quot;voluntary&quot; action that would include some form of compensation. However, &quot;Palestine&#x27;s Arabs did not wish to evacuate the land of their ancestors... The matter raised ethical questions that troubled the Yishuv&quot;. The revolt was inflamed by the partition proposal and continued until 1939 when it was forcefully suppressed by the British.

Later, Vladimir Jabotinsky, the right-wing Zionist leader, drew inspiration from the Nazi demographic policies that resulted in the expulsion of 1.5 million Poles and Jews, in whose place Germans resettled. In Jabotinsky&#x27;s assessment:
The world has become accustomed to the idea of mass migrations and has almost become fond of them. Hitleras odious as he is to ushas given this idea a good name in the world.

By the time of the 1936 Arab revolt, almost all groups within the Zionist movement wanted a Jewish state in Palestine, &quot;whether they declared their intent or preferred to camouflage it, whether or not they perceived it as a political instrument, whether they saw sovereign independence as the prime aim, or accorded priority to the task of social construction&quot;. The main debates within the movement at this time were concerning partition of Palestine and the nature of the relationship with the British. The intensity of the revolt, Britain&#x27;s ambiguous support for the movement and the increasing threat against European Jewry during this period motivated the Zionist leadership to prioritize immediate considerations. The movement ultimately favored the notion of partition, primarily out of practical considerations and partially out of a belief that establishing a Jewish state over all of Palestine would remain an option. At the 1937 Zionist congress, the Zionist leadership adopted the stance that the land allocated to the Jewish state by the partition plan was inadequate—effectively rejecting the partition plan that faded away in the face of both Arab and Zionist opposition.

In response to Ben-Gurion&#x27;s 1938 quote that &quot;politically we are the aggressors and they [the Palestinians] defend themselves&quot;, Israeli historian Benny Morris says, &quot;Ben-Gurion, of course, was right. Zionism was a colonizing and expansionist ideology and movement&quot;, and that &quot;Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and elementally expansionist.&quot; Morris describes the Zionist goal of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine as necessarily displacing and dispossessing the Arab population.

=== Nazism, World War II and the Holocaust ===
In 1939, a British White Paper would recommend limiting Jewish immigration and land purchase with the objective of maintaining the status quo while the threat of war loomed in Europe. The immigration was to be limited to no more than 75,000 people over the next five years. With Nazi expansionism in Europe, the limits on immigration prompted further militarization, land takeover and illegal immigration efforts by the Zionist movement. The second world war broke out as the Zionists were developing their campaign against the White Paper—unable to accept the White Paper or to side against the British, the Zionist movement would ultimately support the British war effort while working to upend the White Paper. From the start of the second world war, the Zionists pressured the British to organize and train a Jewish &quot;army&quot;, culminating in the establishment of a Jewish Brigade and accompanying blue and white flag. The development of this force would further train and enable the already substantial Zionist military capacity. The Haganah was allowed by the British to openly acquire weapons and worked with the British to prepare for a possible Axis invasion.

Despite the White Paper, Zionist immigration and settlement efforts continued during the war period. While immigration had previously been selective, once the details of the holocaust reached Palestine in 1942, selectivity was abandoned. The official Zionist movement&#x27;s war effort focused on the survival and development of the Yishuv; Pappe argues that scarce Zionist energy was deployed in support of European Jews. Many of those fleeing Nazi terror in Europe preferred to leave for the United States, however, strict American immigration policies and Zionist efforts led to 10% of the 3 million Jews leaving Europe to settle in Palestine.

In the Biltmore Program of 1942, the Zionist movement would openly declare for the first time its goal of establishing a Jewish state in all of Palestine. At this point, the United States, with its growing economy and unprecedented military force, became a focal point of Zionist political activity that engaged with the American electorate and politicians. US President Truman supported the Biltmore program for the duration of his time in office, largely motivated by humanitarian concerns and the growing influence of the Zionist lobby.

During World War II, as the horrors of the Holocaust became known, the Zionist leadership formulated the One Million Plan, a reduction from Ben-Gurion&#x27;s previous target of two million immigrants. Following the end of the war, many stateless refugees, mainly Holocaust survivors, began migrating to Palestine in small boats in defiance of British rules. The Holocaust united much of the rest of world Jewry behind the Zionist project. The British either imprisoned these Jews in Cyprus or sent them to the British-controlled Allied Occupation Zones in Germany. The British, having faced Arab revolts, were now facing opposition by Zionist groups in Palestine for subsequent restrictions on Jewish immigration. In January 1946 the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, a joint British and American committee, was tasked to examine political, economic and social conditions in Mandatory Palestine and the well-being of the peoples now living there; to consult representatives of Arabs and Jews, and to make other recommendations &#x27;as necessary&#x27; for an interim handling of these problems as well as for their eventual solution. Following the failure of the 1946–47 London Conference on Palestine, at which the United States refused to support the British, leading to both the Morrison–Grady Plan and the Bevin Plan being rejected by all parties, the British decided to refer the question to the UN on February 14, 1947.

=== End of the Mandate and expulsion of the Palestinians ===
Towards the end of the war, the Zionist leadership was motivated more than ever to establish a Jewish state. Since the British were no longer sponsoring its development, many Zionists considered it would be necessary to establish the state by force by upending the British position in Palestine. In this the IRA&#x27;s tactics against Britain in the Irish War of Independence served as a both a model and source of inspiration. The Irgun, the military arm of the revisionist Zionists, and Lehi, who at one point sought an alliance with the Nazis, would lead a series of terrorist attacks against the British starting in 1944. This included the King David Hotel bombing, British immigration and tax offices and police stations. It was only by the war&#x27;s end that the Haganah joined in the sabotage against the British. The combined impact of US opinion and the attacks on British presence eventually led the British to refer the situation to the United Nations in 1947. In response to a United Kingdom government request that the General Assembly &quot;make recommendations under article 10 of the Charter, concerning the future government of Palestine&quot;, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) was created on 15 May 1947.

The urgency of the condition of the Jewish refugees in Europe motivated the committee to unanimously vote in favor of terminating the British mandate in Palestine. The disagreement came with regards to whether Palestine should be partitioned or if it should constitute a federal state. American lobbying efforts, pressuring UN delegates with the threat of withdrawal of US aid, eventually secured the General Assembly votes in favor of the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, which was passed 29 November 1947.

Outbursts of violence slowly grew into a wider civil war between the Arabs and Zionist militias. By mid-December, the Haganah had shifted to a more &quot;aggressive defense&quot;, abandoning notions of restraint it had espoused from 1936 to 1939. The Haganah reprisal raids were often disproportionate to the initial Arab offenses, which led to the spread of violence to previously unaffected areas. The Zionist militias, employed terror attacks against Arab civilian and militia centers and many Palestinians were evicted from their houses. In response, Arabs planted bombs in Jewish civilian areas, particularly in Jerusalem.

The first expulsion of Palestinians began 12 days after the adoption of the UN resolution, and the first Palestinian village was eliminated a month later, in retaliation for Palestinian attacks on convoys and Jewish settlements. In March 1948, Zionist forces began implementing Plan D, an ethnic cleansing operation that involved the expulsion of civilians and the destruction of Arab towns and villages in pursuit of eliminating Palestinians seen as potentially hostile, resulting in the loss of Palestine to much of its indigenous population. According to Benny Morris Zionist forces committed 24 massacres of Palestinians in the ensuing war, in part as a form of psychological warfare, the most notorious of which is the Deir Yassin massacre. The United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine estimated that between 1948 and 1949, 710,000 Palestinians were driven out of the country and another 40,000 were internally displaced, primarily as a result of these expulsions and massacres.

The British left Palestine (having done little to maintain order) on May 14 as planned. The British did not facilitate a formal transfer of power; a fully functioning Jewish quasi-state had already been operating under the British for the past several decades. The same day, Ben-Gurion declared the establishment of the state of Israel. The Declaration of Independence of Israel described a democracy with equality of social and political rights for all citizens, and extended a peace offering to neighboring states and their Arab citizens. Masalha notes that the declaration states equality on the basis of citizenship but not nationality.

The ensuing war led to the State of Israel establishing control over 78% of Mandatory Palestine, instead of the 55% outlined in the UN partition plan, and resulted in the destruction of much of Palestinian society and the Arab landscape. This war, led by the Zionist Yishuv was framed by its leaders in biblical and messianic terms as a &#x27;miraculous clearing of the land,&#x27; akin to the biblical War of Joshua. Masalha writes that it is not clear who the Yishuv was declaring independence from, as it was neither from the British colonial rule, which facilitated Jewish settlement against Palestinian wishes, nor from the land&#x27;s indigenous inhabitants, who had long cultivated and owned it. After the 1949 Armistice Agreements, a series of laws passed by the first Israeli government prevented displaced Palestinians from claiming private property or returning on the state&#x27;s territories. They and many of their descendants remain refugees supported by UNRWA.

==== Hebraization of names ====

As part of the effort to consolidate its new ownership over the land it had taken over in the 1948 war, the Israeli state worked towards &quot;erasing all traces of its former owners&quot;. The project of &quot;Hebraization&quot; of the map, for which the JNF Naming Committee was established, aimed to replace what remained of the Arab towns and villages with newly named Israeli settlements. These names were often based on the Arab names but with a &quot;Hebrew pronunciation&quot; or based on old Hebrew biblical names. This effort also sought to demonstrate continuous Jewish ownership over the land to ancient times. 

Prior to 1948, the Zionist movement had limited authority over the use of place names in Palestine. After 1948, the Zionist movement systematically eliminated mention of &quot;Palestine&quot; from the names of its organizations; for example, the Jewish Agency for Palestine, which played a critical role in the founding of the Israeli state in 1948 was renamed to the &quot;Jewish Agency for Israel&quot;.

=== Post-World War II ===

Since the creation of the State of Israel, the World Zionist Organization has functioned mainly as an organization dedicated to assisting and encouraging Jews to migrate to Israel. It has provided political support for Israel in other countries but plays little role in internal Israeli politics. The movement&#x27;s major success since 1948 was in providing logistical support for Jewish migrants and refugees and, most importantly, in assisting Soviet Jews in their struggle with the authorities over the right to leave the USSR and to practice their religion in freedom, and the exodus of 850,000 Jews from the Arab world, mostly to Israel. In 1944–45, Ben-Gurion described the One Million Plan to foreign officials as being the &quot;primary goal and top priority of the Zionist movement.&quot; The immigration restrictions of the British White Paper of 1939 meant that such a plan could not be put into large scale effect until the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948. The new country&#x27;s immigration policy had some opposition within the new Israeli government, such as those who argued that there was &quot;no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own&quot; as well as those who argued that the absorption process caused &quot;undue hardship&quot;. However, the force of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s influence and insistence ensured that his immigration policy was carried out.

=== Religious Zionism and the Six-Day War ===

Prior to the 1967 Six-Day War, religious Zionism mostly described support for political Zionism among Orthodox Jews. However, the war and the Israeli conquest of the West Bank, invigorated and popularized a religious Zionist ideology associated with the Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, which believes that Zionism is a part of the historical process that will bring about the messianic age. This ideology considered secular Zionism and secular state policies to be holy and part God&#x27;s divine plan: &quot;The spirit of Israel... is so closely linked to the spirit of God that a Jewish nationalist, no matter how secularist his intention may be, is, despite himself, imbued with the divine spirit even against his own will.&quot;

According to followers of the Mercaz HaRav ideology, the Six Day War was a demonstration of the work of the Divine Hand and the &quot;beginning of redemption&quot;. Proponents of this ideology venerate the land as sacred, and consider its sanctity a core principle of religious Zionism. Religious Zionists view the settlement of the West Bank as a commandment of God, necessary for the redemption of the Jewish people. Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, a major religious Zionist leader and thinker, would declare in 1967 following the Six Day War in the presence of Israeli leadership including the president, ministers, members of the Knesset, judges, chief rabbis and senior civil servants:

 I tell you explicitly... that there is a prohibition in the Torah against giving up even an inch of our liberated land. There are no conquests here and we are not occupying foreign land; we are returning to our home, to the inheritance of our forefathers. There is no Arab land here, only the inheritance of our God—the more the world gets used to this thought the better it will be for it and for all of us.
In the 1970s, religious Zionists, such as Shlomo Aviner and Hanan Porat, campaigned against Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Sinai Peninsula. Religious Zionist ideology motivated the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, who ceded some territory to the PLO as a part of the Oslo Accords, and several religious Zionist rabbis reacted to the assassination with approval.

== Streams and types of Zionism ==
From the turn of the century until the Arab revolt of 1936, there was room for political flexibility within the Zionist movement, many scholars argue that different currents of Zionism have had a shared core framework. Most mainstream histories of the movement delineate a few key strains, many following a taxonomy introduced during the period starting in the late 19th century and continuing into the 1930s: political, practical, socialist, cultural and revisionist. Some scholars emphasise the heterogeneity of these strains of Zionism.

=== Early Zionist Strains: Political and practical Zionism ===
Political Zionism was led by Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau. This approach was espoused at the Zionist Organization&#x27;s First Zionist Congress. It focused on a Jewish home as a solution to the &quot;Jewish question&quot; and antisemitism in Europe, centred on gaining Jewish sovereignty (probably within the Ottoman or later British or French empire), and was opposed to mass migration until after sovereignty was granted. It initially considered locations other than Palestine (e.g. in Africa) and did not foresee migration by many Western Jews to the new homeland.

Known in Hebrew as , Practical Zionism was led by Moshe Leib Lilienblum and Leon Pinsker and molded by the Hovevei Zion organization. It became dominant after Herzl&#x27;s death, and differed from Political Zionism in not seeing Zionism as justified primarily by the Jewish Question but rather as an end in itself; it &quot;aspired to the establishment of an elite utopian community in Palestine&quot; through Aliyah. It also differed from Political Zionism in &quot;distrust[ing] grand political actions&quot; and preferring &quot;an evolutionary incremental process toward the establishment of the national home&quot;.

These initially dominant strains faded after the First World War and Balfour Declaration.

=== Labor Zionism ===

Led by socialists Nachman Syrkin, Haim Arlosoroff, Berl Katznelson, and Marxist Ber Borochov, Labor or Socialist Zionism was a form of Zionism that combined messianic tendencies and socialist or social democratic politics. The labor Zionists promoted immigration and settlement, establishing &quot;facts on the ground&quot; as the main path towards statebuilding. 

Labor Zionism became a mass movement with the founding of Poale Zion (&quot;Workers of Zion&quot;) groups in Eastern and Western Europe and North America in the 1900s. Poale Zion split between Left and Right after 1917. In 1919, the Right Poale Zion in Palestine disbanded to form the nationalist socialist Ahdut HaAvoda, led by David Ben Gurion; in 1930, it merged with Hapoel Hatzair, founded by A. D. Gordon, to form Mapai. Labor Zionism, represented by Mapai, became the dominant force in the political and economic life of the Yishuv during the British Mandate of Palestine. It was the dominant ideology of the political establishment in Israel until the 1977 election, when the Israeli Labor Party was defeated. During the early twentieth century, the left wing of this tradition was represented by Hashomer Hatzair, followed by Mapam in the late twentieth century, and Meretz until 2022.

 In Labor Zionist thought, a revolution of the Jewish soul and society was believed necessary and achievable in part by Jews moving to Israel and becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. Labor Zionists established rural communes in Israel called &quot;kibbutzim&quot;, a form of cooperative agriculture in which the Jewish National Fund hired Jewish workers under trained supervision. The kibbutzim were a symbol of the Second Aliyah in that they put great emphasis on communalism and egalitarianism, representing Utopian socialism to a certain extent. Furthermore, they stressed self-sufficiency, which became an essential aspect of Labor Zionism.

=== Synthetic and General Zionism ===

Synthetic Zionism, led by Chaim Weizmann, Leo Motzkin and Nahum Sokolow, was an approach that advocated a combination of practical and political Zionism and distanced themselves from the growing Labour, Religious and Revisionist Zionist groups as the movement became polarised between those. General Zionists identified with the liberal European middle class to which many Zionist leaders such as Herzl and Chaim Weizmann aspired. As head of the World Zionist Organization, Weizmann&#x27;s policies had a sustained impact on the Zionist movement, with Abba Eban describing him as a dominant figure in Jewish life during the interwar period.

=== Revisionist Zionism ===

Revisionist Zionism, developed by Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky in the 1920s, was a right-wing strain of Zionism. It initially believed that a Jewish state must expand to both sides of the Jordan River, i.e. taking Transjordan in addition to all of Palestine. It broke with the WZO in 1935 because of the latter&#x27;s refusal to declare the establishment of a Jewish state as its immediate aim, and had its own paramilitary organisation, Irgun, from 1931 to 1948.

Followers of Revisionist Zionism developed the Likud Party in Israel, which has dominated most governments since 1977. It advocates Israel&#x27;s maintaining control of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and takes a hard-line approach in the Arab–Israeli conflict.

=== Religious Zionism ===
Initially led by Yitzchak Yaacov Reines and by Abraham Isaac Kook, Religious Zionism is a variant of Zionist ideology that combines religious conservatism and secular nationalism into a theology with patriotism as its basis. One of the core ideas in Religious Zionism is the belief that the ingathering of exiles in the Land of Israel and the establishment of Israel is the beginning of the redemption, the initial stage of the &quot;geula&quot;. 

After the Six-Day War and the capture of the West Bank, a territory referred to by the movement as Judea and Samaria, the movement turned right as it integrated revanchist and irredentist forms of nationalism; this right-wing form of religious Zionism, powerful within the settlement movement, is represented today by Gush Emunim (founded by students of Abraham Kook&#x27;s son Zvi Yehuda Kook in 1974), Jewish Home (HaBayit HaYehudi, formed in 2009), Tkuma, and Meimad.

Kahanism, a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose party, Kach, was eventually banned from the Knesset, but has been increasingly influential on Israeli politics.

=== Liberal Zionism ===
Today, the liberal Zionist perspective criticizes the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory since 1967 while also promoting the idea of a Jewish state as a necessity. In this vein, liberal Zionism sees Zionist and Israeli activity before 1967, such as the military conquest of Palestine and the expulsion of Palestinians in 1948, as a necessity.

Liberal Zionism, although not associated with any single party in modern Israel, remains a strong trend in Israeli politics advocating free market principles, democracy and adherence to human rights.

Philosopher Carlo Strenger describes a modern-day version of Liberal Zionism, rooted in the original ideology of Herzl and Ahad Ha&#x27;am. It is marked by a concern for democratic values and human rights, freedom to criticize government policies without accusations of disloyalty, and rejection of excessive religious influence in public life. Liberal Zionists see that &quot;Jewish history shows that Jews need and are entitled to a nation-state of their own. But they also think that this state must be a liberal democracy, which means that there must be strict equality before the law independent of religion, ethnicity or gender.&quot;

=== Cultural Zionism ===

Cultural Zionism or Spiritual Zionism is a strain of Zionism that focused on creating a center in historic Palestine with its own secular Jewish culture and national history, including language and historical roots, rather than on mass migration or state-building. The founder of Cultural Zionism was Asher Ginsberg, better known as Ahad Ha&#x27;am. Like Hibbat Zion and unlike Herzl, Ha&#x27;am saw Palestine as the spiritual centre of Jewish life. Ha&#x27;am inaugurated the movement in his 1880 essay &quot;This is not the way&quot;, which called for the cultivation of a qualitative Jewish presence in the land over [the] quantitative one&quot; pursued by Hibbat Zion. Ha&#x27;am was also a sharp critic of Herzl; spiritual Zionism believed that the realpolitik engaged in by Political Zionism corrupted Jewry, and opposed any political solutions that victimised non-Jewish people in the land.

Brit Shalom, which promoted Arab-Jewish cooperation, was established in 1925 by supporters of Ahad Ha&#x27;am&#x27;s Spiritual Zionism, including Martin Buber, Gershom Scholem, Hans Kohn, &quot;and other important figures of the intellectual elite of the pre-independence &quot;yishuv&quot;, Gorny describes it as an ultimately marginal group.

== Non-Jewish support ==

=== Christian support ===

From the beginning of the Zionist movement&#x27;s development, it was dependent on support from the Christian world. The Christian restorationist movement held the belief that the &quot;return&quot; of Jews to Palestine would trigger the second coming of the Messiah, the resurrection of the dead, and ultimately lead to the conversion of the Jews to Christianity. In this sense, Christian ideas of &quot;restoration&quot; were a prerequisite for Zionism.

Christian Zionism is primarily driven by the belief that the return of Jews to the Holy Land will either lead to their conversion to Christianity or their destruction. This belief is criticized by Gershom Gorenberg in his book &quot;The End of Days,&quot; where he highlights the troubling aspect of this messianic scenario—the disappearance of Jews. Evangelical figures like Jerry Falwell believe the establishment of Israel is a pivotal event signaling the Second Coming of Christ and the eventual End of the World. As a result, Christian Zionists have significantly contributed politically and financially to Israeli nationalist forces, with the understanding that Israel&#x27;s role is to facilitate the Second Coming of Christ and the elimination of Judaism.

One of the principal Protestant teachers who promoted the biblical doctrine that the Jews would return to their national homeland was John Nelson Darby. His doctrine of dispensationalism is credited with promoting Zionism, following his 11 lectures on the hopes of the church, the Jew and the gentile given in Geneva in 1840. However, others like C H Spurgeon, both Horatius and Andrew Bonar, Robert Murray M&#x27;Chyene, and J C Ryle were among a number of prominent proponents of both the importance and significance of a Jewish return, who were not dispensationalist. Pro-Zionist views were embraced by many evangelicals and also affected international foreign policy.

The largest Zionist organisation is Christians United for Israel, which has 10 million members and is led by John Hagee.

=== Hindu support ===

After Israel&#x27;s creation in 1948, the Indian National Congress government opposed Zionism. Some writers have claimed that this was done in order to get more Muslim votes in India (where Muslims numbered over 30 million at the time).

In more current times, conservative Indian parties and organizations tend to support Zionism. A 2012 international opinion survey found that India was the most pro-Israel country in the world. This has invited attacks on the Hindutva movement by parts of the Indian left opposed to Zionism, and allegations that Hindus are conspiring with the &quot;Jewish Lobby.&quot;

== Anti-Zionism ==


Zionism has been opposed by a wide variety of organizations and individuals. Until World War II, anti-Zionism was widespread among Jews for varying reasons. Orthodox Jews opposed Zionism on religious grounds, as preempting the Messiah, many secular or assimilationist Jewish anti-Zionists identified more with ideals of the Enlightenment and saw Zionism as a reactionary ideology, while left-wing Jews (including in the Bund) believed that the Jewish question was best solved in the diaspora through building a socialist society.

Opposition to Zionism in the Jewish diaspora was surmounted only from the 1930s onward, as conditions for Jews deteriorated radically in Europe and, with the Second World War, the sheer scale of the Holocaust was felt. Thereafter, Jewish anti-Zionist groups generally either disintegrated or transformed into pro-Zionist organizations, though many small groups, and bodies like the American Council for Judaism, conserved an earlier Reform tradition of rejection of Zionism.

There was a shift in the meaning of anti-Zionism after the events of the 1940s. Whereas pre-1948 anti-Zionism was against the hypothetical establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, post-1948 anti-Zionism had to contend with the existence of the State of Israel. This often meant taking a retaliatory position to the new reality of Jewish sovereignty in the Middle East. The overriding impulse of post-1948 anti-Zionism is to dismantle the current State of Israel and replace it with something else.

Opposition to Zionism was overwhelmingly common among the non-Jewish communities of Palestine from the 1880s onwards. Palestinian nationalism, the national movement of the Palestinian people that espouses self-determination and sovereignty over the region of Palestine, cohered in the early 20th century, along with broader Arab nationalism and the ideology of Greater Syria. Palestinian nationalism later internationalized and attached itself to other ideologies, in particular Third World socialism and Islamism, and was embodied in particular by the broadly secular Palestinian Liberation Organisation, and later also by the socialist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Islamist Hamas.

Although the left was initially mostly supportive of Zionism, Soviet anti-Zionism was influential in spreading anti-Zionism on the global left, and much of the New Left of the 1960s took on anti-Zionism as a key tenet.

Today, opponents include Palestinian nationalists, several states of the Arab League and in the Muslim world, much of the left, and some secular Jews, as well as the Satmar and Neturei Karta Jewish sects.

The fascist far right have also generally espoused anti-Zionism, for antisemitic reasons.

Reasons for opposing Zionism have been varied, and they include: fundamental disagreement that foreign born Jews have rights of resettlement, the perception that land confiscations are unfair; expulsions of Palestinians; violence against Palestinians; and alleged racism. Arab states in particular have historically strongly opposed Zionism. The preamble of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights, which has been ratified by 53 African countries , includes an undertaking to eliminate Zionism together with other practices including colonialism, neo-colonialism, apartheid, &quot;aggressive foreign military bases&quot; and all forms of discrimination.

=== Characterization as colonialist and racist ===

In December 1973, the UN passed a series of resolutions condemning South Africa and included a reference to an &quot;unholy alliance between Portuguese colonialism, Apartheid and Zionism.&quot; At the time there was little cooperation between Israel and South Africa, although the two countries would develop a close relationship during the 1970s. Parallels have also been drawn between aspects of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime and certain Israeli policies toward the Palestinians, which are seen as manifestations of racism in Zionist thinking.

In 1975 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 3379, which said &quot;Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination&quot;. According to the resolution, &quot;any doctrine of racial differentiation of superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust, and dangerous&quot;. The resolution named the occupied territory of Palestine, Zimbabwe, and South Africa as examples of racist regimes. Resolution 3379 was pioneered by the Soviet Union and passed with numerical support from Arab and African states amidst accusations that Israel was supportive of the apartheid regime in South Africa. In 1991 the resolution was repealed with UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86, after Israel declared that it would only participate in the Madrid Conference of 1991 if the resolution were revoked.

Arab countries sought to associate Zionism with racism in connection with a 2001 UN conference on racism, which took place in Durban, South Africa, which caused the United States and Israel to walk away from the conference. The final text of the conference did not connect Zionism with racism. A human rights forum arranged in connection with the conference, on the other hand, did equate Zionism with racism and censured Israel for what it called &quot;racist crimes, including acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing&quot;.

=== Haredi Judaism and Zionism ===

Haredi Jews number some 2,100,000 world-wide, constituting 14% of the total Jewish population in the world. Most accept though do not support the secular Israeli state. A small number of Orthodox organizations among these Haredi reject Zionism as they view it as a secular movement and reject nationalism as a doctrine. in Jerusalem, certain Hasidic groups, most famously the Satmar Hasidim, as well as the larger movement they are part of, the Edah HaChareidis, are opposed to its ideology for religious reasons. Despite having his life saved by a leader of the Zionist movement in 1944, one of the best known Hasidic opponents of political Zionism was Hungarian rebbe and Talmudic scholar Joel Teitelbaum. Although this group of ultra-observant Jews do not support or identify with Zionism as a movement or ideology, in a poll taken in February 2024, 83% said they have a &quot;very strong emotional connection&quot; to Israel, only a small percentage less than the 87% of Modern Orthodox Jews who reported having those same feelings.

The Neturei Karta, a tiny Orthodox Haredi sect, is considered &quot;the most radical of the Extreme Orthodox groups&quot;, with approximately 5,000 members worldwide that make up about 0.03 percent of the world&#x27;s Jewish population. Some of its members have said that Israel is a &quot;racist regime&quot;, compared Zionists to Nazis, claimed that Zionism is contrary to the teachings of the Torah, or accused it of promoting antisemitism.

=== Anti-Zionism or antisemitism ===

Critics of anti-Zionism have argued that opposition to Zionism can be hard to distinguish from antisemitism, and that criticism of Israel may be used as an excuse to express viewpoints that might otherwise be considered antisemitic.

Anti-Zionist writers such as Noam Chomsky, Norman Finkelstein, Michael Marder, and Tariq Ali have argued that the characterization of anti-Zionism as antisemitic obscures legitimate criticism of Israel&#x27;s policies and actions, and that it is used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel.

== Zionism and colonialism ==

=== European Colonialism ===
Zionism has been characterized as a form of colonialism or settler colonialism by various scholars. Joseph Massad argues that Zionism was intrinsically linked to European colonial thought from its inception, shaped by antisemitism and European imperial interests. Edward Said similarly described the movement as following the European colonial model, particularly in its patronizing view of the native Palestinian population, which it regarded as backward. Zeev Sternhell describes Zionism disagrees as a movement of &quot;conquest&quot;, but disagrees that Jews arriving in Palestine had a colonial mindset. Anita Shapira and Shlomo Ben-Ami also emphisize the importance of the &quot;ethos&quot; of the movement, framing Zionism as a national liberation movement that was &quot;destined&quot; or &quot;forced&quot; to use colonial methods. 
Conversely, Nur Masalha argues that Zionism cannot be understood as a national liberation movement because it relied on British colonial support, asserting that &quot;the State of Israel owes its very existence to the British colonial power in Palestine&quot;.

Various proponents of Zionism have characterized Zionism as colonial or settler-colonial. Joseph Massad wrote that, for political and ideological reasons, starting in the 1930s, some Zionist thinkers proposed that the Zionist movement should avoid using terms related to colonialism. Rashid Khalidi highlights how this move was an attempted rebranding of Zionism as an anticolonial movement.

=== The Transition from British sponsored colonialism to the Israeli state ===
Gershon Shafir describes the use of violence by a colonial metropole as essential to settler colonization. Shafir defines settler-colonialism as the creation of a permanent home in which settlers benefit from privileges withheld from the indigenous population. He describes colonization, the establishment of settlements against the wishes of the indigenous people, as the distinctive characteristic of settler colonialism.

Shafir distinguishes between the pre-1948 era and the post-1967 era in the sense that after 1967, the Israeli state became the sponsor of the Zionist movement&#x27;s colonial efforts, a role that had previously been played by the British. For Shafir, Jerome Slater and Shlomo Ben-Ami, after the Israeli conquest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, the Zionist movement more closely resembled other colonial movements. Similarly, Avi Shlaim describes 1967 as a milestone in the development of the &quot;Zionist colonial project&quot; rather than as a qualitative shift in its nature. Israeli historian Yitzhak Sternberg cites Sivan, Halamish and Efrat as similarly describing 1967 as a turning point in which Zionism became involved in colonial efforts.

Shafir and Morris both further distinguish between Zionist colonialism during the First Aliyah and following the arrival of the Second Aliyah. Shafir describes the First Aliyah as following the ethnic plantation colony model, exploiting low wage Palestinian workers. Morris describes this relationship:

These Jews were not colonists in the usual sense of sons or agents of an imperial mother country, projecting its power beyond the seas and exploiting Third World natural resources. But the settlements of the First Aliyah were still colonial, with white Europeans living amid and employing a mass of relatively impoverished natives.
=== Colonization and colonialism ===
Sternberg argues that it is important to clearly distinguish between colonization and colonialism as concepts. For Shafir and Peled, &quot;colonization, namely territorial dispossession and the settlement of immigrant populations&quot;, cannot happen without colonialism and &quot;the means of violence of a colonial metropole&quot;. In contrast, Sternberg considers classical definitions of colonization as broad enough to include cases that did not require the dispossession of the native population.

Tuvia Friling depicts the Zionist movement as operating differently from colonial movements in terms of land acquisition. Specifically, the Zionist movement acquired land in the early years by purchasing it. Sternberg in contrast explains that it was not unique for colonial movements to purchase land as part of land acquisition, pointing to similarities in North American colonialism. Friling argues that in contrast to European colonial projects, the early Zionist leadership was dominated by the labor movement with a socialist ethos. Shafir points to ideological drives in American and Rhodesian settler colonies that developed in service of the colonial project. Similarly, Shafir says, the Zionist labor movement used socialist ideals largely in service of the national movement.

In response to the argument that Zionism could not be a colonial project, but should instead be described as a project of immigration, Shafir quotes Lorenzo Veracini&#x27;s statement that settlers sometimes hide &quot;behind the persecuted, the migrant, even the refugee... behind his labor and hardship.&quot; Shafir goes on to characterize Zionism as not unique, in the sense that &quot;[t]he ruthless ethnic cleanser is commonly hidden behind the peaceful settler who arrived in an &#x27;empty land&#x27; to start a new life.&quot;

Alan Dowty describes the debate over the relationship between Zionism and colonialism as essentially a discussion of &quot;semantics&quot;. He defines colonialism as the imposition of control by a &quot;mother country&quot; on another people, for economic gain or for the spreading of culture or religion. Dowty argues that Zionism does not fit this definition on the basis that &quot;there was... no mother country&quot; and that Zionism did not consider the local population in its plans. Efraim Karsh adopts a similar definition and similarly concludes that Zionism is not colonialism. Dowty elaborates that Zionism did not control the local population since it ultimately failed to remove the native people from Palestine. In his assessment of whether Zionism is colonialism, Penslar works with a broader definition of colonialism than Dowty, which allows for the country sponsoring the colonial enterprise to be different from the country of origin of the settlers.

=== Zionism as settler colonialism ===

Beyond characterizing it as a colonial movement, Zionism has been more recently described as a form of settler colonialism, with scholarly proponents of this paradigm including Edward Said, Rashid Khalidi, Noam Chomsky, Ilan Pappe, Fayez Sayegh, Maxime Rodinson, , Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, Baha Abu-Laban, , and Rosemary Sayigh.

The settler colonial framework on the conflict emerged in the 1960s during the decolonization of Africa and the Middle East, and re-emerged in Israeli academia in the 1990s led by Israeli and Palestinian scholars, who challenged some of Israel&#x27;s foundational myths. It built on the work of Patrick Wolfe, an influential theorist of settler colonial studies who has defined settler colonialism as an ongoing &quot;structure, not an event&quot; aimed at replacing a native population rather than exploiting it.

<doc id="34485" wikidata="Q148163" url="?curid=34485" title="Zarzuela">
<text> () is a Spanish lyric-dramatic genre that alternates between spoken and sung scenes, the latter incorporating operatic and popular songs, as well as dance. The etymology of the name is uncertain, but some propose it may derive from the name of a royal hunting lodge, the Palace of Zarzuela, near Madrid, where that type of entertainment was allegedly first presented to the court. The palace in turn was named after the brambles () that grew there.

There are two main forms of &quot;zarzuela&quot;: Baroque &quot;zarzuela&quot; (c. 1630–1750), the earliest style, and Romantic &quot;zarzuela&quot; (c. 1850–1950). Romantic zarzuelas can be further divided into two main subgenres, &quot;género grande&quot; and &quot;género chico&quot;, although other sub-divisions exist.

&quot;Zarzuela&quot; spread to the Spanish dominions, and many Spanish-speaking countries – notably Cuba – developed their own traditions. &quot;Zarzuela&quot; is also a strong tradition in the Philippines, where it is also referred to in certain languages as . Other regional and linguistic variants in Spain include the Basque &quot;&quot; and the Catalan .

A masque-like musical theatre had existed in Spain since the time of Juan del Encina. The &quot;zarzuela&quot; genre was innovative in giving a dramatic function to the musical numbers, which were integrated into the plot of the work. Dances and choruses were incorporated as well as solo and ensemble numbers, all to orchestral accompaniment.

In 1657 at the Royal Palace of &quot;El Prado&quot;, King Philip IV of Spain, Queen Mariana and their court attended the first performance of a new comedy by Pedro Calderón de la Barca, with music by Juan Hidalgo de Polanco titled &quot;El Laurel de Apolo&quot; (The Laurels of Apollo). &quot;El Laurel de Apolo&quot; traditionally symbolises the birth of a new musical genre that had become known as &quot;La Zarzuela&quot;.

Like Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s earlier &quot;El golfo de las sirenas&quot; (&quot;The Sirens&#x27; Gulf&quot;, 1657), &quot;El Laurel de Apolo&quot; mixed mythological verse drama with operatic solos, popular songs and dances. The characters in these early, baroque &quot;zarzuelas&quot; were a mixture of gods, mythological creatures and rustic or pastoral comedy characters; Antonio de Literes&#x27;s popular &quot;Acis y Galatea&quot; (1708) is yet another example. Unlike some other operatic forms, there were spoken interludes, often in verse.

==Italian influence==
In 18th-century Bourbon Spain, Italian artistic style dominated in the arts, including Italian opera. &quot;Zarzuela&quot;, though still written to Spanish texts, changed to accommodate the Italian vogue. During the reign of King Charles III, political problems provoked a series of revolts against his Italian ministers; these were echoed in theatrical presentations. The older style &quot;zarzuela&quot; fell out of fashion, but popular Spanish tradition continued to manifest itself in shorter works, such as the single-scene &quot;tonadilla&quot; (or &quot;intermezzo&quot;) of which the finest literary exponent was Ramón de la Cruz. Musicians such as Antonio Rodríguez de Hita were proficient in the shorter style of works, though he also wrote a full-scale &quot;zarzuela&quot; with de la Cruz entitled &quot;Las segadoras de Vallecas&quot; (&quot;The Reapers of Vallecas&quot;, 1768). José Castel was one of several composers to write for the Teatro del Príncipe.

==19th century==
In the 1850s and 1860s a group of patriotic writers and composers led by Francisco Barbieri and Joaquín Gaztambide revived the &quot;zarzuela&quot; form, seeing in it a possible release from French and Italian music hegemony. The elements of the work continue to be the same: sung solos and choruses, spiced with spoken scenes, and comedic songs, ensembles and dances. Costume dramas and regional variations abound, and the librettos (though often based on French originals) are rich in Spanish idioms and popular jargon.

The &quot;zarzuelas&quot; of the day included in their librettos various regionalisms and popular slang, such as that of Madrid &quot;castizos&quot;. Often, the success of a work was due to one or more songs that the public came to know and love. Despite some modifications the basic structure of the &quot;zarzuela&quot; remained the same: dialogue scenes, songs, choruses, and comic scenes generally performed by two actor-singers. The culminating masterpieces from this period were Barbieri&#x27;s &quot;Pan y toros&quot; and Gaztambide&#x27;s &quot;El juramento&quot;. Another notable composer from this period was Emilio Arrieta.

==Romantic &quot;zarzuela&quot;==
After the Glorious Revolution of 1868, the country entered a deep crisis (especially economically), which was reflected in theatre. The public could not afford high-priced theatre tickets for grandiose productions, which led to the rise of the Teatros Variedades (&quot;variety theatres&quot;) in Madrid, with cheap tickets for one-act plays (sainetes). This &quot;theatre of an hour&quot; had great success and &quot;zarzuela&quot; composers took to the new formula with alacrity. Single-act &quot;zarzuelas&quot; were classified as &quot;género chico&quot; (&quot;little genre&quot;) whilst the longer &quot;zarzuelas&quot; of three acts, lasting up to four hours, were called &quot;género grande&quot; (&quot;grand genre&quot;). &quot;Zarzuela grande&quot; battled on at the Teatro de la Zarzuela de Madrid, founded by Barbieri and his friends in the 1850s. A newer theatre, the Apolo, opened in 1873. At first it attempted to present the &quot;género grande&quot;, but it soon yielded to the taste and economics of the time, and became the &quot;temple&quot; of the more populist &quot;género chico&quot; in the late 1870s.

Musical content from this era ranges from full-scale operatic arias (&quot;romanzas&quot;) through to popular songs, and dialogue from high poetic drama to lowlife comedy characters. There are also many types of &quot;zarzuela&quot; in between the two named genres, with a variety of musical and dramatic flavours.

Many of the greatest &quot;zarzuelas&quot; were written in the 1880s and 1890s. &#x27;s zarzuela &quot;La Gran Vía&quot; (1886) is considered a masterpiece of the género chico genre of Spanish plays. The form continued to adapt to new theatrical stimuli until well into the 20th century. With the onset of the Spanish Civil War, the form rapidly declined, and the last romantic &quot;zarzuelas&quot; to hold the stage were written in the 1950s.

Whilst Barbieri produced the influential &quot;zarzuela grande&quot; &quot;El barberillo de Lavapiés&quot;, the classic exponent of the &quot;género chico&quot; was his pupil Federico Chueca, whose &quot;La gran vía&quot; (composed with Joaquín Valverde Durán) was a cult success both in Spain and throughout Europe.

The musical heir of Chueca was José Serrano, whose short, one act &quot;género chico&quot; &quot;zarzuelas&quot; - notably &quot;La canción del olvido&quot;, &quot;Alma de dios&quot; and the much later &quot;Los claveles&quot; and &quot;La dolorosa&quot; - form a stylistic bridge to the more musically sophisticated &quot;zarzuelas&quot; of the 20th century.

Just as romantic &quot;zarzuela&quot; featured popular customs, festivals, and manners of speech, especially those of the poor areas of Madrid, many feature strong social criticism and reflect political polemics of the day.

==20th century==

From about 1900, the term (&quot;degraded&quot; or &quot;low genre&quot;) was coined to describe an emerging form of entertainment allied to the (revue) type of musical comedy: these were musical works similar to the zarzuela but lighter and bolder in their social criticism, with scenes portraying sexual themes and many verbal double entendres. One popular work from the &quot;género ínfimo&quot; years is &quot;La corte de Faraón&quot; (1910), by Vicente Lleó, which was based on the French operetta &quot;Madame Putiphar&quot;.

In the second decade of the century, the influences of Viennese operetta and the English followers of Sullivan such as Lionel Monckton made themselves felt, in works such as &quot;Molinos de viento&quot; and &quot;El asombro de Damasco&quot; (both by Pablo Luna), before the Spanish tradition of great acts was reasserted in Amadeu Vives&#x27;s &quot;Doña Francisquita&quot; (1923). The zarzuela continued to flourish in the 1930s, thanks to composers of the stature of Pablo Sorozábal – who reinvigorated it as a vehicle for socio-political comment – Federico Moreno Torroba, and Francisco Alonso.

However, the Spanish Civil War brought a decline of the genre, and after the Second World War, its extinction as a live genre was almost total. There were no new authors and the compositions are not renovated. There have been no significant new works created since the 1950s; the existing zarzuela repertoire is costly to produce, and many classics have been performed only sporadically in recent years, at least professionally.

The genre has again found favour in Spain and elsewhere: younger people, in particular, have been drawn to its lyrical music and theatrical spectacle in the 1940s and 1950s. Spanish radio and television have dedicated time to zarzuela in 1978, not least in a popular series of programs produced by TVE and entitled &quot;Antología de la zarzuela&quot; (&quot;Zarzuela Anthology&quot;). These were based on lip syncs of the classic recordings of the 1940s and 1950s. Some years earlier, impresario José Tamayo worked a theatrical show of the same name which popularized pieces of zarzuela through several national and international tours.

==&quot;Zarzuela&quot; in Catalonia==
While the &quot;zarzuela&quot; tradition flourished in Madrid and other Spanish cities, Catalonia developed its own &quot;zarzuela&quot;, with librettos in Catalan. The atmosphere, the plots, and the music were quite different from the model that triumphed in Madrid, as the Catalan &quot;zarzuela&quot; was looking to attract a different public, the bourgeois classes. Catalan &quot;zarzuela&quot; was turned little by little into what is called, in Catalan, &quot;teatre líric català&quot; (&quot;Catalan lyric theater&quot;), with a personality of its own, and with &quot;modernista&quot; lyricists and composers such as Enric Granados or Enric Morera.

In the final years of the 19th century, as &quot;modernisme&quot; emerged, one of the notable &quot;modernistas&quot;, and one of Felip Pedrell&#x27;s pupils, Amadeu Vives came onto the Barcelona scene. He contributed to the creation of the Orfeó Català in 1891, along with Lluís Millet. In spite of a success sustained over many years, his musical ambition took him to Madrid, where &quot;zarzuela&quot; had a higher profile. Vives became one of the most important &quot;zarzuela&quot; composers, with such masterpieces as &quot;Doña Francisquita&quot;.

==&quot;Zarzuela&quot; in Cuba and Mexico==
In Cuba the afrocubanismo &quot;zarzuelas&quot; of Ernesto Lecuona (&quot;María la O&quot;; &quot;El cafetal&quot;), Eliseo Grenet (&quot;La virgen morena&quot;) and Gonzalo Roig (&quot;Cecilia Valdés&quot;, based on Cirilo Villaverde&#x27;s classic novel) represent a brief golden age of political and cultural importance. These and other works centred on the plight of the mulata woman and other black underclasses in Cuban society. The outstanding star of many of these productions was Rita Montaner.

Mexico likewise had its own &quot;zarzuela&quot; traditions. One example is Carlo Curti&#x27;s &quot;La cuarta plana&quot;, starring Esperanza Iris.

==&quot;Zarzuela&quot; in the Philippines==
In the Philippines, the &quot;Zarzuela Musical Theatre&quot; has been widely adapted by Filipinos in their native cultures, notably in urban areas. The theatre was only introduced by the Spanish in 1878, despite being part of the Spanish Empire since the middle of the 16th century. During this time, the plays were performed only by Spanish people. By 1880, majority of the performers and writers were Filipinos, notably Philippine national hero, José Rizal, who was fond of the play. Afterwards, local languages, instead of Spanish, were used to perform the complex theatre, with additions from multiple cultures throughout the archipelago. 

When the Philippines was colonized by the Americans in the early 20th century, the humor from the &quot;moro-moro play&quot; was added into the Philippine zarzuela, while moving away from the traditional Spanish zarzuela. The theatre afterwards was used by Filipinos to express freedom from discrimination and colonial rule, depicting the Filipino people triumphant against the Spanish and Americans by the end of each play. The revolutionary overtones of the play prompted the American colonialists to arrest various performers and writers of the Philippine zarzuela, to the extent of forcefully shutting down entire zarzuela companies in the Philippines. In the 1920s, due to the introduction of the cinema, the zarzuela became widely popular in the rural areas, disabling the Americans from stopping the plays from spreading. The Philippine zarzuela evolved into a kind of comedy of manners distinct to the Filipino taste. In 2011, the performing art was cited by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the performing arts category that the government may nominate in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. In 2012, through a partnership with UNESCO, the Philippine government established the documents needed for the safeguarding of the Philippine zarzuela. UNESCO has cited the Philippine zarzuela as the national theatre and opera of the Philippines.

==Recorded &quot;zarzuela&quot;==
From 1950 onwards, &quot;zarzuela&quot; prospered in a series of LP recordings from EMI, Hispavox and others, with worldwide distribution. A series produced by the Alhambra company of Madrid, the majority conducted by the leading Spanish conductor Ataulfo Argenta had particular success. Many featured singers soon to become world-famous, such as Teresa Berganza, Alfredo Kraus and Pilar Lorengar; and later, Montserrat Caballé and Plácido Domingo. Less known performers such as Ana María Iriarte, Inés Ribadeneira, Toñy Rosado, Carlos Munguía, Renato Cesari, and others frequently lent their voices to the recordings. The choirs of Orfeón Donostiarra and Singers&#x27; Choir of Madrid also contributed, rounding out the overall quality of the works. After Argenta&#x27;s death others such as Indalecio Cisneros and Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos continued in his footsteps. There were also recordings made conducted by the composers themselves, such as Pablo Sorozábal and Federico Moreno Torroba. Many well-known singers, including Victoria de los Ángeles, Montserrat Caballé, Juan Diego Flórez, and Lisette Oropesa have recorded albums of zarzuela songs and arias.

Many zarzuela productions are now to be seen on DVD and Blu-ray disc. In March 2009, EuroArts released &quot;Amor, Vida de Mi Vida&quot;, a recording on Blu-ray disc of an August 2007 zarzuela concert by Plácido Domingo and Ana María Martínez, with the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg conducted by Jesús López-Cobos. In April 2009, BBC/Opus Arte released a Blu-ray disc of a July 2006 performance of Federico Moreno Torroba&#x27;s &quot;Luisa Fernanda&quot; with Plácido Domingo and Nancy Herrera, recorded at the Teatro Real de Madrid with Jesús López-Cobos conducting.

In the United States, the Jarvis Conservatory of Napa, California, between 1996 and 2005, mounted several full zarzuela productions, subsequently issued on DVD and online. The series includes &quot;La dolorosa&quot;; &quot;La Gran Via&quot;; &quot;Luisa Fernanda&quot;; &quot;La verbena de la Paloma&quot;; &quot;La Rosa del Azafrán&quot;; &quot;La revoltosa&quot;; &quot;Agua, Azucarillos y Aguardiente&quot;; &quot;Doña Francisquita&quot;; &quot;Gigantes y Cabezudos&quot;; &quot;La alegría de la huerta&quot;; &quot;La chulapona&quot;; &quot;Luis Alonso&quot; (Giménez, 1896); and &quot;El barberillo de Lavapiés&quot;.

<doc id="34487" wikidata="Q1974823" url="?curid=34487" title="Zoop">
<text>Zoop is a puzzle video game originally developed by Hookstone and published by Viacom New Media in 1995 for the Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, MS-DOS, Macintosh, PlayStation, Game Gear, and Game Boy, then in 1996 for the Saturn and Jaguar. &quot;Zoop&quot; has similarities to Taito&#x27;s 1989 arcade video game &quot;Plotting&quot; (also known as &quot;Flipull&quot;), but &quot;Zoop&quot; runs in real-time instead. Players are tasked with eliminating pieces that spawn from one of the sides of the screen before they reach the center of the playfield. By pointing at a piece and shooting it, the player can either swap it with the current player color and thus arrange the same color pieces in a row or column, or match the color.

A month before release, &quot;Zoop&quot; was one of four games played in the preliminary rounds of the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II competition, a rare instance of an as-yet-unreleased game being used in a video game competition.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Zoop&quot; is a real-time puzzle game, like &quot;Plotting&quot;, where the player controls a triangle in the center of the screen. Every second (or more often in advanced levels), a piece comes in from the side and possibly pushes other pieces forward. Two consecutive pieces will never come in from the same quadrant, and runs of consecutive identical pieces on one row are longer, statistically, than one might expect. If a piece falls into the center square, the game is over.

If the player shoots a piece of the same color as their triangle, it will be &quot;zooped&quot; (cleared) and points are earned. If the piece behind the target piece is also of the same color, it is also &quot;zooped&quot;. The same goes for the next piece, and so on. If a piece of a different color from the player&#x27;s current piece is shot, the player&#x27;s piece will switch colors with it. This is also what happens when a piece of a different color is encountered after zooping one or more pieces of the same color. When the quota of &quot;zooped&quot; pieces is met, the game speeds up, and (before level 10) the background changes. Various special pieces do different things, such as a proximity bomb (shaped like a lightning bolt) that blows up pieces in a 3×3 area centered at the target piece, or a line bomb (often shaped like a gear) that clears a whole target line of pieces.

To make gameplay more difficult, the game also employed what was referred to as &quot;Opti-Challenge&quot; backgrounds. As the levels progressed, the backgrounds would become increasingly distracting. Early on, this would involve the use of contrasting colors and increasingly intricate color schemes. Background patterns would also become more intricate and would make subtle use of asymmetrical elements. Although the &quot;Opti-Challenge&quot; technique of the game was used as a selling point, very little information exists about the technique itself, and no other game on the market has ever claimed to use &quot;Opti-Challenge&quot; graphics. The sound effects have a cartoonish tone to match the vivid colors used through the stages, while the music is smooth jazz and &quot;evolves&quot; with the game. As the levels get harder, the music becomes more tense, adding to the fast-paced atmosphere of the game.

== Development and release ==
Along with &quot;Dracula Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Zoop&quot; is one of the few original properties that were released by Viacom New Media, who only published games that are based on existing intellectual properties (including Viacom Media Networks&#x27; programming) until their closure in 1997. The title was extensively marketed by Viacom, who wanted the game to replicate the level of success of &quot;Tetris&quot;, which can be evidenced by its release on many platforms, as well as the game&#x27;s slogan, &quot;America&#x27;s Largest Killer of Time!&quot;.

The team at Hookstone stated in an interview with Spanish magazine &quot;PC Manía&quot; that &quot;Zoop&quot; spent several years in development and that the concept proved to be difficult to explain to their producers and as such, the team presented a nearly-finished build. The PC was chosen as the lead platform, despite the development team never having done anything for the PC before. According to Aaron Fothergill, one of the programmers for the Atari Jaguar version of &quot;Zoop&quot;, Electric Spectacle Productions wanted the Jaguar version to have more advanced visuals than the PlayStation version, but Viacom requested the developer to disable the extra graphics to make the PlayStation version more appealing than the Jaguar version. As of 2018, the rights to &quot;Zoop&quot; are held by Viacom International.

Before it was officially released to the general public, the game was featured and played during the preliminary rounds on the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II competition. Shortly after its release, the Super NES version was offered as part of a limited &quot;rent one, get one free&quot; promotion by Blockbuster.

==Ports==
The Genesis and Super NES versions of &quot;Zoop&quot; are identical in terms of gameplay, aside from graphical and audio differences between the two. The MS-DOS version of the game has support for various sound cards, and it uses wavetable-like MIDI music. The PlayStation version was released a month after the system was launched and has more advanced visuals. The Game Boy port is the only version across all platforms that features a multiplayer mode. It also received a port to the Atari Jaguar that was developed by Electric Spectacle Productions and published by Atari Corporation on 5 January 1996, with graphics that are more in line with the previously released versions but sporting a more jazz-style soundtrack. It was one of the last releases for the Jaguar. &quot;Zoop&quot; was also released for the Sega Saturn in Japan only by Media Quest on 29 November 1996. The Saturn version uses the same enhanced visuals as the PlayStation port.

== Reception ==
The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; criticized the Game Gear version as having poor audio even by Game Gear standards but otherwise were divided about the game. One of them said &quot;it is more like work than anything else, and it certainly isn&#x27;t addictive&quot;, two of them said it lacks anything special but is still addictive and enjoyable for players of all skill levels, and the fourth called it &quot;a must-try&quot;.

Reviewing the SNES version, a critic for &quot;Next Generation&quot; found the gameplay to be too complicated, concluding that &quot;it&#x27;s not bad really, but the idea isn&#x27;t that intuitive, and once you get past the learning curve it lacks the addictive quality this kind of game needs.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot;″s The Axe Grinder similarly said that, while the game is fun and has good graphics and music, it lacks the addictive pull that an action puzzler needs to distinguish itself.

&quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; (previously &quot;Sega Magazine&quot;) gave the Genesis/Mega Drive version a 62%, saying the game &quot;has the curious compulsiveness of &quot;Tetris&quot; to a degree&quot;, but that it is overshadowed by more complex and graphically impressive games then on the market. Cover Girl of &quot;GamePro&quot; was pleased with the music and graphics, particularly the use of eye-tricking background contrasts in the later levels. She found the level select and five difficulty modes broaden the accessibility, but criticized that the game sends the player back to the beginning whenever they lose. She concluded that while falling short of classics like &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;Zoop&quot; is an enjoyable enough puzzler to merit a buy.

Reviewing the Jaguar version, &quot;GamePro&quot; noted that it made no changes from previous versions of the game. They said of the game itself: &quot;A classic? No. Addictive? Yes.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; similarly stated that &quot;while &quot;Zoop&quot; is an enjoyable game, it&#x27;s not exactly the second puzzling. ... Games like &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Bust-a-Move&quot; have undeniable magic, and while &quot;Zoop&quot; has the mechanics of a great puzzle game, it lacks that magic.&quot; They praised the pace of the action, in that the game demands the player&#x27;s full attention from the beginning.

&quot;GamePro&quot;″s brief review of the PlayStation version called it &quot;an uncomplicated puzzle game that&#x27;s only slightly hampered by squirrelly controls&quot; and &quot;a great addiction for puzzle fans.&quot; A brief review from &quot;Next Generation&quot; commented, &quot;Action puzzle games should be simple but addicting; &quot;Zoop&quot; is complicated but kind of compulsive.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; rated the PlayStation version of the game a 5/10, stating, &quot;&quot;Zoop&quot; has all the makings of a good puzzle game, it just doesn&#x27;t deliver the goods.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the DOS version an A− and said it wasn&#x27;t as addictive but was as much fun as &quot;Tetris&quot;.

The game was awarded &quot;Best Puzzle Game&quot; in the 1995 &quot;Nintendo Power Awards&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The game was featured in 1995 in series 5 episode 4 of the British TV series &quot;GamesMaster&quot;.

In September 2003, the trademark renewal for &quot;Zoop&quot; was cancelled.

<text>Zhang Xueliang (; June 3, 1901 – October 15, 2001) was a Chinese general who in 1928 succeeded his father Zhang Zuolin as the commander of the Northeastern Army. He is best known for his role in the Xi&#x27;an Incident in 1936, in which he arrested Chiang Kai-shek and forced him to form a Second United Front with the Chinese Communist Party against the Japanese. 

In 1928, Zhang, at the time a general in the Northeastern Army, became the commander of the army and leader of the Fengtian clique upon his father&#x27;s assassination. A reformer sympathetic to nationalist ideas, he completed the official reunification of China by pledging loyalty to the Nationalist government, and used his powerful base to wield significant influence in the politics of the Nanjing decade. Zhang followed Chiang&#x27;s policy of nonresistance to the Japanese invasions of Manchuria in 1931 and Rehe in 1933, after which he was forced to resign as head of the Northeastern Army. In 1935, Zhang was again appointed its commander to suppress the Communists, but became disillusioned with Chiang&#x27;s policy of &quot;stabilizing China before resisting Japan&quot;, and helped to plan the Xi&#x27;an Incident. Following the incident, Chiang had Zhang arrested for insubordination and sentenced to house arrest, first in mainland China and then in Taiwan. Zhang would remain under confinement until 1988, a period of more than 50 years. He died of pneumonia in 2001, at the age of 100.

==Early life==
Zhang Xueliang was born in Haicheng, Liaoning province on June 3, 1901. Zhang was educated by private tutors and, unlike his father, the warlord Zhang Zuolin, he felt at ease in the company of westerners. 

Zhang graduated from Fengtian Military Academy, was made a colonel in the Fengtian Army, and appointed the commander of his father&#x27;s bodyguards in 1919. In 1921 he was sent to Japan to observe military maneuvers, where he developed a special interest in aircraft. Later, he developed an air corps for the Fengtian Army, which was widely used in the battles that took place within the Great Wall during the 1920s. In 1922, he was promoted to major general and commanded an army-sized force. Two years later, he was also made commander of the air units. Upon the death of his father in 1928, he succeeded him as the leader of the Northeast Peace Preservation Forces (popularly &quot;Northeastern Army&quot;), which controlled China&#x27;s northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Fengtian, and Jilin. In December of the same year he proclaimed his allegiance to the Kuomintang (KMT; Chinese Nationalist Party).

==Leader of Manchuria==
The Japanese believed that Zhang Xueliang, who was known as a womanizer and an opium addict, would be much more subject to Japanese influence than was his father. On this premise, an officer of the Japanese Kwantung Army therefore killed his father, Zhang Zuolin, by exploding a bomb above his train while it crossed under a railroad bridge. Surprisingly, the younger Zhang proved to be more independent and skilled than anyone had expected and declared his support for Chiang Kai-shek, leading to the reunification of China in 1928. With the assistance of Australian journalist William Henry Donald and Dr. Harry Willis Miller, he overcame his opium addiction in 1933 with the administering of Cantharidin auto-serum therapy.

He was given the nickname &quot;Hero of History&quot; () by PRC historians because of his desire to reunite China and rid it of Japanese invaders; and was willing to pay the price and become &quot;vice&quot; leader of China (not because it was good that he was supporting the Kuomintang). In order to rid his command of Japanese influence, he had two prominent pro-Tokyo officials executed in front of the assembled guests at a dinner party in January 1929. It was a hard decision for him to make. The two had powers over the heads of others. In May 1929, relations between the Kuomintang Nanjing and the excessively strengthened Feng Yuxiang worsened. In addition, the Japanese government, dissatisfied with the pro-Kuomintang policy of Zhang Zuolin, and now his son, threatened to &quot;take the most decisive measures to ensure that the Kuomintang flag never flies over Manchuria&quot;. The &quot;Young Marshal&quot; supported Nanjing, and Feng&#x27;s troops were pushed back to the outlying provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, and in July 1929, Japan officially recognized Kuomintang China. At the same time, Zhang Xueliang and Chiang Kai-shek held a personal meeting in Beiping, at which a decision was made on the armed seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway or CER. By pushing Zhang Xueliang to take this step, Chiang Kai-shek sought to make the Young Marshal completely dependent on Nanjing and at the same time raise his prestige and get most of the profits from the operation of the CER at the disposal of Nanjing. Zhang Xueliang, in turn, believed that the capture of the CER would strengthen his position in the Northeast, allow him to personally manage the profits of the CER, and ensure his independence from Nanjing. As a result, on July 10, 1929, the Conflict on the CER began. However, the Red Army showed a higher combat capability, and the conflict ended with the signing of the Khabarovsk Protocol of December 22, 1929.


In 1930, when warlords Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan attempted to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Kuomintang government, Zhang stepped in to support the Nanjing-based government against the Northern warlords in exchange for control of the key railroads in Hebei and the customs revenues from the port city of Tianjin. A year later, in the September 18 Mukden Incident, Japanese troops attacked Zhang&#x27;s forces in Shenyang in order to provoke a full-on war with China, which Chiang did not want to face until his forces were stronger. In accordance with this strategy, Zhang&#x27;s armies withdrew from the front lines without significant engagements, leading to the effective Japanese occupation of Zhang&#x27;s former northeastern domain. There has been speculation that Chiang Kai-Shek wrote a letter to Zhang asking him to pull his forces back, but Zhang later stated that he himself issued the orders. Apparently, Zhang was aware of how weak his forces were compared to the Japanese and wished to preserve his position by retaining a sizeable army. Nonetheless, this would still be in line with Chiang&#x27;s overall strategic standings.

==Early 1930s==

After retreating from Manchuria, Zhang and the Northeastern Army took up defensive positions along the Great Wall in Rehe. During this time, Zhang sponsored China&#x27;s first participation in the Olympic Games.

The Japanese attacked Zhang again in 1933, and after a weak resistance, Zhang was denied reinforcements from the central government and had to retreat further south. He resigned his posts, underwent treatment for his opium addiction, and left for a year-long exile in Europe. When Zhang returned in January 1934, he sought to regain his position in charge of the Northeastern Army. However, this was strongly opposed by both the Japanese and some Nationalist leaders critical of his failure to stop the Japanese advance. Chiang therefore reassigned him to an anti-Communist force in Wuhan, alienating Zhang and the other leaders of the Northeastern Army. Over the next year, Zhang became a more outspoken critic of Chiang&#x27;s policy of appeasement towards Japan. He continued to pressure Chiang to reappoint him as head of the Northeastern Army, with the hope that he could use the force to fight the Japanese. On October 2, 1935, Chiang granted to Zhang&#x27;s request, but only because he needed the Northeastern Army&#x27;s support to crush the final Communist base at Yan&#x27;an.

==Xi&#x27;an incident==

On April 6, 1936, Zhang met with CPC delegate Zhou Enlai to plan the end of the Chinese Civil War. KMT leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at the time took a passive position against Japan and considered the communists to be a greater danger to the Republic of China than the Japanese, and his overall strategy was to annihilate the communists before focusing his efforts on the Japanese. He believed that &quot;communism was a cancer while the Japanese represented a superficial wound.&quot; Growing nationalist anger against Japan made this position very unpopular, and led to Zhang&#x27;s action against Chiang, known as the Xi&#x27;an Incident.

In December 1936, Zhang and General Yang Hucheng kidnapped Chiang, imprisoning him until he agreed to form a united front with the communists against the Japanese invasion. After two weeks of negotiations, Chiang agreed to unite with the communists and drive the Japanese out of China. 

After Chiang negotiated with the Communists, Zhang flew back to Nanjing as a demonstration of good faith.

== Life under house arrest ==

===Trial===
As soon as Zhang landed in Nanjing, Chiang had him placed under arrest by military police. Zhang wrote Chiang an obsequious letter of apology. Although he never disavowed his role in the Xi&#x27;an incident, he admitted that what he had done was a crime, and asked to be punished. He intended the letter to be a private assurance of loyalty to Chiang, but the latter had the letter published so as to discredit Zhang. Li Liejun then presided over a show trial which convicted Zhang of abducting the Generalissimo and attempting to change government policy, sentencing him to ten years in prison. Chiang had him pardoned just a few days later, on January 4, 1937, but with the stipulation that he not be given his civil rights back and that he would remain under protective detention.

===Mainland China===
During the first few years of Zhang&#x27;s imprisonment, he was regularly moved from location to location under the close supervision of Chiang Kai-shek. He was soon joined by his first wife, Yu Fengzhi. The couple began living with the family of one of his wardens, Liu Yiguang. Zhang was allowed access to his bank account, but was (according to custom) expected to pay for most of the expenses related to his detention. In 1940 Yu Fengzhi became sick with breast cancer and was granted permission to seek treatment in the United States. Although they remained affectionate in their letters to one another, the couple would never see each other again. In 1964, Yu agreed to divorce Zhang so that he could marry Zhao.

===Taiwan===
Zhang was eventually taken to Taiwan, where he remained under house arrest until Chiang&#x27;s 1975 death. Much of his time was spent studying Ming dynasty literature and the Manchu language and collecting Chinese fan paintings, calligraphy, and other works of art by illustrious artists (a collection of more than 200 works using his studio&#x27;s name &quot;Dingyuanzhai&quot; () was auctioned with tremendous success by Sotheby&#x27;s on April 10, 1994). 

Zhang studied the New Testament. In 1964, he formally married Edith Chao, daughter of a senior official, who left her family in her teens to become his companion and later followed him into exile. His first wife, Yu, said she was so moved by Ms. Chao&#x27;s devotion that she released her husband from his vows. Zhang and his wife, Edith, became devout Christians who also regularly attended Sunday services at the Methodist chapel in Shilin, a Taipei suburb, with Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s family. On March 26, 1988, two months after the death of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s son Chiang Ching-kuo, his freedom was officially restored.

==Later life and death==

In 1991, Zhang made his first trip abroad after being released from house arrest, visiting San Francisco to see friends and family who had moved there. Zhang emigrated to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1995. There he lived with his younger brother Chang Hsueh-sen, who was working as a hotelier. 

Although never personally a communist, Zhang is regarded by the Chinese Communist Party and the People&#x27;s Republic of China as a patriotic hero for his role in ending the encirclement campaigns and beginning the war of resistance against Japan. There were numerous pleas for him to visit mainland China, but Zhang declined, citing his political closeness to the KMT and his frail health. However, he was named as the honorary President of Northeastern University in 1993, where he served as President between 1928 and 1937. Zhang was also named as the honorary chairman of Harbin Institute of Technology in 1993.

In June 2000, Edith Chao died at the age of 88. On October 14 of the following year, Zhang died of pneumonia at the age of 100. at Straub Hospital in Honolulu. Representatives from both China and Taiwan attended his funeral in Honolulu, along with Yan Mingfu, the former head of China&#x27;s United Front Work Department and the son of Zhang&#x27;s close friend, .

<text>Zephaniah (, ; – &quot;Sōfənīəs&quot;) is the name of several people in the Hebrew Bible; the most prominent being the prophet who prophesied in the days of Josiah, king of Judah (640–609 BCE) and is attributed a book bearing his name among the Twelve Minor Prophets. His name is commonly transliterated Sophonias in Bibles translated from the Vulgate or Septuagint. The name might mean &quot;Yahweh has hidden/protected,&quot; or &quot;Yah lies in wait&quot;. The church father Jerome interpreted the name to mean &quot;the watchman of the Lord&quot;.

Scholars propose various dates of composition; Zephaniah 2’s oracles may have a seventh century BCE date with the book possibly growing out from that core, while the number of intertextual references suggests an exilic or later composition and editing.

==The prophet Zephaniah==

The best known Biblical figure bearing the name Zephaniah is the son of Cushi, and great-great grandson of King Hezekiah, ninth in the literary order of the Twelve Minor Prophets. He prophesied in the days of Josiah, ruler of the Kingdom of Judah (640–609 BCE), but before Josiah&#x27;s reform in 621 BCE, and was contemporary with Jeremiah, with whom he had much in common. The unique source containing the minimal knowledge of his personality and rhetorical and literary qualities is the short, three chapter book of the Old Testament which bears his name. The scene of his activity was the city of Jerusalem, which he seems to know well. The existence of two Zephaniahs linked to the book is considered purely hypothetical.

===Date of activity===
Under the two preceding kings of Judah, Amon of Judah and Manasseh of Judah, the cult of other deities, especially Baal and Astarte, had developed in Jerusalem, bringing with it elements of alien culture and morals. Josiah, a dedicated reformer, wished to put an end to perceived misuse of the holy places. One of the most zealous champions and advisers of this reform was Zephaniah, and his writing remains one of the most important documents for the understanding of the era of Josiah.

Boldly predicting the destruction of Judah for the evil committed by its occupants, the prophet spoke against the religious and moral corruption, when, in view of the idolatry which had penetrated even into the sanctuary, he warned that God would &quot;destroy out of this place the remnant of Baal, and the names of the idolatrous priests&quot; (Zeph 1:4), and pleaded for a return to the simplicity of their fathers instead of the luxurious foreign clothing which was worn especially in aristocratic circles (1:8).

The age of Zephaniah was also a key historical period, because the lands of Western Asia were overrun by foreigners due to the migration of the Scythians in the last decades of the seventh century BC, and because Jerusalem was only a few decades before its downfall in 586 BC. In light of these events, a message of impending judgment is the primary burden of this figure&#x27;s preaching (1:7).

===The Book of Zephaniah===

The Book of Zephaniah contains the fundamental ideas of the preaching of Zephaniah. The scheme of the book in its present form is as follows:

# Zephaniah 1:2–2:3. Warnings about the &quot;day of the Lord&quot;, a &quot;Dies irae, dies illa&quot; of the Old Testament. The judgment of the Lord will descend on Judah and Jerusalem as a punishment for the awful degeneracy in religious life (1:4–7a); it will extend to all classes of the people (1:7b–13), and will be attended with all the horrors of a frightful catastrophe (1:14–18); therefore, repent and seek the Lord (2:1–3).
# Zephaniah 2:4–15. Not only Jerusalem, but the entire world is subject to judgment, including the Philistines, (4–7) Moabites, Ammonites, (8–11) Ethiopians, (12) Assyrians and Ninevites (13-15).
# Zephaniah 3:1–8. The Prophet focuses once again on Jerusalem: &quot;Woe to the provoking, and redeemed city ... She hath not hearkened to the voice, neither hath she received discipline.&quot; The severest reckoning will be required of the leading classes of the civil community, and of the Prophets and priests as the directors of public worship.
# Zephaniah 3:9–20. With a prophetic glance at the Kingdom of God of the future, in which all the world unites and turns to God, the prosperity of the Messianic Kingdom will be enjoyed.
# Zephaniah 3:9–20. The last message of Zephaniah also has a Messianic coloring, although not to an extent comparable with that which may be found in the Book of Isaiah.

===In Christianity===

He is commemorated with the other minor prophets in the calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 31. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar and in the Roman Martyrology, he is commemorated on December 3.

His book is an inspiration for the hymn, &quot;Dies irae&quot;.

==Other Zephaniahs in the Bible==

Other individuals named Zephaniah include:
# The son of Maaseiah, the &quot;second priest&quot; in the reign of Zedekiah, often mentioned in Jeremiah as having been sent from the king to inquire (Jer. 21:1) regarding the coming woes which he had denounced, and to entreat the prophet&#x27;s intercession that the judgment threatened might be averted (Jer 29:25, 26, 29; 37:3; 52:24). He, along with some other captive Jews, was put to death by Nebuchadnezzar II &quot;at Riblah in the land of Hamath&quot; (2 Kings 25:21).
# A Kohathite ancestor of the prophet Samuel (1 Chr 6:36).
# The father of Josiah, the kohen (priest) who dwelt in Jerusalem when Darius I issued the decree that the temple should be rebuilt ... (Zech 6:10).

<doc id="34494" wikidata="Q7333" url="?curid=34494" title="Zheng He">
<text>Zheng He (also romanized Cheng Ho; 1371–1433/1435) was a Chinese admiral, explorer, diplomat, and bureaucrat during the early Ming dynasty (1368–1644). He is often regarded as the greatest admiral in Chinese history. Born into a Muslim family as Ma He, he later adopted the surname Zheng conferred onto him by the Yongle Emperor (). Between 1405 and 1433, Zheng commanded seven treasure voyages across Asia under the commission of the Yongle Emperor and the succeeding Xuande Emperor (). According to legend, Zheng&#x27;s largest ships were almost twice as long as any wooden ship ever recorded, and carried hundreds of sailors on four decks.

A favorite of the Yongle Emperor, whom Zheng assisted in the Jingnan campaign that overthrew the previous Jianwen Emperor in 1402, Zheng He rose to the top of the Ming imperial hierarchy and served as commander of the southern capital Nanjing.

==Early life and family==
Zheng was born Ma He to a Muslim family of Kunyang, Kunming, Yunnan, then under the rule of the Principality of Liang loyal to the Northern Yuan dynasty. He had an older brother and four sisters. The Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions suggest that devotion to Tianfei, the patron goddess of sailors and seafarers, was the dominant faith to which he adhered, reflecting the goddess&#x27;s central role to the treasure fleet. John Guy mentions, &quot;When Zheng He, the Muslim eunuch leader of the great expeditions to the &#x27;Western Ocean&#x27; (Indian Ocean) in the early fifteenth century, embarked on his voyages, it was from the Divine Woman that he sought protection, as well as at the tombs of the Muslim saints on Lingshan Hill, above the city of Quanzhou.&quot;

Zheng He was a great-great-great-grandson of Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, who served in the administration of the Mongol Empire and was the governor of Yunnan during the early Yuan dynasty. His great-grandfather Bayan may have been stationed at a Mongol garrison in Yunnan. Zheng He&#x27;s grandfather carried the title &quot;hajji&quot;, and his father had the sinicized surname Ma and the title &quot;hajji&quot;, which suggests that they had made the pilgrimage to Mecca.

In the autumn of 1381, a Ming army invaded and conquered Yunnan, which was then ruled by the Mongol prince Basalawarmi, Prince of Liang. In 1381, Ma Hajji, Zheng He&#x27;s father, died in the fighting between the Ming armies and Mongol forces. Dreyer states that Zheng He&#x27;s father died at 39 while resisting the Ming conquest, while Levathes states that Zheng He&#x27;s father died at 37, but it is unclear if he was helping the Mongol Army or was just caught in the onslaught of battle. Wenming, the oldest son, buried their father outside Kunming. In his capacity as Admiral, Zheng He had an epitaph engraved in honour of his father, composed by the Minister of Rites Li Zhigang on 1 June 1405, which was Duanwu Festival.

== Capture and service ==
Zheng He was captured by the Ming armies in Yunnan in 1381. General Fu Youde saw Ma He on a road and approached him to inquire about the location of the Mongol pretender. Ma He responded defiantly by saying that the Mongol pretender had jumped into a lake. Then the general took him prisoner. He was castrated between the ages of 10 and 14, and placed in the service of the Prince of Yan.

Ma He was sent to serve in the household of Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, who later became the Yongle Emperor. Zhu Di was 11 years older than Ma. Enslaved as a eunuch servant, Ma He eventually gained the confidence of Zhu Di, who, as his benefactor, gained the allegiance and loyalty of the young eunuch. The prince had been governing Beiping (modern Beijing) since 1380. It was near the northern frontier with hostile Mongol tribes. Ma spent his early life as a soldier on the northern frontier and often participated in Zhu Di&#x27;s military campaigns against the Mongols. On 2 March 1390, Ma accompanied the prince when he commanded his first expedition, which was a great victory, as the Mongol commander Naghachu surrendered as soon as he realized he had fallen into a trap.

Eventually, he gained the confidence and trust of the prince. Ma was also known as &quot;Sanbao&quot; during his service in the household of the Prince of Yan, a reference to the Buddhist Three Jewels. Ma received a proper education at Beiping, which he would not have had if he had been placed in the imperial capital of Nanjing as the Hongwu Emperor, the father of Zhu Di, did not trust eunuchs and believed that it was better to keep them illiterate. The Hongwu Emperor purged and exterminated much of the original Ming leadership and gave his enfeoffed sons more military authority, especially those in the north, like the Prince of Yan.

== Adulthood and military career ==
Zheng He&#x27;s appearance as an adult was recorded: he was seven &quot;chi&quot; tall, had a waist that was five &quot;chi&quot; in circumference, cheeks and a forehead that was high, a small nose, glaring eyes, teeth that were white and well-shaped as shells, and a voice that was as loud as a bell. It is also recorded that he had great knowledge about warfare and was well-accustomed to battle.

The young eunuch eventually became a trusted adviser to the prince and assisted him when the Jianwen Emperor&#x27;s hostility to his uncle&#x27;s feudal bases prompted the 13991402 Jingnan Campaign, which ended with the emperor&#x27;s apparent death and the ascension of Zhu Di, Prince of Yan, as the Yongle Emperor. In 1393, the Crown Prince had died, thus the deceased prince&#x27;s son became the new heir apparent. By the time the emperor died (24 June 1398), the Prince of Qin and the Prince of Jin had perished, which left Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, as the eldest surviving son of the emperor. However, Zhu Di&#x27;s nephew succeeded the imperial throne as the Jianwen Emperor. In 1398, he issued a policy known as &quot;xuēfān&quot; (), or &quot;reducing the feudatories&quot;, which entailed eliminating all princes by stripping their power and military forces. In August 1399, Zhu Di openly rebelled against his nephew. In 1399, Ma He successfully defended Beiping&#x27;s city reservoir, Zhenglunba, against the imperial armies. In January 1402, Zhu Di began with his military campaign to capture the imperial capital, Nanjing. Zheng He would be one of his commanders during that campaign.

In 1402, Zhu Di&#x27;s armies defeated the imperial forces and marched into Nanjing on 13 July 1402. Zhu Di accepted the elevation to emperor four days later. After ascending the throne as the Yongle Emperor, Zhu Di promoted Ma He as the Grand Director (, &quot;tàijiān&quot;) of the Directorate of Palace Servants (). During the Chinese New Year on 11 February 1404, the Yongle Emperor conferred the surname &quot;Zheng&quot; to Ma He, because he had distinguished himself defending the city reservoir against imperial forces in 1399. Another reason was that the eunuch commander also distinguished himself during the 1402 campaign to capture the capital, Nanjing.

In the new administration, Zheng He served in the highest posts as Grand Director and later as Chief Envoy () during his sea voyages. Over the next three decades he conducted seven of the voyages on behalf of the emperor, trading and collecting tribute in the western Pacific and Indian Oceans.

In 1424, Zheng He traveled to Palembang in Sumatra to confer an official seal and letter of appointment upon Shi Jisun, who was placed in the office of Pacification Commissioner. The &quot;Taizong Shilu&quot; 27 February 1424 entry reports that Shi Jisun had sent Qiu Yancheng as envoy to petition the approval of the succession from his father Shi Jinqing, who was the Pacification Commissioner of Palembang, and was given permission from the Yongle Emperor. When Zheng He returned from Palembang, he found that the Yongle Emperor had died during his absence. On 7 September 1424, Zhu Gaozhi had inherited the throne as the Hongxi Emperor after the death of the Yongle Emperor on 12 August 1424.

On 7 September 1424, the Hongxi Emperor terminated the undertaking of further treasure voyages. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the treasure fleet for the city&#x27;s defense. On 25 March 1428, the Xuande Emperor ordered Zheng He and others to take over the supervision for the rebuilding and repair of the Great Bao&#x27;en Temple at Nanjing. He completed the construction of the temple in 1431.

On 15 May 1426, the Xuande Emperor ordered the Directorate of Ceremonial to send a letter to Zheng He to reprimand him for a transgression. Earlier, an official petitioned the emperor to reward workmen who had built temples in Nanjing. The Xuande Emperor responded negatively to the official for charging the costs to the court instead of the monks themselves, but he realised that Zheng He and his associates had instigated the official. According to , the nature of the emperor&#x27;s words indicated that Zheng He&#x27;s behaviour in the situation was the last straw, but there is too little information about what had happened earlier. Nevertheless, the Xuande Emperor would eventually come to trust Zheng He.

In 1430, the new Xuande Emperor appointed Zheng He to command over a seventh and final expedition into the &quot;Western Ocean&quot; (Indian Ocean). In 1431, Zheng He was bestowed with the title &quot;Sanbao Taijian&quot; (), using his informal name Sanbao and the title of Grand Director.

==Expeditions==

The Yuan dynasty and the expanding Sino-Arab trade during the 14th century had gradually expanded Chinese knowledge of the world since &quot;universal&quot; maps previously displaying only China and its surrounding seas began to expand farther and farther southwest, with much more accurate depictions of the extent of Arabia and Africa. Between 1405 and 1433, the Ming government sponsored seven naval expeditions. The Yongle Emperor, disregarding the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s expressed wishes, designed them to establish a Chinese presence and impose imperial control over the Indian Ocean trade, impress foreign peoples in the Indian Ocean basin, and extend the empire&#x27;s tributary system. It has also been inferred from passages in the &quot;History of Ming&quot; that the initial voyages were launched as part of the emperor&#x27;s attempt to capture his escaped predecessor, which would have made the first voyage the &quot;largest-scale manhunt on water in the history of China.&quot;

Zheng He was placed as the admiral in control of the huge fleet and armed forces that undertook the expeditions. Wang Jinghong was appointed as second in command. Preparations were thorough and wide-ranging, including the use of so many linguists that a foreign language institute was established at Nanjing. Zheng He&#x27;s first voyage departed 11 July 1405, from Suzhou and consisted of a fleet of 317 ships holding almost 28,000 crewmen.

Zheng He&#x27;s fleets visited Brunei, Java, Siam (Thailand), Southeast Asia, India, the Horn of Africa, and Arabia, dispensing and receiving goods along the way. Zheng He presented gifts of gold, silver, porcelain, and silk, and in return, China received such novelties as ostriches, zebras, camels, and ivory from the Swahili Coast. The giraffe that he brought back from Malindi was considered to be a &quot;qilin&quot; and taken as proof of the Mandate of Heaven upon the administration. The Daxuexi Alley Mosque in Xi&#x27;an has a stele dating to January 1523, inscribed with Zheng He&#x27;s fourth maritime voyage to Tianfang, Arabian Peninsula.
While Zheng He&#x27;s fleet was unprecedented, the routes were not. His fleet followed long-established, well-mapped routes of trade between China and the Arabian Peninsula that had been used since at least the Han dynasty. That fact, along with the use of a more-than-abundant number of crew members who were regular military personnel, leads some to speculate that the expeditions may have been geared at least partially at spreading China&#x27;s power through expansion. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the king of Wu sent a 20-year diplomatic mission led by Zhu Ying and Kang Tai along the coast of Asia, which reached as far as the Eastern Roman Empire. After centuries of disruption, the Song dynasty restored large-scale maritime trade from China in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans and reached as far as the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa. When his fleet first arrived at Malacca, there was already a sizable Chinese community. The &quot;General Survey of the Ocean Shores&quot; (, &quot;Yíngyá Shènglǎn&quot;), composed by the translator Ma Huan in 1416, gives very detailed accounts of his observations of people&#x27;s customs and lives in the ports that they visited. He referred to the expatriate Chinese as &quot;Tang&quot; people ().


The fleet did not engage in conquest or colonization; though it included troops, their purpose was to demonstrate the Middle Kingdom&#x27;s strength. However, a contemporary reported that Zheng He &quot;walked like a tiger&quot; and did not shrink from violence when he considered it necessary to impress foreign peoples with China&#x27;s military might. He ruthlessly suppressed pirates, who had long plagued Chinese and Southeast Asian waters. For example, he defeated Chen Zuyi, one of the most feared and respected pirate captains, and returned him to China for execution. He also waged a land war against the Kingdom of Kotte on Ceylon, and he made displays of military force when local officials threatened his fleet in Arabia and East Africa. From his fourth voyage, he brought envoys from 30 states, who traveled to China and paid their respects at the Ming court.

In 1424, the Yongle Emperor died. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor (r. 14241425), stopped the voyages during his short reign. Zheng He made one more voyage during the reign of Hongxi&#x27;s son, the Xuande Emperor (r. 1426–1435) but, the voyages of the Chinese treasure ship fleets then ended. Xuande believed his father&#x27;s decision to halt the voyages had been meritorious and thus &quot;there would be no need to make a detailed description of his grandfather&#x27;s sending Zheng He to the Western Ocean.&quot; The voyages &quot;were contrary to the rules stipulated in the Huang Ming Zuxun&quot; (), the dynastic foundation documents laid down by the Hongwu Emperor:

Some far-off countries pay their tribute to me at much expense and through great difficulties, all of which are by no means my own wish. Messages should be forwarded to them to reduce their tribute so as to avoid high and unnecessary expenses on both sides.

They further violated longstanding Confucian principles. They were only made possible by (and therefore continued to represent) a triumph of the Ming&#x27;s eunuch faction over the administration&#x27;s scholar-bureaucrats. Upon Zheng He&#x27;s death and his faction&#x27;s fall from power, his successors sought to minimize him in official accounts, along with continuing attempts to destroy all records related to the Jianwen Emperor or the manhunt to find him.

Although unmentioned in the official dynastic histories, Zheng He probably died during the treasure fleet&#x27;s last voyage. Although he has a tomb in China, it is empty since he was buried at sea.

Zheng He led seven expeditions to the &quot;Western&quot; or Indian Ocean. Zheng He brought back to China many trophies and envoys from more than thirty kingdoms, including King Vira Alakeshwara of Ceylon, who came to China as a captive to apologize to the Emperor for offenses against his mission.

Zheng He wrote of his travels:

We have traversed more than 100,000 &quot;li&quot; of immense water spaces and have beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising in the sky, and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors, while our sails, loftily unfurled like clouds day and night, continued their course [as rapidly] as a star, traversing those savage waves as if we were treading a public thoroughfare...

==Sailing charts==


Zheng He&#x27;s sailing charts, the Mao Kun map, were published in a book entitled the &quot;Wubei Zhi&quot; (&quot;A Treatise on Armament Technology&quot;) written in 1621 and published in 1628 but traced back to Zheng He&#x27;s and earlier voyages. It was originally a strip map 20.5 cm by 560 cm that could be rolled up, but was divided into 40 pages which vary in scale from 7 miles/inch in the Nanjing area to 215 miles/inch in parts of the African coast.

Investigation into folios 19V to 20R of the Mao Kun Map, which cover the Indian Ocean including South India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and East Africa, suggests that the map is a composite of four maps, one for Sri Lanka, one for South India one for the Maldives and one for around 400 km of the East African coast, no further south than 6 degrees south of the Equator. Each of these maps is positioned at a different orientation to fit with the ocean currents and winds required of a sailing chart, rather than a formal map. The analysis also suggests that Arabic-speaking pilots with a detailed knowledge of the African coast were involved in the cartography.

There is little attempt to provide an accurate 2-D representation; instead, the sailing instructions are given using a 24-point compass system with a Chinese symbol for each point, together with a sailing time or distance, which takes account of the local currents and winds. Sometimes depth soundings are also provided. It also shows bays, estuaries, capes and islands, ports and mountains along the coast, important landmarks such as pagodas and temples, and shoal rocks. Of 300 named places outside China, more than 80% can be confidently located. There are also fifty observations of stellar altitude.

==Size of ships==
According to &#x27;s novel &quot;Sanbao Taijian Xia Xiyang Ji Tongsu Yanyi&quot; (&quot;Eunuch Sanbao Western Records Popular Romance&quot;, published 1597), the first expedition had:

* &quot;Treasure ships&quot; (, &quot;Bǎo Chuán&quot;) nine-masted, 44.4 by 18 &quot;zhang&quot;, about long and wide.
* Equine ships (, &quot;Mǎ Chuán&quot;), carrying horses and tribute goods and repair material for the fleet, eight-masted, 37 by 15 &quot;zhang&quot;, about long and wide.
* Supply ships (, &quot;Liáng Chuán&quot;), containing staple for the crew, seven-masted, 28 by 12 &quot;zhang&quot;, about long and wide.
* Transport ships (, &quot;Zuò Chuán&quot;), six-masted, 24 by 9.4 &quot;zhang&quot;, about long and wide.
* Warships (, &quot;Zhàn Chuán&quot;), five-masted, 18 by 6.8 &quot;zhang&quot;, about long.

On the ships were navigators, explorers, sailors, doctors, workers, and soldiers, along with the translator and diarist Gong Zhen. Six more expeditions took place from 1407 to 1433, with fleets thought to be of comparable size.

Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta both described multi-masted ships carrying 500 to 1,000 passengers in their translated accounts. Niccolò de&#x27; Conti, a contemporary of Zheng He, was also an eyewitness of ships in Southeast Asia, claiming to have seen five-masted junks weighing about 2,000 &quot;vegetes&quot;, that is Venetian butt. Christopher Wake estimated a burthen of 1300 tons. The ship of Conti may have been a Burmese or Indonesian jong.

The largest ships in the fleet, the Chinese treasure ships described in Chinese chronicles, would have been nearly twice as long as any other wooden ship recorded thereafter until the 20th century, surpassing Admiral Nelson&#x27;s HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, long, which was launched in 1765, and the &quot;Vasa&quot; of 1627. The first ships to attain long were 19th century steamers with iron hulls. Many scholars consider it unlikely that any of Zheng He&#x27;s ships were in length and have proposed much shorter lengths, as low as . Zhao Zhigang claimed that he has solved the debate of the size difference, and stated that Zheng He&#x27;s largest ship was about in length.

===Disputes of historical records of length===
Edward L. Dreyer claims that Luo Maodeng&#x27;s novel is unsuitable as historical evidence. The novel contains a number of fantasy element; for example the ships were &quot;constructed with divine help by the immortal Lu Ban&quot;.

One explanation for the seemingly-inefficient size of the colossal ships was that the 44 &quot;zhang&quot; treasure ships were used only by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats to travel along the Yangtze for court business, including reviewing Zheng He&#x27;s expedition fleet. The Yangtze river, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable by these treasure ships. Zheng He, a court eunuch, would not have had the privilege in rank to command the largest of the ships, seaworthy or not. The main ships of Zheng He&#x27;s fleet were instead six-masted 2000-liao ships. That would give burthen of 500 tons and a displacement tonnage of about 800 tons.

Traditional and popular accounts of Zheng He&#x27;s voyages have described a great fleet of gigantic ships far larger than any other wooden ships in history. The most grandiose claims for Zheng He&#x27;s 1405 fleet are entirely based on a calculation derived from an account that was written three centuries later and was accepted as fact by one modern writer; rejected by numerous naval experts. There are even some sources that claim some of the treasure ships might have been as long as . The claims that the Chinese treasure ships reached such size is disputed because other 17th century Ming records stated that European East Indiamen and galleons were 30, 40, 50, and 60 &quot;zhang&quot; (90, 120, 150, and 180 m) in length.

It is also possible that the measure of &quot;zhang&quot; (丈) used in the conversions was mistaken. The length of a Dutch ship recorded in the &quot;History of Ming&quot; was 30 &quot;zhang&quot;. If the &quot;zhang&quot; is taken to be 3.2 m, the Dutch ship would be 96 m long. Also the Dutch &quot;Hongyi&quot; cannon was recorded to be more than 2 &quot;zhang&quot; (6.4 m) long. Comparative study by Hu Xiaowei (2018) concluded that 1 &quot;zhang&quot; would be equal to 1.5–1.6 m, this means the Dutch ship would be 45–48 m long and the cannon would be 3–3.2 m long. Taking 1.6 m for 1 &quot;zhang&quot;, Zheng He&#x27;s 44 &quot;zhang&quot; treasure ship would be long and wide, or 22 &quot;zhang&quot; long and 9 &quot;zhang&quot; wide if the &quot;zhang&quot; is taken to be 3.2 m. It is known that the measure unit during the Ming era was not unified: A measurement of East and West Pagoda in Quanzhou resulted in a &quot;zhang&quot; unit of 2.5–2.56 m. According to Chen Cunren, one &quot;zhang&quot; in the Ming Dynasty is only half a &quot;zhang&quot; in modern times.

===Treasure Shipyard excavation===
From 2003 to 2004, the Treasure Shipyard was excavated in northwestern Nanjing (the former capital of the Ming Dynasty), near the Yangtze River. Despite the site being referred to as the &quot;Longjiang Treasure Shipyard&quot; (龍江寶船廠) in the official names, the site is distinct from the actual Longjiang Shipyard, which was located on a different site and produced different types of ships. The Treasure Shipyard, where Zheng He&#x27;s fleet is believed to have been built in the Ming Dynasty, once consisted of thirteen basins (based on a 1944 map), most of which have now been covered by the construction of buildings in the 20th century. The basins are believed to have been connected to the Yangtze via a series of gates. Three long basins survive, each with wooden structures inside, interpreted to be frames onto which the ships to be built on. The largest basin extends for a length of . While they were long enough to accommodate the largest claimed Zheng He treasure ship, they were not wide enough to fit even a ship half the claimed size. The basin was only wide at most, with only a width showing evidence of structures. They were also not deep enough, being only deep. Other remains of ships in the site indicate that the ships were only slightly larger than the frames that supported them. Moreover, the basin structures were grouped into clusters with large gaps between them, if each cluster was interpreted as a ship framework, then the largest ship would not exceed at most, probably less.

The 2003–2004 excavation also recovered two complete wooden rudderposts from the Treasure Shipyard, in addition to another recovered in 1957. They are made of teak and measure
around in length. Zhou Shide (1962) claimed that the first rudderpost recovered was proof of the enormous dimensions of the ships based on his calculations on how big the rudderblade would be. However Church (2010) points out that Zhou was using calculations based on modern steel propeller-driven ships, not wooden ships; as well as the fact that Zhou&#x27;s hypothetical rudder shape was based on the flat-bottomed &quot;shachuan&quot; (沙船) ship type, not the sea-going &quot;fuchuan&quot; (福船). The rudderposts cannot be used to infer the actual size of the rudder blades. Church notes that in traditional wooden Chinese ships, rudderposts were necessarily long in order for them to extend from the water level up unto the ship deck, where it was controlled by the tiller. Church compares it with modern wooden junks built in the traditional &quot;Lümeimao&quot; (&quot;green eyebrow&quot;, 綠眉毛) style, which also have rudderposts that are long, but are only in overall length.

== Death ==
One theory is that Admiral Zheng He died in 1433, during or shortly after his seventh voyage. Another is that Zheng He continued to serve as the defender of Nanjing, and died in 1435.

A tomb was built for Zheng He at the southern slope of Cattle Head Hill, Nanjing. The original tomb was a horseshoe-shaped grave. It is a cenotaph believed to contain his clothes and headgear. In 1985, the tomb was rebuilt following a Muslim style.

==Legacy==
Zheng&#x27;s voyages were long neglected in official Chinese histories but have become well known in China and abroad since the publication of Liang Qichao&#x27;s &quot;Biography of Our Homeland&#x27;s Great Navigator, Zheng He&quot; in 1904.

===Imperial China===
In the decades after the last voyage, Imperial officials minimized the importance of Zheng He and his expeditions throughout the many regnal and dynastic histories they compiled. The information in the Yongle and Xuande Emperors&#x27; official annals was incomplete and even erroneous, and other official publications omitted them completely. Although some have seen that as a conspiracy seeking to eliminate memories of the voyages, it is likely that the records were dispersed throughout several departments and the expeditions, unauthorized by and in fact counter to the injunctions of the dynastic founder, presented a kind of embarrassment to the dynasty.

State-sponsored Ming naval efforts declined dramatically after Zheng&#x27;s voyages. Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the surviving Yuan Mongols from the north. The relocation of the capital to Beijing in the north exacerbated this threat dramatically. At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians. The expenditures necessary for the land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions. Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the Zhengtong Emperor at Tumu Fortress, less than a day&#x27;s march from the walls of the capital. The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor. The battle had two salient effects. Firstly, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads. Secondly, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new Jingtai era. Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor would political stability return. Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the Great Wall of China. In that environment, funding for naval expeditions was simply absent.

However, missions from Southeastern Asia continued to arrive for decades. Depending on local conditions, they could reach such frequency that the court found it necessary to restrict them. The &quot;History of Ming&quot; records imperial edicts forbade Java, Champa, and Siam from sending their envoys more often than once every three years.

===Southeast Asia===
====Veneration====
Among the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia, Zheng He became a figure of folk veneration. Even some of his crew members who happened to stay in some port sometimes did so as well, such as &quot;Poontaokong&quot; on Sulu. The temples of the cult, called after either of his names, Cheng Hoon or Sam Po, are peculiar to overseas Chinese except for a single temple in Hongjian originally constructed by a returned Filipino Chinese in the Ming dynasty and rebuilt by another Filipino Chinese after the original was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.

====Malacca====
The oldest and most important Chinese temple in Malacca is the 17th-century Cheng Hoon Teng, dedicated to Guanyin. During Dutch colonial rule, the head of the Cheng Hoon Temple was appointed as chief over the community&#x27;s Chinese inhabitants.

Following Zheng He&#x27;s arrival, the sultan and the sultana of Malacca visited China at the head of over 540 of their subjects, bearing ample tribute. Sultan Mansur Shah (r. 1459–1477) later dispatched Tun Perpatih Putih as his envoy to China, carrying a letter from the sultan to the Ming emperor. The letter requested the hand of an imperial daughter in marriage. Malay (but not Chinese) annals record that in 1459, a princess named Hang Li Po or Hang Liu was sent from China to marry the sultan. She came with 500 high-ranking young men and a few hundred handmaidens as her entourage. They eventually settled in Bukit Cina. It is believed that a significant number of them married into the local populace, creating the descendants now known as the Peranakan. Owing to this supposed lineage, the Peranakan still use special honorifics: &quot;Baba&quot; for the men and &quot;Nyonya&quot; for the women.

====Indonesia====

The Chinese Indonesian community have established temples dedicated to Zheng He in Jakarta, Cirebon, Surabaya, and Semarang.

In 1961, the Indonesian Islamic leader and scholar Hamka credited Zheng He for playing an important role in the development of Islam in Indonesia. The &quot;Brunei Times&quot; credits Zheng He with building Chinese Muslim communities in Palembang and along the shores of Java, the Malay Peninsula, and the Philippines. These Muslims allegedly followed the Hanafi school in the Chinese language.

===Western scholarship===
In the 1950s, historians such as John Fairbank and Joseph Needham popularized the idea that after Zheng He&#x27;s voyages China turned away from the seas due to the &quot;Haijin&quot; edict and was isolated from European technological advancements. Modern historians point out that Chinese maritime commerce did not totally stop after Zheng He, that Chinese ships continued to participate in Southeast Asian commerce until the 19th century, and that active Chinese trading with India and East Africa continued long after the time of Zheng. Moreover, revisionist historians such as Jack Goldstone argue that the Zheng He voyages ended for practical reasons that did not reflect the technological level of China. Although the Ming dynasty prohibited shipping with the &quot;Haijin&quot; edict, it was a policy of the Hongwu Emperor that long preceded Zheng He and the ban, so obviously disregarded by the Yongle Emperor, was eventually lifted entirely. However, the ban on maritime shipping forced countless numbers of people into smuggling and piracy. Neglect of the imperial navy and Nanjing dockyards after Zheng He&#x27;s voyages left the coast highly vulnerable to Japanese wokou during the 16th century.

Richard von Glahn, a UCLA professor of Chinese history, commented that most treatments of Zheng He present him wrongly, &quot;offer counterfactual arguments,&quot; and &quot;emphasize China&#x27;s missed opportunity&quot; by focusing on failures, instead of accomplishments. In contrast, Glahn asserts that &quot;Zheng He reshaped Asia&quot; because maritime history in the 15th century was essentially the Zheng He story and the effects of his voyages.

===Cultural influence===
Despite the official neglect, the adventures of the fleet captured the imagination of some Chinese with some writing novelisations of the voyages, such as the &quot;Romance of the Three-Jeweled Eunuch&quot; in 1597.

On his travels, Zheng He built mosques and also spread the worship of Mazu. He apparently never found time for a pilgrimage to Mecca but sent sailors there on his last voyage. He played an important part in developing relations between China and Islamic countries. Zheng He also visited Muslim shrines of Islamic holy men in the Fujian.

In modern times, interest in Zheng He has revived substantially. In Vernor Vinge&#x27;s 1999 science fiction novel &quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot;, an interstellar society of commercial traders in human space are named the Qeng Ho, after the admiral. The expeditions featured prominently in Heather Terrell&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;The Map Thief&quot;. For the 600th anniversary of Zheng He&#x27;s voyages in 2005, China Central Television produced a special television series, &quot;Zheng He Xia Xiyang&quot;, starring Gallen Lo as Zheng He. He is also mentioned in part of the main storyline of the first-person shooter game Far Cry 3. The Star Trek series &quot;Picard&quot; further featured an advanced starship named USS &quot;Zheng He&quot;. There was even a US Navy boat that was acquired for picket duty during World War II that was named &quot;Cheng Ho&quot; by its previous owner.

===Relics===
* Zheng He built the Tianfei Palace (), a temple in honour of the goddess Mazu, in Nanjing after the fleet returned from its first western voyage in 1407.
* The &quot;Deed of Foreign Connection and Exchange&quot; () or &quot;Tongfan Deed Stele&quot; is located in the Tianfei Palace in Liuhe, Taicang, whence the expeditions first departed. The stele was submerged and lost but has been rebuilt.
* To thank the Celestial Wife for her blessings, Zheng He and his colleagues rebuilt the Tianfei Palace in Nanshan, Changle County, Fujian Province as well before they left on their last voyage. At the renovated temple, they raised a stele, &quot;A Record of Tianfei Showing Her Presence and Power&quot; (), discussing their earlier voyages.
* The Galle Trilingual Inscription in Sri Lanka was discovered in the city of Galle in 1911 and is preserved at the National Museum of Colombo. The three languages used in the inscription were Chinese, Tamil, and Persian. The inscription praises Buddha and describes the fleet&#x27;s donations to the famous Tenavarai Nayanar temple of Tondeswaram frequented by both Hindus and Buddhists.
* Zheng He&#x27;s tomb in Nanjing has been repaired and a small museum built next to it, but his body was buried at sea off the Malabar Coast near Calicut, in western India. However, his sword and other personal possessions were interred in a Muslim tomb inscribed in Arabic. The tomb of Zheng He&#x27;s assistant Hong Bao was recently unearthed in Nanjing as well.
* Seven large sunken ships were found in the sea near Dongsha Island, which were confirmed to belong to Zheng He&#x27;s fleet. The types of the seven sunken ships were Shachuan (沙船), Fuchuan (福船), and Zhanzuochuan (戰座船).

===Commemoration===
In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, 11 July is Maritime Day (, &quot;Zhōngguó Hánghǎi Rì&quot;) and is devoted to the memory of Zheng He&#x27;s first voyage. Initially Kunming Changshui International Airport was to be named Zheng He International Airport.

In 2015, Emotion Media Factory dedicated a special multimedia show &quot;Zheng He is coming&quot; for amusement park Romon U-Park (Ningbo, China). The show became a finalist of the amusement industry prestigious Brass Rings Awards by IAAPA.

Zheng He is the namesake of the ROCS &quot;Cheng Ho&quot; missile frigate in Taiwan.

The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy ship &quot;Zheng He (AX-81)&quot; is a Chinese training ship named for him. Like her namesake, she serves as a goodwill ambassador for China, becoming the first Chinese Navy ship to visit the United States in 1989 and completing a circumnavigation of the globe in 2012.

The proposed sample-return spacecraft &quot;Tianwen-2&quot; was originally named &quot;ZhengHe&quot;. Its mission to explore Near-Earth asteroid 2016 HO3 is scheduled to launch in 2025.

<doc id="34498" wikidata="Q219149" url="?curid=34498" title="Zombie process">
<text>On Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a zombie process or defunct process is a process that has completed execution (via the codice_1 system call) but still has an entry in the process table: it is a process in the &quot;terminated state&quot;. This occurs for the child processes, where the entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child&#x27;s exit status: once the exit status is read via the codice_2 system call, the zombie&#x27;s entry is removed from the process table and it is said to be &quot;reaped&quot;. A child process initially becomes a zombie, only then being removed from the resource table. Under normal system operation, zombies are immediately waited on by their parent and then reaped by the system. Processes that stay zombies for a long time are usually an error and can cause a resource leak. Generally, the only kernel resource they occupy is the process table entry, their process ID. However, zombies can also hold buffers open, consuming memory. Zombies can hold handles to file descriptors, which prevents the space for those files from being available to the filesystem. This effect can be seen by a difference between codice_3 and codice_4. While codice_5 may show a large amount of free disk space, codice_6 will show a full partition. If the zombies are not cleaned, this can fill the root partition and crash the system.

The term &quot;zombie process&quot; derives from the common definition of zombie — an undead person. In the term&#x27;s metaphor, the child process has &quot;died&quot; but has not yet been &quot;reaped&quot;. Unlike normal processes, the codice_7 command has no effect on a zombie process.

Zombie processes should not be confused with orphan processes, a process that is still executing, but whose parent has died. When the parent dies, the orphaned child process is adopted by codice_8. When orphan processes die, they do not remain as zombie processes; instead, they are codice_9ed on by codice_10.

==Overview==
When a process ends via codice_11, all of the memory and resources associated with it are deallocated so they can be used by other processes. However, the process&#x27;s entry in the process table remains. The parent can read the child&#x27;s exit status by executing the codice_2 system call, whereupon the zombie is removed. The codice_9 call may be executed in sequential code, but it is commonly executed in a handler for the SIGCHLD signal, which the parent receives whenever a child has died.

After the zombie is removed, its process identifier (PID) and entry in the process table can then be reused. However, if a parent fails to call codice_9, the zombie will be left in the process table, causing a resource leak. In some situations this may be desirable – the parent process wishes to continue holding this resource – for example if the parent creates another child process it ensures that it will not be allocated the same PID. On modern UNIX-like systems (that comply with SUSv3 specification in this respect), the following special case applies: if the parent &quot;explicitly&quot; ignores SIGCHLD by setting its handler to codice_15 (rather than simply ignoring the signal by default) or has the codice_16 flag set, all child exit status information will be discarded and no zombie processes will be left.

Zombies can be identified in the output from the Unix codice_17 command by the presence of a &quot;codice_18&quot; in the &quot;STAT&quot; column. Zombies that exist for more than a short period of time typically indicate a bug in the parent program, or just an uncommon decision to not reap children (see example). If the parent program is no longer running, zombie processes typically indicate a bug in the operating system. As with other resource leaks, the presence of a few zombies is not worrisome in itself, but may indicate a problem that would grow serious under heavier loads. Since there is no memory allocated to zombie processes – the only system memory usage is for the process table entry itself – the primary concern with many zombies is not running out of memory, but rather running out of process table entries, concretely process ID numbers. However, zombies can hold open buffers that are associated with file descriptors, and thereby cause memory to be consumed by the zombie. Zombies can also hold a file descriptor to a file that has been deleted. This prevents the file system from recovering the i-nodes for the deleted file. Therefore, the command to show disk usage will not count the deleted files whose space cannot be reused due to the zombie holding the filedescriptor.

To remove zombies from a system, the SIGCHLD signal can be sent to the parent manually, using the codice_19 command. If the parent process still refuses to reap the zombie, and if it would be fine to terminate the parent process, the next step can be to remove the parent process. When a process loses its parent, codice_10 becomes its new parent. codice_10 periodically executes the codice_9 system call to reap any zombies with codice_10 as parent.

==Example==
&quot;Synchronously&quot; waiting for the specific child processes in a (specific) order may leave zombies present longer than the above-mentioned &quot;short period of time&quot;. It is not necessarily a program bug.
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(void)
 pid_t pids[10];
 int i;

 for (i = 9; i &gt;= 0; --i) {
 pids[i] = fork();
 if (pids[i] == 0) {
 printf(&quot;Child%d\n&quot;, i);
 sleep(i+1);
 _exit(0);
 }

 for (i = 9; i &gt;= 0; --i) {
 printf(&quot;parent%d\n&quot;, i);
 waitpid(pids[i], NULL, 0);

 return 0;


===Output===
===Explanation===
In the first loop, the original (parent) process forks 10 copies of itself. Each of these child processes (detected by the fact that fork() returned zero) prints a message, sleeps, and exits. All of the children are created at essentially the same time (since the parent is doing very little in the loop), so it is somewhat random when each of them gets scheduled for the first time - thus the scrambled order of their messages.

During the loop, an array of child process IDs is built. There is a copy of the pids[] array in all 11 processes, but only in the parent is it complete - the copy in each child will be missing the lower-numbered child PIDs, and have zero for its own PID. (Not that this really matters, as only the parent process actually uses this array.)

The second loop executes only in the parent process (because all of the children have exited before this point), and waits for each child to exit. It waits for the child that slept 10 seconds first; all the others have long since exited, so all of the messages (except the first) appear in quick succession. There is no possibility of random ordering here, since it is driven by a loop in a single process. The first parent message actually appeared before any of the children messages - the parent was able to continue into the second loop before any of the child processes were able to start. This again is just the random behavior of the process scheduler - the &quot;parent9&quot; message could have appeared anywhere in the sequence prior to &quot;parent8&quot;.

Child0 through Child8 spend one or more seconds in this state, between the time they exited and the time the parent did a waitpid() on them. The parent was already waiting on Child9 before it exited, so that one process spent essentially no time as a zombie.

<doc id="34499" wikidata="Q207240" url="?curid=34499" title="Zlib">
<text>zlib ( or &quot;zeta-lib&quot;, ) is a software library used for data compression as well as a data format. zlib was written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler and is an abstraction of the DEFLATE compression algorithm used in their gzip file compression program. zlib is also a crucial component of many software platforms, including Linux, macOS, and iOS. It has also been used in gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Wii U, Wii, Xbox One and Xbox 360.

The first public version of Zlib, 0.9, was released on 1 May 1995 and was originally intended for use with the libpng image library. It is free software, distributed under the zlib License.

== Capabilities ==

=== Encapsulation ===
Raw DEFLATE compressed data (RFC 1951) are typically written with a zlib or gzip wrapper encapsulating the data, by adding a header and footer. This provides stream identification and error detection that are not provided by the raw DEFLATE data.

The zlib wrapper (RFC 1950) is smaller than the gzip wrapper (RFC 1952), as the latter stores a file name and other file system information.

=== Algorithm ===
, zlib only supports one algorithm, called DEFLATE, which uses a combination of a variation of LZ77 (Lempel–Ziv 1977) and Huffman coding. This algorithm provides good compression on a wide variety of data with minimal use of system resources. This is also the algorithm used in the Zip archive format. The header makes allowance for other algorithms, but none are currently implemented.

=== Resource use ===
zlib provides facilities for control of processor and memory use. A compression level value may be supplied that trades speed for compression. There are also facilities for conserving memory, useful in restricted memory environments, such as some embedded systems.

=== Strategy ===
The compression can be optimized for specific types of data. If one is using the library to always compress specific types of data, then using a specific strategy may improve compression and performance. For example, if the data contain long lengths of repeated bytes, the run-length encoding (RLE) strategy may give good results at a higher speed. For general data, the default strategy is preferred.

=== Error handling ===
Errors in compressed data may be detected and skipped. Further, if &quot;full-flush&quot; points are written to the compressed stream, then corrupt data can be skipped, and the decompression will resynchronize at the next flush point—although no error recovery of the corrupt data is provided. Full-flush points are useful for large data streams on unreliable channels, where some data loss is unimportant, such as in some multimedia applications. However, creating many flush points can affect the speed as well as the amount (ratio) of compression.

=== Data length ===
There is no limit to the length of data that can be compressed or decompressed. Repeated calls to the library allow an unlimited number of blocks of data to be handled. Some ancillary code (counters) may suffer from overflow for long data streams, but this does not affect the actual compression or decompression.

When compressing a long (or infinite) data stream, it is advisable to write regular full-flush points.

== Applications ==
Today, zlib is something of a &quot;de facto&quot; standard, to the point that zlib and DEFLATE are often used interchangeably in standards documents, with thousands of applications relying on it for compression, either directly or indirectly. These include:
* The Linux kernel, where zlib is used to implement compressed network protocols, compressed file systems, and to decompress the kernel image at boot time.
* GNU Binutils and GNU Debugger (GDB)
* libpng, the reference implementation for the PNG image format, which specifies DEFLATE as the stream compression for its bitmap data.
* libwww, an API for web applications like web browsers.
* The Apache HTTP Server, which uses zlib to implement HTTP/1.1.
* Similarly, the cURL library uses zlib to decompress HTTP responses.
* The OpenSSH client and server, which rely on zlib to perform the optional compression offered by the Secure Shell protocol.
* The OpenSSL and GnuTLS security libraries, which can optionally use zlib to compress TLS connections.
* The FFmpeg multimedia library, which uses zlib to read and write the DEFLATE-compressed parts of stream formats, such as Matroska.
* The rsync remote file synchronizer, which uses zlib to implement optional protocol compression.
* The dpkg and RPM package managers, which use zlib to unpack files from compressed software packages.
* The Apache Subversion and CVS version control systems, which use zlib to compress traffic to and from remote repositories.
* The Apache ORC column-oriented data storage format use ZLib as its default compression method.
* The Git version control system uses zlib to store the contents of its data objects (blobs, trees, commits and tags).
* The PostgreSQL RDBMS uses zlib with custom dump format (pg_dump -Fc) for database backups.
* The class System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream of the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 and higher.
* The &quot;deflate&quot; utility in TORNADO as part of VxWorks Operating System made by Wind River Systems uses zlib to compress boot ROM images.
* zlib-flate, raw zlib compression program, part of qpdf
* The MySQL RDBMS uses ZLib LZ77 for compression in InnoDB Tables 
zlib is also used in many embedded devices, such as the Apple iPhone and Sony PlayStation 3, because the code is portable, liberally licensed, and has a relatively small memory footprint.

=== Forks ===
A commonly used library built on an old codebase, zlib is also frequently forked by third-parties that claim improvements to this library:
* Intel has a high-performance fork of zlib.
* Cloudflare maintains a high-performance fork with &quot;massive&quot; improvements.
* zlib-ng is a zlib replacement fork for &quot;next generation&quot; systems. It removes workaround code for compilers that do not support ANSI C, integrates Cloudflare and Intel optimizations, adds hardware acceleration (SIMD and intrinsic functions), and uses code sanitizers, fuzzing, and code coverage to help find bugs.

<doc id="34505" wikidata="Q135811" url="?curid=34505" title="Z-machine">
<text>The Z-machine is a virtual machine that was developed by Joel Berez and Marc Blank in 1979 and used by Infocom for its text adventure games. Infocom compiled game code to files containing Z-machine instructions (called story files or Z-code files) and could therefore port its text adventures to a new platform simply by writing a Z-machine implementation for that platform. With the large number of incompatible home computer systems in use at the time, this was an important advantage over using native code or developing a compiler for each system.

==History and design==
===Nomenclature and conventions===
The &quot;Z&quot; of Z-machine stands for &quot;Zork&quot;, Infocom&#x27;s first adventure game. Infocom used file extensions of .dat (Data) and .zip (ZIP = Z-machine Interpreter Program), but the latter clashed with the widespread use of .zip for PKZIP-compatible archive files starting in the 1990s, after Activision had closed Infocom.

Infocom produced six versions of the Z-machine. Files using versions 1 and 2 are very rare. Only two version 1 files are known to have been released by Infocom and only two of version 2. Version 3 covers the majority of Infocom&#x27;s released games. Later versions had more capabilities, culminating in some graphic support in version 6.

The modern convention for Z-code files usually have names ending in .z1, .z2, .z3, .z4, .z5, .z6, .z7, or .z8, where the number is the version number of the Z-machine on which the file is intended to be run, as given by the first byte of the story file. As previously noted, the Infocom games used the equivalent of .z1 through .z6; .z7 and .z8 were proposed and adopted after Infocom had shut down.

===Before Z-machine===
The MDL programming language was derived from Lisp at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by the Dynamic Modeling group of the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) in the 1970s; inspired by &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; (1977), members of that group went on to write &quot;Zork&quot; in MDL, completing the initial version two weeks later. Like &quot;Adventure&quot;, &quot;Zork&quot; was programmed for the DEC PDP-10; the finished version occupies 1 MB of MDL code and requires 512 KB of RAM to run. Because contemporary home computers did not have these resources, considerable effort was needed to port the game. Eventually, the developers split &quot;Zork&quot; into two games for personal computers.

The compression required to run &quot;Zork&quot; from floppy discs with approximately 80 KB of storage seemed like an insurmountable barrier to Blank. Berez realized that UCSD Pascal used a virtual machine (VM) model to generate executable files that could be readily ported across platforms, and together with Blank, they devised requirements for a lightweight VM optimized for text adventure games, which would retrieve data and execute instructions as needed from storage to compensate for the relatively small RAM sizes in typical microcomputers. The resulting Z-machine used an object tree structure for in-game items, locations, characters, and weapons. For comparison, the Z-machine parser occupies 3 kB of storage, while the original PDP-10 parser occupies 10 Kwords (36-bit).

===ZIL and ZIP, ZILCH and ZAP===
To complement the Z-machine, Infocom developed the high-level computer language Zork Implementation Language (ZIL) by streamlining MDL, and the Z-language Interpreter Program (ZIP), which complies ZIL into Z-machine instructions in a two-stage process; this made text adventure development platform-independent and enabled porting to different systems simply by writing an appropriate Z-machine interpreter. ZIP consists of a compiler (ZILCH, short for ZIL Compiler Hack) and an assembler (ZAP, the Z-machine Assembler Program).

ZILCH has never been released, although documentation of ZIL still exists, and an open-source replacement &quot;ZILF&quot; has been written. After Mediagenic moved Infocom to California in 1989, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;ZIL ... is functionally dead&quot;, and reported rumors of a &quot;completely new parser that may never be used&quot;.

===Graham Nelson and &quot;Inform&quot;===

In May 1993, Graham Nelson released the first version of his &quot;Inform&quot; compiler, which also generates Z-machine story files as its output, even though the Inform source language is quite different from ZIL.

Inform has become popular in the interactive fiction community. A large proportion of interactive fiction is in the form of Z-machine story files. Demand for the ability to create larger game files led Nelson to specify versions 7 and 
8 of the Z-machine, though version 7 is rarely used. Because of the way addresses are handled, a version 3 story file can be up to 128K in length, a version 5 story can be up to 256K in length, and a version 8 story can be up to 512k in length. Though these sizes may seem small by today&#x27;s computing standards, for text-only adventures, these are large enough for elaborate games.

During the 1990s, Graham Nelson drew up a Z-Machine Standard based on detailed studies of the existing Infocom files. The standard also includes extensions used by his newer versions, as well as links to the &quot;Blorb&quot; resource format used by Infocom, and a &quot;Quetzal&quot; savefile format. In 2006, Nelson expanded Z-machine to the 32-bit Glulx format for Inform 7. The Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation, founded 2016, manages all these standards.

==ZIL (Zork Implementation Language)==

The ZIL is based on MDL from MIT. Here is the definition of Zork I&#x27;s brass lantern in ZIL, with added comments to illustrate the meaning of each line:
&lt;OBJECT LANTERN #_Defines the LANTERN object
 (LOC LIVING-ROOM) #_Defines the initial object location
 (SYNONYM LAMP LANTERN LIGHT) #_Defines synonyms that can be used instead of LANTERN
 (ADJECTIVE BRASS) #_Optional adjective to distinguish this lantern from other lanterns
 (DESC &quot;brass lantern&quot;) #_Short description in inventory list
 (FLAGS TAKEBIT LIGHTBIT) #_What is this object capable of? It can be TAKEN. It provides LIGHT.
 (ACTION LANTERN-F) #_Subroutine which defines special actions with this object
 (FDESC &quot;A battery-powered lantern is on the trophy case.&quot;) #_Description during first encounter
 (LDESC &quot;There is a brass lantern (battery-powered) here.&quot;) #_Later description in other locations
 (SIZE 15)&gt; #_Defines weight to limit inventory capacity
The equivalent object in MDL is defined as:
&lt;OBJECT [&quot;LAMP&quot; &quot;LANTE&quot; &quot;LIGHT&quot;]
 [&quot;BRASS&quot;]
 &quot;lamp&quot;
 &lt;+ ,OVISON ,TAKEBIT ,LIGHTBIT&gt;
 LANTERN
 (ODESC0 &quot;A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.&quot;
 ODESC1 &quot;There is a brass lantern (battery-powered) here.&quot;
 OSIZE 15
 OLINT [0 &gt;])&gt;
A more complex example involving combat, along with its MDL Zork equivalent, is presented in a 2019 blog post by Andrew Plotkin. Notably, the Z-machine has no support for garbage collection and ZIL has no concept of Lisp&#x27;s list system.

==Interpreters==
Interpreters for Z-code files are available on a wide variety of platforms. The Inform website lists links to freely available interpreters for 15 desktop operating systems (including 8-bit microcomputers from the 1980s such as the Apple II, TRS-80, and , and grouping &quot;Unix&quot; and &quot;Windows&quot; as one each), 10 mobile operating systems (including Palm OS and the Game Boy), and four interpreter platforms (Emacs, Java, JavaScript, and Scratch). According to Nelson, it is &quot;possibly the most portable virtual machine ever created&quot;.

Popular interpreters include Nitfol and Frotz. Nitfol makes use of the Glk API, and supports versions 1 through 8 of the Z-machine, including the version 6 graphical Z-machine. Save files are stored in the standard Quetzal save format. Binary files are available for several different operating systems, including the classic Mac OS, Unix-like systems, DOS, and Windows.

Frotz was written in C by Stefan Jokisch in 1995 for DOS. Over time it was ported to other platforms, such as Unix-like systems, RISC OS, and iOS. Sound effects and graphics were supported to varying degrees. By 2002, development stalled and the program was picked up by David Griffith. The code base was split between virtual machine and user interface portions in such a way that the virtual machine became independent from any user interface. This allowed more variety in porting Frotz. One of the stranger ports is also one of the simplest: an instant messaging bot is wrapped around a version of Frotz with the minimum I/O functionality creating a bot with which one can play most Z-machine games using an instant messaging client.

Another popular client for macOS and other Unix-like systems is Zoom. It supports the same Quetzal save-format, but the packaging of the file-structure is different.

<doc id="34513" wikidata="Q204" url="?curid=34513" title="0">
<text>0 (zero) is a number representing an empty quantity. Adding (or subtracting) 0 to any number leaves that number unchanged; in mathematical terminology, 0 is the additive identity of the integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers, as well as other algebraic structures. Multiplying any number by 0 results in 0, and consequently division by zero has no meaning in arithmetic.

As a numerical digit, 0 plays a crucial role in decimal notation: it indicates that the power of ten corresponding to the place containing a 0 does not contribute to the total. For example, &quot;205&quot; in decimal means two hundreds, no tens, and five ones. The same principle applies in place-value notations that uses a base other than ten, such as binary and hexadecimal. The modern use of 0 in this manner derives from Indian mathematics that was transmitted to Europe via medieval Islamic mathematicians and popularized by Fibonacci. It was independently used by the Maya.

Common names for the number 0 in English include &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;nought&quot;, &quot;naught&quot; (), and &quot;nil&quot;. In contexts where at least one adjacent digit distinguishes it from the letter O, the number is sometimes pronounced as &quot;oh&quot; or &quot;o&quot; (). Informal or slang terms for 0 include &quot;zilch&quot; and &quot;zip&quot;. Historically, &quot;ought&quot;, &quot;aught&quot; (), and &quot;cipher&quot; have also been used.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;zero&quot; came into the English language via French from the Italian , a contraction of the Venetian form of Italian via &quot;ṣafira&quot; or &quot;ṣifr&quot;. In pre-Islamic time the word (Arabic ) had the meaning &quot;empty&quot;. evolved to mean zero when it was used to translate () from India. The first known English use of &quot;zero&quot; was in 1598.

The Italian mathematician Fibonacci (), who grew up in North Africa and is credited with introducing the decimal system to Europe, used the term &quot;zephyrum&quot;. This became in Italian, and was then contracted to in Venetian. The Italian word was already in existence (meaning &quot;west wind&quot; from Latin and Greek ) and may have influenced the spelling when transcribing Arabic .

===Modern usage===
Depending on the context, there may be different words used for the number zero, or the concept of zero. For the simple notion of lacking, the words &quot;nothing&quot; (although this is not accurate) and &quot;none&quot; are often used. The British English words &quot;nought&quot; or &quot;naught&quot;, and &quot;&quot; are also synonymous.

It is often called &quot;oh&quot; in the context of reading out a string of digits, such as telephone numbers, street addresses, credit card numbers, military time, or years. For example, the area code 201 may be pronounced &quot;two oh one&quot;, and the year 1907 is often pronounced &quot;nineteen oh seven&quot;. The presence of other digits, indicating that the string contains only numbers, avoids confusion with the letter O. For this reason, systems that include strings with both letters and numbers (such as Canadian postal codes) may exclude the use of the letter O.

Slang words for zero include &quot;zip&quot;, &quot;zilch&quot;, &quot;nada&quot;, and &quot;scratch&quot;. In the context of sports, &quot;nil&quot; is sometimes used, especially in British English. Several sports have specific words for a score of zero, such as &quot;love&quot; in tennis – from French , &quot;the egg&quot; – and &quot;duck&quot; in cricket, a shortening of &quot;duck&#x27;s egg&quot;. &quot;Goose egg&quot; is another general slang term used for zero.

==History==

===Ancient Near East===

Ancient Egyptian numerals were of base 10. They used hieroglyphs for the digits and were not positional. In one papyrus written around , a scribe recorded daily incomes and expenditures for the pharaoh&#x27;s court, using the &quot;nfr&quot; hieroglyph to indicate cases where the amount of a foodstuff received was exactly equal to the amount disbursed. Egyptologist Alan Gardiner suggested that the &quot;nfr&quot; hieroglyph was being used as a symbol for zero. The same symbol was also used to indicate the base level in drawings of tombs and pyramids, and distances were measured relative to the base line as being above or below this line.

By the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, Babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated base 60 positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a &quot;space&quot; between sexagesimal numerals. In a tablet unearthed at Kish (dating to as early as ), the scribe Bêl-bân-aplu used three hooks as a placeholder in the same Babylonian system. By , a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was repurposed as a placeholder.

The Babylonian positional numeral system differed from the later Hindu–Arabic system in that it did not explicitly specify the magnitude of the leading sexagesimal digit, so that for example the lone digit 1 () might represent any of 1, 60, 3600 = 602, etc., similar to the significand of a floating-point number but without an explicit exponent, and so only distinguished implicitly from context. The zero-like placeholder mark was only ever used in between digits, but never alone or at the end of a number.

===Pre-Columbian Americas===

The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar developed in south-central Mexico and Central America required the use of zero as a placeholder within its vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. Many different glyphs, including the partial quatrefoil were used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the earliest of which (on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas) has a date of 36 BC.

Since the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the Maya homeland, it is generally believed that the use of zero in the Americas predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs. Many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland, although the Olmec civilization ended by the , several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates.

Although zero became an integral part of Maya numerals, with a different, empty tortoise-like &quot;shell shape&quot; used for many depictions of the &quot;zero&quot; numeral, it is assumed not to have influenced Old World numeral systems.

Quipu, a knotted cord device, used in the Inca Empire and its predecessor societies in the Andean region to record accounting and other digital data, is encoded in a base ten positional system. Zero is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.

===Classical antiquity===
The ancient Greeks had no symbol for zero (μηδέν, pronounced &#x27;midén&#x27;), and did not use a digit placeholder for it. According to mathematician Charles Seife, the ancient Greeks did begin to adopt the Babylonian placeholder zero for their work in astronomy after 500 BC, representing it with the lowercase Greek letter &quot;ό&quot; (&quot;όμικρον&quot;: omicron). However, after using the Babylonian placeholder zero for astronomical calculations they would typically convert the numbers back into Greek numerals. Greeks seemed to have a philosophical opposition to using zero as a number. Other scholars give the Greek partial adoption of the Babylonian zero a later date, with neuroscientist Andreas Nieder giving a date of after 400 BC and mathematician Robert Kaplan dating it after the conquests of Alexander.

Greeks seemed unsure about the status of zero as a number. Some of them asked themselves, &quot;How can not being be?&quot;, leading to philosophical and, by the medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of zero and the vacuum. The paradoxes of Zeno of Elea depend in large part on the uncertain interpretation of zero.
By AD150, Ptolemy, influenced by Hipparchus and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for zero () in his work on mathematical astronomy called the &quot;Syntaxis Mathematica&quot;, also known as the &quot;Almagest&quot;. This Hellenistic zero was perhaps the earliest documented use of a numeral representing zero in the Old World. Ptolemy used it many times in his &quot;Almagest&quot; (VI.8) for the magnitude of solar and lunar eclipses. It represented the value of both digits and minutes of immersion at first and last contact. Digits varied continuously from 0 to 12 to 0 as the Moon passed over the Sun (a triangular pulse), where twelve digits was the angular diameter of the Sun. Minutes of immersion was tabulated from 00 to 3120 to 00, where 00 used the symbol as a placeholder in two positions of his sexagesimal positional numeral system, while the combination meant a zero angle. Minutes of immersion was also a continuous function (a triangular pulse with convex sides), where d was the digit function and 3120 was the sum of the radii of the Sun&#x27;s and Moon&#x27;s discs. Ptolemy&#x27;s symbol was a placeholder as well as a number used by two continuous mathematical functions, one within another, so it meant zero, not none. Over time, Ptolemy&#x27;s zero tended to increase in size and lose the overline, sometimes depicted as a large elongated 0-like omicron &quot;Ο&quot; or as omicron with overline &quot;ō&quot; instead of a dot with overline.

The earliest use of zero in the calculation of the Julian Easter occurred before AD311, at the first entry in a table of epacts as preserved in an Ethiopic document for the years 311 to 369, using a Ge&#x27;ez word for &quot;none&quot; (English translation is &quot;0&quot; elsewhere) alongside Ge&#x27;ez numerals (based on Greek numerals), which was translated from an equivalent table published by the Church of Alexandria in Medieval Greek. This use was repeated in 525 in an equivalent table, that was translated via the Latin (&quot;none&quot;) by Dionysius Exiguus, alongside Roman numerals. When division produced zero as a remainder, &quot;nihil&quot;, meaning &quot;nothing&quot;, was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval calculators of Easter. The initial &quot;N&quot; was used as a zero symbol in a table of Roman numerals by Bede—or his colleagues—around AD725.

In most cultures, 0 was identified before the idea of negative things (i.e., quantities less than zero) was accepted.

===China===

The &quot;Sūnzĭ Suànjīng&quot;, of unknown date but estimated to be dated from the 1st to , describe how the Chinese counting rods system enabled one to perform decimal calculations. As noted in the &quot;Xiahou Yang Suanjing&quot; (425–468 AD), to multiply or divide a number by 10, 100, 1000, or 10000, all one needs to do, with rods on the counting board, is to move them forwards, or back, by 1, 2, 3, or 4 places. The rods gave the decimal representation of a number, with an empty space denoting zero. The counting rod system is a positional notation system.

Zero was not treated as a number at that time, but as a &quot;vacant position&quot;. Qín Jiǔsháo&#x27;s 1247 &quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot; is the oldest surviving Chinese mathematical text using a round symbol ‘〇’ for zero. The origin of this symbol is unknown; it may have been produced by modifying a square symbol. Chinese authors had been familiar with the idea of negative numbers by the Han dynasty , as seen in &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;.

===India===

Pingala ( or 2nd century BC), a Sanskrit prosody scholar, used binary sequences, in the form of short and long syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables), to identify the possible valid Sanskrit meters, a notation similar to Morse code. Pingala used the Sanskrit word &quot;śūnya&quot; explicitly to refer to zero.

The concept of zero as a written digit in the decimal place value notation was developed in India. A symbol for zero, a large dot likely to be the precursor of the still-current hollow symbol, is used throughout the Bakhshali manuscript, a practical manual on arithmetic for merchants. In 2017, researchers at the Bodleian Library reported radiocarbon dating results for three samples from the manuscript, indicating that they came from three different centuries: from AD 224–383, AD 680–779, and AD 885–993. It is not known how the birch bark fragments from different centuries forming the manuscript came to be packaged together. If the writing on the oldest birch bark fragments is as old as those fragments, it represents South Asia&#x27;s oldest recorded use of a zero symbol. However, it is possible that the writing dates instead to the time period of the youngest fragments, AD 885–993. The latter dating has been argued to be more consistent with the sophisticated use of zero within the document, as portions of it appear to show zero being employed as a number in its own right, rather than only as a positional placeholder.

The &quot;Lokavibhāga&quot;, a Jain text on cosmology surviving in a medieval Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit original, which is internally dated to AD 458 (Saka era 380), uses a decimal place-value system, including a zero. In this text, &quot;śūnya&quot; (&quot;void, empty&quot;) is also used to refer to zero.

The &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; ( 499), states &quot;sthānāt sthānaṁ daśaguṇaṁ syāt&quot; &quot;from place to place each is ten times the preceding&quot;.

Rules governing the use of zero appeared in Brahmagupta&#x27;s &quot;Brahmasputha Siddhanta&quot; (7th century), which states the sum of zero with itself as zero, and incorrectly describes division by zero in the following way:

A positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero.

====Epigraphy====
A black dot is used as a decimal placeholder in the Bakhshali manuscript, portions of which date from AD 224–993.

There are numerous copper plate inscriptions, with the same small in them, some of them possibly dated to the 6th century, but their date or authenticity may be open to doubt.

A stone tablet found in the ruins of a temple near Sambor on the Mekong, Kratié Province, Cambodia, includes the inscription of &quot;605&quot; in Khmer numerals (a set of numeral glyphs for the Hindu–Arabic numeral system). The number is the year of the inscription in the Saka era, corresponding to a date of AD 683.

The first known use of special glyphs for the decimal digits that includes the indubitable appearance of a symbol for the digit zero, a small circle, appears on a stone inscription found at the Chaturbhuj Temple, Gwalior, in India, dated AD 876.

===Middle Ages===
====Transmission to Islamic culture====

The Arabic-language inheritance of science was largely Greek, followed by Hindu influences. In 773, at Al-Mansur&#x27;s behest, translations were made of many ancient treatises including Greek, Roman, Indian, and others.

In AD 813, astronomical tables were prepared by a Persian mathematician, Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, using Hindu numerals; and about 825, he published a book synthesizing Greek and Hindu knowledge and also contained his own contribution to mathematics including an explanation of the use of zero. This book was later translated into Latin in the 12th century under the title &quot;Algoritmi de numero Indorum&quot;. This title means &quot;al-Khwarizmi on the Numerals of the Indians&quot;. The word &quot;Algoritmi&quot; was the translator&#x27;s Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s name, and the word &quot;Algorithm&quot; or &quot;Algorism&quot; started to acquire a meaning of any arithmetic based on decimals.

Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Khwarizmi, in 976, stated that if no number appears in the place of tens in a calculation, a little circle should be used &quot;to keep the rows&quot;. This circle was called &quot;ṣifr&quot;.

====Transmission to Europe====
The Hindu–Arabic numeral system (base 10) reached Western Europe in the 11th century, via Al-Andalus, through Spanish Muslims, the Moors, together with knowledge of classical astronomy and instruments like the astrolabe. Gerbert of Aurillac is credited with reintroducing the lost teachings into Catholic Europe. For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as &quot;Arabic numerals&quot;. The Italian mathematician Fibonacci or Leonardo of Pisa was instrumental in bringing the system into European mathematics in 1202, stating:

After my father&#x27;s appointment by his homeland as state official in the customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed in the study of calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus []. Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid&#x27;s geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.

From the 13th century, manuals on calculation (adding, multiplying, extracting roots, etc.) became common in Europe where they were called after the Persian mathematician al-Khwārizmī. One popular manual was written by Johannes de Sacrobosco in the early 1200s and was one of the earliest scientific books to be printed, in 1488. The practice of calculating on paper using Hindu–Arabic numerals only gradually displaced calculation by abacus and recording with Roman numerals. In the 16th century, Hindu–Arabic numerals became the predominant numerals used in Europe.

==Symbols and representations==

Today, the numerical digit 0 is usually written as a circle or ellipse. Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter O more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0. Typewriters originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0. The distinction came into prominence on modern character displays.

A slashed zero (formula_1) is often used to distinguish the number from the letter (mostly in computing, navigation and in the military, for example). The digit 0 with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 displays and has continued with some modern computer typefaces such as Andalé Mono, and in some airline reservation systems. One variation uses a short vertical bar instead of the dot. Some fonts designed for use with computers made the &quot;0&quot; character more squared at the edges, like a rectangle, and the &quot;O&quot; character more rounded. A further distinction is made in falsification-hindering typeface as used on German car number plates by slitting open the digit 0 on the upper right side. In some systems either the letter O or the numeral 0, or both, are excluded from use, to avoid confusion.
==Mathematics==
The concept of zero plays multiple roles in mathematics: as a digit, it is an important part of positional notation for representing numbers, while it also plays an important role as a number in its own right in many algebraic settings.

=== As a digit ===
In positional number systems (such as the usual decimal notation for representing numbers), the digit 0 plays the role of a placeholder, indicating that certain powers of the base do not contribute. For example, the decimal number 205 is the sum of two hundreds and five ones, with the 0 digit indicating that no tens are added. The digit plays the same role in decimal fractions and in the decimal representation of other real numbers (indicating whether any tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc., are present) and in bases other than 10 (for example, in binary, where it indicates which powers of 2 are omitted).

===Elementary algebra===

The number 0 is the smallest nonnegative integer, and the largest nonpositive integer. The natural number following 0 is 1 and no natural number precedes 0. The number 0 may or may not be considered a natural number, but it is an integer, and hence a rational number and a real number. All rational numbers are algebraic numbers, including 0. When the real numbers are extended to form the complex numbers, 0 becomes the origin of the complex plane.

The number 0 can be regarded as neither positive nor negative or, alternatively, both positive and negative and is usually displayed as the central number in a number line. Zero is even (that is, a multiple of 2), and is also an integer multiple of any other integer, rational, or real number. It is neither a prime number nor a composite number: it is not prime because prime numbers are greater than 1 by definition, and it is not composite because it cannot be expressed as the product of two smaller natural numbers. (However, the singleton set {0} is a prime ideal in the ring of the integers.)

The following are some basic rules for dealing with the number 0. These rules apply for any real or complex number &quot;x&quot;, unless otherwise stated.
* Addition: &quot;x&quot; + 0 = 0 + &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;. That is, 0 is an identity element (or neutral element) with respect to addition.
* Subtraction: &quot;x&quot; − 0 = &quot;x&quot; and 0 − &quot;x&quot; = −&quot;x&quot;.
* Multiplication: &quot;x&quot; · 0 = 0 · &quot;x&quot; = 0.
* Division: = 0, for nonzero &quot;x&quot;. But  is undefined, because 0 has no multiplicative inverse (no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1), a consequence of the previous rule.
* Exponentiation: &quot;x&quot;0 = = 1, except that the case &quot;x&quot; = 0 is considered undefined in some contexts. For all positive real &quot;x&quot;, .

The expression , which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form as a result of applying the lim operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is a so-called &quot;indeterminate form&quot;. That does not mean that the limit sought is necessarily undefined; rather, it means that the limit of , if it exists, must be found by another method, such as l&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule.

The sum of 0 numbers (the &quot;empty sum&quot;) is 0, and the product of 0 numbers (the &quot;empty product&quot;) is 1. The factorial 0! evaluates to 1, as a special case of the empty product.

===Other uses in mathematics===
The role of 0 as the smallest counting number can be generalized or extended in various ways. In set theory, 0 is the cardinality of the empty set (notated as &quot;{ }&quot;, &quot;formula_2&quot;, or &quot;∅&quot;): if one does not have any apples, then one has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is &quot;defined&quot; to be the empty set. When this is done, the empty set is the von Neumann cardinal assignment for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. The cardinality function, applied to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.

Also in set theory, 0 is the lowest ordinal number, corresponding to the empty set viewed as a well-ordered set. In order theory (and especially its subfield lattice theory), 0 may denote the least element of a lattice or other partially ordered set.

The role of 0 as additive identity generalizes beyond elementary algebra. In abstract algebra, 0 is commonly used to denote a zero element, which is the identity element for addition (if defined on the structure under consideration) and an absorbing element for multiplication (if defined). (Such elements may also be called zero elements.) Examples include identity elements of additive groups and vector spaces. Another example is the zero function (or zero map) on a domain . This is the constant function with 0 as its only possible output value, that is, it is the function defined by for all in . As a function from the real numbers to the real numbers, the zero function is the only function that is both even and odd.

The number 0 is also used in several other ways within various branches of mathematics:
* A &quot;zero of a function&quot; &quot;f&quot; is a point &quot;x&quot; in the domain of the function such that .
* In propositional logic, 0 may be used to denote the truth value false.
* In probability theory, 0 is the smallest allowed value for the probability of any event.
* Category theory introduces the idea of a zero object, often denoted 0, and the related concept of zero morphisms, which generalize the zero function.

==Physics==
The value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an absolute temperature (typically measured in kelvins), zero is the lowest possible value. (Negative temperatures can be defined for some physical systems, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder.) This is in contrast to temperatures on the Celsius scale, for example, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. Measuring sound intensity in decibels or phons, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In physics, the zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy of the ground state of the system.

==Computer science==
Modern computers store information in binary, that is, using an &quot;alphabet&quot; that contains only two symbols, usually chosen to be &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. Binary coding is convenient for digital electronics, where &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; can stand for the absence or presence of electrical current in a wire. Computer programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than the binary instructions that are directly executed by the central processing unit. 0 plays various important roles in high-level languages. For example, a Boolean variable stores a value that is either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false,&quot; and 0 is often the numerical representation of &quot;false.&quot;

0 also plays a role in array indexing. The most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one, and this is the practice in early classic programming languages such as Fortran and COBOL. However, in the late 1950s LISP introduced zero-based numbering for arrays while Algol 58 introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. For example, the elements of an array are numbered starting from 0 in C, so that for an array of &quot;n&quot; items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to .

There can be confusion between 0- and 1-based indexing; for example, Java&#x27;s JDBC indexes parameters from 1 although Java itself uses 0-based indexing.

In C, a byte containing the value 0 serves to indicate where a string of characters ends. Also, 0 is a standard way to refer to a null pointer in code.

In databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value. It is then said to have a null value. For numeric fields it is not the value zero. For text fields this is not blank nor the empty string. The presence of null values leads to three-valued logic. No longer is a condition either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, but it can be &quot;undetermined&quot;. Any computation including a null value delivers a null result.

In mathematics, there is no &quot;positive zero&quot; or &quot;negative zero&quot; distinct from zero; both −0 and +0 represent exactly the same number. However, in some computer hardware signed number representations, zero has two distinct representations, a positive one grouped with the positive numbers and a negative one grouped with the negatives. This kind of dual representation is known as signed zero, with the latter form sometimes called negative zero. These representations include the signed magnitude and ones&#x27; complement binary integer representations (but not the two&#x27;s complement binary form used in most modern computers), and most floating-point number representations (such as IEEE 754 and IBM S/390 floating-point formats).

An epoch, in computing terminology, is the date and time associated with a zero timestamp. The Unix epoch begins the midnight before the first of January 1970. The Classic Mac OS epoch and Palm OS epoch begin the midnight before the first of January 1904.

Many APIs and operating systems that require applications to return an integer value as an exit status typically use zero to indicate success and non-zero values to indicate specific error or warning conditions.

Programmers often use a slashed zero to avoid confusion with the letter &quot;O&quot;.

== Other fields ==
===Biology===
In comparative zoology and cognitive science, recognition that some animals display awareness of the concept of zero leads to the conclusion that the capability for numerical abstraction arose early in the evolution of species.

===Dating systems===

In the BC calendar era, the year 1BC is the first year before AD1; there is not a year zero. By contrast, in astronomical year numbering, the year 1BC is numbered 0, the year 2BC is numbered −1, and so forth.

<text>Żarnowiec is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Krokowa, within Puck County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies close to Żarnowieckie Lake, approximately west of Krokowa, north-west of Puck, and north-west of the regional capital Gdańsk. In 2005 the village had a population of 861.

Żarnowiec was the location for the first Polish nuclear power plant (Żarnowiec Nuclear Power Plant), but construction was stopped in 1990 due to protests of the local population and lack of funds. Recently, the construction plans are being reconsidered.

== History ==

The earliest evidence of settlement in the region dates from the 8th century BC: the inhabitants were apparently linked with the Lusatian and East Pomeranian cultures. There was a settlement near the Żarnowiec lake from the seventh to the tenth century AD. A village known alternately as &quot;Sarnkow&quot;, &quot;Sarnowitz&quot;, &quot;Sarnowicz&quot; or &quot;Czarnowicz&quot; is first mentioned in sources dating from the thirteenth century, when it was inhabited by the Kashubians.

In 1215, Żarnowiec belonged to the Cistercian order based in Oliwa Abbey, which founded a monastery for women there. In the 13th century the local monastery was granted various privileges including ownership of five nearby villages of Kartoszyno, Lubkowo, Odargowo, Świecino, Wierzchucino, what was confirmed by King of Poland Przemysł II in 1295 in Gdańsk. In 1297 the monastery received special economic and juridical privileges from Mściwój II, Duke of Pomerania. It was located within fragmented medieval Poland.

In fourteenth century Żarnowiec, together with all of Pomerelia was annexed from Poland by the Teutonic Order. In 1433, it was raided by a Hussite army. In 1454 the territory was formally re-incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland by King Casimir IV Jagiellon. In 1462, during the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War, the Polish army under Piotr Dunin defeated the Teutonic Knights there (see Battle of Świecino, also known as the Battle of Żarnowiec). After the war Żarnowiec was confirmed as part of Poland, and administratively was included in the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the province of Royal Prussia in the Greater Poland Province.

In 1589 Kuyavian Bishop and royal secretary Hieronim Rozdrażewski granted the monastery to a female order of Benedictines from Chełmno, who founded an abbey there in 1617. In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, the village was taken over by Prussia. The population was subjected to anti-Polish policies, including Germanisation. In 1810 Prussians prohibited the admission of new nuns to the monastery. In 1833 nuns expelled by the Prussians from Toruń settled in the abbey, however in 1834 the abbey was liquidated. During a rally in Żarnowiec in 1911, Prussians arrested a prominent Polish independence activist in Gdańsk Pomerania and local Kashubian activist Antoni Abraham, who was afterwards sentenced to six weeks in prison in Gdańsk for resisting arrest. The village was restored to Poland in 1919, after the country regained independence after World War I. The monastery was refounded in 1946 by a female order of Benedictines, resettled from Vilnius from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union in World War II.

<text>The Z notation is a formal specification language used for describing and modelling computing systems. It is targeted at the clear specification of computer programs and computer-based systems in general.

==History==
In 1974, Jean-Raymond Abrial published &quot;Data Semantics&quot;. He used a notation that would later be taught in the University of Grenoble until the end of the 1980s. While at EDF (Électricité de France), working with Bertrand Meyer, Abrial also worked on developing Z. The Z notation is used in the 1980 book &quot;Méthodes de programmation&quot;.

Z was originally proposed by Abrial in 1977 with the help of Steve Schuman and Bertrand Meyer. It was developed further at the Programming Research Group at Oxford University, where Abrial worked in the early 1980s, having arrived at Oxford in September 1979.

Abrial has said that Z is so named &quot;Because it is the ultimate language!&quot; although the name &quot;Zermelo&quot; is also associated with the Z notation through its use of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.

In 1992, the Z User Group (ZUG) was established to oversee activities concerning the Z notation, especially meetings and conferences.

==Usage and notation==
Z is based on the standard mathematical notation used in axiomatic set theory, lambda calculus, and first-order predicate logic. All expressions in Z notation are typed, thereby avoiding some of the paradoxes of naive set theory. Z contains a standardized catalogue (called the &quot;mathematical toolkit&quot;) of commonly used mathematical functions and predicates, defined using Z itself. It is augmented with Z schema boxes, which can be combined using their own operators, based on standard logical operators, and also by including schemas within other schemas. This allows Z specifications to be built up into large specifications in a convenient manner.

Because Z notation (just like the APL language, long before it) uses many non-ASCII symbols, the specification includes suggestions for rendering the Z notation symbols in ASCII and in LaTeX. There are also Unicode encodings for all standard Z symbols.

==Standards==
ISO completed a Z standardization effort in 2002. This standard and a technical corrigendum are available from ISO free:
* the standard is publicly available from the ISO ITTF site free of charge and, separately, available for purchase from the ISO site;
* the technical corrigendum is available from the ISO site free of charge.

==Award==
In 1992, Oxford University Computing Laboratory and IBM were jointly awarded The Queen&#x27;s Award for Technological Achievement &quot;for the development of ... the Z notation, and its application in the IBM Customer Information Control System (CICS) product.&quot;

<text>In chemistry, a zwitterion ( ; ), also called an inner salt or dipolar ion, is a molecule that contains an equal number of positively and negatively charged functional groups.
1,2-dipolar compounds, such as ylides, are sometimes excluded from the definition.

Some zwitterions, such as amino acid zwitterions, are in chemical equilibrium with an uncharged &quot;parent&quot; molecule. Betaines are zwitterions that cannot isomerize to an all-neutral form, such as when the positive charge is located on a quaternary ammonium group. Similarly, a molecule containing a phosphonium group and a carboxylate group cannot isomerize.

==Amino acids==
Tautomerism of amino acids follows this stoichiometry:
The ratio of the concentrations of the two species in solution is independent of pH.

It has been suggested, on the basis of theoretical analysis, that the zwitterion is stabilized in aqueous solution by hydrogen bonding with solvent water molecules. Analysis of neutron diffraction data for glycine showed that it was in the zwitterionic form in the solid state and confirmed the presence of hydrogen bonds. Theoretical calculations have been used to show that zwitterions may also be present in the gas phase for some cases different from the simple carboxylic acid-to-amine transfer. 

The p&quot;K&quot;a values for deprotonation of the common amino acids span the approximate range . This is also consistent with the zwitterion being the predominant isomer that is present in an aqueous solution. For comparison, the simple carboxylic acid propionic acid () has a p&quot;K&quot;a value of 4.88.

==Other compounds==

Sulfamic acid crystallizes in the zwitterion form.

In crystals of anthranilic acid there are two molecules in the unit cell. One molecule is in the zwitterion form, the other is not.

In the solid state, H4EDTA is a zwitterion with two protons having been transferred from carboxylic acid groups to the nitrogen atoms.

In psilocybin, the proton on the dimethyl amino group is labile and may jump to the phosphate group to form a compound which is not a zwitterion.

==Theoretical studies==

Insight to the equilibrium in solution may be gained from the results of theoretical calculations. For example, pyridoxal phosphate, a form of vitamin B6, in aqueous solution is predicted to have an equilibrium favoring a tautomeric form in which a proton is transferred from the phenolic -OH group to the nitrogen atom.

Because tautomers are different compounds, they sometimes have different enough structures that they can be detected independently in their mixture. This allows experimental analysis of the equilibrium.

==Betaines and similar compounds==
The compound trimethylglycine, which was isolated from sugar beet, was named as &quot;betaine&quot;. Later, other compounds were discovered that contain the same structural motif, a quaternary nitrogen atom with a carboxylate group attached to it via a –CH2– link. At the present time, all compounds whose structure includes this motif are known as betaines. Betaines do not isomerize because the chemical groups attached to the nitrogen atom are not labile. These compounds may be classed as permanent zwitterions, as isomerisation to a molecule with no electrical charges does not occur, or is very slow.
Other examples of permanent zwitterions include phosphatidylcholines, which also contain a quaternary nitrogen atom, but with a negatively-charged phosphate group in place of a carboxylate group; sulfobetaines, which contain a quaternary nitrogen atom and a negatively charged sulfonate group; and pulmonary surfactants such as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Lauramidopropyl betaine is the major component of cocamidopropyl betaine.

==Conjugated zwitterions==
Strongly polarized conjugated compounds (conjugated zwitterions) are typically very reactive, share diradical character, activate strong bonds and small molecules, and serve as transient intermediates in catalysis. Donor-acceptor entities are of vast use in photochemistry (photoinduced electron transfer), organic electronics, switching and sensing.

<text>Zhu Shijie (, 1249–1314), courtesy name Hanqing (), pseudonym Songting (), was a Chinese mathematician and writer during the Yuan Dynasty. Zhu was born close to today&#x27;s Beijing. Two of his mathematical works have survived: &quot;Introduction to Computational Studies&quot; ( &quot;Suan hsüeh Ch&#x27;i-mong&quot;) and &quot;Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns&quot;.

==&quot;Suanxue qimeng&quot;==

The &quot;Suanxue qimeng&quot; (), written in 1299, is an elementary textbook on mathematics in three volumes, 20 chapters and 259 problems. This book also showed how to measure two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional solids. The &quot;Introduction&quot; strongly influenced the development of mathematics in Japan. The book was once lost in China, until the Qing dynasty mathematician Luo Shilin bought a Korean printed edition and republished it in Yangzhou.

==&quot;Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns&quot;==

Zhu&#x27;s second book, &quot;Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns&quot; (1303) is his most important work, advancing Chinese algebra. The first four of the 288 solved problems illustrate his method of the four unknowns. He shows how to convert a problem stated verbally into a system of polynomial equations (up to 14th order), by using up to four unknowns: 天 Heaven, 地 Earth, 人 Man, 物 Matter, and then how to reduce the system to a single polynomial equation in one unknown by successive elimination of unknowns. He then solves the high order equation by &quot;Ling long kai fang&quot; method of Southern Song dynasty mathematician Qin Jiushao (from &quot;Shùshū Jiǔzhāng,&quot; “Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections” of 1247). This was more than 570 years before English mathematician William Horner&#x27;s method using synthetic division. Zhu makes use of what is currently known as Pascal&#x27;s triangle, which he refers to as discovered by Jia Xian before 1050. The final equation and one of its solutions is given for each of the 288 problems.

Zhu also found square and cube roots by solving quadratic and cubic equations, and added to the understanding of series and progressions, classifying them according to the coefficients of the Pascal triangle. He also showed how to solve systems of linear equations by reducing the matrix of their coefficients to diagonal form. He moreover applied these methods to algebraic equations, using a version of the resultant. His methods pre-date Blaise Pascal, William Horner, and modern matrix methods by many centuries. The preface of the book describes how Zhu traveled China for 20 years teaching mathematics.

The methods of &quot;Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns&quot; form the foundation for Wu&#x27;s method of characteristic set.

<text>A zoetrope is a pre-film animation device that produces the illusion of motion, by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion. A zoetrope is a cylindrical variant of the phénakisticope, an apparatus suggested after the stroboscopic discs were introduced in 1833. The definitive version of the zoetrope, with replaceable film picture film strips, was introduced as a toy by Milton Bradley in 1866 and became very successful.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;zoetrope&quot; was composed from the Greek root words ζωή &quot;zoe&quot;, &quot;life&quot; and τρόπος &quot;tropos&quot;, &quot;turning&quot; as a translation of &quot;wheel of life&quot;.
The term &quot;soetrope&quot; was coined by inventor William E. Lincoln.

==Technology==
The zoetrope consists of a cylinder with cuts vertically in the sides. On the inner surface of the cylinder is a band with images from a set of sequenced pictures. As the cylinder spins, the user looks through the cuts at the pictures across. The scanning of the slits keeps the pictures from simply blurring together, and the user sees a rapid succession of images, producing the illusion of motion. From the late 19th century, devices working on similar principles have been developed, named analogously as linear zoetropes and 3D zoetropes, with traditional zoetropes referred to as &quot;cylindrical zoetropes&quot; if distinction is needed.
The zoetrope works on the same principle as its predecessor, the phenakistoscope, but is more convenient and allows the animation to be viewed by several people at the same time. Instead of being radially arrayed on a disc, the sequence of pictures depicting phases of motion is on a paper strip. For viewing, this is placed against the inner surface of the lower part of an open-topped metal drum, the upper part of which is provided with a vertical viewing slit across from each picture. The drum, on a spindle base, is spun. The faster the drum is spun, the smoother the animation appears.

==Earlier rotating devices with images==
An earthenware bowl from Iran, over 5000 years old, could be considered a predecessor of the zoetrope. This bowl is decorated in a series of images portraying a goat jumping toward a tree and eating its leaves. Though the images are sequential and seem evenly distributed around the bowl, to have the images appear as an animation the bowl would have to rotate quite fast and steadily while a stroboscopic effect would somehow have to be generated. As such, it remains very uncertain if the artist who created the bowl actually intended to create an animation.

According to a 4th-century Chinese historical text, the 1st-century BC Chinese mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan created a lamp with a circular band with images of birds and animals that moved &quot;quite naturally&quot; when the heat of the lamp caused the band to rotate. However, it is unclear whether this really created the illusion of motion or whether the account was an interpretation of the spatial movement of the pictures of animals. Possibly the same device was referred to as &quot;umbrella lamp&quot; and mentioned as &quot;a variety of zoetrope&quot; which &quot;may well have originated in China&quot; by historian of Chinese technology Joseph Needham. It had pictures painted on thin panes of paper or mica on the sides of a light cylindrical canopy bearing vanes at the top. When placed over a lamp it would give an impression of movement of animals or men. Needham mentions several other descriptions of figures moving after the lighting of a candle or lamp, but some of these have a semi-fabulous context or can be compared to heat operated carousel toys. It is possible that all these early Chinese examples were actually the same as, or very similar to, the &quot;trotting horse lamp&quot; [走馬燈] known in China since before 1000 AD. This is a lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes or painted figures attached to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The moving silhouettes are projected on the thin paper sides of the lantern. Some versions added extra motion with jointed heads, feet or hands of figures triggered by a transversely connected iron wire. None of these lamps are known to have featured sequential substitution of images depicting motion and thus don&#x27;t display animation in the way that the zoetrope does.
John Bate described a simple device in his 1634 book &quot;The Mysteries of Nature and Art&quot;. It consisted of &quot;a light Card, with severall images set upon it&quot;, fastened on the four spokes of a wheel, which was turned around by heat inside a glass or horn cylinder, &quot;ſo that you would think the immages to bee living creatures by their motion&quot;. The description seems rather close to a simple four-phase animation device depicted and described in Henry V. Hopwood&#x27;s 1899 book &quot;Living Pictures&quot; (see picture). Hopwood gave no name, date or any additional information for this toy that rotated when blown upon. A similar device inside a small zoetrope drum with four slits, was marketed around 1900 by a Parisian company as &quot;L&#x27;Animateur&quot; (or &quot;The Animator&quot;). However, Bate&#x27;s device as it is seen in the accompanying illustration seems not to have actually animated the images, but rather to have moved the images around spatially.

==Invention==
===Simon Stampfer (1833)===
Simon Stampfer, one of the inventors of the phenakistiscope animation disc (or &quot;stroboscopic discs&quot; as he called them), suggested in July 1833 in a pamphlet that the sequence of images for the stroboscopic animation could alternatively be placed on a cylinder, or a looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers.

===William Horner (1834)===
After taking notice of Joseph Plateau&#x27;s invention of the phénakisticope (published in London as &quot;phantasmascope&quot;) British mathematician William George Horner thought up a cylindrical variation and published details about its mathematical principles in January 1834. He called his device the &quot;Dædaleum&quot;, as a reference to the Greek myth of Daedalus. Horner&#x27;s revolving drum had viewing slits between the pictures, instead of above as the later zoetrope variations would have. Horner planned to publish the dædaleum with optician King, Jr in Bristol but it &quot;met with some impediment probably in the sketching of the figures&quot;.

===Experimental photographic sequence viewers (1850s–1860s)===

During the next three decades the phénakisticope remained the more common animation device, while relatively few experimental variations followed the idea of Horner&#x27;s dædaleum or Stampfer&#x27;s stroboscopic cylinder. Most of the zoetrope-like devices created between 1833 and 1865 were intended for viewing photographic sequences, often with a stereoscopic effect. These included Johann Nepomuk Czermak&#x27;s Stereophoroskop, about which he published an article in 1855.

On February 27, 1860, Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices. This included a version that used an endless band of pictures running between two spools that was intermittently lit by an electric spark. Desvignes&#x27; &quot;Mimoscope&quot;, received an Honourable Mention &quot;for ingenuity of construction&quot; at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. It could &quot;exhibit drawings, models, single or stereoscopic photographs, so as to animate animal movements, or that of machinery, showing various other illusions.&quot; Desvignes &quot;employed models, insects and other objects, instead of pictures, with perfect success.&quot; The horizontal slits (like in Czermak&#x27;s Stereophoroskop) allowed a much improved view, with both eyes, of the opposite pictures.

===William Ensign Lincoln &amp; Milton Bradley&#x27;s Zoetrope (1865–1867)===

William Ensign Lincoln invented the definitive zoetrope in 1865 when he was about 18 years old and a sophomore at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Lincoln&#x27;s patented version had the viewing slits on a level &quot;above&quot; the pictures, which allowed the use of easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions. On advice of a local bookstore owner, Lincoln sent a model to color lithographers and board game manufacturers Milton Bradley and Co. Some shop owners advertised the zoetrope in American newspapers in December 1866. William E. Lincoln applied for a U.S. patent for his &quot;Zoëtrope&quot; on July 27, 1866 as an assignor to Milton Bradley, and it was granted on April 23, 1867. 
It was also patented in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on June 7, 1867 (application March 6, 1867) under no. 629, by Henry Watson Hallett (as a communication to him by Milton Bradley), and in the Second French Empire by Charles William May (filed May 14, 1867).

Over the years Milton Bradley released at least seven numbered series of twelve zoetrope strips each, as well as a set of twelve strips by Professor Robert Hallowell Richards showing the gradual transformations from one isometric form to another, and one separately available strip showing the progress of the Grecian bend (a woman morphing into a camel). The London Stereoscopic and Photographic Company was licensed as the British publisher and repeated most of the Milton Bradley animations, while adding a set of twelve animations by famous British illustrator George Cruikshank in 1870. French licensee F. Delacour &amp; Bakes produced the &quot;Zootrope, ou cercle magique&quot;, of which newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; ordered 10,000 copies to sell to subscribers at a reduced price.

===James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s improved zoetrope===
In 1868 James Clerk Maxwell had an improved zoetrope constructed. Instead of slits it used concave lenses with a focal length equaling the diameter of the cylinder. The virtual image was thus seen in the centre and appeared much more sharp and steady than in the original zoetrope. Maxwell drew several strips that mostly demonstrated subjects relating to physics, like the vibrations of a harp string or Helmholtz&#x27;s vortex rings threading through each other. An article about the &quot;Zootrope perfectionné&quot; was published in French scientific magazine &quot;Le Cosmos&quot; in 1869, but the device was never marketed. Maxwell&#x27;s original zoetrope and some strips are kept in the collection of the Cavendish Museum in Cambridge.

==Linear zoetropes==
A linear zoetrope consists of an opaque linear screen with thin vertical slits in it. Behind each slit is an image, often illuminated. A motion picture is seen by moving past the display.

Linear zoetropes have several differences compared to cylindrical zoetropes due to their different geometries. Linear zoetropes can have arbitrarily long animations and can cause images to appear wider than their actual sizes.

===Subway zoetropes===

====Japan====

Linear zoetrope-like advertising was in use in Japan in the early 1990s, for example on the line between the Narita airport and central Tokyo.

====United States====
In September 1980, independent filmmaker Bill Brand installed a type of linear zoetrope he called the &quot;Masstransiscope&quot; in an unused subway platform at the former Myrtle Avenue station on the New York City Subway. It consists of a wall with 228 slits; behind each slit is a hand-painted panel, and riders of passing trains see a motion picture. After falling into a state of disrepair, the &quot;Masstransiscope&quot; was restored in late 2008. Since then, a variety of artists and advertisers have begun to use subway tunnel walls to produce a zoetrope effect when viewed from moving trains.

Joshua Spodek, as an astrophysics graduate student, conceived of and led the development of a class of linear zoetropes that saw the zoetrope&#x27;s first commercial success in over a century. A display of his design debuted in September 2001 in the Atlanta subway system tunnel and showed an advertisement to riders moving past. The display is internally lit and nearly long, with an animation lasting around 20 seconds. His design soon appeared, both commercially and artistically, in subway systems around North America, Asia, and Europe.

In April 2006, the Washington Metro installed advertisement zoetropes between the Metro Center and Gallery Place subway stations. A similar advertisement was installed on the PATH train in New Jersey, between the World Trade Center and Exchange Place stations.

At around the same time, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system installed a zoetrope-type advertisement between the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations which could be viewed by commuters traveling in either direction. The BART ads are still visible, though they are changed infrequently: a particular ad may remain up for several months before being replaced.

The New York City Subway hosted two digital linear zoetropes through its Arts for Transit program. One, &quot;Bryant Park in Motion&quot;, was installed in 2010 at the Bryant Park subway station, and was created by Spodek and students at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of Arts&#x27; Interactive Telecommunications Program. The other, &quot;Union Square in Motion&quot;, was installed in 2011 by Spodek and students and alumni from Parsons the New School for Design&#x27;s Art, Media, and Technology program in the Union Square station.

====Other places====
The Kyiv Metro (in Kyiv, Ukraine) also featured an advertisement about 2008 for Life mobile telephone carrier in one of its subway tunnels that featured the zoetrope effect. It was quickly taken down.

In Mexico City, Mexico, an advertisement for the Honda Civic featuring a zoetrope effect was placed in one of the Line 2 tunnels.

The Zurich Airport Skymetro features a linear zoetrope.

==3D zoetropes==

3D zoetropes apply the same principle to three-dimensional models, as already practiced by Czermak (1855) and Desvignes (1860) in predecessors of the zoetrope. In 1887, Étienne-Jules Marey used a large zoetrope to animate a series of plaster models based on his chronophotographs of birds in flight. Modern equivalents normally dispense with the slitted drum and instead use a rapidly flashing strobe light to illuminate the models, producing much clearer and sharper distortion-free results. The models are mounted on a rotating base and the light flashes on and off within an extremely small fraction of a second as each successive model passes the same spot. The stroboscopic effect makes each seem to be a single animated object. By allowing the rotation speed to be slightly out of synchronization with the strobe, the animated objects can be made to appear to also move slowly forwards or backwards, according to how much faster or slower each rotation is than the corresponding series of strobe flashes.

===Ghibli===
The Ghibli Museum in Tokyo, Japan hosts a 3D zoetrope featuring characters from the animated movie &quot;My Neighbour Totoro.&quot; The zoetrope is accompanied by an explanatory display, and is part of an exhibit explaining the principles of animation and historical devices.

===&quot;Toy Story&quot;===

Pixar created a 3D zoetrope inspired by Ghibli&#x27;s for its touring exhibition, which first showed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and features characters from &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. Two more 3D Zoetropes were created by Pixar, both featuring 360-degree viewing. One was installed at Disney California Adventure, sister park to Disneyland, but has since been moved to The Walt Disney Studios Lot in Burbank, CA. The other was installed at Hong Kong Disneyland from 2010 until 2017, and is now shown in Disneyland Paris as of late 2019. The original &quot;Toy Story&quot; &quot;Zoetrope&quot; still travels worldwide and has been shown in 34 national museums and art galleries in 18 countries since 2005.

===&quot;All Things Fall&quot;===
&quot;All Things Fall&quot; is a 3D printed zoetrope, created by British artist Mat Collishaw. It is inspired by a painting by Ippolito Scarsella of &quot;The Massacre of Innocents&quot;. The work was presented during the solo exhibition &quot;Black Mirror&quot; at Galleria Borghese in Rome. It is made of steel, aluminium, plaster, resin, lit by LED lights and powered by an electric motor. Of his work, Collishaw says: &quot;The zoetrope literally repeats characters to create an overwhelming orgy of violence that is simultaneously appalling and compelling.&quot; Each model figure was 3D printed with a fused deposition modeling technique in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene.

===Peter Hudson===
Over the period 2002–2016, Peter Hudson and the makers at Spin Art, LLC, have created multiple interactive 3D stroboscopic zoetrope art installations. This began with &quot;Sisyphish&quot; (2002), a human powered zoetrope that used strobe light to animate human figures swimming on a large rotating disk. &quot;Sisyphish&quot;, sometimes called &quot;The Playa Swimmers&quot;, was originally unveiled at the arts and culture event, &quot;Burning Man&quot;, in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada.

Peter has since created stroboscopic zoetropes from 2004 to present including: &quot;Deeper&quot; (2004), &quot;Homouroboros&quot; (2007), &quot;Tantalus&quot; (2008), and &quot;Charon&quot;, which toured Europe and the United Kingdom in summer of 2012. The &quot;Charon&quot; zoetrope is built to resemble and rotate in the same kinetic fashion as a ferris wheel, stands at 32 feet high, weighs 8 tons and features twenty rowing skeleton figures representing the mythological character, Charon, who carries souls of the newly deceased across the river Styx.
Hudson&#x27;s most recent zoetrope creation is entitled &quot;Eternal Return&quot;, took two years to build, and was unveiled in 2014 in the Black Rock Desert.

Peter Hudson&#x27;s zoetropes are based in San Francisco are exhibited at various festivals and special events in the United States and internationally throughout the year.

===Other examples===
Wick Alexander and Robin Brailsford&#x27;s 2001 4-piece artwork titled &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; consists of 4 sculptural zoetropes at different public locations in Culver City, California.

==Giant Zoetropes==
An 1857 textbook on physics mentioned an early cylindrical stroboscopic installation with moving images that was in diameter and had been exhibited in Frankfurt.

A &quot;Great Zoetrope; or: Wheel of Life&quot;, in circumference, with &quot;life-size figures&quot;, was installed in the Concert Hall of the Crystal Palace in London by permission of the London Stereoscopic and Photographic Company. The programme featured at least four animations based on strips in their catalogue. The huge cylinder was turned around by a gas engine and was operative at least from late 1867 to spring 1868.
In 2008, Artem Limited, a UK visual effects house, built a 10-meter wide, 10-metric ton zoetrope for Sony, called the BRAVIA-drome, to promote Sony&#x27;s motion interpolation technology. It features 64 images of the Brazilian footballer Kaká. This has been declared the largest zoetrope in the world by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

In 2010, the artist Yishay Garbasz created a 3 meter wide zoetrope for the Busan Biennale with images of her naked body one year before to one year after her gender-affirming surgery.

In 2014, Brazilian graffiti-street art duo OSGEMEOS made a large piece called “Untitled (Zoetrope)” featuring their characteristic yellow characters, with an accompanying animation of the zoetrope in motion. It is part of the &quot;OSGEMEOS: Endless Story&quot; exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (2024-2025).

==Successors==
Émile Reynaud&#x27;s 1877 praxinoscope was an improvement on the zoetrope that became popular toward the end of the 19th century. It replaced the zoetrope&#x27;s narrow viewing slits with an inner circle of mirrors that intermittently reflected the images.

Soon after the zoetrope became popular, the flip book was introduced in 1868. With its simplicity and compactness, along with its more tactile qualities, the flip book has stayed relatively popular. A disadvantage of the flip book can be seen in the fact that the animation stops rather quickly, while the zoetrope can display animation as a continuous loop.

Eadward Muybridge published his first chronophotography pictures in 1878. These sequential pictures were soon mounted in zoetropes by several people (including Muybridge himself) and were also published as strips for the zoetrope in the 1880s. This paved the way for the development of cinematography. Muybridge&#x27;s own Zoopraxiscope (1879) was an early moving image projector and one of several inventions made before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895.

In 1895 Auguste and Louis Lumière were developing the Kinora simultaneously with the cinematograph. While cinema proved to be an enormous success, the Kinora became a popular motion picture viewer for home use.

Film, television and video are seen as the prevailing successors of the zoetrope, when regarded as technological steps in the development of motion pictures. In digital media, GIF animation can arguably be seen as the closest contemporary successor of Zoetrope animation, since both usually show looped image sequences.

In 2016, an inside-out variation of the zoetrope was invented and patented with the name Silhouette Zoetrope. The device was invented by the researcher Dr. Christine Veras, and it won third place in the Best Illusion of the Year Contest, paying homage to the classical zoetrope but displaying a unique combination of optical illusions.

A digital successor to the zoetrope was invented in 2023 by Mike Ando. The Andotrope uses smartphones within a slotted cylinder to produce a 360º viewing angle for digital content.

==Contemporary media uses==
Since the late 20th century, zoetropes have seen occasional use for artwork, entertainment, marketing and other media use, notably as linear zoetropes and 3D zoetropes (see above).

Making a zoetrope has also become a relatively common arts and crafts assignment and a means to explain some of the technical and optical principles of film and motion viewing in educational programs.

===In popular culture===
Blue Man Group uses a zoetrope at their shows in Las Vegas and in the Sharp Aquos Theater in Universal Studios (in Orlando, Florida).

The 1999 film &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; uses a man-sized zoetrope chamber as a twisted horror theme.

In 2007, an image of a zoetrope was unveiled as one of BBC Two&#x27;s new idents: a futuristic city with flying cars seen through the shape of the number two.
In 2011, Scott Blake created a &quot;9/11 Zoetrope&quot; allowing viewers to watch a continuous reenactment of United Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.

In 2012 animation studio Sehsucht, Berlin created the opener to the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards. The CGI animation features a 3D zoetrope that shows a story of the American Dream. The animation followed the lives of Roxxy and Seth, who, through social media and popularity reach the height of their success playing at the EMA&#x27;s atop the zoetrope carousel. It was directed by Mate Steinforth and produced by Christina Geller.

In 2013, director Jeff Zwart created a two-minute film, &quot;Forza/Filmspeed&quot;, promoting Forza Motorsport 5. The production placed high resolution still images from the game on panels around Barber Motorsports Park and filmed them from a camera attached to a McLaren MP4-12C sports car.

In the 2016 horror film &quot;The Conjuring 2&quot;, there is the usage of a zoetrope in one of the scenes.

In 2019, the second season of the anime adaptation of ONE&#x27;s manga Mob Psycho 100 features a 3D rendering of a zoetrope in its opening credit sequence.

In 2022, the official music video for Pharrell Williams&#x27;s song &quot;Cash In Cash Out&quot; makes use of a computer-animated 3D zoetrope. The video, directed by Francois Rousselet, took a little over a year to create. It features claymation-like versions of Williams, 21 Savage, and Tyler, the Creator moving through a lavish rotating set, including a jewelry-sporting detached hand playing a piano and a road paved with money.

<doc id="34527" wikidata="Q204079" url="?curid=34527" title="Zodiacal light">
<text>The zodiacal light (also called false dawn when seen before sunrise) is a faint glow of diffuse sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust. Brighter around the Sun, it appears in a particularly dark night sky to extend from the Sun&#x27;s direction in a roughly triangular shape along the zodiac, and appears with less intensity and visibility along the whole ecliptic as the zodiacal band. Zodiacal light spans the entire sky and contributes to the natural light of a clear and moonless night sky. A related phenomenon is &quot;gegenschein&quot; (or &quot;counterglow&quot;), sunlight backscattered from the interplanetary dust, which appears directly opposite to the Sun as a faint but slightly brighter oval glow.

Zodiacal light contributes to the natural light of the sky, though since zodiacal light is very faint, it is often outshone and rendered invisible by moonlight or light pollution.

The interplanetary dust in the Solar System forms a thick, pancake-shaped cloud called the zodiacal cloud which straddles the ecliptic plane. The particle sizes range from 10 to 300 micrometres, implying masses from one nanogram to tens of micrograms.

The &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Helios&quot; spacecraft observations in the 1970s revealed zodiacal light to be scattered by the interplanetary dust cloud in the Solar System.
Analysis of images of impact debris from the &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft shows that the distribution of the dust extends from Earth&#x27;s orbit to the 4:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter at , and suggests that the dust is from Mars. However, no other dedicated dust instrumentation on &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, &quot;Galileo&quot;, &quot;Ulysses&quot;, nor &quot;Cassini&quot; found an indication that Mars is a significant source of dust besides comets and asteroids.

== Viewing ==

In the mid-latitudes, the zodiacal light is best observed in the western sky in the spring after the evening twilight has completely disappeared, or in the eastern sky in the autumn just before the morning twilight appears. The zodiacal light appears as a column, brighter at the horizon and tilted at the angle of the ecliptic. The light scattered from extremely small dust particles is strongly forward scattering, although the zodiacal light actually extends all the way around the sky, hence it is brightest when observing at a small angle with the Sun. This is why it is most clearly visible near sunrise or sunset when the Sun is blocked, but the dust particles nearest the line of sight to the Sun are not. The dust band that causes the zodiacal light is uniform across the whole ecliptic.

The dust further from the ecliptic is almost undetectable except when viewed at a small angle with the Sun. Thus it is possible to see more of the width at small angles toward the Sun, and it appears wider near the horizon, closer to the Sun under the horizon.

== Origin ==

The source of the dust has been long debated. Until recently, it was thought that the dust originated from the tails of active comets and from collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt. Many of our meteor showers have no known active comet parent bodies. Over 85 percent of the dust is attributed to occasional fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets that are nearly dormant. Jupiter-family comets have orbital periods of less than 20 years and are considered dormant when not actively outgassing, but may do so in the future. The first fully dynamical model of the zodiacal cloud demonstrated that only if the dust was released in orbits that approach Jupiter, is it stirred up enough to explain the thickness of the zodiacal dust cloud. The dust in meteoroid streams is much larger, 300 to 10,000 micrometres in diameter, and falls apart into smaller zodiacal dust grains over time.

The Poynting–Robertson effect forces the dust into more circular (but still elongated) orbits, while spiralling slowly into the Sun. Hence a continuous source of new particles is needed to maintain the zodiacal cloud. Cometary dust and dust generated by collisions among the asteroids are believed to be mostly responsible for the maintenance of the dust cloud producing the zodiacal light and the gegenschein.

Particles can be reduced in size by collisions or by space weathering. When ground down to sizes less than 10 micrometres, the grains are removed from the inner Solar System by solar radiation pressure. The dust is then replenished by the infall from comets. Zodiacal dust around nearby stars is called exozodiacal dust; it is a potentially important source of noise in attempts to directly image extrasolar planets. It has been pointed out that this exozodiacal dust, or hot debris disks, can be an indicator of planets, as planets tend to scatter the comets to the inner Solar System.

In 2015, new results from the secondary ion dust spectrometer COSIMA on board the &quot;ESA/Rosetta&quot; orbiter confirmed that the parent bodies of interplanetary dust are most probably Jupiter-family comets such as comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Data from the Juno mission indicate that the dust close to Earth has a local origin in the inner Solar System, best fitting the planet Mars as a source.

== Appearance ==

Zodiacal light is produced by sunlight reflecting off dust particles in the Solar System known as cosmic dust. Consequently, its spectrum is the same as the solar spectrum. The material producing the zodiacal light is located in a lens-shaped volume of space centered on the sun and extending well out beyond the orbit of Earth. This material is known as the interplanetary dust cloud. Since most of the material is located near the plane of the Solar System, the zodiacal light is seen along the ecliptic. The amount of material needed to produce the observed zodiacal light is quite small. If it were in the form of 1 mm particles, each with the same albedo (reflecting power) as the Moon, each particle would be 8 km from its neighbors. The gegenschein may be caused by particles directly opposite the Sun as seen from Earth, which would be in full phase.

According to Nesvorný and Jenniskens, when the dust grains are as small as about 150 micrometres in size, they will hit the Earth at an average speed of 14.5 km/s, many as slowly as 12 km/s. If so, they pointed out, this comet dust can survive entry in partially molten form, accounting for the unusual attributes of the micrometeorites collected in Antarctica, which do not resemble the larger meteorites known to originate from asteroids. In recent years, observations by a variety of spacecraft have shown significant structure in the zodiacal light including dust bands associated with debris from particular asteroid families and several cometary trails.

== Cultural significance ==
According to Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Kosmos&quot;, Mesoamericans were aware of the zodiacal light before 1500. It was perhaps first reported in print by Joshua Childrey in 1661. The phenomenon was investigated by the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1683. According to some sources, he explained it by dust particles around the Sun. Other sources state that it was first explained this way by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, in 1684, whom Cassini advised to study the zodiacal light.

=== Importance to Islam ===
The Islamic prophet Muhammad described zodiacal light in reference to the timing of the five daily prayers, calling it the &quot;false dawn&quot; ( &#x27;). Muslim oral tradition preserves numerous sayings, or hadith, in which Muhammad describes the difference between the light of false dawn, appearing in the sky long after sunset, and the light of the first band of horizontal light at sunrise, the &quot;true dawn&quot; ( &#x27;). According to the vast majority of Muslim scholars, astronomical dawn is considered the true dawn. Practitioners of Islam use Muhammad&#x27;s descriptions of zodiacal light to avoid errors in determining the timing of fasting and daily prayers.

=== Brian May ===
In 2007, Brian May, lead guitarist with the band Queen, completed his thesis, &quot;A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud&quot;, thirty-six years after abandoning it to pursue a career in music. He was able to submit it only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic undertaken during the intervening years. May described the subject as being one that became &quot;trendy&quot; again in the 2000s.

== Other planets ==

Other planets, like Venus or Mercury, have shown to have rings of interplanetary dust in their orbital spaces.

<doc id="34529" wikidata="Q1024590" url="?curid=34529" title="Zamenhof Day">
<text>Zamenhof Day (, Polish: ), also called Esperanto Book Day, is celebrated on 15 December, the birthday of Esperanto creator L. L. Zamenhof. It is the most widely celebrated day in Esperanto culture. On this day, Esperantists hold information sessions and cultural gatherings to promote literature in Esperanto.

The history of celebrating Esperanto on Zamenhof&#x27;s birthday can be traced back to 17 December 1878, when at a birthday party for his 19th birthday he presented to his friends his &quot;Lingwe uniwersala&quot;, the first version of his international language. By 1887, this language had evolved into what is now recognized as Esperanto when he published the &quot;Unua Libro&quot;. 15 December previously used to be also known as Esperanto Day, but that is now celebrated on 26 July, the day &quot;Unua Libro&quot; was published. As of 1927 onwards, 15 December is celebrated within the Esperanto movement as &quot;Esperanto Book Day&quot; as it is customary to purchase a new book on Esperanto on that occasion.

==Zamenhof&#x27;s 150th birth anniversary==
15 December 2009 marked 150 years since Zamenhof&#x27;s birth, and there were several events to celebrate. On this date, the authorities in his home town of Białystok, Poland, opened a new Zamenhof Center, and a symposium honoring Zamenhof was held in New York City, featuring talks by Arika Okrent and Humphrey Tonkin among other professors.

Also on this date, the search engine Google, in 33 national language versions (but not the international English one), bore a special version of their logo (a Doodle) emblazoned with the Esperanto flag in honor of the occasion, which generated, between the 30 biggest Wikipedia languages, 1,750,000 page views on the articles &quot;L. L. Zamenhof&quot;.

<doc id="34533" wikidata="Q9601" url="?curid=34533" title="Zoroastrianism">
<text>Zoroastrianism ( ), also called Mazdayasnā () or Beh-dīn (), is an Iranian religion centred on the Avesta and the teachings of Zarathushtra Spitama, who is more commonly referred to by the name Zoroaster ( ). Among the world&#x27;s oldest organized faiths, its adherents exalt an uncreated, benevolent, and all-wise deity known as Ahura Mazda (), who is hailed as the supreme being of the universe. Opposed to Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu (), who is personified as a destructive spirit and the adversary of all things that are good. As such, the Zoroastrian religion combines a dualistic cosmology of good and evil with an eschatological outlook predicting the ultimate triumph of Ahura Mazda over evil. Opinions vary among scholars as to whether Zoroastrianism is monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, or a combination of all three. Zoroastrianism shaped Iranian culture and history, while scholars differ on whether it significantly influenced ancient Western philosophy and the Abrahamic religions, or gradually reconciled with other religions and traditions, such as Christianity and Islam.

Originating from Zoroaster&#x27;s reforms of the ancient Iranian religion, Zoroastrianism began during the Avestan period (possibly as early as the 2nd millennium BCE), but was first recorded in the mid-6th century BCE. For the following millennium, it was the official religion of successive Iranian polities, beginning with the Achaemenid Empire, which formalized and institutionalized many of its tenets and rituals, and ending with the Sasanian Empire, which revitalized the faith and standardized its teachings. In the 7th century CE, the rise of Islam and the ensuing Muslim conquest of Iran marked the beginning of the decline of Zoroastrianism. The persecution of Zoroastrians by the early Muslims in the nascent Rashidun Caliphate prompted much of the community to migrate to the Indian subcontinent, where they were granted asylum and became the progenitors of today&#x27;s Parsis. Once numbering in the millions, the world&#x27;s total Zoroastrian population is estimated to comprise between 100,000 and 200,000 people as of 2024. Most Zoroastrians reside either in India (50,000–60,000), in Iran (15,000–25,000), or in North America (22,000). The religion is thought to be declining due to restrictions on conversion, strict endogamy, and low birth rates.

The central beliefs and practices of Zoroastrianism are contained in the Avesta, a compendium of sacred texts assembled over several centuries. Its oldest and most central component are the Gathas, purported to be the direct teachings of Zoroaster and his account of conversations with Ahura Mazda. These writings are part of a major section of the &quot;Avesta&quot; called the Yasna, which forms the core of Zoroastrian liturgy. Zoroaster&#x27;s religious philosophy divided the early Iranian gods of Proto-Indo-Iranian paganism into emanations of the natural world—the &quot;ahura&quot; and the &quot;daeva&quot;; the former class consisting of divinities to be revered and the latter class consisting of divinities to be rejected and condemned. Zoroaster proclaimed that Ahura Mazda was the supreme creator and sustaining force of the universe, working in &quot;gētīg&quot; (the visible material realm) and &quot;mēnōg&quot; (the invisible spiritual and mental realm) through the Amesha Spenta, a class of seven divine entities that represent various aspects of the universe and the highest moral good. Emanating from Ahura Mazda is Spenta Mainyu (the Holy or Bountiful Spirit), the source of life and goodness, which is opposed by Angra Mainyu (the Destructive or Opposing Spirit), who is born from &quot;Aka Manah&quot; (evil thought). Angra Mainyu was further developed by Middle Persian literature into Ahriman (), Ahura Mazda&#x27;s direct adversary.

Zoroastrian doctrine holds that, within this cosmic dichotomy, human beings have the choice between &quot;Asha&quot; (truth, cosmic order), the principle of righteousness or &quot;rightness&quot; that is promoted and embodied by Ahura Mazda, and &quot;Druj&quot; (falsehood, deceit), the essential nature of Angra Mainyu that expresses itself as greed, wrath, and envy. Thus, the central moral precepts of the religion are good thoughts (&quot;hwnata&quot;), good words (&quot;hakhta&quot;), and good deeds (&quot;hvarshta&quot;), which are recited in many prayers and ceremonies. Many of the practices and beliefs of ancient Iranian religion can still be seen in Zoroastrianism, such as reverence for nature and its elements, such as water (&quot;aban&quot;). Fire (&quot;atar&quot;) is held by Zoroastrians to be particularly sacred as a symbol of Ahura Mazda himself&quot;,&quot; serving as a focal point of many ceremonies and rituals, and serving as the basis for Zoroastrian places of worship, which are known as fire temples.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Zoroaster&quot; () is a Greek rendering of the Avestan name &quot;Zarathustra&quot;. He is known as &quot;Zartosht&quot; and &quot;Zardosht&quot; in Persian and &quot;Zaratosht&quot; in Gujarati. The Zoroastrian name of the religion is &quot;Mazdayasna&quot;, which combines &quot;Mazda-&quot; with the Avestan word &quot;yasna&quot;, meaning &quot;worship, devotion&quot;. In English, an adherent of the faith is commonly called a Zoroastrian or a Zarathustrian. An older expression still used today is &quot;Behdin&quot;, meaning &quot;of the good religion&quot;, deriving from &quot;beh&quot; &lt; Middle Persian &quot;weh&quot; &#x27;good&#x27; + &quot;din&quot; &lt; Middle Persian &quot;dēn&quot; &lt; Avestan &quot;daēnā&quot;&quot;. In the Zoroastrian liturgy, this term is used as a title for a lay individual who has been formally inducted into the religion in a &quot;Navjote&quot; ceremony, in contrast to the priestly titles of &quot;osta&quot;, &quot;osti&quot;, &quot;ervad&quot; (hirbod), &quot;mobed&quot; and &quot;dastur&quot;.

The first surviving reference to Zoroaster in English scholarship is attributed to Thomas Browne (1605–1682), who briefly refers to Zoroaster in his 1643 &quot;Religio Medici&quot;. The term &quot;Mazdaism&quot; () is an alternative form in English used as well for the faith, taking &quot;Mazda-&quot; from the name Ahura Mazda and adding the suffix &quot;-ism&quot; to suggest a belief system.

== Theology ==

The theological category of Zoroastrianism is hard to define. The reasons are the difficulties in assigning precise dates to the principle texts and the fact that many contain much older material. Furthermore, Zorastrianism shaped only slowly over time and was not complete even by the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia. Polytheistic, monotheistic, and dualistic strands can be identified in the wider Zorastrian tradition, with dualism being the dominant tendency. The major difference to Manichaeism lies in the insistence of good in the creation account.

Some scholars believe Zoroastrianism started as an Indo-Iranian polytheistic religion: according to Yujin Nagasawa, . By contrast, Md. Sayem characterizes Zoroastrianism as being one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world.

Zoroastrians treat Ahura Mazda as the supreme god, but believe in lesser divinities known as Yazatas, who share some similarities with the angels in Abrahamic religions. These yazatas (&quot;good agents&quot;) include Anahita, Sraosha, Mithra, Rashnu, and Tishtrya. Historian Richard Foltz has put forth evidence that Iranians of pre-Islamic era worshipped all these figures; especially the gods Mithra and Anahita. Prods Oktor Skjærvø states Zoroastrianism is henotheistic, and .

Brian Arthur Brown states that this is unclear, because historic texts present a conflicting picture, ranging from Zoroastrianism&#x27;s belief in .

Economist Mario Ferrero suggests that Zoroastrianism transitioned from polytheism to monotheism due to political and economic pressures.

In the 19th century, through contact with Western academics and missionaries, Zoroastrianism experienced a massive theological change that still affects it today. The Rev. John Wilson led various missionary campaigns in India against the Parsi community, disparaging the Parsis for their &quot;dualism&quot; and &quot;polytheism&quot; and as having unnecessary rituals while declaring the Avesta to not be &quot;divinely inspired&quot;. This caused mass dismay in the relatively uneducated Parsi community, which blamed its priests and led to some conversions towards Christianity.

The arrival of the German orientalist and philologist Martin Haug led to a rallied defense of the faith through Haug&#x27;s reinterpretation of the Avesta through Christianized and European orientalist lens. Haug postulated that Zoroastrianism was solely monotheistic with all other divinities reduced to the status of angels while Ahura Mazda became both omnipotent and the source of evil as well as good. Haug&#x27;s thinking was subsequently disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, thus corroborating Haug&#x27;s theory, and the idea became so popular that it is now almost universally accepted as doctrine (though being re-evaluated in modern Zoroastrianism and academia). It has been argued by Almut Hintze that this designation of monotheism is not wholly perfect and that Zoroastrianism instead has its &quot;own form of monotheism&quot; which combines elements of dualism and polytheism. Farhang Mehr asserts that Zoroastrianism is principally monotheistic with some dualistic elements.

Lenorant and Chevallier assert that Zoroastrianism&#x27;s concept of divinity covers both being and mind as immanent entities, describing Zoroastrianism as having a belief in an immanent self-creating universe with consciousness as its special attribute, thereby putting Zoroastrianism in the pantheistic fold sharing its origin with Indian Hinduism.

== Nature of the divine ==
Zoroastrianism contains multiple classes of divine beings, who are typically organised into tiers and spheres of influence.

=== Ahuras ===

The Ahura are a class of divine beings 

==== Ahura Mazda ====

Ahura Mazda, also known as Oromasdes, Ohrmazd, Ormazd, Ormusd, Hoormazd, Harzoo, Hormazd, Hormaz and Hurmz, is the creator deity and the supreme god in Zoroastrianism. Ahura Mazda stands for the dual deity &quot;Mitrāˊ-Váruṇā&quot; of the Hindu holy book known as the Rigveda.

According to scholars, Ahura Mazda is an uncreated, omniscient, omnipotent and benevolent God who has created the spiritual and material existences out of infinite light, and maintains the cosmic law of Asha. He is the first and most invoked spirit in Yasna, and is unrivaled, has no equals and presides over all creation. In Avesta, Ahura Mazda is the only true God, and the representation of goodness, light, and truth. He is in conflict with the evil spirit Angra Mainyu, the representation of evil, darkness, and deceit. Angru Mainyu&#x27;s goal is to tempt humans away from Ahura Mazda. Notably, Angra Mainyu is not a creation of Ahura Mazda but an independent entity. The belief in Ahura Mazda, the &quot;Lord of Wisdom&quot; who is considered an all-encompassing Deity and the only existing one, is the foundation of Zoroastrianism.

==== Ahura Mithra ====
Mitra, also called Mithra, was originally an Indo-Iranian god of Mitra is considered a being worthy of worship and is &quot;characterized by riches&quot;.

=== Yazata ===

The Yazata (Avestan: 𐬫𐬀𐬰𐬀𐬙𐬀) are divine beings worshiped by song and sacrifice in Zoroastrianism, in accordance with the Avesta. The word &#x27;Yazata&#x27; is derived from &#x27;Yazdan&#x27;, the Old Persian word for &#x27;god&#x27;, and literally means &quot;divinity worthy of worship or veneration&quot;. As a concept, it also contains a wide range of other meanings; though generally signifying (or used as an epithet of) a divinity.

The origins of Yazata are varied, with many also being featured as gods in Hinduism, or other Iranian religions. In modern Zoroastrianism, the Yazata are considered holy emanations of the creator, always devoted to him and obey the will of Ahura Mazda. While subject to repression by the Islamic Caliphate, the Yazata were often framed as &quot;angels&quot; to counter accusation of polytheism (&quot;shirk&quot;). According to the Avesta The Yazata assist Ahura Mazda in his battle against the evil spirit, and are hypostases of moral or physical aspects of creation. The yazatas collectively are , who is .

==== Notable Yazata ====
* Ahura Mazda
* Mitra or Mithra
* Anahita – formerly an Iranian water goddess
* Ātar (Fire)
* Rashnu, one of the three judges who pass judgment on the souls of people after death
* Sraosha or Srōsh
* Verethragna – who may be the Vedic god Indra

==== Amesha Spentas ====
Yazatas are further divided into Amesha Spentas, their &quot;ham-kar&quot; or &quot;Collaborators&quot; who are Lower Ranking divinities, and also certain healing plants, primordial creatures, the fravashis of the dead, and certain prayers that are themselves considered holy.

The Amesha Spentas and their &quot;ham-kar&quot; or &quot;collaborator&quot; Yazatas are as follows:
* Vohu Manah + Mah / Geush Urvan / Ram
* Asha Vahishta + Atar / Sraosha / Verethraghna
* Kshatra Vairya + Khwar / Mithra / Asman / Anaghran
* Spenta Armaiti + Ap / Daena / Ashi / Manthra Spenta
* Haurvatat + Tishtriya / Fravashi / Vata
* Ameretat + Rashnu / Arshtat / Zamyad

== Principal beliefs ==
=== Tenets of faith ===

In Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda is the beginning and the end, the creator of everything that can and cannot be seen, the eternal and uncreated, the all-good and source of Asha. In the Gathas, the most sacred texts of Zoroastrianism thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, Zoroaster acknowledged the highest devotion to Ahura Mazda, with worship and adoration also given to Ahura Mazda&#x27;s manifestations (Amesha Spenta) and the other ahuras (Yazata) that support Ahura Mazda.

&quot;Daena&quot; (&quot;din&quot; in modern Persian and meaning &quot;that which is seen&quot;) is representative of the sum of one&#x27;s spiritual conscience and attributes, which through one&#x27;s choice Asha is either strengthened or weakened in the Daena. Traditionally, the (similar to the Hindu sacred utterance &quot;mantra&quot;) prayer formulas, are believed to be of immense power and the vehicles of Asha and creation used to maintain good and fight evil. &quot;Daena&quot; should not be confused with the fundamental principle of &quot;Asha&quot;, believed to be the cosmic order which governs and permeates all existence, and the concept of which governed the life of the ancient Indo-Iranians. For these, &quot;asha&quot; was the course of everything observable—the motion of the planets and astral bodies; the progression of the seasons; and the pattern of daily nomadic herdsman life, governed by regular metronomic events such as sunrise and sunset, and was strengthened through truth-telling and following the Threefold Path.

All physical creation (&quot;getig&quot;) was thus determined to run according to a master plan—inherent to Ahura Mazda—and violations of the order (&quot;druj&quot;) were violations against creation, and thus violations against Ahura Mazda. This concept of &quot;asha&quot; versus the &quot;druj&quot; should not be confused with Western and especially Christian notions of good versus evil, for although both forms of opposition express moral conflict, the &quot;asha&quot; versus &quot;druj&quot; concept is more systemic and less personal, representing, for instance, chaos (that opposes order); or &quot;uncreation&quot;, evident as natural decay (that opposes creation); or more simply &quot;the lie&quot; (that opposes truth and goodness). Moreover, in the role as the one uncreated creator of all, Ahura Mazda is not the creator of &quot;druj&quot;, which is &quot;nothing&quot;, anti-creation, and thus (likewise) uncreated and developed as the antithesis of existence through choice.
In this schema of &quot;asha&quot; versus &quot;druj&quot;, mortal beings (both humans and animals) play a critical role, for they too are created. Here, in their lives, they are active participants in the conflict, and it is their spiritual duty to defend Asha, which is under constant assault and would decay in strength without counter&quot;action&quot;. Throughout the Gathas, Zoroaster emphasizes deeds and actions within society and accordingly extreme asceticism is frowned upon in Zoroastrianism but moderate forms are allowed within.

Humata, Huxta, Huvarshta (Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds), the Threefold Path of Asha, is considered the core maxim of Zoroastrianism especially by modern practitioners. In Zoroastrianism, good transpires for those who do righteous deeds for its own sake, not for the search of reward. Those who do evil are said to be attacked and confused by the druj and are responsible for aligning themselves back to Asha by following this path. There is also a heavy emphasis on spreading happiness, mostly through charity, and respecting the spiritual equality and duty of both men and women.

Central to Zoroastrianism is the emphasis on moral choice, to choose the responsibility and duty for which one is in the mortal world, or to give up this duty and so facilitate the work of &quot;druj&quot;. Similarly, predestination is rejected in Zoroastrian teaching and the absolute free will of all conscious beings is core, with even divine beings having the ability to choose. Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act toward one another. Reward, punishment, happiness, and grief all depend on how individuals live their lives.

In Zoroastrian tradition, life is a temporary state in which a mortal is expected to participate actively in the continuing battle between Asha and Druj. Prior to its incarnation at the birth of the child, the &quot;urvan&quot; (soul) of an individual is still united with its &quot;fravashi&quot; (personal/higher spirit), which has existed since Ahura Mazda created the universe. Prior to the splitting off of the &quot;urvan&quot;, the fravashi participates in the maintenance of creation led by Ahura Mazda. During the life of a given individual, the fravashi acts as a source of inspiration to perform good actions and as a spiritual protector. The fravashis of ancestors cultural, spiritual, and heroic, associated with illustrious bloodlines, are venerated and can be called upon to aid the living.

The religion states that active and ethical participation in life through good deeds formed from good thoughts and good words is necessary to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay. This active participation is a central element in Zoroaster&#x27;s concept of free will, and Zoroastrianism as such rejects extreme forms of asceticism and monasticism but historically has allowed for moderate expressions of these concepts. On the fourth day after death, the urvan is reunited with its fravashi, whereupon the experiences of life in the material world are collected for use in the continuing battle for good in the spiritual world. For the most part, Zoroastrianism does not have a notion of reincarnation; albeit Followers of Ilm-e-Kshnoom in India, among other currently non-traditional opinions, believe in reincarnation and practice vegetarianism.

Zoroastrianism&#x27;s emphasis on the protection and veneration of nature and its elements has led some to proclaim it as the The Avesta and other texts call for the protection of water, earth, fire, and air making it, in effect, an ecological religion: (Avesta: Yasnas 1.19, 3.4, 16.9; Yashts 6.3–4, 10.13). However, this particular assertion is limited to natural forces held as emanations of asha by the fact that early Zoroastrians had a duty to exterminate &quot;evil&quot; species, a dictate no longer followed in modern Zoroastrianism. Although there have been various theological statements supporting vegetarianism in Zoroastrianism&#x27;s history and those who believe that Zoroaster was vegetarian.

Zoroastrianism is not entirely uniform in theological and philosophical thought, especially with historical and modern influences having a significant impact on individual and local beliefs, practices, values, and vocabulary, sometimes merging with tradition and in other cases displacing it. The ultimate purpose in the life of a practicing Zoroastrian is to become an &quot;ashavan&quot; (a master of Asha) and to bring happiness into the world, which contributes to the cosmic battle against evil. The core teachings of Zoroastrianism include:
* Following the threefold path of Asha: &quot;Humata&quot;, &quot;Hūxta&quot;, &quot;Huvarshta&quot; ().
* Practicing charity to keep one&#x27;s soul aligned with Asha and thus with spreading happiness.
* The spiritual equality and duty of men and women alike.
* Being good for the sake of goodness and without the hope of reward (see &quot;Ashem Vohu&quot;).

=== Cosmology ===
==== Cosmogony ====
According to the Zoroastrian creation myth, there is one universal, transcendent, all-good, and uncreated supreme creator deity Ahura Mazda, or the &quot;Wise Lord&quot; (&quot;Ahura&quot; meaning &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;Mazda&quot; meaning &quot;Wisdom&quot; in Avestan). Zoroaster keeps the two attributes separate as two different concepts in most of the Gathas yet sometimes combines them into one form. Zoroaster also proclaims that Ahura Mazda is omniscient but not omnipotent. Ahura Mazda existed in light and goodness above, while Angra Mainyu, (also referred to in later texts as &quot;Ahriman&quot;), the destructive spirit/mentality,
existed in darkness and ignorance below. They have existed independently of each other for all time, and manifest contrary substances. In the Gathas, Ahura Mazda is noted as working through emanations known as the Amesha Spenta and with the help of &quot;other ahuras&quot;. These divine beings called &quot;Amesha Spentas&quot;, support him and are representative and guardians of different aspects of creation and the ideal personality. Ahura Mazda is immanent in humankind and interacts with creation through these bounteous/holy divinities. In addition to these, He is assisted by a league of countless divinities called Yazatas, meaning &quot;worthy of worship.&quot; Each Yazata is generally a hypostasis of a moral or physical aspect of creation. Asha, is the main spiritual force which comes from Ahura Mazda. It is the cosmic order and is the antithesis of chaos, which is evident as &quot;druj&quot;, falsehood and disorder, that comes from Angra Mainyu. The resulting cosmic conflict involves all of creation, mental/spiritual and material, including humanity at its core, which has an active role to play in the conflict. The main representative of Asha in this conflict is Spenta Mainyu, the creative spirit/mentality. Ahura Mazda then created the material and visible world itself in order to ensnare evil. He created the floating, egg-shaped universe in two parts: first the spiritual (&quot;menog&quot;) and 3,000 years later, the physical (&quot;getig&quot;). Ahura Mazda then created Gayomard, the archetypical perfect man, and Gavaevodata, the primordial bovine.

While Ahura Mazda created the universe and humankind, Angra Mainyu, whose very nature is to destroy, miscreated demons, evil &quot;daevas&quot;, and noxious creatures (&quot;khrafstar&quot;) such as snakes, ants, and flies. Angra Mainyu created an opposite, evil being for each good being, except for humans, which he found he could not match. Angra Mainyu invaded the universe through the base of the sky, inflicting Gayomard and the bull with suffering and death. However, the evil forces were trapped in the universe and could not retreat. The dying primordial man and bovine emitted seeds, which were protect by Mah, the Moon. From the bull&#x27;s seed grew all beneficial plants and animals of the world and from the man&#x27;s seed grew a plant whose leaves became the first human couple. Humans thus struggle in a two-fold universe of the material and spiritual trapped and in long combat with evil. The evils of this physical world are not products of an inherent weakness but are the fault of Angra Mainyu&#x27;s assault on creation. This assault turned the perfectly flat, peaceful, and daily illuminated world into a mountainous, violent place that is half night. According to Zoroastrian cosmology, in articulating the Ahuna Vairya formula, Ahura Mazda made the ultimate triumph of good against Angra Mainyu evident. Ahura Mazda will ultimately prevail over the evil Angra Mainyu, at which point reality will undergo a cosmic renovation called Frashokereti and limited time will end. In the final renovation, all of creation—even the souls of the dead that were initially banished to or chose to descend into &quot;darkness&quot;—will be reunited with Ahura Mazda in the Kshatra Vairya (meaning &quot;best dominion&quot;), being resurrected to immortality.

==== Cosmography ====
Zoroastrian cosmography, which refers to the description of the structure of the cosmos in Zoroastrian literature and theology, involves a primary division of the cosmos into heaven and earth. The heaven is composed of three parts: the lower-most part, which is where the fixed stars may be found; the middle part, where the domain of the moon is located, and the upper part, which is the domain of the sun and unreachable by Ahirman. Further above the highest level of the heaven/sky includes regions described as the Endless Lights, as well as the Thrones of Amahraspandān and Ohrmazd. Although this is the basic framework which occurs in Avestan texts, later Zoroastrian literature would elaborate on this picture by further subdividing the lowest part of heaven to achieve a total of six or seven layers. The Earth itself was described as possessing three primary mountains: Mount Hukairiia, whose peak was the focal point of the revolution of the star Sadwēs; Mount Haraitī, whose peak was the focal point of the revolution of the sun and the moon, and the greatest of them all, the Harā Bərəz whose peak was located at the center of the Earth and which was the first in a chain of 2,244 mountains which, together, encircled the Earth. Although the planets are not described in early Zoroastrian sources, they entered Zoroastrian thought in the Middle Persian period: they were demonized and took on the names &quot;Anāhīd&quot; (Pahlavi for Venus), &quot;Tīr&quot; (Mercury), &quot;Wahrām&quot; (Mars), &quot;Ohrmazd&quot; (Jupiter), and &quot;Kēwān&quot; (Saturn).

=== Eschatology ===

Individual judgment at death is at the Chinvat Bridge (&quot;bridge of judgement&quot; or &quot;bridge of choice&quot;), which each human must cross, facing a spiritual judgment, though modern belief is split as to whether it is representative of a mental decision during life to choose between good and evil or an afterworld location. Humans&#x27; actions under their free will through choice determine the outcome. According to tradition, the soul is judged by the Yazatas Mithra, Sraosha, and Rashnu, where depending on the verdict one is either greeted at the bridge by a beautiful, sweet-smelling maiden or by an ugly, foul-smelling old hag representing their Daena affected by their actions in life. The maiden leads the dead safely across the bridge, which widens and becomes pleasant for the righteous, towards the House of Song. The hag leads the dead down a bridge that narrows to a razor&#x27;s edge and is full of stench until the departed falls off into the abyss towards the House of Lies. Those with a balance of good and evil go to Hamistagan, a purgatorial realm mentioned in the 9th century work &quot;Dadestan-i Denig&quot;.

The House of Lies is considered temporary and reformative; punishments fit the crimes, and souls do not rest in eternal damnation. Hell contains foul smells and evil food, a smothering darkness, and souls are packed tightly together although they believe they are in total isolation.

In ancient Zoroastrian eschatology, a 3,000-year struggle between good and evil will be fought, punctuated by evil&#x27;s final assault. During the final assault, the sun and moon will darken, and humankind will lose its reverence for religion, family, and elders. The world will fall into winter, and Angra Mainyu&#x27;s most fearsome miscreant, Azi Dahaka, will break free and terrorize the world.

According to legend, the final savior of the world, known as the Saoshyant, will be born to a virgin impregnated by the seed of Zoroaster while bathing in a lake. The Saoshyant will raise the dead—including those in all afterworlds—for final judgment, returning the wicked to hell to be purged of bodily sin. Next, all will wade through a river of molten metal in which the righteous will not burn but through which the impure will be completely purified. The forces of good will ultimately triumph over evil, rendering it forever impotent but not destroyed. The Saoshyant and Ahura Mazda will offer a bull as a final sacrifice for all time and all humans will become immortal. Mountains will again flatten and valleys will rise; the House of Song will descend to the moon, and the earth will rise to meet them both. Humanity will require two judgments because there are as many aspects to our being: spiritual (&quot;menog&quot;) and physical (&quot;getig&quot;).

== Practices and rituals ==
Throughout Zoroastrian history, shrines and temples have been the focus of worship and pilgrimage for adherents of the religion. Early Zoroastrians were recorded as worshiping in the 5th century BCE on mounds and hills where fires were lit below the open skies. In the wake of Achaemenid expansion, shrines were constructed throughout the empire and particularly influenced the role of Mithra, Aredvi Sura Anahita, Verethragna and Tishtrya, alongside other traditional Yazata who all have hymns within the Avesta and also local deities and culture-heroes. Today, enclosed and covered fire temples tend to be the focus of community worship where fires of varying grades are maintained by the clergy assigned to the temples.

The incorporation of cultural and local rituals is quite common and traditions have been passed down in historically Zoroastrian communities such as herbal healing practices, wedding ceremonies, and the like. Traditionally, Zoroastrian rituals have also included shamanic elements involving mystical methods such as spirit travel to the invisible realm and involving the consumption of fortified wine, Haoma, mang, and other ritual aids.

In Zoroastrianism, water (&quot;aban&quot;) and fire (&quot;atar&quot;) are agents of ritual purity, and the associated purification ceremonies are considered the basis of ritual life. In Zoroastrian cosmogony, water and fire are respectively the second and last primordial elements to have been created, and scripture considers fire to have its origin in the waters (re. which conception see Apam Napat).

A corpse is considered a host for decay, i.e., of &quot;druj&quot;. Consequently, scripture enjoins the safe disposal of the dead in a manner such that a corpse does not pollute the good creation. These injunctions are the doctrinal basis of the fast-fading traditional practice of ritual exposure, most commonly identified with the so-called Towers of Silence for which there is no standard technical term in either scripture or tradition. Ritual exposure is currently mainly practiced by Zoroastrian communities of the Indian subcontinent, in locations where it is not illegal and diclofenac poisoning has not led to the virtual extinction of scavenger birds.

The central ritual of Zoroastrianism is the Yasna, which is a recitation of the eponymous book of the Avesta and sacrificial ritual ceremony involving Haoma. Extensions to the Yasna ritual are possible through use of the Visperad and Vendidad, but such an extended ritual is rare in modern Zoroastrianism. The Yasna itself descended from Indo-Iranian sacrificial ceremonies and animal sacrifice of varying degrees are mentioned in the Avesta and are still practiced in Zoroastrianism albeit through reduced forms such as the sacrifice of fat before meals. High rituals such as the Yasna are considered to be the purview of the Mobads with a corpus of individual and communal rituals and prayers included in the Khordeh Avesta.

A Zoroastrian is welcomed into the faith through the Navjote/Sedreh Pushi ceremony, which is traditionally conducted during the later childhood or pre-teen years of the aspirant, though there is no defined age limit for the ritual. After the ceremony, Zoroastrians are encouraged to wear their &quot;sedreh&quot; (ritual shirt) and &quot;kushti&quot; (ritual girdle) daily as a spiritual reminder and for mystical protection, though reformist Zoroastrians tend to only wear them during festivals, ceremonies, and prayers.

Historically, Zoroastrians are encouraged to pray the five daily Gāhs and to maintain and celebrate the various holy festivals of the Zoroastrian calendar, which can differ from community to community. Zoroastrian prayers, called , are conducted usually with hands outstretched in imitation of Zoroaster&#x27;s prayer style described in the Gathas and are of a reflectionary and supplicant nature believed to be endowed with the ability to banish evil. Devout Zoroastrians are known to cover their heads during prayer, either with traditional topi, scarves, other headwear, or even just their hands. However, full coverage and veiling which is traditional in Islamic practice is not a part of Zoroastrianism and Zoroastrian women in Iran wear their head coverings displaying hair and their faces to defy mandates by the Islamic Republic of Iran.

== Scripture ==
=== &quot;Avesta&quot; ===

The &quot;Avesta&quot; is a collection of the central religious texts of Zoroastrianism written in the old Iranian dialect of Avestan. The history of the Avesta is speculated upon in many Pahlavi texts with varying degrees of authority, with the current version of the Avesta dating at oldest from the times of the Sasanian Empire. The Avesta was . According to Middle Persian tradition, Ahura Mazda created the twenty-one Nasks of the original Avesta which Zoroaster brought to Vishtaspa. Here, two copies were created, one which was put in the house of archives and the other put in the Imperial treasury. During Alexander&#x27;s conquest of Persia, the Avesta (written on 1200 ox-hides) was burned, and the scientific sections that the Greeks could use were dispersed among themselves. However, there is no strong historical evidence for this and they remain contested despite affirmations from the Zoroastrian tradition, whether it be the &quot;Denkart&quot;, &quot;Tansar-nāma&quot;, &quot;Ardāy Wirāz Nāmag&quot;, &quot;Bundahsin&quot;, &quot;Zand-i Wahman yasn&quot; or the transmitted oral tradition.

As tradition continues, under the reign of King Valax (identified with a Vologases of the Arsacid dynasty), an attempt was made to restore what was considered the Avesta. During the Sassanid Empire, Ardeshir ordered Tansar, his high priest, to finish the work that King Valax had started. Shapur I sent priests to locate the scientific text portions of the Avesta that were in the possession of the Greeks. Under Shapur II, Arderbad Mahrespandand revised the canon to ensure its orthodox character, while under Khosrow I, the Avesta was translated into Pahlavi.

The compilation of the Avesta can be authoritatively traced, however, to the Sasanian Empire, of which only fraction survive today if the Middle Persian literature is correct. The later manuscripts all date from after the fall of the Sasanian Empire, the latest being from 1288, 590 years after the fall of the Sasanian Empire. The texts that remain today are the Gathas, Yasna, Visperad and the Vendidad, of which the latter&#x27;s inclusion is disputed within the faith. Along with these texts is the individual, communal, and ceremonial prayer book called the Khordeh Avesta, which contains the Yashts and other important hymns, prayers, and rituals. The rest of the materials from the Avesta are called &quot;Avestan fragments&quot; in that they are written in Avestan, incomplete, and generally of unknown provenance.

=== Middle Persian (Pahlavi) ===
Middle Persian and Pahlavi works created in the 9th and 10th century contain many religious Zoroastrian books, as most of the writers and copyists were part of the Zoroastrian clergy. The most significant and important books of this era include the Denkard, Bundahishn, Menog-i Khrad, Selections of Zadspram, Jamasp Namag, Epistles of Manucher, Rivayats, Dadestan-i-Denig, and Arda Viraf Namag. All Middle Persian texts written on Zoroastrianism during this time period are considered secondary works on the religion, and not scripture.

== History ==
=== Zoroaster ===

Zoroastrianism was founded by Zoroaster in ancient Iran. The precise date of the founding of the religion is uncertain and estimates vary wildly from 2000 BCE to . Zoroaster was born – in either Northeast Iran or Southwest Afghanistan – into a culture with a polytheistic religion, which featured excessive animal sacrifice and the excessive ritual use of intoxicants. His life was influenced profoundly by the attempts of his people to find peace and stability in the face of constant threats of raiding and conflict. Zoroaster&#x27;s birth and early life are little documented but speculated upon heavily in later texts. What is known is recorded in the Gathas, forming the core of the Avesta, which contain hymns thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. Born into the Spitama clan, he refers to himself as a poet-priest and prophet. He had a wife, three sons, and three daughters, the numbers of which are gathered from various texts.

Zoroaster rejected many of the gods of the Bronze Age Iranians and their oppressive class structure, in which the Kavis and Karapans (princes and priests) controlled the ordinary people. He also opposed cruel animal sacrifices and the excessive use of the possibly hallucinogenic Haoma plant (conjectured to have been a species of ephedra or &quot;Peganum harmala&quot;), but did not condemn either practice outright, providing moderation was observed.

=== Legendary accounts ===
According to later Zoroastrian tradition, when Zoroaster was 30 years old, he went into the Daiti river to draw water for a Haoma ceremony; when he emerged, he received a vision of Vohu Manah. After this, Vohu Manah took him to the other six Amesha Spentas, where he received the completion of his vision. This vision radically transformed his view of the world, and he tried to teach this view to others. Zoroaster believed in one supreme creator deity and acknowledged this creator&#x27;s emanations (Amesha Spenta) and other divinities which he called Ahuras (Yazata). Some of the deities of the old religion, the &quot;Daevas&quot; (etymologically similar to the Sanskrit &quot;Devas&quot;), appeared to delight in war and strife and were condemned as evil workers of Angra Mainyu by Zoroaster.

Zoroaster&#x27;s ideas were not taken up quickly; he originally only had one convert: his cousin Maidhyoimanha.

==== Cypress of Kashmar ====

The Cypress of Kashmar is a mythical cypress tree of legendary beauty and gargantuan dimensions. It is said to have sprung from a branch brought by Zoroaster from Paradise and to have stood in today&#x27;s Kashmar in northeastern Iran and to have been planted by Zoroaster in honor of the conversion of King Vishtaspa to Zoroastrianism. According to the Iranian physicist and historian Zakariya al-Qazwini King Vishtaspa had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself. In his &quot;ʿAjā&#x27;ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā&#x27;ib al-mawjūdāt&quot;, he further describes how the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil in 247 AH (861 CE) caused the mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across Iran, to be used for beams in his new palace at Samarra. Before, he wanted the tree to be reconstructed before his eyes. This was done in spite of protests by the Iranians, who offered a very great sum of money to save the tree. Al-Mutawakkil never saw the cypress, because he was murdered by a Turkish soldier (possibly in the employ of his son) on the night when it arrived on the banks of the Tigris.

==== Fire Temple of Kashmar ====
Kashmar Fire Temple was the first Zoroastrian fire temple built by Vishtaspa at the request of Zoroaster in Kashmar. In a part of Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahnameh, the story of finding Zarathustra and accepting Vishtaspa&#x27;s religion is regulated that after accepting Zoroastrian religion, Vishtaspa sends priests all over the universe And Azar enters the fire temples (domes) and the first of them is Adur Burzen-Mihr who founded in Kashmar and planted a cypress tree in front of the fire temple and made it a symbol of accepting the Bahi religion And he sent priests all over the world, and commanded all the famous men and women to come to that place of worship.

According to the Paikuli inscription, during the Sasanian Empire, Kashmar was part of Greater Khorasan, and the Sasanians worked hard to revive the ancient religion. It still remains a few kilometers above the ancient city of Kashmar in the castle complex of Atashgah.

=== Early history ===
The roots of Zoroastrianism are thought to lie in a common prehistoric Indo-Iranian religious system dating back to the early 2nd millennium BCE. The prophet Zoroaster himself, though traditionally dated to the 6th century BCE, is thought by many modern historians to have been a reformer of the polytheistic Iranian religion who lived much earlier during the second half of the second millennium BCE. Zoroastrian tradition names Airyanem Vaejah as the home of Zarathustra and the birthplace of the religion. No consensus exists as to the localization of Airyanem Vaejah, but the region of Khwarezm has been considered by modern scholars as a candidate. Zoroastrianism as a religion was not firmly established until centuries later during the Young Avestan period. At this time, the Zoroastrian community was concentrated in the eastern portion of Greater Iran. Although no consensus exists on the chronology of the Avestan period, the lack of any discernable Persian and Median influence in the Avesta makes a time frame in the first half of the first millennium BCE likely.

=== Classical antiquity ===


Zoroastrianism enters recorded history in the mid-5th century BCE. Herodotus&#x27; &quot;The Histories&quot; (completed ) includes a description of Greater Iranian society with what may be recognizably Zoroastrian features, including exposure of the dead.

&quot;The Histories&quot; is a primary source of information on the early period of the Achaemenid era (648–330 BCE), in particular with respect to the role of the Magi. According to Herodotus, the Magi were the sixth tribe of the Medes (until the unification of the Persian empire under Cyrus the Great, all Iranians were referred to as &quot;Mede&quot; or &quot;Mada&quot; by the peoples of the Ancient World) and wielded considerable influence at the courts of the Median emperors.

Following the unification of the Median and Persian empires in 550 BCE, Cyrus the Great and later his son Cambyses II curtailed the powers of the Magi after they had attempted to sow dissent following their loss of influence. In 522 BCE, the Magi revolted and set up a rival claimant to the throne. The usurper, pretending to be Cyrus&#x27; younger son Smerdis, took power shortly thereafter. Owing to the despotic rule of Cambyses and his long absence in Egypt, acknowledged the usurper, especially as he granted a remission of taxes for three years.

Darius I and later Achaemenid emperors acknowledged their devotion to Ahura Mazda in inscriptions, as attested to several times in the Behistun inscription and appear to have continued the model of coexistence with other religions. Whether Darius was a follower of the teachings of Zoroaster has not been conclusively established as there is no indication of note that worship of Ahura Mazda was exclusively a Zoroastrian practice.

According to later Zoroastrian legend (&quot;Denkard&quot; and the &quot;Book of Arda Viraf&quot;), many sacred texts were lost when Alexander the Great&#x27;s troops invaded Persepolis and subsequently destroyed the royal library there. Diodorus Siculus&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;, which was completed , appears to substantiate this Zoroastrian legend. According to one archaeological examination, the ruins of the palace of Xerxes I bear traces of having been burned. Whether a vast collection of (semi-)religious texts , as suggested by the &quot;Denkard&quot;, actually existed remains a matter of speculation.

Alexander&#x27;s conquests largely displaced Zoroastrianism with Hellenistic beliefs, though the religion continued to be practiced many centuries following the demise of the Achaemenids in mainland Persia and the core regions of the former Achaemenid Empire, most notably Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and the Caucasus. In the Cappadocian kingdom, whose territory was formerly an Achaemenid possession, Persian colonists, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper, continued to practice the faith [Zoroastrianism] of their forefathers; and there Strabo, observing in the first century BCE, records (XV.3.15) that these &quot;fire kindlers&quot; possessed many , as well as fire temples. Strabo further states that these were It was not until the end of the Parthian Empire (247 BCE224 CE) that Zoroastrianism would receive renewed interest.

=== Late antiquity ===

As late as the Parthian period, a form of Zoroastrianism was without a doubt the dominant religion in the Armenian lands. The Sassanids aggressively promoted the Zurvanite form of Zoroastrianism, often building fire temples in captured territories to promote the religion. During the period of their centuries-long suzerainty over the Caucasus, the Sassanids made attempts to promote Zoroastrianism there with considerable successes.

Due to its ties to the Christian Roman Empire, Persia&#x27;s archrival since Parthian times, the Sassanids were suspicious of Roman Christianity, and after the reign of Constantine the Great, sometimes persecuted it. In 451 CE, the Sassanid authority clashed with their Armenian subjects in the Battle of Avarayr, making them officially break with the Roman Church. But the Sassanids tolerated or even sometimes favored the Christianity of the Church of the East. The acceptance of Christianity in Georgia (Caucasian Iberia) saw the Zoroastrian religion there slowly but surely decline, but as late the 5th century CE, it was still widely practised as something like a second established religion.

=== Decline in the Middle Ages ===
Over the course of 16 years during the 7th century, most of the Sasanian Empire was conquered by the emerging Muslim caliphate. Although the administration of the state was rapidly Islamicized and subsumed under the Umayyad Caliphate, in the beginning exerted on newly subjected people to adopt Islam. Because of their sheer numbers, the conquered Zoroastrians had to be treated as &quot;dhimmis&quot; (despite doubts of the validity of this identification that persisted down the centuries), which made them eligible for protection. Islamic jurists took the stance that only Muslims could be perfectly moral, but In the main, once the conquest was over and , the Arab governors protected the local populations in exchange for tribute.

The Arabs adopted the Sasanian tax-system, both the land-tax levied on landowners and the poll-tax levied on individuals, called &quot;jizya&quot;, a tax levied on non-Muslims (i.e., the &quot;dhimmis&quot;). In time, this poll-tax came to be used as a means to humble the non-Muslims, and a number of laws and restrictions evolved to emphasize their inferior status. Under the early orthodox caliphs, as long as the non-Muslims paid their taxes and adhered to the &quot;dhimmi&quot; laws, administrators were enjoined to leave non-Muslims .

Under Abbasid rule, Muslim Iranians (who by then were in the majority) in many instances showed severe disregard for and mistreated local Zoroastrians. For example, in the 9th century, a deeply venerated cypress tree in Khorasan (which Parthian-era legend supposed had been planted by Zoroaster himself) was felled for the construction of a palace in Baghdad, away. In the 10th century, on the day that a Tower of Silence had been completed at much trouble and expense, a Muslim official contrived to get up onto it, and to call the &quot;adhan&quot; (the Muslim call to prayer) from its walls. This was turned into a pretext to annex the building.

Ultimately, Muslim scholars like Al-Biruni found few records left of the belief of for instance the Khawarizmians because figures like Qutayba ibn Muslim As a result, 

==== Conversion ====
Though subject to a new leadership and harassment, the Zoroastrians were able to continue their former ways, although there was a slow but steady social and economic pressure to convert, with the nobility and city-dwellers being the first to do so, while Islam was accepted more slowly among the peasantry and landed gentry. now lay with followers of Islam, and although the 

In time, a tradition evolved by which Islam was made to appear as a partly Iranian religion. One example of this was a legend that Husayn, son of the fourth caliph Ali and grandson of Islam&#x27;s prophet Muhammad, had married a captive Sassanid princess named Shahrbanu. This &quot;wholly fictitious figure&quot; was said to have borne Husayn a son, the historical fourth Shi&#x27;a imam, who insisted that the caliphate rightly belonged to him and his descendants, and that the Umayyads had wrongfully wrested it from him. The alleged descent from the Sassanid house counterbalanced the Arab nationalism of the Umayyads, and the Iranian national association with a Zoroastrian past was disarmed. Thus, according to scholar Mary Boyce, The &quot;damning indictment&quot; that becoming Muslim was un-Iranian only remained an idiom in Zoroastrian texts.

With Iranian support, the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and in the subsequent caliphate government—that nominally lasted until 1258—Muslim Iranians received marked favor in the new government, both in Iran and at the capital in Baghdad. This mitigated the antagonism between Arabs and Iranians but sharpened the distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims. The Abbasids zealously persecuted heretics, and although this was directed mainly at Muslim sectarians, it also created a harsher climate for non-Muslims.

==== Survival ====

Despite economic and social incentives to convert, Zoroastrianism remained strong in some regions, particularly in those furthest away from the Caliphate capital at Baghdad. In Bukhara (present-day Uzbekistan), resistance to Islam required the 9th-century Arab commander Qutaiba to convert his province four times. The first three times the citizens reverted to their old religion. Finally, the governor made their religion , turned the local fire temple into a mosque, and encouraged the local population to attend Friday prayers by paying each attendee two dirhams. The cities where Arab governors resided were particularly vulnerable to such pressures, and in these cases the Zoroastrians were left with no choice but to either conform or migrate to regions that had a more amicable administration.

The 9th century came to define the great number of Zoroastrian texts that were composed or re-written during the 8th to 10th centuries (excluding copying and lesser amendments, which continued for some time thereafter). All of these works are in the Middle Persian dialect of that period (free of Arabic words) and written in the difficult Pahlavi script (hence the adoption of the term &quot;Pahlavi&quot; as the name of the variant of the language, and of the genre, of those Zoroastrian books). If read aloud, these books would still have been intelligible to the laity. Many of these texts are responses to the tribulations of the time, and all of them include exhortations to stand fast in their religious beliefs.
In Khorasan in northeastern Iran, a 10th-century Iranian nobleman brought together four Zoroastrian priests to transcribe a Sassanid-era Middle Persian work titled &quot;Book of the Lord&quot; (&quot;Khwaday Namag&quot;) from Pahlavi script into Arabic script. This transcription, which remained in Middle Persian prose (an Arabic version, by al-Muqaffa, also exists), was completed in 957 and subsequently became the basis for Firdausi&#x27;s &quot;Book of Kings&quot;. It became enormously popular among both Zoroastrians and Muslims, and also served to propagate the Sassanid justification for overthrowing the Arsacids.

Among migrations were those to cities in (or on the margins of) the great salt deserts, in particular to Yazd and Kerman, which remain centers of Iranian Zoroastrianism to this day. Yazd became the seat of the Iranian high priests during Mongol Ilkhanate rule, when the Crucial to the present-day survival of Zoroastrianism was a migration from the northeastern Iranian town of &quot;Sanjan in south-western Khorasan&quot;, to Gujarat, in western India. The descendants of that group are today known as the &quot;Parsis&quot;—&quot;as the Gujaratis, from long tradition, called anyone from Iran&quot;—who today represent the larger of the two groups of Zoroastrians in India.
The struggle between Zoroastrianism and Islam declined in the 10th and 11th centuries. Local Iranian dynasties, &quot;all vigorously Muslim,&quot; had emerged as largely independent vassals of the Caliphs. In the 16th century, in one of the early letters between Iranian Zoroastrians and their co-religionists in India, the priests of Yazd lamented that &quot;no period [in human history], not even that of Alexander, had been more grievous or troublesome for the faithful than &#x27;this millennium of the demon ofWrath&#x27;.&quot;

=== Modern ===

Zoroastrianism has survived into the modern period, particularly in India, where the Parsis are thought to have been present since about the 9th century.

Today Zoroastrianism can be divided in two main schools of thought: reformists and traditionalists. Traditionalists are mostly Parsis and accept, beside the Gathas and Avesta, also the Middle Persian literature and like the reformists mostly developed in their modern form from 19th century developments. They generally do not allow conversion to the faith and, as such, for someone to be a Zoroastrian they must be born of Zoroastrian parents. Some traditionalists recognize the children of mixed marriages as Zoroastrians, though usually only if the father is a born Zoroastrian. Not all Zoroastrians identify with either school. Notable examples gaining traction include Neo-Zoroastrians/Revivalists, which are usually reinterpretations of Zoroastrianism appealing towards Western concerns, and centering the idea of Zoroastrianism as a living religion. These advocate the revival and maintenance of old rituals and prayers while supporting ethical and social progressive reforms. Both of these latter schools tend to center the Gathas without outright rejecting other texts except the Vendidad.

From the 19th century onward, the Parsis gained a reputation for their education and widespread influence in all aspects of society. They played an instrumental role in the economic development of the region over many decades; several of the best-known business conglomerates of India are run by Parsi-Zoroastrians, including the Tata, Godrej, Wadia families, and others.

For a variety of social and political factors, the Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent, namely the Parsis and Iranis, have not engaged in conversion since at least the 18th century. Zoroastrian high priests have historically opined there is no reason to not allow conversion, which is also supported by the Revayats and other scripture, though later priests have condemned these judgements. Within Iran, many of the beleaguered Zoroastrians have been also historically opposed or not practically concerned with the matter of conversion. Currently though, The Council of Tehran Mobeds (the highest ecclesiastical authority within Iran) endorses conversion but conversion from Islam to Zoroastrianism is illegal under the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Though the Armenians share a rich history affiliated with Zoroastrianism (that eventually declined with the advent of Christianity), reports indicate that there were Zoroastrians in Armenia until the 1920s.

At the request of the government of Tajikistan, UNESCO declared 2003 a year to celebrate the &quot;3000th anniversary of Zoroastrian culture&quot;, with special events throughout the world. In 2011, the Tehran Mobeds Anjuman announced that for the first time in the history of modern Iran and of the modern Zoroastrian communities worldwide, women had been ordained in Iran and North America as mobedyars, meaning women assistant mobeds (Zoroastrian clergy). The women hold official certificates and can perform the lower-rung religious functions and can initiate people into the religion.

The current Zoroastrian population is said be around 100,000 to 200,000 and reportedly declining. However, further studies are needed to confirm this, as numbers have also been rising in some areas, such as Iran.

== Demographics ==
Zoroastrian communities internationally tend to comprise mostly two main groups of people: Indian Parsis and Iranian Zoroastrians.According to a study in 2012 by the Federation of Zoroastrian Associations of North America, the number of Zoroastrians worldwide was estimated to be between 111,691 and 121,962. The number is imprecise because of diverging counts in Iran.

=== Iran and Central Asia ===
Iran&#x27;s figures of Zoroastrians have ranged widely; the last census (1974) before the revolution of 1979 revealed 21,400 Zoroastrians. Some 10,000 adherents remain in the Central Asian regions that were once considered the traditional stronghold of Zoroastrianism, i.e., Bactria (see also Balkh), which is in Northern Afghanistan; Sogdiana; Margiana; and other areas close to Zoroaster&#x27;s homeland. In Iran, emigration, out-marriage and low birth rates are likewise leading to a decline in the Zoroastrian population. Zoroastrian groups in Iran say their number is approximately 60,000. According to the Iranian census data from 2011 the number of Zoroastrians in Iran was 25,271.

Communities exist in Tehran, as well as in Yazd, Kerman and Kermanshah, where many still speak an Iranian language distinct from the usual Persian. They call their language Dari, not to be confused with the Dari spoken in Afghanistan. Their language is also called &quot;Gavri&quot; or &quot;Behdini&quot;, literally &quot;of the Good Religion&quot;. Sometimes their language is named for the cities in which it is spoken, such as &quot;Yazdi&quot; or &quot;Kermani&quot;. Iranian Zoroastrians were historically called &quot;Gabr&quot;s.

The number of Kurdish Zoroastrians, along with those of non-ethnic converts, has been estimated differently. The Zoroastrian Representative of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has reported that as many as 100,000 people in Iraqi Kurdistan have converted to Zoroastrianism recently, with some community leaders speculating that even more Zoroastrians in the region are practicing their faith secretly. However, this has not been confirmed by independent sources.

The surge in Kurdish Muslims converting to Zoroastrianism is largely attributed to disillusionment with Islam after experiencing violence and oppression perpetrated by ISIS in the area.

=== South Asia ===
India is considered to be home to a large Zoroastrian population – the descendants of migrants from Iran and today known as the Parsis. In India&#x27;s 2001 census, the Parsi population numbered at 69,601, representing about 0.006% of the total population of India, with a concentration in and around the city of Mumbai. By 2008, the birth-to-death ratio was 1:5; 200 births per year to 1,000 deaths. India&#x27;s 2011 census recorded 57,264 Parsi Zoroastrians.

The Zoroastrian population in Pakistan was estimated to number 1,675 people in 2012, mostly living in Sindh (especially Karachi) followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) of Pakistan reported that there were 3,650 Parsi voters during the elections in Pakistan in 2013 and 4,235 in 2018. According to the 2023 Pakistani census, there were 2,348 Parsis across the nation, with 1,656 (70.5%) being located in the Karachi Division.

=== Western world ===

North America is thought to be home to 18,000–25,000 Zoroastrians of both South Asian and Iranian backgrounds. As of 2012, the population of Zoroastrians in US was 15,000, making it the third-largest Zoroastrian population in the world after those of India and Iran. According to the 2021 Canadian census, the Zoroastrian Canadian population stood at 7,285, of which 3,630 were Parsis (of South Asian descent) and a further 2,390 of West Asian origin. A further 3,500 live in Australia (mainly in Sydney). Stewart, Hinze &amp; Williams write that 3,000 Kurds have converted to Zoroastrianism in Sweden. According to the 2021 UK census, there were 4,105 Zoroastrians in England and Wales, of which 4,043 were in England. The majority (51%) of these (2,050) were in London, most notably the boroughs of Barnet, Harrow and Westminster. The remaining 49% of English Zoroastrians were scattered relatively evenly throughout the country, with the second and third largest concentrations being Birmingham (72) and Manchester (47). In 2020, Historic England published &quot;A Survey of Zoroastrianism Buildings in England&quot; with the aim of providing information about buildings that Zoroastrians use in England so that HE can work with communities to enhance and protect those buildings now and in the future. The scoping survey identified four buildings in England.

== Relation to other religions and cultures ==
=== Indo-Iranian origins ===

The religion of Zoroastrianism is closest to historical Vedic religion to varying degrees. Some historians believe that Zoroastrianism, along with similar philosophical revolutions in South Asia were interconnected strings of reformation of a common Indo-Aryan thread. Many traits of Zoroastrianism can be traced to prehistoric Indo-Iranian culture and beliefs, that is, before the migrations that separated the Indo-Aryans and Iranics peoples. Thus, Zoroastrianism shares elements with the historical Vedic religion that also originated in that era. Some examples include cognates between the Avestan word &quot;Ahura&quot; (&quot;Ahura Mazda&quot;) and the Vedic Sanskrit word &quot;Asura&quot; (&#x27;demon&#x27;, &#x27;evil demigod&#x27;); as well as &quot;daeva&quot; (&quot;demon&quot;) and &quot;deva&quot; (&quot;god&quot;) and they both descend from a common Proto-Indo-Iranian religion.

Zoroastrianism inherited ideas from other belief systems and, like other &quot;practiced&quot; religions, contains syncretism. Specifically, Zoroastrianism in Sogdia, the Kushan Empire, Armenia, China, and other places incorporates local and foreign practices and deities.

Conversely, Zoroastrian influenced Hungarian, Slavic, Ossetian, Turkic and Mongol mythologies, all of which bear extensive light-dark dualisms and possible sun god theonyms related to Hvare-khshaeta.

=== Abrahamic religions ===
Zoroastrianism is sometimes credited with being the first monotheistic religion in history, antedating the Israelites and leaving a lasting and profound imprint on Second Temple Judaism and, through it, on later monotheistic religions such as early Christianity and Islam.
There are clear commonalities and similarities between Zoroastrianism, Judaism and Christianity, such as: monotheism, dualism (i.e., a robust notion of a Devil—but with a positive appraisal of material creation), symbolism of the divine, heaven(s) and hell(s), angels and demons, eschatology and final judgment, a messianic figure and the idea of a savior, a holy spirit, concern with ritual purity, an idealization of wisdom and righteousness, and other doctrines, symbols, practices, and religious features.

According to Mary Boyce, 

The interactions between Judaism and Zoroastrianism resulted in transfer of religious ideas between the two religions and as a result, it is believed that Jews under Achaemenid rule were influenced by Zoroastrian angelology, demonology, eschatology, as well as Zoroastrian ideas about compensatory justice in life and after death. It is also postulated that the Jewish high monotheistic concept of God developed during and after the period of the Babylonian captivity, when the Jews had a prolonged exposure to sophisticated Zoroastrian beliefs.

In addition, Zoroastrian concepts seeded dualistic ideas in Jewish eschatology, such as the belief in a savior, the final battle between good and evil, the triumph of good and the resurrection of the dead. These ideas later passed on to Christianity via Zoroastrian-inspired texts of the Old Testament.

According to some sources, such as &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (1906), there exist many similarities between Zoroastrianism and Judaism. This has led some to propose that key Zoroastrian concepts influenced Judaism. However, other scholars disagree, finding that the general social influence of Zoroastrianism was much more limited, and that no link can be found in Jewish or Christian texts.

Proponents of a link cite similarities between the two: such as dualism (good and evil, divine twins Ahura Mazda &quot;God&quot; and Angra Mainyu &quot;Satan&quot;), image of the deity, eschatology, resurrection and final judgment, messianism, revelation of Zoroaster on a mountain with Moses on Mount Sinai, three sons of Fereydun with three sons of Noah, heaven and hell, angelology and demonology, cosmology of six days or periods of creation, and free will, among others. Other scholars diminish or reject such influences, noting that , rather than being a monotheistic religion. Others say Zoroastrianism, and that 

Others, such as Lester L. Grabbe, have said and the . There exist distinctions but also similarities between Zoroastrian and Jewish law regarding marriage and procreation. While Mary Boyce claims, besides Abrahamic religions, Zoroastrian influence also extended to Northern Buddhism.

==== Islam ====
Zoroastrians are considered to be a &quot;People of the Book&quot; by Muslims.

=== Manichaeism ===
Zoroastrianism is often compared with Manichaeism. Nominally an Iranian religion, Manichaeism was heavily inspired by Zoroastrianism because of Mani&#x27;s Iranian origin, and it was also rooted in prior Middle-Eastern Gnostic beliefs.

Manichaeism adopted many of the Yazatas for its own pantheon. Gherardo Gnoli, in &quot;The Encyclopaedia of Religion&quot;, says that .

The two religions have substantial differences.

=== Present-day Iran ===
Many aspects of Zoroastrianism are present in the culture and mythologies of the peoples of Greater Iran, not least because Zoroastrianism was a dominant influence on the people of the cultural continent for a thousand years. Even after the rise of Islam and the loss of direct influence, Zoroastrianism remained part of the cultural heritage of the Iranian language-speaking world, in part as festivals and customs, but also because Ferdowsi incorporated a number of the figures and stories from the Avesta in his epic &quot;Shāhnāme&quot;, which is pivotal to Iranian identity. One notable example is the incorporation of the Yazata Sraosha as an angel venerated within Shia Islam in Iran.
