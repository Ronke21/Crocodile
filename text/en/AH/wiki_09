<text>&quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot; is a line from an editorial by Francis Pharcellus Church. Written in response to a letter by eight-year-old Virginia O&#x27;Hanlon asking whether Santa Claus was real, the editorial was first published in the New York newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; on September 21, 1897. 

&quot;Is There a Santa Claus?&quot; was initially published uncredited and Church&#x27;s authorship was not disclosed until after his death in 1906. The editorial was quickly republished by other New York newspapers. Though initially reluctant to do the same, &quot;The Sun&quot; soon began regularly republishing the editorial during the Christmas and holiday season, including every year from 1924 to 1950, when the paper ceased publication.

The editorial is widely reprinted in the United States during the holiday season, and is the most reprinted newspaper editorial in the English language. It has been translated into around 20 languages and adapted as television specials, a film, a musical, and a cantata.

== Background ==

=== Francis Pharcellus Church ===
Francis Pharcellus Church (February 22, 1839April 11, 1906) was an American publisher and editor. He and his brother William Conant Church founded and edited several publications: &quot;The Army and Navy Journal&quot; (1863), &quot;The Galaxy&quot; (1866), and the &quot;Internal Revenue Record and Customs Journal&quot; (1870). Before the outbreak of the American Civil War he had worked in journalism, first at his father&#x27;s &quot;New-York Chronicle&quot; and later at the New York newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;. Church left &quot;The Sun&quot; in the early 1860s but returned to work there part-time in 1874. After &quot;The Galaxy&quot; merged with &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1878 he joined &quot;The Sun&quot; full-time as an editor and writer. Church wrote thousands of editorials at the paper,&quot;&quot; and became known for writing on religious topics from a secular point of view. After Church&#x27;s death, his friend J. R. Duryee wrote that &quot;by nature and training [he] was reticent about himself, highly sensitive and retiring&quot;.

=== &quot;The Sun&quot; ===
In 1897, &quot;The Sun&quot; was one of the most prominent newspapers in New York City, having been developed by its long-time editor, Charles Anderson Dana, over the previous thirty years. Their editorials that year were described by the scholar W. Joseph Campbell as favoring &quot; and personal attack&quot;. Campbell also wrote that the management of the paper was reluctant to republish content.

== Writing and publication ==
In 1897, Philip O&#x27;Hanlon, a surgeon, was asked by his eight-year-old daughter, Virginia O&#x27;Hanlon, whether Santa Claus existed. His answer did not convince her, and Virginia decided to pose the question to &quot;The Sun&quot;. Sources conflict over whether her father suggested writing the letter,&quot;&quot; or she elected to on her own. In her letter Virginia wrote that her father had told her &quot;If you see it in &quot;The Sun&quot; it&#x27;s so.&quot;&quot;&quot; O&#x27;Hanlon later told &quot;The Sun&quot; that her father thought the newspaper would be &quot;too busy&quot; to respond to her question and had said to &quot;[w]rite if you want to,&quot; but to not be disappointed if she got no response. After sending the letter she looked for a response &quot;day after day&quot;. O&#x27;Hanlon later said that she had waited for an answer to her letter for long enough that she forgot about it. Campbell theorizes the letter was sent shortly after O&#x27;Hanlon&#x27;s birthday in July and was &quot;overlooked or misplaced&quot; for a time.

&quot;The Sun&quot; editor-in-chief, Edward Page Mitchell, eventually gave the letter to Francis Church. Mitchell reported that Church, who was initially reluctant to write a response, produced it &quot;in a short time&quot;&quot;&quot; during a single afternoon. Church&#x27;s response was 416 words long and was anonymously published in &quot;The Sun&quot; on September 21, 1897, shortly after the beginning of the school year in New York City. The editorial appeared in the paper&#x27;s third and last column of editorials that day, positioned below discussions of an election law in Connecticut, a newly invented chainless bicycle, and &quot;British Ships in American Waters&quot;.

Church was not disclosed as the editorial&#x27;s author until after his 1906 death. This sometimes led to inaccuracies: a republication in December 1897 by &quot;The Meriden Weekly Republican&quot; had attributed authorship to Dana, saying that the editorial could &quot;hardly have been written&quot; by any other employee of the paper. The editorial is one of two whose authorship &quot;The Sun&quot; disclosed, the other being Harold M. Anderson&#x27;s &quot;[Charles] Lindbergh Flies Alone&quot;. Campbell argued in 2006 that Church might not have welcomed &quot;The Sun&quot; disclosure, noting that he was generally unwilling to disclose the authorship of other editorials.

=== Summary ===
The editorial, as it first appeared in &quot;The Sun&quot;, was titled &quot;Is There a Santa Claus?&quot; and prefaced with the text of O&#x27;Hanlon&#x27;s letter asking the paper to tell her the truth about the existence of Santa Claus. O&#x27;Hanlon wrote that some of her &quot;little friends&quot; had told her that he was not real. Church&#x27;s response began: &quot;Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age.&quot; He continued to write that Santa Claus existed &quot;as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist&quot; and that the world would be &quot;dreary&quot; if he did not. Church argued that just because something could not be seen did not mean it was not real: &quot;Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.&quot; He concluded that:
=== Initial reception ===
Virginia O&#x27;Hanlon was informed of the editorial from a friend who called her father, describing the editorial as &quot;the most wonderful piece of writing I ever saw.&quot; She later told &quot;The Sun&quot; &quot;I think that I have never been so happy in my life&quot; as when she read Church&#x27;s response. O&#x27;Hanlon continued to say that while she was initially very proud of her role in the editorial&#x27;s publication, she eventually came to understand that &quot;the important thing was&quot; Church&#x27;s writing. In an interview later in life she credited it with shaping the direction of her life positively. 

&quot;The Sun&quot; editor, Charles Anderson Dana, favorably received Church&#x27;s editorial, deeming it &quot;real literature&quot;. He also said that it &quot;might be a good idea to reprint [the editorial] every Christmasyes, and even tell who wrote it!&quot; The editorial&#x27;s publication drew no commentary from contemporary New York newspapers.

== Later republication ==
While &quot;The Sun&quot; did not republish the editorial for five years, it soon appeared in other papers. &quot;The Sun&quot; only republished the editorial after a number of reader requests. After 1902, it did not appear in the paper again until 1906, shortly after Church&#x27;s death. The paper began to re-publish the editorial more regularly after this, including six times in the ensuing ten years and, according to Campbell, gradually began to &quot;warm to&quot; the editorial. During this period other newspapers began to republish the editorial. 

In 1918, &quot;The Sun&quot; wrote that they got many requests to &quot;reprint again the Santa Claus editorial article&quot; every Christmas season. The paper would also mail readers copies of the editorial upon request; it received 163,840 requests in 1930 alone and had sent 200,000 copies out by 1936. Virginia O&#x27;Hanlon also received mail about her letter until her 1971 death and would include a copy of the editorial in her replies.&quot;The Sun&quot; started reprinting the editorial annually at Christmas after 1924, when the paper&#x27;s editor-in-chief, Frank Munsey, placed it as the first editorial on December 23. This practice continued on the 23rd or 24th of the month until the paper&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1950. 

&quot;Is There a Santa Claus?&quot; often appears in newspaper editorial sections during the Christmas and holiday season. It has become the most reprinted editorial in any newspaper in the English language, and has been translated into around 20 languages. Campbell describes it as living on as &quot;enduring inspiration in American journalism.&quot; Journalist David W. Dunlap described &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot; as one of the most famous lines in American journalism, placing it after &quot;Headless body in topless bar&quot; and &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman&quot;. William David Sloan, a journalism scholar, described the line as &quot;perhaps America&#x27;s most famous editorial quote&quot; and the editorial as &quot;the nation&#x27;s best known.&quot;

==Adaptations and legacy==
The 1921 book &quot;Is There a Santa Claus?&quot; was adapted from the editorial. The editorial became better known with the rise of mass media. The story of Virginia&#x27;s inquiry and the response from &quot;The Sun&quot; was adapted in 1932 into an NBC-produced cantata, making it the only known editorial set to classical music. In the 1940s it was read yearly by actress Fay Bainter over the radio. The editorial has been adapted to film several times, including as a segment of the short film &quot;Santa Claus Story&quot; (1945). 

Elizabeth Press published the 1972 children&#x27;s book &quot;Yes, Virginia&quot; that illustrated the editorial and included a brief history of those involved. The highly fictionalized 1974 animated television special &quot;Yes, Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus&quot; aired on ABC. Animated by Bill Melendez, it won the 1975 Emmy Award for outstanding children&#x27;s special. 

In the 1989 drama &quot;Prancer&quot;, the letter is read and referenced multiple times, as it is the favorite piece of literature of the main character, whose belief in Santa Claus is vital to her. The 1991 live-action television film &quot;Yes, Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus&quot; starring Richard Thomas, Ed Asner, and Charles Bronson, was also based on the publication. The story was adapted into an eponymous 1996 holiday musical, with music and lyrics by David Kirchenbaum and book by Myles McDonnel.

The 2009 animated television special &quot;Yes, Virginia&quot; aired on CBS and featured actors including Neil Patrick Harris and Beatrice Miller. The special was written by the Macy&#x27;s ad agency as part of their &quot;Believe&quot; Make-A-Wish fundraising campaign. A novelization based on the special was published the following year. Macy&#x27;s later had the special adapted into a musical for students in third through sixth grade. The company gave schools the rights to perform the musical for free and awarded $1,000 grants to a hundred schools for staging the show.

The phrase &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is (a) ...&quot; has often been used to emphasize that &quot;fantasies and myths are important&quot; and can be &quot;spiritually if not literally true&quot;.

== Analysis ==
The historian and journalist Bill Kovarik described the editorial as part of a broader &quot;revival of the Christmas holiday&quot; that took place during the late 19th century with the publication of various works such as Thomas Nast&#x27;s art. Scholar Stephen Nissenbaum wrote that the editorial reflected popular theology of the late Victorian era and that its content echoed that of sermons on the existence of God. A 1914 editorial in &quot;The Outlook&quot;, building on &quot;The Sun&quot;, saw Santa Claus as a symbol of love, part of a child&#x27;s developing image of God. 

The editorial&#x27;s success has been used to offer insights to writing. Upon the centenary of the editorial&#x27;s publication in 1997, the journalist Eric Newton, who at the time was working at the Newseum, described the editorial as representative of the sort of &quot;poetry&quot; that newspapers should publish as editorials, while Geo Beach in the &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; trade magazine described Church&#x27;s writing as &quot;brave&quot; and showing that &quot;love, hope, belief—all have a place on the editorial page&quot;. Beach also wrote that newspapers should not hold &quot;anything back&quot;, as &quot;The Sun&quot; had done by publishing the editorial in September rather than in the Christmas season. In 2005, Campbell wrote that the editorial, particularly &quot;The Sun&quot; reluctance to republish it, could offer insight into the broader state of American newspapers in the late 19th century.

Reception of the editorial has not been unanimously positive. As early as 1935, journalist Heywood Broun called the editorial a &quot;phony piece of writing.&quot; Members of the Christian Reformed Church in North America in Lynden, Washington criticized it in 1951 for encouraging Virginia to think of her friends as liars. In 1997, the journalist Rick Horowitz wrote in the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; that the editorial gave journalists an excuse to not write their own essays around Christmas: &quot;they can just slap Francis Church&#x27;s &#x27;Yes, Virginia,&#x27; up there on the page and go straight to the office party.&quot;

<doc id="34350" wikidata="Q117012" url="?curid=34350" title="Yoko Ono">
<text>Yoko Ono (, usually spelled in katakana as ; born February 18, 1933) is a Japanese multimedia artist, singer, songwriter, and peace activist. Her work also encompasses performance art and filmmaking.

Ono grew up in Tokyo and moved to New York City in 1952 to join her family. She became involved with New York City&#x27;s downtown artists scene in the early 1960s, which included the Fluxus group, and became well known in 1969 when she married English musician John Lennon of the Beatles, with whom she would subsequently record as a duo in the Plastic Ono Band. The couple used their honeymoon as a stage for public protests against the Vietnam War with what they called a bed-in. She and Lennon remained married until he was murdered in front of the couple&#x27;s apartment building, the Dakota, on December 8, 1980. Together, they had one son, Sean, who later also became a musician.

Ono began a career in popular music in 1969, forming the Plastic Ono Band with Lennon and producing a number of avant-garde music albums in the 1970s. She achieved commercial and critical success in 1980 with the chart-topping album &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;, a collaboration with Lennon that was released three weeks before his murder, winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. To date, she has had twelve number one singles on the US Dance charts, and in 2016 was named the 11th most successful dance club artist of all time by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. Many musicians have paid tribute to Ono as an artist in her own right and as a muse and icon, including Elvis Costello who recorded his version of &quot;Walking on Thin Ice&quot; with The Attractions for the &quot;Every Man Has a Woman&quot; tribute album to Yoko Ono, the B-52&#x27;s, Sonic Youth and Meredith Monk.

As Lennon&#x27;s widow, Ono works to preserve his legacy. She funded the Strawberry Fields memorial in Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park, the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, and the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan (which closed in 2010). She has made significant philanthropic contributions to the arts, peace and disaster relief in Japan and the Philippines, and other such causes. In 2002, she inaugurated a biennial $50,000 LennonOno Grant for Peace. In 2012, she received the Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt Human Rights Award and co-founded the group Artists Against Fracking.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and family ===
Ono was born in Tokyo City on February 18, 1933, to mother (1911–1999) and father , a wealthy banker and former classical pianist. Isoko&#x27;s adoptive maternal grandfather was an affiliate of the Yasuda clan and zaibatsu. Eisuke came from a long line of samurai warrior-scholars. The kanji translation of &quot;Yōko&quot; () means &quot;ocean child&quot;. Two weeks before Ono&#x27;s birth, Eisuke was transferred to San Francisco, California, by his employer, the Yokohama Specie Bank. The rest of the family followed soon after, with Ono first meeting her father when she was two years old. Her younger brother Keisuke was born in December 1936.

In 1937, the family was transferred back to Japan, and Ono enrolled at Tokyo&#x27;s elite Gakushūin (also known as the Peers School), one of the most exclusive schools in Japan. Ono was enrolled in piano lessons from the age of 4, until the age of 12 or 13. She attended kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores.

The family moved to New York City in 1940. The next year, Eisuke was transferred from New York City to Hanoi in French Indochina, and the family returned to Japan. Ono was enrolled in Keimei Gakuen, an exclusive Christian primary school run by the Mitsui family. She remained in Tokyo throughout World War II and the fire-bombing of March 9, 1945, during which she was sheltered with other family members in a special bunker in Tokyo&#x27;s Azabu district, away from the heavy bombing. Ono later went to the Karuizawa mountain resort with members of her family.

Starvation was rampant in the destruction that followed the Tokyo bombings; the Ono family was forced to beg for food while pulling their belongings in a wheelbarrow. Ono said it was during this period in her life that she developed her &quot;aggressive&quot; attitude and understanding of &quot;outsider&quot; status. Other stories tell of her mother bringing a large number of goods to the countryside, where they were bartered for food. In one anecdote, her mother traded a German-made sewing machine for of rice to feed the family. During this time, Ono&#x27;s father, who had been in Hanoi, was believed to be in a prisoner of war camp in China. Ono told Amy Goodman of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; on October 16, 2007, that &quot;He was in French Indochina, which is Vietnam actually... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp.&quot;

After the war ended in 1945, Ono remained in Japan when her family moved to the United States and settled in Scarsdale, New York, an affluent town north of midtown Manhattan. By April 1946, Gakushūin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, located near the Tokyo Imperial Palace, had not been damaged by the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of Prince Akihito, the future emperor of Japan. At 14 years old, she took up vocal training in lieder-singing.

=== College and downtown beginnings ===
Ono graduated from Gakushūin in 1951, and was accepted into the philosophy program of Gakushuin University as the first woman to enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters.

Ono joined her family in New York in September 1952, enrolling at nearby Sarah Lawrence College. Ono&#x27;s parents approved of her college choice, but disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people they felt were beneath her. In 1956, Ono left college to elope with Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi, a star in Tokyo&#x27;s experimental community, then studying at Juilliard.

At Sarah Lawrence, Ono studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Ono has said that her heroes at this time were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, &quot;I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [an] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and... he said, &#x27;Well, look, there are people who are doing things like what you do, and they&#x27;re called avant-garde. Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. Ono left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.

Ono has often been associated with the Fluxus group, a loose association of Dada-inspired avant-garde artists which was founded in the early 1960s by Lithuanian-American artist George Maciunas. Maciunas promoted her work, giving Ono her first solo exhibition at his AG Gallery in New York in 1961. He formally invited Ono to join Fluxus, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent. However, she did collaborate with Maciunas, Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, and the poet Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.

Ono first met John Cage through his student Ichiyanagi Toshi, in Cage&#x27;s experimental composition class at the New School for Social Research. She was introduced to more of Cage&#x27;s unconventional neo-Dadaism first hand, and via his New York City protégés Allan Kaprow, Brecht, Mac Low, Al Hansen and the poet Dick Higgins.

After Cage finished teaching at the New School in the summer of 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found an inexpensive loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street and used the apartment as a studio and living space, also allowing composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. They both held a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961; the events were attended by people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim. Ono and Young both claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. Ono presented work only once during the series.

In 1961, Ono had her first major public performance in a concert at the 258-seat Carnegie Recital Hall (smaller than the &quot;Main Hall&quot;). This concert featured radical experimental music and performances.

The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono&#x27;s earliest conceptual artwork, including &quot;Painting to Be Stepped On&quot;, a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork as footprints were left on it. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias&#x27;s AG Gallery in July 1961. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, Cage advised her to treat the paper with flame retardant. She is credited for the album cover art for the album &quot;Nirvana Symphony&quot; by Toshiro Mayuzumi, released by Time Records in 1962.

After living apart for several years, Ono and Ichiyanagi filed for divorce in 1962. Ono returned home to live with her parents, and, suffering from clinical depression, was briefly placed into a Japanese mental institution.

=== Early career and motherhood ===
On November 28, 1962, Ono married Anthony Cox, an American film producer and art promoter who had been instrumental in securing her release from the mental institution. Ono&#x27;s second marriage was annulled on March 1, 1963, because she had neglected to finalize her divorce from Ichiyanagi. After finalizing that divorce, Cox and Ono married again on June 6, 1963. She gave birth to their daughter Kyoko Chan Cox two months later, on August 8, 1963.

The marriage quickly fell apart, but the couple continued working together for the sake of their joint careers. They performed at Tokyo&#x27;s Sogetsu Hall, with Ono lying atop a piano played by John Cage. Soon, the couple returned to New York with Kyoko. In the early years of the marriage, Ono left most of Kyoko&#x27;s parenting to Cox while she pursued her art full-time, with Cox also managing her publicity.

Ono had a second engagement at the Carnegie Recital Hall in 1965, in which she debuted &quot;Cut Piece&quot;. In September 1966, Ono visited London to meet artist and political activist Gustav Metzger&#x27;s Destruction in Art Symposium in September 1966. She was the only woman artist chosen to perform her own events and only one of two invited to speak. She premiered &quot;The Fog Machine&quot; during her &quot;Concert of Music for the Mind&quot; at the Bluecoat Society of Arts in Liverpool, England in 1967.

Ono and Cox divorced on February 2, 1969, and she married John Lennon later that same year. During a 1971 custody battle, Cox disappeared with their eight-year-old daughter. He won custody after successfully claiming that Ono was an unfit mother due to her drug use. Ono&#x27;s ex-husband changed Kyoko&#x27;s name to &quot;Ruth Holman&quot; and subsequently raised the girl in an organization known as the Church of the Living Word. Ono and Lennon searched for Kyoko for years, but to no avail. She would finally see Kyoko again in 1998.

===Relationship with John Lennon===
Ono&#x27;s first contact with any member of the Beatles occurred when she visited Paul McCartney at his home in London to obtain a Lennon–McCartney song manuscript for a book John Cage was working on, &quot;Notations&quot;. McCartney declined to give her any of his manuscripts but suggested that Lennon might oblige. Lennon later gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to &quot;The Word&quot;.

Ono and Lennon first met on November 7, 1966, at the Indica Gallery in London, where she was preparing &quot;Unfinished Paintings&quot;, her conceptual art exhibit about interactive painting and sculpture. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. One piece, &quot;Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting&quot;, had a ladder painted white with a magnifying glass at the top. When Lennon climbed the ladder, he looked through the magnifying glass and was able to read the word &quot;YES&quot; which was written in miniature. He greatly enjoyed this experience as it was a positive message, whereas most concept art he encountered at the time was anti-everything.

Lennon was also intrigued by Ono&#x27;s &quot;Hammer a Nail&quot; where viewers were invited to hammer a nail into a wooden board painted white. Although the exhibition had not yet opened, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know who this is? He&#x27;s a millionaire! He might buy it.&quot; Ono feigned not knowing of the Beatles (even as she had gone to see Paul McCartney asking for a Beatle song score), but relented on the condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.&quot;

In a 2002 interview, Ono said, &quot;I was very attracted to him. It was a really strange situation.&quot; Ono started writing to Lennon, sending him her conceptual artworks, and soon the two began corresponding. In September 1967, Lennon sponsored Ono&#x27;s solo &quot;Half-A-Wind Show&quot;, at Lisson Gallery in London. When Lennon&#x27;s wife Cynthia asked for an explanation of why Ono was telephoning them at home, he told her that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her &quot;avant-garde bullshit&quot;.

In early 1968, while the Beatles were making their visit to India, Lennon wrote the song &quot;Julia&quot; and included a reference to Ono: &quot;Ocean child calls me&quot;, referring to the translation of Yoko&#x27;s Japanese spelling. In May 1968, while his wife was on holiday in Greece, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording a selection of avant-garde tape loops, after which, he said, they &quot;made love at dawn&quot;. The recordings made by the two during this session ultimately became their first collaborative album, the musique concrete work &quot;Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins&quot;. When Lennon&#x27;s wife returned home, she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon, who simply said, &quot;Oh, hi.&quot;

On September 24 and 25, 1968, Lennon wrote and recorded &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot;, which contains sexual references to Ono. Ono became pregnant, but had a miscarriage of a male child on November 21, 1968, a few weeks after Lennon&#x27;s divorce from Cynthia was granted. On December 12, 1968, Lennon and Ono participated in the BBC documentary about The Rolling Stones, &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock And Roll Circus&quot;, along with several other high-profile musicians. Lennon performed his Beatles composition &quot;Yer Blues&quot; towards the end, with an improvised vocal performance by Ono rounding out the set. The film would not be released until 1996, due to the death of The Rolling Stones&#x27; founding member Brian Jones a few months after it was shot.

====Early collaborations, marriage and &quot;bed-ins&quot;====
During the final two years of the Beatles, Lennon and Ono created and attended public protests against the Vietnam War. They collaborated on a series of avant-garde recordings, beginning in 1968 with &quot;Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins&quot;, which notoriously featured an unretouched image of the two artists nude on the front cover. The same year, the couple contributed an experimental sound collage to The Beatles&#x27; self-titled &quot;White Album&quot; called &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, with Ono contributing additional vocals to &quot;Birthday&quot;, and one lead vocal line on &quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&quot;, marking the only occasion in a Beatles recording in which a woman sings lead vocals.

On March 20, 1969, Lennon and Ono were married at the registry office in Gibraltar and spent their honeymoon in Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long bed-in for peace. They planned another bed-in in the US, but were denied entry to the country. They held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;. Lennon later stated his regrets about feeling &quot;guilty enough to give McCartney credit as co-writer on my first independent single instead of giving it to Yoko, who had actually written it with me.&quot; The couple often combined advocacy with performance art, such as in &quot;bagism&quot;, first introduced during a Vienna press conference, where they satirised prejudice and stereotyping by wearing a bag over their entire bodies. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;.

During the Amsterdam Bed In press conference, Yoko also earned controversy in the Jewish community for saying during the press conference that, &quot;If I was a Jewish girl in Hitler&#x27;s day, I would approach him and become his girlfriend. After 10 days in bed, he would come to my way of thinking. This world needs communication. And making love is a great way of communicating.&quot;

Lennon changed his name by deed poll on April 22, 1969, switching out &quot;Winston&quot; for &quot;Ono&quot; as a middle name. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon after that, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon. The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill, Berkshire, in southeast England. When Ono was injured in a car crash, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles&#x27; last recorded album, &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

====The Plastic Ono Band====

After &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;, Lennon and Ono decided it would be better to form their own band to release their newer, more personally representative art work, rather than release the sound material as the Beatles. To this end they formed the Plastic Ono Band, a name based on their 1968 Fluxus conceptual art project of the same name. that emerged from Ono&#x27;s Fluxus concept of an open-ended plastic band. Plastic Ono Band was first conceived of by Ono in 1967 as an idea for an art exhibition in Berlin but The Plastic Ono Band was first physically realized in 1968 as a multi-media machine maquette by John Lennon, also called &quot;The Plastic Ono Band&quot;. In 1968, Lennon and Ono began a personal and artistic relationship in which they decided to credit their future endeavours as work of The Plastic Ono Band. Under that name Ono and Lennon collaborated on several art exhibitions, concerts, happenings and experimental noise music recording projects, including a sound and light installation in the Apple press office that consisted of four perspex columns, each representing a member of the Beatles, with one holding a tape recorder and amplifier, the second a closed-circuit TV and camera, the third a record player and amplifier, and the fourth a miniature light show and loud speaker. Soon after The Plastic Ono Band name was used in recording and releasing somewhat more standard rock-based albums.

In July 1969, Lennon&#x27;s first solo single, &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; (backed by Ono&#x27;s &quot;Remember Love&quot;) was the first release to be credited to the Plastic Ono Band. It was followed in October by &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (backed by Ono&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko (Mummy&#x27;s Only Looking for her Hand in the Snow)&quot;). The singles were followed in December by the group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot;, which had been recorded live at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival in September. This incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist Eric Clapton, bass player Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards. During the second half, Ono took to the microphone and performed two original feedback-driven compositions, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko&quot; and &quot;John John (Let&#x27;s Hope For Peace)&quot;, constituting the entirety of the second half of the live album.

====&quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot;====

Ono released her first solo album, &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot; in 1970, as a companion piece to Lennon&#x27;s &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot;. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono&#x27;s featured a photo of her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon&#x27;s a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and free jazz techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included Ornette Coleman, other renowned free jazz performers, and Ringo Starr. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence Meredith Monk and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise instead of words. The album reached No. 182 on the US charts.
When Lennon was invited to play with Frank Zappa at the Fillmore (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them. Later that year, she released &quot;Fly&quot;, a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional psychedelic rock with tracks including &quot;Midsummer New York&quot; and &quot;Mind Train&quot;, in addition to a number of Fluxus experiments. She also received minor airplay with the ballad &quot;Mrs. Lennon&quot;. The track &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, Kyoko (Mummy&#x27;s Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)&quot; was an ode to Ono&#x27;s missing daughter, and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. In 1971, while studying with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Majorca, Spain, Ono&#x27;s ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from the kindergarten. They reached an out of court agreement and the charges were dismissed. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko. Ono would not see her daughter until 1998. During this time, she wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko&quot;, which also appears on Lennon and Ono&#x27;s album &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot;, in addition to &quot;Fly&quot;. Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; when Yoko whispers &quot;Happy Christmas, Kyoko&quot;, followed by Lennon whispering, &quot;Happy Christmas, Julian.&quot; The song reached No. 4 in the UK, where its release was delayed until 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart. Originally a protest song about the Vietnam War, &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; has since become a Christmas standard. That August the couple appeared together at a benefit in Madison Square Garden with Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, and Sha Na Na for mentally disabled children organized by WABC-TV&#x27;s Geraldo Rivera.

In a 2018 issue of &quot;Portland Magazine&quot;, editor Colin W. Sargent writes of interviewing Yoko while she was visiting Portland, Maine, in 2005. She spoke of driving along the coast with Lennon and dreamed of buying a house in Maine. &quot;We talked excitedly in the car. We were looking for a house on the water… We did examine the place! We kept driving north along the water until I don&#x27;t really remember the name of the town. We went quite a ways up, actually, because it was so beautiful.&quot;

In 1973, Ono recorded a single, &quot;Joseijoi Banzai, Parts 1 and 2&quot; with musicians billed as the Plastic Ono Band and Elephants Memory and released it only in Japan. She cheered feminism by combining lyrics inspired by Japanese war songs with Pop rhythms, signalling a new direction.

====Separation and reconciliation====
After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Ono and Lennon lived together in London and then moved permanently to Manhattan to escape tabloid racism towards Ono. Their relationship became strained because Lennon was facing deportation due to drug charges that had been filed against him in England, and because of Ono&#x27;s separation from her daughter. The couple separated in July 1973, with Ono pursuing her career and Lennon living between Los Angeles and New York with personal assistant May Pang; Ono had given her blessing to Lennon and Pang&#x27;s relationship.

By December 1974, Lennon and Pang considered buying a house together, and he refused to accept Ono&#x27;s phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, Lennon failed to return home or call Pang. When she telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress, which did not happen.

Ono and Lennon&#x27;s son, Sean, was born on October 9, 1975, Lennon&#x27;s 35th birthday. Following the birth of Sean, both Lennon and Ono took a hiatus from the music industry, with Lennon becoming a stay-at-home dad to care for his infant son. Sean has followed in his parents&#x27; footsteps with a career in music; he performs solo work, works with Ono and formed a band, The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger.

=== Return to music and murder of Lennon ===

In early 1980, Lennon heard Lene Lovich and the B-52&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; while on vacation in Bermuda. The latter reminded him of Ono&#x27;s musical sound and he took this as an indication that she had reached the mainstream (the band had in fact been influenced by Ono). Ono and Lennon began trading songs over the phone with each other, quickly accumulating enough material to record. The emerging album was structured as a dialogue, and was to be credited to John Lennon and Yoko Ono as a duo. It would also mark the return of Lennon to the public eye after a five-year absence, as well as a public reconciliation of Ono and Lennon.

&quot;Double Fantasy&quot; was released on November 17, 1980, and received tepid initial reviews, with much of the criticism centering on the idealization of Lennon and Ono&#x27;s marriage and supposed domestic bliss. However, the reception and the legacy of the album would be forever linked with what happened just weeks after its release.

On the evening of December 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were at the Record Plant Studio and working on Ono&#x27;s song &quot;Walking on Thin Ice&quot;. When they returned to their Manhattan home The Dakota, Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman, who had been stalking Lennon for two months. Yoko cradled the dying Lennon in her arms, and for a time afterward, lived in constant fear of her own and her son Sean&#x27;s assassination.

After John&#x27;s death, the interior decorator Sam Havadtoy moved in to support her. &quot;Walking on Thin Ice (For John)&quot; was released as a single less than a month later, and became Ono&#x27;s first chart success as a solo artist, peaking at No. 58 and gaining significant underground airplay. &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; received an instant critical reappraisal, eventually becoming a landmark album of the 1980s, and winning Ono the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards.

In 1981, she released the album &quot;Season of Glass&quot;, which featured the striking cover photo of Lennon&#x27;s bloody spectacles next to a half-filled glass of water, with a window overlooking Central Park in the background. This photograph sold at an auction in London in April 2002 for about $13,000. In the liner notes to &quot;Season of Glass&quot;, Ono explained that the album was not dedicated to Lennon because &quot;he would have been offended—he was one of us.&quot; The album received highly favorable reviews and reflected the public&#x27;s mood after Lennon&#x27;s assassination.

In 1982, she released &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;. The cover featured Ono in her wrap-around sunglasses, looking towards the sun, while on the back the ghost of Lennon looks over her and their son. The album scored minor chart success and airplay with the single &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot;.

In 1984, a tribute album titled &quot;Every Man Has a Woman&quot; was released, featuring a selection of songs written by Ono performed by artists such as Elvis Costello, Roberta Flack, Eddie Money, Rosanne Cash, and Harry Nilsson. Later that year, Ono and Lennon&#x27;s final album, &quot;Milk and Honey&quot;, was released as a mixture of unfinished Lennon recordings from the &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; sessions, and new Ono recordings. It peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 11 in the U.S., going gold in both countries as well as in Canada.

Ono funded the construction and maintenance of the Strawberry Fields memorial in Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park, directly across from the Dakota, which was the scene of the murder. It was officially dedicated on October 9, 1985, which would have been his 45th birthday.

Ono&#x27;s final album of the 1980s was &quot;Starpeace&quot;, a concept album that she intended as an antidote to Ronald Reagan&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; missile defense system. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the palm of her hand. &quot;Starpeace&quot; became Ono&#x27;s most successful non-Lennon effort. The single &quot;Hell in Paradise&quot; was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the video, directed by Zbigniew Rybczyński received major airplay on MTV and won &quot;Most Innovative Video&quot; at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986.

In 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for &quot;Starpeace&quot;, primarily visiting Eastern European countries.

=== Resurgence and collaborations ===
In 1990, Ono collaborated with music consultant Jeff Pollack to honor what would have been Lennon&#x27;s 50th birthday with a worldwide broadcast of &quot;Imagine&quot;. Over 1,000 stations in over 50 countries participated in the simultaneous broadcast. Ono felt the timing was perfect, considering the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Germany.

Ono went on a musical hiatus following the release of &quot;Starpeace&quot;, until she signed with Rykodisc in 1992 and released the comprehensive six-disc box set &quot;Onobox&quot;. The box set included remastered highlights from Ono&#x27;s solo albums and previously unreleased material from the 1974 &quot;lost weekend&quot; sessions. She also released a one-disc sampler of highlights from &quot;Onobox&quot;, simply titled &quot;Walking on Thin Ice&quot;. That year, she sat down for an extensive interview with music journalist Mark Kemp for a cover story in the alternative music magazine &quot;Option&quot;. The story took a revisionist look at Ono&#x27;s music for a new generation of fans more accepting of her role as a pioneer in the blending of pop and avant-garde music.

In 1994, Ono produced her own off-Broadway musical entitled &quot;New York Rock&quot;, which featured Broadway renditions of her songs.

In 1995, Ono released &quot;Rising&quot;, a collaboration with her son Sean and his then-band, Ima. &quot;Rising&quot; spawned a world tour that traveled through Europe, Japan, and the United States. The following year, she collaborated with various alternative rock musicians for an EP entitled &quot;Rising Mixes&quot;. Guest remixers of &quot;Rising&quot; material included Cibo Matto, Ween, Tricky, and Thurston Moore.

In 1997, Rykodisc reissued Ono&#x27;s catalog of solo recordings on CD, from &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot; through &quot;Starpeace&quot;. Ono and her engineer Rob Stevens personally remastered the audio, and various bonus tracks were added, including outtakes, demos, and live cuts. In the same year, Ono and the BMI Foundation established an annual music competition program for songwriters of contemporary musical genres to honor John Lennon&#x27;s memory and his large creative legacy. Over $350,000 has been given through BMI Foundation&#x27;s John Lennon Scholarships to talented young musicians in the United States, making it one of the most respected awards for emerging songwriters.

In 2000, Ono founded the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan, which housed over 130 pieces of Lennon and Beatles memorabilia from Ono&#x27;s private collection. The museum closed in 2010.

Ono&#x27;s feminist concept album &quot;Blueprint for a Sunrise&quot; was released in 2001. A month after the 9/11 attacks, Ono organized the concert &quot;Come Together: A Night for John Lennon&#x27;s Words and Music&quot; at Radio City Music Hall. Hosted by the actor Kevin Spacey and featuring Lou Reed, Cyndi Lauper and Nelly Furtado, it raised money for September 11 relief efforts and aired on TNT and the WB.

=== Later life and dance chart hits ===
In 2002, Ono joined the B-52&#x27;s in New York for their 25th anniversary concerts; she came out for the encore and performed &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; with the band. In March 2002, she was present with Cherie Blair at the unveiling of a seven-foot statue of Lennon to mark the renaming of Liverpool airport to Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

Beginning in 2003, some DJs remixed other Ono songs for dance clubs. For the remix project, she dropped her first name and became known simply as &quot;ONO&quot;, in response to the &quot;Oh, no!&quot; jokes that dogged her throughout her career. Ono had great success with new versions of &quot;Walking on Thin Ice&quot;, remixed by top DJs and dance artists including Pet Shop Boys, Orange Factory, Peter Rauhofer, and Danny Tenaglia. In April 2003, Ono&#x27;s &quot;Walking on Thin Ice (Remixes)&quot; was rated number 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Dance/Club Play chart, gaining Ono her first no. 1 hit. She would have a second no. 1 hit on the same chart in November 2004 with &quot;Everyman... Everywoman...&quot;, a reworking of her song &quot;Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him&quot;.

During the Liverpool Biennial in 2004, Ono flooded the city with two images on banners, bags, stickers, postcards, flyers, posters and badges: one of a woman&#x27;s naked breast, the other of the same model&#x27;s vulva. During her stay in Lennon&#x27;s city of birth, she said she was &quot;astounded&quot; by the city&#x27;s renaissance. The piece, titled &quot;My Mummy Was Beautiful&quot;, was dedicated to Lennon&#x27;s mother, Julia, who had died when he was a teenager. According to Ono, the work was meant to be innocent, not shocking; she was attempting to replicate the experience of a baby looking up at its mother&#x27;s body, those parts of the mother&#x27;s body being a child&#x27;s introduction to humanity.

Ono performed at the opening ceremony for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, Like many of the other performers during the ceremony, she wore white to symbolize the snow of winter. She read a free verse poem calling for world peace as an introduction to Peter Gabriel&#x27;s performance of &quot;Imagine&quot;.

On December 13, 2006, one of Ono&#x27;s bodyguards was arrested after he was allegedly taped trying to extort $2 million from her. The tapes revealed that he threatened to release private conversations and photographs. His bail was revoked, and he pleaded not guilty to two counts of attempted grand larceny. On February 16, 2007, a deal was reached where extortion charges were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, a felony, and was sentenced to the 60 days that he had already spent in jail. After reading an unapologetic statement, he was released to immigration officials because he had also been found guilty of overstaying his business visa.

Ono released the album &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m a Witch&quot; in February 2007, a collection of remixes and covers from her back catalog by various artists including The Flaming Lips, Cat Power, Anohni, DJ Spooky, Porcupine Tree, and Peaches, along with a special edition of &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot;. &quot;Yes I&#x27;m a Witch&quot; was critically well received. A similar compilation of Ono dance remixes entitled &quot;Open Your Box&quot; was also released in April.

On June 26, 2007, Ono appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; along with McCartney, Starr and Olivia Harrison. She headlined the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago on July 14, 2007, performing a full set that mixed music and performance art. She sang &quot;Mulberry&quot;, a song about her time in the countryside after the Japanese collapse in World War II for only the third time ever, with Thurston Moore: She had previously performed the song with John and with Sean. On October 9 of that year, the Imagine Peace Tower on Viðey Island in Iceland, dedicated to peace and to Lennon, was turned on with her, Sean, Ringo, and Olivia in attendance. Each year between October 9 and December 8, it projects a vertical beam of light into the sky.
Ono returned to Liverpool for the 2008 Liverpool Biennial, where she unveiled &quot;Sky Ladders&quot; in the ruins of Church of St Luke (which was largely destroyed during World War II and now stands roofless as a memorial to those killed in the Liverpool Blitz). Two years later, on March 31, 2009, she went to the inauguration of the exhibition &quot;Imagine: The Peace Ballad of John &amp; Yoko&quot; to mark the 40th anniversary of the Lennon-Ono Bed-In at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Canada, from May 26 to June 2, 1969. The hotel had been doing steady business with the room they stayed in for over 40 years. That year Ono became a grandmother when Emi was born to her daughter Kyoko.

Ono had further Dance/Club Play chart no. 1 hits with &quot;No No No&quot; in January 2008, and &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; the following August. In June 2009, at the age of 76, Ono scored her fifth no. 1 hit on the Dance/Club Play chart with &quot;I&#x27;m Not Getting Enough&quot;.

In May 2009, she designed a T-shirt for the second Fashion Against AIDS campaign and collection of HIV/AIDS awareness, NGO Designers Against AIDS, and H&amp;M, with the statement &quot;Imagine Peace&quot; depicted in 21 languages. Ono appeared onstage at Microsoft&#x27;s June 1, 2009, E3 Expo press conference with Olivia Harrison, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr to promote the &quot;Beatles: Rock Band&quot; video game, which was universally praised by critics. Ono appeared on the Basement Jaxx album &quot;Scars&quot;, featuring on the single &quot;Day of the Sunflowers (We March On)&quot;. In the same year, she became an honorary patron to Alder Hey Charity, and created an exhibit called &quot;John Lennon: The New York City Years&quot; for the NYC Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex. The exhibit used music, photographs, and personal items to depict Lennon&#x27;s life in New York. A portion of the cost of each ticket was donated to Spirit Foundation, a charitable foundation set up and founded by Lennon and Ono.

=== The new Plastic Ono Band ===
In 2009, Ono recorded &quot;Between My Head and the Sky&quot;, which was her first album to be released as &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot; since 1973&#x27;s &quot;Feeling the Space&quot;. The all-new Plastic Ono Band lineup included Sean Lennon, Cornelius, and Yuka Honda. On February 16, 2010, Sean organized a concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music called &quot;We Are Plastic Ono Band&quot;, at which Yoko performed her music with Sean, Clapton, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner for the first time since the 1970s. Guests including Bette Midler, Paul Simon and his son Harper, and principal members of Sonic Youth and the Scissor Sisters interpreted her songs in their own styles.

On April 1, 2010, she was named the first &quot;Global Autism Ambassador&quot; by the Autism Speaks organization. She had created an artwork the year before for autism awareness and allowed it to be auctioned off in 67 parts to benefit the organization. In April 2010, RCRD LBL made available free downloads of Junior Boys&#x27; mix of &quot;I&#x27;m Not Getting Enough&quot;, a single originally released 10 years prior on &quot;Blueprint for a Sunrise&quot;. That song and &quot;Wouldnit (I&#x27;m a Star)&quot;, released September 14, made it to Billboard&#x27;s end of the year list of favorite Dance/Club songs at No. 23 and No. 50 respectively.

Ono appeared with Starr on July 7 at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall in celebration of Starr&#x27;s 70th birthday, performing &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; and &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;. On September 16, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian Lennon&#x27;s photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City, appearing for the first time photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted his work on her website. On October 2, Ono and the Plastic Ono Band performed at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, with special guest Lady Gaga, whom she deeply admires.
On February 18, 2011 (her 78th birthday), Ono took out a full-page advert in the UK free newspaper &quot;Metro&quot; for &quot;Imagine Peace 2011&quot;. It took the form of an open letter, inviting people to think of, and wish for, peace. With son Sean, she held a benefit concert to aid in the relief efforts for earthquake and tsunami-ravaged Japan on March 27 in New York City. The effort raised a total of $33,000. The same year, &quot;Move on Fast&quot; became her sixth consecutive number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs chart and her eighth number-one hit overall. She also collaborated with The Flaming Lips on an EP entitled &quot;The Flaming Lips with Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot;.

In July 2011, she visited Japan to support earthquake and tsunami victims and tourism to the country. During her visit, Ono gave a lecture and performance entitled &quot;The Road of Hope&quot; at Tokyo&#x27;s Mori Art Museum, during which she painted a large calligraphy piece entitled &quot;Dream&quot; to help raise funds for construction of the Rainbow House, an institution for the orphans of the Great East Japan earthquake. She also collected the 8th Hiroshima Art Prize for her contributions to art and for peace, that she was awarded the year prior.

In January 2012, a Ralphi Rosario mix of her 1995 song &quot;Talking to the Universe&quot; became her seventh consecutive No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In March of the same year, she was awarded the 20,000-euro ($26,400) Oskar Kokoschka Prize in Austria. From June 19 to September 9, her work &quot;To the Light&quot; was exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery in London. It was held in conjunction with the London 2012 Festival, a 12-week UK-wide celebration featuring internationally renowned artists from Midsummer&#x27;s Day (June 21) to the final day of the Paralympic Games on September 9. The album &quot;Yokokimthurston&quot; was also released in 2012, featuring a collaboration with Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth. AllMusic characterized it as &quot;focused and risk-taking&quot; and &quot;above the best&quot; of the couple&#x27;s experimental music, with Ono&#x27;s voice described as &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot;.

On June 29, 2012, Ono received a lifetime achievement award at the Dublin Biennial. During this (her second) trip to Ireland (the first was with John before they married), she visited the crypt of Irish leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell at Glasnevin Cemetery and Dún Laoghaire, from where Irish departed for England to escape the famine. In February 2013, Ono accepted the Rainer Hildebrandt Medal at Berlin&#x27;s Checkpoint Charlie Museum, awarded to her and Lennon for their lifetime of work for peace and human rights. The next month, she tweeted an anti-gun message with the &quot;Season of Glass&quot; image of Lennon&#x27;s bloodied glasses on what would have been her and Lennon&#x27;s 44th anniversary, noting that guns have killed more than 1 million people since Lennon&#x27;s death in 1980. She was also given a Congressional citation from the Philippines for her monetary aid to the victims of typhoon Pablo, as well as her donation to disaster relief efforts after typhoon Ondoy in 2009 and assistance of Filipino schoolchildren.

In 2013, she and the Plastic Ono Band released the LP &quot;Take Me to the Land of Hell&quot;, which featured numerous guests including Yuka Honda, Cornelius, Hirotaka &quot;Shimmy&quot; Shimizu, mi-gu&#x27;s Yuko Araki, Wilco&#x27;s Nels Cline, Tune-Yards, Questlove, Lenny Kravitz, and Ad-Rock and Mike D of the Beastie Boys. In June 2013, she curated the Meltdown festival in London, where she played two concerts, one with the Plastic Ono Band, and the second on backing vocals during Siouxsie Sioux&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Walking on Thin Ice&quot; at the &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; show. In July, OR Books published Ono&#x27;s sequel to 1964&#x27;s &quot;Grapefruit&quot;, another book of instruction-based &#x27;action poems&#x27; this time entitled, &quot;Acorn&quot;.

Her online video for &quot;Bad Dancer&quot; released in November 2013, which featured some of these guests, was well-liked by the press. By the end of the year she had become one of three artists with two songs in the Top 20 Dance/Club and had two consecutive number 1 hits on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Dance Club Play Charts. On the strength of the singles &quot;Hold Me&quot; (Featuring Dave Audé) and &quot;Walking on Thin Ice&quot;, the then-80-year-old beat Katy Perry, Robin Thicke and her friend Lady Gaga.

In 2014, &quot;Angel&quot; was Ono&#x27;s twelfth number one on the US Dance chart. Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band continued to perform live into 2015.

On February 16, 2016, Manimal Vinyl released &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m a Witch Too,&quot; which features remixes from Moby, Death Cab For Cutie, Sparks, and Miike Snow. Like its predecessor, &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m a Witch Too&quot; received critical acclaim. On February 26, 2016, Ono was hospitalized after suffering what was rumored to be a possible stroke. It was later announced that she was experiencing extreme symptoms of the flu. On September 6, 2016, Secretly Canadian announced that they would be re-issuing 11 of Ono&#x27;s albums from 1968 to 1985; &quot;Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins&quot; through &quot;Starpeace&quot;. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; named her the 11th most successful dance club artist of all time.

In October 2018, Ono released &quot;Warzone&quot;, which included new versions of previously recorded tracks including &quot;Imagine&quot;.

In a piece for the &quot;New Yorker&quot; published in November 2021, it was noted that Ono had &quot;withdrawn from public life&quot;, with her son Sean now acting as the public representative for the family&#x27;s interests in the Beatles&#x27; business.

==Artwork==
===&quot;Cut Piece&quot;, 1964===

Ono was a pioneer of conceptual art and performance art. A seminal performance work is &quot;Cut Piece&quot;, first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto, Japan. The piece consisted of Ono, dressed in her best suit, kneeling on a stage with a pair of scissors in front of her. She invited and then instructed audience members to join her on stage and cut pieces of her clothing off. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion. The piece was subsequently performed at the Sogetsu Art Centre in Tokyo that same year, New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall in 1965 and London&#x27;s Africa Center as part of the Destruction in Art Symposium in 1966. Of the piece, John Hendricks wrote in the catalogue to Ono&#x27;s Japan Society retrospective: &quot;[&quot;Cut Piece&quot;] unveils the interpersonal alienation that characterizes social relationships between subjects, dismantling the disinterested Kantian aesthetic model... It demonstrates the reciprocity between artists, objects, and viewers and the responsibility beholders have to the reception and preservation of art.&quot;

Other performers of the piece have included Charlotte Moorman and John Hendricks. Ono reprised the piece in Paris in 2003, in the low post-9/11 period between the US and France, saying she hoped to show that this is &quot;a time where we need to trust each other&quot;. In 2013, the Canadian singer Peaches reprised it at the multi-day Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre in London, which Ono curated.

===&quot;Grapefruit&quot; book, 1964===
Ono&#x27;s small book titled &quot;Grapefruit&quot; is another seminal piece of conceptual art. First published in 1964, the book reads as a set of instructions through which the work of art is completed-either literally or in the imagination of the viewer participant. One example is &quot;Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies.&quot; &quot;Grapefruit&quot; has been published several times, most widely distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. David Bourdon, art critic for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;, called &quot;Grapefruit&quot; &quot;one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960s&quot;. He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner came in and &quot;did virtually the same things&quot; she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.

Ono would enact many of the book&#x27;s scenarios as performance pieces throughout her career, which formed the basis for her art exhibitions, including the highly publicized retrospective exhibition, &quot;This Is Not Here&quot; in 1971 at the Everson Museum in Syracuse, New York, that was nearly closed when it was besieged by excited Beatles fans, who broke several of the art pieces and flooded the toilets. It was her last major exhibition until 1989&#x27;s &quot;Yoko Ono: Objects, Films&quot; retrospective at the Whitney.

Nearly fifty years later in July 2013, she released a sequel to &quot;Grapefruit&quot;, another book of instructions, &quot;Acorn&quot; via OR Books.

===Do It Yourself Fluxfest, 1966===
a 20-piece collection conjoining short instructional texts by Ono with Maciunas&#x27; graphic illustrations. First printed in &quot;3 newspaper events for the price of $1&quot;, the No. 7, February 1966 issue of the Fluxus magazine cc V TRE, the compilation underscores the Fluxus idea that anyone can make art. These amusing pieces find meaning in the humorous dialogue that exists between Ono&#x27;s instructions and Maciunas&#x27; skillful treatment of text with relation to pictorial motifs.

===Experimental films, 1964–1972===
Ono was also an experimental filmmaker who made 16 films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply &quot;No. 4&quot;, often referred to as &quot;Bottoms&quot;. The 80-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film. She also collaborated with Lennon on the film &quot;Fly&quot; (1970), the soundtrack of which appeared on her 1971 album &quot;Fly&quot;; and on &quot;Up Your Legs Forever&quot;, a quasi-sequel to &quot;No. 4&quot;.

In March 2004, the ICA London, showed most of her films from this period in their exhibition &quot;The Rare Films of Yoko Ono&quot;. She also acted in an obscure exploitation film in 1965, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Bed&quot;.

===&quot;Wish Tree&quot;, 1996–present===

Another example of Ono&#x27;s participatory art was her &quot;Wish Tree&quot; project, in which a tree native to the installation site is installed. Her 1996 &quot;Wish Piece&quot; had the following instructions:

:Make a wish
:Write it down on a piece of paper
:Fold it and tie it around a branch of a Wish Tree
:Ask your friends to do the same
:Keep wishing
:Until the branches are covered with wishes.

Her &quot;Wish Tree&quot; installation in the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, established in July 2010, has attracted contributions from all over the world. Other installation locations include London; St. Louis; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco; Copenhagen; the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, California; Japan; Venice; Dublin; and, Miami at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in 2010.

In 2014 Ono&#x27;s &quot;Imagine Peace&quot; exhibit opened at the Bob Rauschenburg Gallery at Florida SouthWestern State College in Fort Myers, Florida. Ono installed a billboard on U.S. Route 41 in Fort Myers to promote the show and peace. When the exhibit closed, wishes that had been placed on the installed Wish Trees were sent to the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland and added to the millions of wishes already there. &quot;Imagine Peace&quot; was also installed in Houston in 2011 through the Deborah Colton Gallery, returning in 2016.

=== &quot;Earth Peace&quot;, 2014 ===
One of two pieces Ono installed as part of the 2014 Folkestone Triennial, Earth Peace originally consisted of many parts and appeared in many locations and media around Folkestone, including posters, stickers, billboards and badges. Three of the pieces remain in Folkestone, on loan to the town and part of the Creative Folkestone Artworks collection. These include an inscribed stone, a flag – which is flown on an annual basis on International Peace Day and a beacon of light installed on the dome roof of The Grand in Folkestone Leas. Ono&#x27;s beacon flashes a morse code message, &quot;Earth Peace&quot;, across the English Channel.

=== &quot;Skyladder&quot;, 2014 ===
The second of Ono&#x27;s 2014 Folkestone Triennial pieces and now also on loan to the town as part of the Folkestone Artworks collection, &quot;Skyladder&quot; is displayed in two locations – on a high wall of the Quarterhouse bar and in the staircase of the Folkestone public library. &quot;Skyladder&quot; takes the form of an artistic &#x27;instruction&#x27; or invitation to the people of Folkestone and beyond. The instruction reads: &quot;Audience should bring a ladder they like. Colour it. Word it. Take pictures of it. Keep adding things to it. And send it as a postcard to a friend&quot;&quot;.&quot;

=== &quot;Arising&quot;, 2015 ===
In 2015, Ono created the piece &quot;Arising&quot; in Venice. As part of the exhibition &quot;Personal Structures&quot;, organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the European Cultural Centre&#x27;s Palazzo Bembo. In this feminist work of art, female silicon bodies were burnt in the Venetian lagoon, evoking the imagery of mythical phoenixes. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record &quot;Rising&quot; and this piece, Ono responded: &quot;&quot;Rising&quot; was telling all people that it is time for us to rise and fight for our rights. But in the process of fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope &quot;Arising&quot; will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together.&quot;

===&quot;Skylanding&quot;, 2016===

In October 2016, Ono unveiled her first permanent art installation in the United States; the collection is located in Jackson Park, Chicago and promotes peace. Ono was inspired during a visit to the Garden of the Phoenix in 2013 and feels a connection to the city of Chicago.

===&quot;Refugee Boat&quot;, 2019===
Participating in Lower Manhattan&#x27;s River to River Festival in 2019, Ono presented her participatory installation &quot;Add Color (Refugee Boat)&quot; (1960/2019). The work comprises a white room with a white rowing boat in it, which were both covered by messages and drawings from members of the audience throughout the festival. Through the participatory nature of the work, the artist emphasised the need for solidarity and the history of immigrants and refugees in the United States. &quot;Refugee Boat&quot; belongs to Ono&#x27;s &quot;Add Color Painting&quot; series, first enacted in 1960, which invites the audience to make marks over the designated objects, often white.

===Recognition and retrospectives===

John Lennon once described his wife as &quot;the world&#x27;s most famous unknown artist: everybody knows her name, but nobody knows what she does&quot;. Her circle of friends in the New York art world has included Kate Millett, Nam June Paik, Dan Richter, Jonas Mekas, Merce Cunningham, Judith Malina, Erica Abeel, Fred DeAsis, Peggy Guggenheim, Betty Rollin, Shusaku Arakawa, Adrian Morris, Stefan Wolpe, Keith Haring, and Andy Warhol (she was one of the speakers at Warhol&#x27;s 1987 funeral), as well as George Maciunas and La Monte Young. In addition to Mekas, Maciunas, Young, and Warhol, she has also collaborated with DeAsis, Yvonne Rainer and Zbigniew Rybczyński.

In 1989, the Whitney Museum held a retrospective of her work, &quot;Yoko Ono: Objects, Films&quot;, marking Ono&#x27;s reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At the suggestion of Ono&#x27;s live-in companion at the time, interior decorator Sam Havadtoy, she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. &quot;I realized that for something to move me so much that I would cry, there&#x27;s something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it&#x27;s the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way – solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change. . . . I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified.&quot;

Over a decade later, in 2001, &quot;Y E S YOKO ONO&quot;, a 40-year retrospective of Ono&#x27;s work, received the International Association of Art Critics USA Award for Best Museum Show Originating in New York City, considered one of the highest accolades in the museum profession. YES refers to the title of a 1966 sculptural work by Yoko Ono, shown at Indica Gallery, London: viewers climb a ladder to read the word &quot;yes&quot;, printed on a small canvas suspended from the ceiling. The exhibition&#x27;s curator Alexandra Munroe wrote that &quot;John Lennon got it, on his first meeting with Yoko: when he climbed the ladder to peer at the framed paper on the ceiling, he encountered the tiny word YES. &#x27;So it was positive. I felt relieved.&#x27;&quot; The exhibition traveled to 13 museums in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Korea from 2000 through 2003. In 2001, she received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Liverpool University and, in 2002, was presented with the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts from Bard College
and the Skowhegan Medal for work in assorted media. The next year, she was awarded the fifth MOCA Award to Distinguished Women in the Arts from the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles. In 2005, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Japan Society of New York, which had hosted &quot;Yes Yoko Ono&quot; and where she had worked in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

In 2008, she showed a large retrospective exhibition, &quot;Between The Sky and My Head&quot;, at the Kunsthalle Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany, and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, England. The following year, she showed a selection of new and old work as part of her show &quot;Anton&#x27;s Memory&quot; in Venice, Italy. She also received a Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement from the Venice Biennale in 2009. In 2012, Ono held a major exhibition of her work &quot;To The Light&quot; at the Serpentine Galleries, London. She was also the winner of the 2012 Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Austria&#x27;s highest award for applied contemporary art. In February 2013, to coincide with her 80th birthday, the largest retrospective of her work, &quot;Half-a-Wind Show&quot;, opened at the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt
and travelled to Denmark&#x27;s Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Austria&#x27;s Kunsthalle Krems, and Spain&#x27;s Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.
In 2014 she contributed several artworks to the triennial Folkestone art festival. In 2015 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City held a retrospective exhibition of her early work, &quot;Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960– 1971&quot;. In 2015, Yoko Ono received the European Cultural Centre Art Award for her continuing efforts to promote &quot;Imagine Peace&quot;.

== Political activism, social media and public appreciation ==

Ono has been an activist for peace and human rights since the 1960s. After she and Lennon married in Gibraltar, they held a March 1969 &quot;Bed-in for Peace&quot; in their honeymoon suite at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel. The newlyweds were eager to talk about and promote world peace; they wore pajamas and invited visitors and members of the press. Two months later, Ono and Lennon held another Bed-in at the Queen Elizabeth Fairmont in Montreal, where they recorded their first single, &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot;. The song became a top-20 hit for the newly christened Plastic Ono Band. Other performance/demonstrations with John included &quot;bagism&quot;, iterations with John of the &quot;Bag Piece&quot;s she introduced in the early 1960s, which encouraged a disregard for physical appearance in judging others. In December 1969, the two continued to spread their message of peace with billboards in 12 major world cities reading &quot;WAR IS OVER! If You Want It – Happy Christmas from John &amp; Yoko&quot;.

In the 1970s, Ono and Lennon became close to many radical, counterculture leaders, including Bobby Seale, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Michael X, John Sinclair (for whose rally in Michigan they flew to sing Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Free John Sinclair&quot; that effectively released the poet from prison), Angela Davis, and street musician David Peel. Friend and &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; author Kate Millett has said Ono inspired her activism. Ono and Lennon appeared on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, taking over hosting duties for a week. Ono spoke at length about the evils of racism and sexism. She remained outspoken in her support of feminism, and openly bitter about the racism she had experienced from rock fans, especially in the UK. Her reception within the US media was not much better. For example, an &quot;Esquire&quot; article of the period was titled &quot;John Rennon&#x27;s Excrusive Gloupie&quot; and featured an unflattering David Levine cartoon.

After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, Ono paid for billboards to be put up in New York City and Los Angeles that bore the image of Lennon&#x27;s blood-splashed spectacles. Early in 2002 she paid about £150,000 ($213,375) for a billboard in Piccadilly Circus with a line from Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;: &quot;Imagine all the people living life in peace.&quot; Later the same year, she inaugurated a peace award, the LennonOno Grant for Peace, by giving $50,000 (£31,900) in prize money originally to artists living &quot;in regions of conflict&quot;. The award is given out every two years in conjunction with the lighting of the Imagine Peace Tower, and was first given to Israeli and Palestinian artists. Its program has since expanded to include writers, such as Michael Pollan and Alice Walker, activists such as Vandana Shiva and Pussy Riot, organizations such as New York&#x27;s Center for Constitutional Rights, even an entire country (Iceland).

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2003, which was the eve of the Iraqi invasion by the US and UK, Ono heard about a couple, Andrew and Christine Gale, who were holding a love-in protest in their tiny bedroom in Addingham, West Yorkshire. She phoned them and said, &quot;It&#x27;s good to speak to you. We&#x27;re supporting you. We&#x27;re all sisters together.&quot; The couple said that songs like &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot; inspired their protest. In 2004, Ono remade her song &quot;Everyman... Everywoman...&quot; to support same-sex marriage, releasing remixes that included &quot;Every Man Has a Man Who Loves Him&quot; and &quot;Every Woman Has a Woman Who Loves Her&quot;.

In August 2011, she made the documentary film about the Bed-ins &quot;Bed Peace&quot; available for free on YouTube, and as part of her website &quot;Imagine Peace&quot;.
In January 2013, the 79-year-old Ono, along with Sean Lennon and Susan Sarandon, took to rural Pennsylvania in a bus under the banner of the Artists Against Fracking group she and Sean created with Mark Ruffalo in August 2012 to protest against hydraulic fracturing. Other group members include Lady Gaga and Alec Baldwin.

Ono promotes her art and shares inspirational messages and images through a robust and active Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook presence. In April 2014 her Twitter followers reached 4.69 million, while her Instagram followers exceeded 99,000. Her tweets are short instructional poems, comments on media and politics, and notes about performances.

In 1987, Ono travelled to Moscow to participate in the &quot;International Forum for a Nuclear-free World and for the Survival of Mankind&quot;. She also visited Leningrad, where she met with members of the local John Lennon memorial club. Among these members was Kolya Vasin, who was considered the biggest Beatles fan in the Soviet Union.

Public appreciation of Ono&#x27;s work has shifted over time and was helped by a retrospective at a Whitney Museum branch in 1989 and the 1992 release of the six-disc box set &quot;Onobox&quot;. Retrospectives of her artwork have also been presented at the Japan Society in New York City in 2001, in Bielefeld, Germany, and the UK in 2008, Frankfurt, and Bilbao, Spain, in 2013 and The Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2015. She received a Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement from the Venice Biennale in 2009 and the 2012 Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Austria&#x27;s highest award for applied contemporary art.

In January 2021, Ono was one of the founders of The Coda Collection, a service that launched in the U.S. via Amazon Prime Video Channels on February 18, 2021, the day Ono turned 88. The Coda Collection will feature a slew of music documentaries and concert films. Jim Spinello will run The Coda Channel. Yoko Ono added, &quot;John Lennon was always on the cutting edge of music and culture. The Coda Collection will be a new way for fans to connect on a deeper level.&quot;

==Public image==
For many years, Ono was frequently criticized by both the press and the public. She was blamed for the breakup of the Beatles and repeatedly criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music. Her experimental art was also not popularly accepted. The British press was particularly negative and prompted the couple&#x27;s move to the US. As late as December 1999, &quot;NME&quot; was calling her a &quot;no-talent charlatan&quot;.

===Relationship with the Beatles===

Lennon and Ono were injured in a car crash in June 1969, partway through recording &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. According to journalist Barry Miles, a bed with a microphone was then installed in the studio so that Ono could make artistic comments about the album. Miles thought Ono&#x27;s continual presence in the studio during the latter part of the Beatles&#x27; career put strain on Lennon&#x27;s relationship with the other band members. George Harrison got into a shouting match with Lennon after Ono took one of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking.

The English press dubbed Ono &quot;the woman who broke up the Beatles&quot;, which had been foreseen by Paul McCartney in 1969 during the group&#x27;s rehearsals for their film and album &quot;Let It Be&quot;, when he said &quot;It&#x27;s going to be such an incredible sort of comical thing, like, in fifty years&#x27; time, you know: &#x27;They broke up &#x27;cause Yoko sat on an amp. In an interview with Dick Cavett, Lennon explicitly denied that Ono broke up the Beatles, and Harrison said during an interview with Cavett that the problems within the group began long before Ono came onto the scene. Ono herself has said that the Beatles broke up without any direct involvement from her, adding &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could have tried even to break them up.&quot;

While the Beatles were together, every song written by Lennon or McCartney was credited as Lennon–McCartney regardless of whether the song was a collaboration or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, which originally credited the songs to McCartney–Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called &quot;Wings over America&quot;, which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney–J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon&#x27;s death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney–Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as &quot;Yesterday&quot;, but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving former Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making &quot;an attempt to rewrite history&quot;.

In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview in 1987, Ono pointed out McCartney&#x27;s place in the disintegration of the band. On the 1998 John Lennon anthology, &quot;Lennon Legend&quot;, the composer credit of &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; was changed to &quot;John Lennon&quot; from its original composing credit of &quot;Lennon–McCartney&quot;. Although Lennon wrote the song during his tenure with the Beatles, it was both written and recorded without the help of the band, and released as Lennon&#x27;s first independent single under the &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; moniker. Lennon subsequently expressed regret that he had not given co-writing credit to Ono instead, who actually helped him write the song. In 2002, McCartney released another live album, &quot;Back in the U.S. Live 2002&quot;, and the 19 Beatles songs included are described as &quot;composed by Paul McCartney and John Lennon&quot;, which reignited the debate over credits with Ono. Her spokesperson Elliott Mintz called it &quot;an attempt to rewrite history&quot;. Nevertheless, Ono did not sue.

In 1995, after the Beatles released Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot;, with demos provided by Ono, McCartney and his family collaborated with her and Sean to create the song &quot;Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue&quot;, which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of that Japanese city. Ono publicly compared Lennon to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival Antonio Salieri. This remark infuriated McCartney&#x27;s wife Linda, who was dying from breast cancer at the time. When Linda died less than a year later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife&#x27;s memorial service in Manhattan.

Accepting an award at the 2005 Q Awards, Ono mentioned that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, &quot;You&#x27;re a good songwriter. It&#x27;s not June with spoon that you write. You&#x27;re a good singer, and most musicians are probably a little bit nervous about covering your songs.&quot;

In an October 2010 interview, Ono spoke about Lennon&#x27;s &quot;lost weekend&quot; and her subsequent reconciliation with him. She credited McCartney with helping save her marriage to John. &quot;I want the world to know that it was a very touching thing that [Paul] did for John.&quot; While visiting Ono in March 1974, McCartney, on leaving, asked &quot;[W]hat will make you come back to John?&quot; McCartney subsequently passed her response to Lennon while visiting him in Los Angeles. &quot;John often said he didn&#x27;t understand why Paul did this for us, but he did.&quot; In 2012, McCartney revealed that he did not blame Ono for the breakup of the Beatles and credited Ono with inspiring much of Lennon&#x27;s post-Beatles work.

===Relationship with Julian Lennon===

Ono had a difficult relationship with her stepson Julian, but the relationship improved over the years. He expressed disappointment at her handling of Lennon&#x27;s estate, and at the difference between his upbringing and Sean&#x27;s, adding, &quot;when Dad gave up music for a couple of years to be with Sean, why couldn&#x27;t he do that with me?&quot; Julian was left out of his father&#x27;s will, and he battled Ono in court for years, settling in 1996 for an unspecified amount that the media reported was &quot;believed to&quot; be in the area of £20 million, which Julian has denied.

He has said that he is his &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot;, which Ono has cited as the reason why she was never able to get close to him: &quot;Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he&#x27;s too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind.&quot; Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian&#x27;s photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website.

Julian and his half-brother Sean are close.

===In art and popular culture===

Mary Beth Edelson&#x27;s &quot;Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper&quot; (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles; Ono was among those notable women artists. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became &quot;one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement&quot;.

The post-punk rock band Death of Samantha, founded in 1983, named themselves after a song from Ono&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Approximately Infinite Universe&quot;, also called &quot;Death of Samantha&quot;.

Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies&#x27; debut single was &quot;Be My Yoko Ono&quot;, first released in 1990 and later appearing on their 1992 album &quot;Gordon&quot;. The lyrics are &quot;a shy entreaty to a potential girlfriend, caged in terms that self-deflatingly compare himself to one of pop music&#x27;s foremost geniuses&quot;. It also has a &quot;sarcastic imitation of Yoko Ono&#x27;s unique vocal style in the bridge&quot;.

In 2000, American folk singer Dar Williams recorded a song titled &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Your Yoko Ono&quot;. Bryan Wawzenek of the website &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; described the song as &quot;us[ing] John and Yoko as a starting point for exploring love, and particularly, love between artists&quot;.

The British band Elbow mentioned Ono in their song &quot;New York Morning&quot; from their 2014 album &quot;The Take Off and Landing of Everything&quot; (&quot;Oh, my giddy aunt, New York can talk / It&#x27;s the modern Rome and folk are nice to Yoko&quot;). In response Ono posted an open letter to the band on her website, thanking them and reflecting on her and Lennon&#x27;s relationship with the city. In Public Enemy&#x27;s song &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;, Chuck D and Flavor Flav rap, &quot;Beat is for Sonny Bono/Beat is for Yoko Ono!&quot; Ono&#x27;s name also appears in the lyrics of the Le Tigre song &quot;Hot Topic&quot;, and the Tally Hall song &quot;&amp;&quot;.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; episode 1 of season 5, &quot;Homer&#x27;s Barbershop Quartet&quot;, Barney who is in Homer&#x27;s band, has creative disputes within the group when he falls in love with a Japanese conceptual artist who resembles Yoko Ono.

Ono was a central theme in English comedian James Acaster&#x27;s 2013 show &quot;Lawnmower&quot;, which was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award for Best Show.

<text>Martha Maria Yeardley Smith ( ; born July 3, 1964) is an American actress. She stars as the voice of Lisa Simpson on the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Smith began acting in 1982 after graduating from drama school. She moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. She made her film debut in 1985&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot;, followed by roles in &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot;. She moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and took a recurring role in the television series &quot;Brothers&quot;.

In 1987, Smith auditioned for the &quot;Simpsons&quot; shorts on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Smith intended to audition for the role of Bart Simpson, but the casting director felt her voice was too high, and she was cast as Bart&#x27;s sister Lisa. In 1989, the shorts were spun off into their own half-hour show, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. For her work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992.

Alongside &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Smith appeared in the sitcom &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot; as Louise, and had recurring appearances as Marlene on &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; and as Penny in two episodes of &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;. She has appeared in several films, including &quot;City Slickers&quot;, &quot;Just Write&quot;, &quot;Toys&quot;, and &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;. In 2004, Smith performed an off-Broadway one-woman show entitled &quot;More&quot; at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Aside from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot;. Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy &quot;Waiting For Ophelia&quot;, which had its world premiere at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009.

==Early life==
Smith was born on July 3, 1964, in Paris, France. Her father, Joseph Smith, worked for United Press International in Paris and moved to Washington, D.C., in 1966, where he became &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s first official obituary editor. Her mother, Martha Mayor, was a paper conservator for the Freer and Sackler Galleries at the Smithsonian Institution. Smith&#x27;s parents later divorced. Her maternal grandfather was art historian A. Hyatt Mayor, and among her great-grandparents were marine biologist and zoologist Alpheus Hyatt and artist and sculptor Harriet Randolph Hyatt Mayor. She is also the paternal niece of political scientist, historian, and Latin American studies specialist Peter H. Smith. Smith has labeled her family &quot;upper crust and reserved&quot;. As a child, Smith was often teased because of her unusual voice. Smith has stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve sounded pretty much the same way since I was six. Maybe [my voice is] a little deeper now.&quot; She made her acting debut in a sixth-grade play.

==Career==

===Early career===
Smith became a professional actress in 1982. After appearances in a number of school plays, she joined the local Arena Stage theater group on an apprenticeship, featuring in their production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. She went on to star in several other plays in Washington. She moved to New York City in 1984 and appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;The Real Thing&quot; alongside Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close.

Smith&#x27;s first film role came in &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot; (1985). She then played Putter in &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot; (also 1985). The film was a box office bomb and critically panned, although Smith &quot;thought it would be the movie that launched my career. And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died.&quot; When filming was over, she rejoined &quot;The Real Thing&quot; before being out of work for six months. Smith worried her career was over. However, the following year, she played Connie in Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; (1986), noting it was &quot;truly a dreadful film, but I had a great part in it.&quot;

Smith moved to Los Angeles in 1986 on the &quot;semi-promise&quot; of a part in a TV film. After the audition, the role was given to another actress. Smith realized &quot;that people don&#x27;t mean what they say. It&#x27;s not malicious. They just don&#x27;t realize how much impact they have on an impressionable actor – and all actors are impressionable.&quot; From then on, she decided to &quot;just sort of build a wall around myself&quot;, to cope with the disappointment of not getting a part. In Los Angeles, Smith appeared in theatrical productions of &quot;Living on Salvation Street&quot;, for which she was paid $14 for each performance, &quot;Boys and Girls/Men and Women&quot;, and &quot;How the Other Half Loves&quot;, and played the recurring role of Louella Waters on the Showtime series &quot;Brothers&quot;. She appeared in the films &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Ginger Ale Afternoon&quot; (1989) as &quot;trailer-park girls&quot;. She later spoke of her regrets of appearing in the latter in her one-woman show &quot;More&quot;.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot;===

Smith&#x27;s longest-running role is voicing Lisa Simpson on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She has voiced Lisa since 1987, beginning with &quot;The Simpsons shorts&quot; on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Lisa&#x27;s brother Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila thought her voice was too high. Smith later recalled &quot;I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, &#x27;Thanks for coming!&#x27;&quot; Smith was given the role of Lisa, instead. She denies rumors that she almost turned down the role, though admits she had never planned a career in voice-over work. Pietila stated that, having seen her in &quot;Living on Salvation Street&quot;, Smith was always her preferred choice. Smith lifts her voice up slightly to perform the role. Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, although in some earlier episodes, she provided some of Maggie&#x27;s squeaks and occasional speaking parts. Smith has only voiced characters other than Lisa on very rare occasions, with those characters usually being some derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in &quot;Last Tap Dance in Springfield&quot; and Lisa, Jr. in &quot;&quot; (both from season 11 in 2000). Smith spends two days a week recording the show.

Until 1998, Smith was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices. However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 per episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Smith earned $250,000 per episode. After salary renegotiations in 2008, the voice actors received about $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Smith and the other cast members accepted a 25% pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.
Despite her world-famous role, Smith is rarely recognized in public, which she does not mind, saying, &quot;it&#x27;s wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognise me solely from my voice.&quot; In a 2009 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she commented: &quot;It&#x27;s the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has bought me in my life.&quot;

Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992, but felt it was not worth anything, saying &quot;there&#x27;s part of me that feels it wasn&#x27;t even a real Emmy.&quot; The Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance is a Creative Arts and not handed out during the primetime telecast and, prior to 2009, was a juried award without nominations. However, Smith says &quot;if I had to be associated with one character in fiction, I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson.&quot; The show&#x27;s creator Matt Groening has called Smith very similar to Lisa: &quot;Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, &#x27;No, I wouldn&#x27;t say that. Writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot;, as able &quot;to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic&quot;.

===Further career===
From 1991 to 1994, alongside &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Smith was one of the lead cast members in the sitcom &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot; as Louise. Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;, and Penny in two episodes of &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;. Smith has also appeared in &quot;Phil of the Future&quot; and &quot;Teen Angel&quot;. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991&#x27;s &quot;City Slickers&quot; earned her &quot;more attention than all [her] previous roles combined&quot;, and taught her &quot;that it&#x27;s far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees.&quot; In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film &quot;Just Write&quot;. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Toys&quot; and James L. Brooks&#x27; &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;. Brooks, who is also executive producer of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, had cast Smith in his 1994 film &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; (in one of the film&#x27;s musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot;. She &quot;had a voice-over agent for about two years, and I used to go out [on auditions] all the time, but it never really came to anything. Everybody said, &#x27;Oh Yeardley, you&#x27;ll clean up,&#x27; and that was definitely not the case.&quot;

In 2004, Smith performed her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled &quot;More&quot; at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Directed by Judith Ivey, the play is about her mixed feelings over the success of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, her parents, her relationships, and her struggles with bulimia. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Margo Jefferson called it an &quot;appealing if overlong show&quot;, adding that &quot;The career narrative needed shortening. This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn&#x27;t taint the best parts of &quot;More.&quot; It is refreshing to hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame-driven and about not getting the degree or the kind of fame you craved. It&#x27;s fun to watch a skilled actress use her craft to the full.&quot; She would later perform the play for three weeks in Los Angeles the following year.

Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy &quot;Waiting for Ophelia&quot;, which was released in 2009. She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said: &quot;I loved it. I never get to play parts like that. I always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me.&quot; Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she &quot;believe[d] in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie&quot;, and added: &quot;You can support art even if it&#x27;s not going to make a zillion dollars.&quot; It premiered on April 4, 2009, at the Phoenix Film Festival.

In 2011, Smith starred as Ms. Miller in the movie &quot;The Chaperone&quot; alongside Triple H and Ariel Winter.

In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Smith and others told the stories of the people killed there. On March 30, 2019, Smith was honored with the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s National Leadership Award in Los Angeles for her work as an advocate of the LGBT community.

In 2017, Smith started a podcast, &quot;Small Town Dicks&quot;, which explores real life crime in small towns in the United States. Smith had co-hosted the podcast with actress and long-time friend Zibby Allen until March 2019 when the two filed lawsuits against one another, with Allen accusing Smith of pushing her out of ownership and profit rights from the show.

==Politics==
Smith is a lifelong Democrat.

In 2018, Smith mocked Republican Ted Cruz after he labeled the Democratic Party as &quot;the party of Lisa Simpson&quot;. Smith recommended that people of differing political views should be able to work together on gun control, promoting gay rights and environmentalism.

==Personal life==
Smith married English-Canadian actor Christopher Grove in 1990. They were divorced in 1992, citing irreconcilable differences.

In a 1997 interview with &quot;The Daily Targum&quot;, Smith stated &quot;I am shy, but I have an extroverted persona which I can draw on when I need to,&quot; and that she is a &quot;private&quot; actress.

She married Daniel Erickson in 2002; the marriage lasted for six years and Smith filed for divorce on May 21, 2008, citing irreconcilable differences.

In 2009, she commented, &quot;People have said to me that I&#x27;m unassuming. It&#x27;s true, I&#x27;m the worst celebrity ever. But I&#x27;m trying to become better.&quot;

Smith had bulimia when she was a teenager. She noted &quot;It would make me high, I would feel endorphins and this great sense of victory.&quot;

Smith enjoys writing and painting. During the first season of &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot;, Smith taught herself to paint by copying other artists. The book &quot;Just Humor Me&quot; includes a story, &quot;The Race&quot;, written by Smith. She has written a children&#x27;s book, &quot;I, Lorelei&quot;, which was published by HarperCollins in February 2009.

In 2011, Smith launched a women&#x27;s shoe line called Marchez Vous.

In November 2021, Yeardley was noted for producing a podcast on the murder of Sheila Anderson, one of Scotland&#x27;s most notorious unsolved murders.

On June 11, 2022, Smith married one of the co-hosts of her podcast, &quot;Small Town Dicks&quot;, Detective (Ret) Dan Grice. She met him while he was providing personal security for her during a &quot;Simpsons&quot; event.

<text>Yerevan ( , , ; ; sometimes spelled Erevan) is the capital and largest city of Armenia, as well as one of the world&#x27;s oldest continuously inhabited cities. Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of the country, as its primate city. It has been the capital since 1918, the fourteenth in the history of Armenia and the seventh located in or around the Ararat Plain. The city also serves as the seat of the Araratian Pontifical Diocese, which is the largest diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church and one of the oldest dioceses in the world.

The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by King Argishti I of Urartu at the western extreme of the Ararat Plain. Erebuni was &quot;designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital.&quot; By the late ancient Armenian Kingdom, new capital cities were established and Yerevan declined in importance. The city was mostly depopulated by the Great Surgun of 1603–05, when the Safavid Empire forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of Armenians to Iran. In 1679, the city was mostly destroyed by an earthquake, and then rebuilt on a smaller scale. In 1828, Yerevan became part of the Russian Empire, which led to the repatriation of Armenians whose ancestors had been forcibly relocated in the 17th century. After World War I, Yerevan became the capital of the First Republic of Armenia as thousands of survivors of the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire arrived in the area. The city expanded rapidly during the 20th century while Armenia was a part of the Soviet Union. In a few decades, Yerevan was transformed from a provincial town within the Russian Empire to Armenia&#x27;s principal cultural, artistic, and industrial center, as well as becoming the seat of national government.

With the growth of the Armenian economy, Yerevan has undergone major transformation. Much construction has been done throughout the city since the early 2000s, and retail outlets such as restaurants, shops, and street cafés, which were rare during Soviet times, have multiplied. , the population of Yerevan was 1,060,138, just over 35% of Armenia&#x27;s total population. By 2022, the population further increased to 1,086,677. Yerevan was named the 2012 World Book Capital by UNESCO. Yerevan is an associate member of Eurocities.

Of the notable landmarks of Yerevan, Erebuni Fortress is considered to be the birthplace of the city, the Katoghike Tsiranavor church is the oldest surviving church of Yerevan, and Saint Gregory Cathedral is the largest Armenian cathedral in the world. Tsitsernakaberd is the official memorial to the victims of the Armenian genocide. The city is home to several opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions. Yerevan Opera Theatre is the main spectacle hall of the Armenian capital, the National Gallery of Armenia is the largest art museum in Armenia and shares a building with the History Museum of Armenia, and the Matenadaran contains one of the largest depositories of ancient books and manuscripts in the world.

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the name is unknown. One theory regarding the origin of Yerevan&#x27;s name is the city was named after the Armenian king, Yervand (Orontes) IV, the last ruler of Armenia from the Orontid dynasty, and founder of the city of Yervandashat. However, it is likely that the city&#x27;s name is derived from the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni, which was founded on the territory of modern-day Yerevan in 782 BC by Argishti I. &quot;Erebuni&quot; may derive from the Urartian word for &quot;to take&quot; or &quot;to capture,&quot; meaning that the fortress&#x27;s name could be interpreted as &quot;capture,&quot; &quot;conquest,&quot; or &quot;victory.&quot; As elements of the Urartian language blended with that of the Armenian one, the name eventually evolved into &quot;Yerevan&quot; (Erebuni = Erevani = Erevan = Yerevan). Scholar Margarit Israelyan notes these changes when comparing inscriptions found on two cuneiform tablets at Erebuni:

Early Christian Armenian chroniclers connected the origin of the city&#x27;s name to the legend of Noah&#x27;s Ark. After the ark had landed on Mount Ararat and the flood waters had receded, Noah, while looking in the direction of Yerevan, is said to have exclaimed &quot;Yerevats!&quot; (&quot;it appeared!&quot; in Armenian), from which originated the name Yerevan.

In the late medieval and early modern periods, when Yerevan was under Turkic and later Persian rule, the city was known in Persian as (). The city was officially known as Erivan () under Russian rule during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The city was renamed back to Yerevan (Ереван) in 1936. Up until the mid-1970s the city&#x27;s name was spelled Erevan more often than Yerevan in English sources.

==Symbols==

The principal symbol of Yerevan is Mount Ararat, which is visible from any area in the capital. The seal of the city is a crowned lion on a pedestal with a shield that has a depiction of Mount Ararat on the upper part and half of an Armenian eternity sign on the bottom part. The emblem is a rectangular shield with a blue border.

On 27 September 2004, Yerevan adopted an anthem, &quot;Erebuni-Yerevan&quot;, using lyrics written by Paruyr Sevak and set to music composed by Edgar Hovhannisyan. It was selected in a competition for a new anthem and new flag that would best represent the city. The chosen flag has a white background with the city&#x27;s seal in the middle, surrounded by twelve small red triangles that symbolize the twelve historic capitals of Armenia. The flag includes the three colours of the Armenian National flag. The lion is portrayed on the orange background with blue edging.

==History==


===Pre-history and pre-classical era===
The territory of Yerevan has been inhabited since approximately the 2nd half of the 4th millennium BC. The southern part of the city currently known as Shengavit has been populated since at least 3200 BC, during the period of Kura–Araxes culture of the early Bronze Age. The first excavations at the Shengavit historical site was conducted between 1936 and 1938 under the guidance of archaeologist Yevgeny Bayburdyan. After two decades, archaeologist Sandro Sardarian resumed the excavations starting from 1958 until 1983. The 3rd phase of the excavations started in 2000, under the guidance of archaeologist Hakob Simonyan. In 2009, Simonyan was joined by Mitchell S. Rothman from the Widener University of Pennsylvania. Together they conducted three series of excavations in 2009, 2010, and 2012 respectively. During the process, a full stratigraphic column to bedrock was reached, showing there to be 8 or 9 distinct stratigraphic levels. These levels cover a time between 3200 BC and 2500 BC. Evidences of later use of the site, possibly until 2200 BC, were also found. The excavation process revealed a series of large round buildings with square adjoining rooms and minor round buildings. A series of ritual installations was discovered in 2010 and 2012.

===Erebuni===

The ancient kingdom of Urartu was formed in the 9th century BC by King Arame in the basin of Lake Van of the Armenian Highland, including the territory of modern-day Yerevan. Archaeological evidence, such as a cuneiform inscription, indicates that the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni was founded in 782 BC by the orders of King Argishti I at the site of modern-day Yerevan, to serve as a fort and citadel guarding against attacks from the north Caucasus. The cuneiform inscription found at Erebuni Fortress reads:
During the height of the Urartian power, irrigation canals and artificial reservoirs were built in Erebuni and its surrounding territories.

In the mid-7th century BC, the city of Teishebaini was built by Rusa II of Urartu, around west of Erebuni Fortress. It was fortified on a hill -currently known as Karmir Blur within Shengavit District of Yerevan- to protect the eastern borders of Urartu from the barbaric Cimmerians and Scythians. During excavations, the remains of a governors palace that contained a hundred and twenty rooms spreading across more than was found, along with a citadel dedicated to the Urartian god Teisheba. The construction of the city of Teishebaini, as well as the palace and the citadel was completed by the end of the 7th century BC, during the reign of Rusa III. However, Teishebaini was destroyed by an alliance of Medes and the Scythians in 585 BC.

===Median and Achaemenid rules===
In 590 BC, following the fall of the Kingdom of Urartu at the hands of the Iranian Medes, Erebuni along with the Armenian Highlands became part of the Median Empire.

However, in 550 BC, the Median Empire was conquered by Cyrus the Great, and Erebuni became part of the Achaemenid Empire. Between 522 BC and 331 BC, Erebuni was one of the main centers of the Satrapy of Armenia, a region controlled by the Orontid dynasty as one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire. The Satrapy of Armenia was divided into two parts: the northern part and the southern part, with the cities of Erebuni (Yerevan) and Tushpa (Van) as their centres, respectively.

Coins issued in 478 BC, along with many other items found in the Erebuni Fortress, reveal the importance of Erebuni as a major centre for trade under Achaemenid rule.

===Ancient Kingdom of Armenia===
After Alexander the Great&#x27;s victory over the Achaemenid Empire, the Orontid rulers of the Armenian satrapy achieved independence as a result of the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, founding the Kingdom of Armenia. With the establishment of new cities such as Armavir, Zarehavan, Bagaran and Yervandashat, the importance of Erebuni gradually declined.

With the rise of the Artaxiad dynasty of Armenia who seized power in 189 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia greatly expanded to include major territories of Asia Minor, Atropatene, Iberia, Phoenicia and Syria. The Artaxiads considered Erebuni and Tushpa as cities of Persian heritage. Consequently, new cities and commercial centres were built by Kings Artaxias I, Artavasdes I and Tigranes the Great. Thus, with the dominance of cities such as Artaxata and Tigranocerta, Erebuni significantly lost its importance as a central city.
Under the rule of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia (54–428 AD), many other cities around Erebuni including Vagharshapat and Dvin flourished. Consequently, Erebuni was completely neutralized, losing its role as an economic and strategic centre of Armenia. During the period of the Arsacid kings, Erebuni was only recorded in a Manichaean text of the 3rd century, where it is mentioned that one of the disciples of the prophet Mani founded a Manichaean community near the Christian community in Erebuni.

According to the medieval Armenian geography &quot;Ashkharhatsuyts&quot;, Erebuni was part of the canton () of Kotayk (not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province) of the province of Ayrarat, within Armenia Major.

Armenia became a Christian nation in the early 4th century AD, during the reign of the Arsacid king Tiridates III.

===Sasanian and Roman periods===
Following the partition of Armenia by the Byzantine and Sasanian empires in 387 and in 428, Erebuni and the entire territory of Eastern Armenia came under the rule of Sasanian Persia. The Armenian territories formed the province of Persian Armenia within the Sasanian Empire.

Due to the diminished role of Erebuni, as well as the absence of proper historical data, much of the city&#x27;s history under the Sasanian rule is unknown.

In 587, during the reign of emperor Maurice, Yerevan and much of Armenia came under Roman administration after the Romans defeated the Sassanid Persian Empire at the battle of the Blarathon. Soon after, Katoghike Tsiranavor Church in Avan was built between 595 and 602. Despite being partly damaged during the 1679 earthquake), it is the oldest surviving church within modern Yerevan city limits.

The province of Persian Armenia (also known as Persarmenia) lasted until 646, when the province was dissolved with the Muslim conquest of Persia.

===Arab Islamic invasion===

In 658 AD, at the height of the Arab Islamic invasions, Erebuni-Yerevan was conquered during the Muslim conquest of Persia, as it was part of Persian-ruled Armenia. The city became part of the Emirate of Armenia under the Umayyad Caliphate. The city of Dvin was the centre of the newly created emirate. Starting from this period, as a result of the developing trade activities with the Arabs, the Armenian territories had gained strategic importance as a crossroads for the Arab caravan routes passing between Europe and India through the Arab-controlled Ararat Plain of Armenia. Most probably, &quot;Erebuni&quot; has become known as &quot;Yerevan&quot; since at least the 7th century AD.

===Bagratid Armenia===
After two centuries of Islamic rule over Armenia, the Bagratid prince Ashot I of Armenia led the revolution against the Abbasid Caliphate. Ashot I liberated Yerevan in 850, and was recognized as the Prince of Princes of Armenia by the Abbasid Caliph al-Musta&#x27;in in 862. Ashot was later crowned King of Armenia through the consent of Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tamid in 885. During the rule of the Bagratuni dynasty of Armenia between 885 and 1045, Yerevan was relatively a secure part of the Kingdom before falling to the Byzantines.

However, Yerevan did not have any strategic role during the reign of the Bagratids, who developed many other cities of Ayrarat, such as Shirakavan, Dvin, and Ani.

===Seljuk period, Zakarid Armenia and Mongol rule===

After a brief Byzantine rule over Armenia between 1045 and 1064, the invading Seljuks—led by Tughril and later by his successor Alp Arslan—ruled over the entire region, including Yerevan. However, with the establishment of the Zakarid Principality of Armenia in 1201 under the Georgian protectorate, the Armenian territories of Yerevan and Lori had significantly grown. After the Mongols captured Ani in 1236, Armenia turned into a Mongol protectorate as part of the Ilkhanate, and the Zakarids became vassals to the Mongols. After the fall of the Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century, the Zakarid princes ruled over Lori, Shirak and the Ararat Plain until 1360 when they fell to the invading Turkic tribes.

===Aq Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu tribes===
During the last quarter of the 14th century, the Aq Qoyunlu Sunni Oghuz Turkic tribe took over Armenia, including Yerevan. In 1400, Timur invaded Armenia and Georgia, and captured more than 60,000 of the survived local people as slaves. Many districts including Yerevan were depopulated.

In 1410, Armenia fell under the control of the Kara Koyunlu Shia Oghuz Turkic tribe. According to the Armenian historian Thomas of Metsoph, although the Kara Koyunlu levied heavy taxes against the Armenians, the early years of their rule were relatively peaceful and some reconstruction of towns took place. The Kara Koyunlus made Yerevan the centre of the newly formed &quot;Chukhur Saad&quot; administrative territory. The territory was named after a Turkic leader known as &quot;Emir Saad&quot;.

However, this peaceful period was shattered with the rise of Qara Iskander between 1420 and 1436, who reportedly made Armenia a &quot;desert&quot; and subjected it to &quot;devastation and plunder, to slaughter, and captivity&quot;. The wars of Iskander and his eventual defeat against the Timurids, invited further destruction in Armenia, as many more Armenians were taken captive and sold into slavery and the land was subjected to outright pillaging, forcing many of them to leave the region.

Following the fall of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375, the seat of the Armenian Church was transferred from Sis back to Vagharshapat near Yerevan in 1441. Thus, Yerevan became the main economic, cultural and administrative centre in Armenia.

===Iranian rule===

In 1501–02, most of the Eastern Armenian territories including Yerevan were swiftly conquered by the emerging Safavid dynasty of Iran led by Shah Ismail I. Soon after in 1502, Yerevan became the centre of the Erivan Province, a new administrative territory of Iran formed by the Safavids. For the following 3 centuries, it remained, with brief intermissions, under the Iranian rule. Due to its strategic significance, Yerevan was initially often fought over, and passed back and forth, between the dominion of the rivaling Iranian and Ottoman Empire, until it permanently became controlled by the Safavids. In 1555, Iran had secured its legitimate possession over Yerevan with the Ottomans through the Treaty of Amasya.

In 1582–1583, the Ottomans led by Serdar Ferhad Pasha took brief control over Yerevan. Ferhad Pasha managed to build the Erivan Fortress on the ruins of one thousand-years old ancient Armenian fortress, on the shores of Hrazdan river. However, Ottoman control ended in 1604 when the Persians regained Yerevan as a result of first Ottoman-Safavid War.

Shah Abbas I of Persia who ruled between 1588 and 1629, ordered the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Armenians including citizens from Yerevan to mainland Persia. As a consequence, Yerevan significantly lost its Armenian population who had declined to 20%, while Muslims including Persians, Turks, Kurds and Tatars gained dominance with around 80% of the city&#x27;s population. Muslims were either sedentary, semi-sedentary, or nomadic. Armenians mainly occupied the Kond neighbourhood of Yerevan and the rural suburbs around the city. However, the Armenians dominated over various professions and trade in the area and were of great economic significance to the Persian administration.
During the second Ottoman-Safavid War, Ottoman troops under the command of Sultan Murad IV conquered the city on 8 August 1635. Returning in triumph to Constantinople, he opened the &quot;Yerevan Kiosk&quot; (&quot;Revan Köşkü&quot;) in Topkapı Palace in 1636. However, Iranian troops commanded by Shah Safi retook Yerevan on 1 April 1636. As a result of the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639, the Iranians reconfirmed their control over Eastern Armenia, including Yerevan. On 7 June 1679, a devastating earthquake razed the city to the ground.

In 1724, the Erivan Fortress was besieged by the Ottoman army. After a period of resistance, the fortress fell to the Turks. As a result of the Ottoman invasion, the Erivan Province of the Safavids was dissolved.

Following a brief period of Ottoman rule over Eastern Armenia between 1724 and 1736, and as a result of the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1736, Yerevan along with the adjacent territories became part of the newly formed administrative territory of Erivan Khanate under the Afsharid dynasty of Iran, which encompassed an area of . The Afsharids controlled Eastern Armenia from the mid-1730s until the 1790s. Following the fall of the Afsharids, the Qajar dynasty of Iran took control of Eastern Armenia until 1828, when the region was conquered by the Russian Empire after their victory over the Qajars that resulted in the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828.

===Russian rule===

During the second Russo-Persian War of the 19th century, the Russo-Persian War of 1826–28, Yerevan was captured by Russian troops under general Ivan Paskevich on 1 October 1827. It was formally ceded by the Iranians in 1828, following the Treaty of Turkmenchay. After 3 centuries of Iranian occupation, Yereven along with the rest of Eastern Armenia designated as the &quot;Armenian Oblast&quot;, became part of the Russian Empire, a period that would last until the collapse of the Empire in 1917.

Although not mentioned specifically by name, article XV of the Turkmenchay treaty was intended solely for the repatriation of those Armenians whose ancestors had been forcibly relocated to Iran in the early 17th century during the Safavid period. The Russians sponsored the resettlement process of the Armenian population from Persia and Turkey and spread announcements in Armenian villages. Due to the resettlement, the percentage of the Armenian population of Yerevan increased from 28% to 53.8%. The resettlement was intended to create Russian power bridgehead in the Middle East. In 1829, Armenian repatriates from Persia were resettled in the city and a new quarter was built.

Yerevan served as the seat of the newly formed Armenian Oblast between 1828 and 1840. By the time of Nicholas I&#x27;s visit in 1837, Yerevan had become an &quot;uezd&quot; (&quot;county&quot;). In 1840, the Armenian Oblast was dissolved and its territory incorporated into a new larger province; the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate. In 1850 the territory of the former oblast was reorganized into the Erivan Governorate, covering an area of . Yerevan was the centre of the newly established governorate.
At that period, Yerevan was a small town with narrow roads and alleys, including the central quarter of &quot;Shahar&quot;, the &quot;Ghantar&quot; commercial centre, and the residential neighbourhoods of Kond, Dzoragyugh, Nork and Shentagh. During the 1840s and the 1850s, many schools were opened in the city. However, the first major plan of Yerevan was adopted in 1856, during which, Saint Hripsime and Saint Gayane women&#x27;s colleges were founded and the English Park was opened. In 1863, the Astafyan Street was redeveloped and opened. In 1874, Zacharia Gevorkian opened Yerevan&#x27;s first printing house, while the first theatre opened its doors in 1879.

On 1 October 1879, Yerevan was granted the status of a city through a decree issued by Alexander II of Russia. In 1881, The Yerevan Teachers&#x27; Seminary and the Yerevan Brewery were opened, followed by the Tairyan&#x27;s wine and brandy factory in 1887. Other factories for alcoholic beverages and mineral water were opened during the 1890s. The monumental church of Saint Gregory the Illuminator was opened in 1900. Electricity and telephone lines were introduced to the city in 1907 and 1913 respectively. When British traveller H. F. B. Lynch visited Yerevan in 1893–1894, he considered it an Oriental city. However, this started to change in the first decade of the 20th century, in the penultimate decade of Imperial Russian rule, when the city grew and altered dramatically. In general, Yerevan rapidly grew under Russian rule, both economically and politically. Old buildings were torn down and new buildings of European style were erected.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan city&#x27;s population was over 29,000. In 1902, a railway line linked Yerevan with Alexandropol, Tiflis and Julfa. In the same year, Yerevan&#x27;s first public library was opened. In 1905, the grandnephew of Napoleon I; prince Louis Joseph Jérôme Napoléon (1864–1932) was appointed as governor of Yerevan province. In 1913, for the first time in the city, a telephone line with eighty subscribers became operational.

Yerevan served as the centre of the governorate until 1917, when Erivan governorate was dissolved with the collapse of the Russian Empire.

===Brief independence===

At the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan was a small city with a population of 30,000. In 1917, the Russian Empire ended with the October Revolution. In the aftermath, Armenian, Georgian and Muslim leaders of Transcaucasia united to form the Transcaucasian Federation and proclaimed Transcaucasia&#x27;s secession.

The Federation, however, was short-lived. After gaining control over Alexandropol, the Turkish army was advancing towards the south and east to eliminate the center of Armenian resistance based in Yerevan. On 21 May 1918, the Turks started their campaign moving towards Yerevan via Sardarabad. Catholicos Gevorg V ordered that church bells peal for 6 days as Armenians from all walks of life – peasants, poets, blacksmiths, and even the clergymen – rallied to form organized military units. Civilians, including children, aided in the effort as well, as &quot;Carts drawn by oxen, water buffalo, and cows jammed the roads bringing food, provisions, ammunition, and volunteers from the vicinity&quot; of Yerevan.

By the end of May 1918, Armenians were able to defeat the Turkish army in the battles of Sardarabad, Abaran and Karakilisa. Thus, on 28 May 1918, the Dashnak leader Aram Manukian declared the independence of Armenia. Subsequently, Yerevan became the capital and the center of the newly founded Republic of Armenia, although the members of the Armenian National Council were yet to stay in Tiflis until their arrival in Yerevan to form the government in the summer of the same year. Armenia became a parliamentary republic with four administrative divisions. The capital Yerevan was part of the &quot;Araratian Province&quot;. At the time, Yerevan received more than 75,000 refugees from Western Armenia, who escaped the massacres perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks during the Armenian genocide.

On 26 May 1919, the government passed a law to open the Yerevan State University, which was located on the main Astafyan (now Abovyan) street of Yerevan.

After the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920, Armenia was granted formal international recognition. The United States, as well as many South American countries, officially opened diplomatic channels with the government of independent Armenia. Yerevan had also opened representatives in Great Britain, Italy, Germany, Serbia, Greece, Iran and Japan.

However, after the short period of independence, Yerevan fell to the Bolsheviks, and Armenia was incorporated into Soviet Russia on 2 December 1920. Although nationalist forces managed to retake the city in February 1921 and successfully released all the imprisoned political and military figures, the city&#x27;s nationalist elite were once again defeated by the Soviet forces on 2 April 1921.

===Soviet rule===


The Red Soviet Army invaded Armenia on 29 November 1920 from the northeast. On 2 December 1920, Yerevan along with the other territories of the Republic of Armenia, became part of Soviet Russia, known as the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. However, the Armenian SSR formed the Transcaucasian SFSR (TSFSR) together with the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, between 1922 and 1936.

Under the Soviet rule, Yerevan became the first among the cities in the Soviet Union for which a general plan was developed. The &quot;General Plan of Yerevan&quot; developed by the academician Alexander Tamanian, was approved in 1924. It was initially designed for a population of 150,000. The city was quickly transformed into a modern industrial metropolis of over one million people. New educational, scientific and cultural institutions were founded as well.

Tamanian incorporated national traditions with contemporary urban construction. His design presented a radial-circular arrangement that overlaid the existing city and incorporated much of its existing street plan. As a result, many historic buildings were demolished, including churches, mosques, the Erivan Fortress, baths, bazaars and caravanserais. Many of the districts around central Yerevan were named after former Armenian communities that were destroyed by the Ottoman Turks during the Armenian genocide. The districts of Arabkir, Malatia-Sebastia and Nork Marash, for example, were named after the towns Arabkir, Malatya, Sebastia, and Marash, respectively. After the end of World War II, German POWs were used to help in the construction of new buildings and structures, such as the Kievyan Bridge.

Within the years, the central Kentron district has become the most developed area in Yerevan, something that created a significant gap compared with other districts in the city. Most of the educational, cultural and scientific institutions were centred in the Kentron district.

In 1965, during the commemorations of the fiftieth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Yerevan was the location of a demonstration, the first such demonstration in the Soviet Union, to demand recognition of the Genocide by the Soviet authorities. In 1968, the city&#x27;s 2,750th anniversary was commemorated.

Yerevan played a key role in the Armenian national democratic movement that emerged during the Gorbachev era of the 1980s. The reforms of Glasnost and Perestroika opened questions on issues such as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the environment, Russification, corruption, democracy, and eventually independence. At the beginning of 1988, nearly one million Armenians from several regions of Armenia engaged in demonstrations concerning these subjects, centered in the city&#x27;s Theater Square (currently Freedom Square).

===Modern independence===

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yerevan became the capital of Armenia on 21 September 1991. Maintaining supplies of gas and electricity proved difficult; constant electricity was not restored until 1996 amidst the chaos of the badly instigated and planned transition to a market-based economy.

Since 2000, central Yerevan has been transformed into a vast construction site, with cranes erected all over the Kentron district. Officially, the scores of multi-storied buildings are part of large-scale urban planning projects. Roughly $1.8 billion was spent on such construction in 2006, according to the national statistical service. Prices for downtown apartments have increased by about ten times during the first decade of the 21st century. Many new streets and avenues were opened, such as the Argishti street, Italy street, Saralanj Avenue, Monte Melkonian Avenue, and the Northern Avenue.

However, as a result of this construction boom, the majority of the historic buildings located on the central Aram Street, were either entirely destroyed or transformed into modern residential buildings through the construction of additional floors. Only a few structures were preserved, mainly in the portion that extends between Abovyan Street and Mashtots Avenue.

The first major post-independence protest in Yerevan took place in September 1996, after the announcement of incumbent Levon Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s victory in the presidential election. Major opposition parties of the time, consolidated around the former Karabakh Committee member and former Prime Minister Vazgen Manukyan, organized mass demonstrations between 23 and 25 September, claiming electoral fraud by Ter-Petrosyan. An estimated of 200,000 people gathered in the Freedom Square to protest the election results. After a series of riot and violent protests around the Parliament building on 25 September, the government sent tanks and troops to Yerevan to enforce the ban on rallies and demonstrations on the following day. Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Minister of National Security Serzh Sargsyan announced on the Public Television of Armenia that their respective agencies have prevented an attempted coup d&#x27;état.

In February 2008, unrest in the capital between the authorities and opposition demonstrators led by ex-President Levon Ter-Petrosyan took place after the 2008 Armenian presidential election. The events resulted in 10 deaths and a subsequent 20-day state of emergency declared by President Robert Kocharyan.

In July 2016, a group of armed men calling themselves the &quot;Daredevils of Sassoun&quot; ( &quot;Sasna Tsrrer&quot;) stormed a police station in Erebuni District of Yerevan, taking several hostages, demanding the release of opposition leader Jirair Sefilian and the resignation of President Serzh Sargsyan. 3 policeman were killed as a result of the attack. Many anti-government protestors held rallies in solidarity with the gunmen. However, after 2 weeks of negotiations, the crisis ended and the gunmen surrendered.

==Geography==
===Topography and cityscape===
Yerevan has an average height of , with a minimum of and a maximum of above sea level in its southwestern and northeastern sections, respectively. It is among the fifty highest cities in the world with over 1 million inhabitants.

Yerevan is located on the banks of the Hrazdan River, northeast of the Ararat Plain, in the central-western part of the country. The upper part of the city is surrounded with mountains on three sides while it descends to the banks of the river Hrazdan at the south. The Hrazdan divides Yerevan into two parts through a picturesque canyon.
The city is situated at the heart of the Armenian Highland. Historically, Yerevan was located in the Kotayk canton ( &quot;Kotayk gavar&quot;, not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province) of the Ayrarat province of historic Armenia Major.

According to the current administrative division of Armenia, Yerevan is not part of any &quot;marz&quot; (&quot;province&quot;) and has special administrative status as the country&#x27;s capital. It is bordered by Kotayk Province to the north and the east, Ararat Province to the south and the south-west, Armavir Province to the west and Aragatsotn Province to the north-west.

The Erebuni State Reserve, formed in 1981, is located around 8 km southeast of the city centre within the Erebuni District of the city. At a height between 1300 and 1450 meters above sea level, the reserve occupies an area of 120 hectares, mainly consisting of semi-deserted mountain-steppes.

===Climate===

Yerevan features a continental influenced steppe climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot; or &quot;cold semi-arid climate&quot;, Trewartha climate classification &quot;BSao&quot;), with long, hot, dry summers and short, but cold and snowy winters. This is attributed to Yerevan being on a plain surrounded by mountains and to its distance from the sea and its moderating effects. The summers are usually very hot with the temperature in August reaching up to , and winters generally carry snowfall and freezing temperatures with January often being as cold as and lower. The amount of precipitation is small, amounting annually to about . Yerevan experiences an average of 2,700 sunshine hours per year. On 12 July 2018, Yerevan recorded a temperature of , which is the joint highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Armenia.

===Architecture===

The Yerevan TV Tower is the tallest structure in the city and one of the tallest structures in the South Caucasus.

The Republic Square, the Yerevan Opera Theatre, and the Yerevan Cascade are among the main landmarks at the centre of Yerevan, mainly developed based on the original design of architect Alexander Tamanian, and the revised plan of architect Jim Torosyan.

A major redevelopment process has been launched in Yerevan since 2000. As a result, many historic structures have been demolished and replaced with new buildings. This urban renewal plan has been met with opposition and criticism from some residents, as the projects destroy historic buildings dating back to the period of the Russian Empire, and often leave residents homeless. Downtown houses deemed too small are increasingly demolished and replaced by high-rise buildings.
The Saint Gregory Cathedral, the new building of Yerevan City Council, the new section of Matenadaran institute, the new terminal of Zvartnots International Airport, the Cafesjian Center for the Arts at the Cascade, the Northern Avenue, and the new government complex of ministries are among the major construction projects fulfilled during the first two decades of the 21st century.

Aram Street of old Yerevan and the newly built Northern Avenue are respectively among the notable examples featuring the traditional and modern architectural characteristics of Yerevan.

As of May 2017, Yerevan is home to 4,883 residential apartment buildings, and 65,199 street lamps installed on 39,799 street light posts, covering a total length of 1,514 km. The city has 1,080 streets with a total length of 750 km.

===Parks===

Yerevan is a densely built city but still offers several public parks throughout its districts, graced with mid-sized green gardens. The public park of Erebuni District along with its artificial lake is the oldest garden in the city. Occupying an area of 17 hectares, the origins of the park and the artificial lake date back to the period of king Argishti I of Urartu during the 8th century BCE. In 2011, the garden was entirely remodelled and named as Lyon Park, to become a symbol of the partnership between the cities of Lyon and Yerevan.

The Lovers&#x27; Park on Marshal Baghramyan Avenue and the English Park at the centre of the city, dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries respectively, are among the most popular parks in Yerevan. The Yerevan Botanical Garden (opened in 1935), the Victory Park (opened in the 1950s) and the Circular Park are among the largest green spaces of the city.

Opened in the 1960s, the Yerevan Opera Theatre Park along with its artificial &quot;Swan Lake&quot; is also among the favourite green spaces of the city. In 2019 some of the public space of the park leased to restaurants was reclaimed allowing for improved landscape design. A public ice-skating arena is operated in the park&#x27;s lake area during winters.

The Yerevan Lake is an artificial reservoir opened in 1967 on Hrazdan riverbed at the south of the city centre, with a surface of .

Each administrative district of Yerevan has its own public park, such as the Buenos Aires Park and Tumanyan Park in Ajapnyak, Komitas Park in Shengavit, Vahan Zatikian Park in Malatia-Sebastia, David Anhaght Park in Kanaker-Zeytun, the Family Park in Avan, and Fridtjof Nansen Park in Nor Nork.

==Politics and government==
===Capital===

Yerevan has been the capital of Armenia since the independence of the First Republic in 1918. Situated in the Ararat Plain, the historic lands of Armenia, it served as the best logical choice for capital of the young republic at the time.

When Armenia became a republic of the Soviet Union, Yerevan remained as capital and accommodated all the political and diplomatic institutions in the republic. In 1991 with the independence of Armenia, Yerevan continued with its status as the political and cultural centre of the country, being home to all the national institutions: the Government House, the National Assembly, the Presidential Palace, the Central Bank, the Constitutional Court, all ministries, judicial bodies and other government organizations.

===Municipality===
Yerevan received the status of a city on 1 October 1879, upon a decree issued by Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The first city council formed was headed by Hovhannes Ghorghanyan, who became the first mayor of Yerevan.

The Constitution of the Republic of Armenia adopted on 5 July 1995, granted Yerevan the status of a marz (մարզ, province). Therefore, Yerevan functions similarly to the provinces of Armenia with a few specifications.
The administrative authority of Yerevan is thus represented by:
* the mayor, appointed by the President (who can remove him at any moment) upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister, alongside a group of four deputy mayors heading eleven ministries (of which financial, transport, urban development etc.),
* the Yerevan City Council, regrouping the Heads of community districts under the authority of the mayor,
* twelve &quot;community districts&quot;, with each having its own leader and their elected councils. Yerevan has a principal city hall and twelve deputy mayors of districts.

In the modified Constitution of 27 November 2005, Yerevan city was turned into a &quot;community&quot; (համայնք, &quot;hamaynk&quot;); since, the Constitution declares that this community has to be led by a mayor, elected directly or indirectly, and that the city needs to be governed by a specific law. The first election of the Yerevan City Council took place in 2009 and won by the ruling Republican Party of Armenia.

In addition to the national police and road police, Yerevan has its own municipal police. All three bodies cooperate to maintain law in the city.

===Administrative districts===
Yerevan is divided into twelve &quot;administrative districts&quot; (վարչական շրջան, &quot;varčakan šrĵan&quot;) each with an elected leader. The total area of the 12 districts of Yerevan is .

==Demographics==
Originally a small town, Yerevan became the capital of Armenia and a large city with over one million inhabitants. Until the fall of the Soviet Union, the majority of the population of Yerevan were Armenians with minorities of Russians, Kurds, Azerbaijanis and Iranians present as well. However, with the breakout of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War from 1988 to 1994, the Azerbaijani minority diminished in the country in what was part of population exchanges between Armenia and Azerbaijan. A big part of the Russian minority also fled the country during the 1990s economic crisis in the country. Today, the population of Yerevan is overwhelmingly Armenian.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, due to economic crises, thousands fled Armenia, mostly to Russia, North America and Europe. The population of Yerevan fell from 1,250,000 in 1989 to 1,103,488 in 2001 and to 1,091,235 in 2003. However, the population of Yerevan has been increasing since. In 2007, the capital had 1,107,800 inhabitants.

Yerevantsis in general use the Yerevan dialect, an Eastern Armenian dialect most probably formed during the 13th century. It is currently spoken in and around Yerevan, including the towns of Vagharshapat and Ashtarak. Classical Armenian (&quot;Grabar&quot;) words compose a significant part of the dialect&#x27;s vocabulary. Throughout the history, it was influenced by several languages, especially Russian and Persian and loan words have significant presence in it today. It is currently the most widespread Armenian dialect.

===Ethnic groups===
Yerevan was inhabited first by Armenians and remained homogeneous until the 15th century. The population of the Erivan Fortress, founded in the 1580s, was mainly composed of Muslim soldiers, estimated two to three thousand. The city itself was mainly populated by Armenians. French traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who visited Yerevan possibly up to six times between 1631 and 1668, states that the city is exclusively populated by Armenians. Although much of the Armenian population of the city was deported during the 17th century, the city remained Armenian-majority during the Ottoman–Hotaki War (1722–1727). The demographics of the region changed because of a series of wars between the Ottoman Empire, Iran and Russia. In the early 19th century Yerevan had a Muslim majority, mainly with an Armenian and &quot;Caucasian Tatar&quot; population. According to the traveler H. F. B. Lynch, the city was about 50% Armenian and 50% Muslim (Azerbaijanis and Persians) in the early 1890s.

After the Armenian genocide, many refugees from what Armenians call Western Armenia (nowadays Turkey, then Ottoman Empire) escaped to Eastern Armenia. In 1919, about 75,000 Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire arrived in Yerevan, mostly from the Vaspurakan region (city of Van and surroundings). A significant part of these refugees died of typhus and other diseases.

From 1921 to 1936, about 42,000 ethnic Armenians from Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Greece, Syria, France, Bulgaria etc. went to Soviet Armenia, with most of them settling in Yerevan. The second wave of repatriation occurred from 1946 to 1948, when about 100,000 ethnic Armenians from Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, France, United States etc. moved to Soviet Armenia, again most of whom settled in Yerevan. Thus, the ethnic makeup of Yerevan became more monoethnic during the first 3 decades in the Soviet Union. The Azerbaijani population of Yerevan, who made up 43% of the population of the city prior to the October Revolution, dropped to 0.7% by 1959 and further to 0.1% by 1989, during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

There is an Indian population in Armenia, with over 22,000 residents recorded in the country. Much of this population resides in Yerevan, where a large proportion run businesses, Indian restaurants, and study in Yerevan universities.

===Religion===
====Armenian Apostolic Church====
Armenian Apostolic Christianity is the predominant religion in Armenia. The 5th-century Saint Paul and Peter Church demolished in November 1930 by the Soviets, was among the earliest churches ever built in Erebuni-Yerevan. Many of the ancient Armenian and medieval churches of the city were destroyed by the Soviets in the 1930s during the Great Purge.


The regulating body of the Armenian Church in Yerevan is the Araratian Pontifical Diocese, with the Surp Sarkis Cathedral being the seat of the diocese. It is the largest diocese of the Armenian Church and one of the oldest dioceses in the world, covering the city of Yerevan and the Ararat Province of Armenia.

Yerevan is currently home to the largest Armenian church in the world, the Cathedral of Saint Gregory the Illuminator. It was consecrated in 2001, during the 1700th anniversary of the establishment of the Armenian Church and the adoption of Christianity as the national religion in Armenia.

As of 2017, Yerevan has 17 active Armenian churches as well as four chapels.

====Russian Orthodox Church====

After the capture of Yerevan by the Russians as a result of the Russo-Persian War of 1826–28, many Russian Orthodox churches were built in the city under the orders of the Russian commander General Ivan Paskevich. The Saint Nikolai Cathedral opened during the second half of the 19th century, was the largest Russian church in the city. The Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God was opened in 1916 in Kanaker-Zeytun.

However, most of the churches were either closed or demolished by the Soviets during the 1930s. The Saint Nikolai Cathedral was entirely destroyed in 1931, while the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God was closed and converted first into a warehouse and later into a club for the military personnel. Religious services resumed in the church in 1991, and in 2004 a cupola and a belfry were added to the building. In 2010, the groundbreaking ceremony of the new Holy Cross Russian Orthodox church took place with the presence of Patriarch Kirill I of Moscow. The church was eventually consecrated on 7 October 2017, with the presence of Catholicos Karekin II, Russian bishops and the church benefactor Ara Abramyan.

====Other religions====
According to Ivan Chopin, there were eight mosques in Yerevan in the middle of the 19th century. The 18th-century Blue Mosque of Yerevan was restored and reopened in the 1990s, with Iranian funding, and is currently the only active mosque in Armenia, mainly serving Iranian Shia visitors.

A second airport, Erebuni Airport, is located just south of the city. Since the independence, &quot;Erebuni&quot; is mainly used for military or private flights. The Armenian Air Force has equally installed its base there and there are several MiG-29s stationed on Erebuni&#x27;s tarmac.

===City buses, public vans and trolleybuses===

Public transport in Yerevan is heavily privatized and mostly handled by around 60 private operators. As of May 2017, 39 city bus lines are being operated throughout Yerevan. These lines mostly consist of about 425 Bogdan, Higer City Bus and Hyundai County buses. However, the market share these buses in public transit is only about 39.1%.

But the 50.4% of public transit is still served by &quot;public vans&quot;, locally known as marshrutka. These are about 1210 Russian-made GAZelle vans with 13 seats, that operate same way as buses, having 79 different lines with certain routes and same stops. According to Yerevan Municipality office, in future, marshrutkas should be replaced by ordinary larger buses. Despite having about 13 seats, the limit of passengers is not controlled, so usually these vans carry many more people who stand inside.

The Yerevan trolleybus system has been operating since 1949. Some old Soviet-era trolleybuses have been replaced with comparably new ones. As of May 2017, only 5 trolleybus lines are in operation (2.6% share), with around 45 units in service. The trolleybus system is owned and operated by the municipality.

The tram network that operated in Yerevan since 1906 was decommissioned in January 2004. Its operation had a cost 2.4 times higher than the generated profits, which pushed the municipality to shut down the network, despite a last-ditch effort to save it towards the end of 2003. Since the closure, the rails have been dismantled and sold.

Due to being dispersed among dozens of private operators, the transportation is barely regulated, with only trip fee is being a subject of regulation. Thus, the quality of vehicles is often inadequate, with no certain regulations for safety. Unlike the majority of world capitals, there is no established ticketing system in Yerevan&#x27;s public transportation. Passengers need to pay the money directly to the driver when getting out of the vehicle. The fare -being one of the few things that is regulated- is fixed and controlled by authorities.

The central station in Nor Kilikia neighbourhood serves as bus terminal for inter-city transport, serving outbound routes towards practically all the cities of Armenia as well as abroad, notably Tbilisi and Tabriz.

===Underground===
The Yerevan Metro named after Karen Demirchyan, ( (&quot;Karen Dyemirchyani anvan Yerevani metropoliten kayaran&quot;)) is a rapid transit system that serves the capital city since 1981. It has a single line of length with 10 active stations and 45 units in service. The interiors of the stations resemble that of the former western Soviet nations, with chandeliers hanging from the corridors. The metro stations had most of their names changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of the Republic of Armenia.

A northeastern extension of the line with two new stations is currently being developed. The construction of the first station (&quot;Ajapnyak&quot;) and of the tunnel linking it to the rest of the network will cost US$18 million. The time of the end of the project has not yet been defined. Another long-term project is the construction of two new lines, but these have been suspended due to lack of finance.

The system transports more than 60,000 people on a daily basis.

===Railway===
Yerevan has a single central railway station (several railway stations of suburbs have not been used since 1990) that is connected to the metro via the &quot;Sasuntsi Davit&quot; station. The railway station is made in Soviet-style architecture with its long point on the building roof, representing the symbols of communism: red star, hammer and sickle. Due to the Turkish and Azerbaijani blockades of Armenia, there is only one international train that passes by once every two days, with neighboring Georgia being its destination. For a sum of 9 000 to 18 000 dram, it is possible to take the night train to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. This train then continues to its destination of Batumi, on the shores of the Black sea in the summer season.

The only railway that goes to Iran to the south passes by the closed border of Nakhchivan. For this reason, there are no trains that go south from Yerevan.

During the first decade of the 21st century, the South Caucasus Railway CJSC — which is the current operator of the railway system in Armenia—announced its readiness to put the Yerevan-Gyumri-Kars railway line in service in case the Armenian-Turkish protocols are ratified and the opening of the borders between the two countries is achieved.

As of July 2017, the following railway trips are scheduled from and to Yerevan:
* Yerevan-Tbilisi-Batumi-Yerevan, with a daily trip operating since 15 June 2017, in coordination with the Georgian Railways.
* Yerevan-Gyumri-Yerevan, with 3 daily trips operating since 15 June 2017.
* Yerevan-Yeraskh-Yerevan, with a daily trip operating since 12 July 2014.
* Yerevan-Araks-Yerevan, with a daily trip.
* Yerevan-Shorzha-Yerevan, with weekend trips.

The Yerevan-Ararat-Yerevan route is temporarily not in operation, while the Yerevan-Tbilisi-Yerevan route will operate starting from 2 October 2017.

===Construction===
The construction sector has experienced a significant growth during the 1st decade of the 21st century. Starting from 2000, Yerevan has witnessed a massive construction boom, funded mostly by Armenian millionaires from Russia and the United States, with an extensive and controversial redevelopment process in which many 18th and 19th-century buildings have been demolished and replaced with new buildings. This growth was coupled with a significant increase in real estate prices.

Many major construction projects has been conducted in Yerevan, such as the Northern Avenue and the rehabilitation of &quot;Old Yerevan&quot; on Aram Street. The Northern Avenue is completed and was opened in 2007, while the &quot;Old Yerevan&quot; project is still under development. In the past few years, the city centre has also witnessed major road reconstruction, as well as the renovation of the Republic square, funded by the American-Armenian billionaire Kirk Kerkorian. On the other hand, the Argentina-based Armenian businessman Eduardo Eurnekian took over the airport, while the cascade development project was funded by the US based Armenian millionaire Gerard L. Cafesjian.

However, the sector has significantly dropped by the end of the 1st decade of the 21st century, as a result of the global real estate crisis in 2007–09. In 2013, Yerevan dominated over 58% of the annual total construction sector of Armenia.

In February 2017, the urban development committee of the government revealed its plans for the upcoming major construction projects in the city. With a total cost of US$300 million, a new business district will rise at the centre of the city, to replace the current Firdowsi shopping area. The committee has also announced the construction of &quot;Noy&quot; (Noah) ethnographic residential district at the western vicinity of Kentron District, with an approximate cost of US$100 million.

===Energy===

The location of the city on the shores of Hrazdan river has enabled the production of hydroelectricity. As part of the Sevan–Hrazdan Cascade, three hydroelectric power plants are established within the administrative territory of Yerevan: Kanaker HPP, Yerevan-1 HPP, and Yerevan-3 HPP. The entire plant was privatized in 2003, and is currently owned by RusHydro.

<text>Yngwie Johan Malmsteen (; born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerbäck, on 30 June 1963) is a Swedish guitarist. He first became known in the 1980s for his neoclassical playing style in heavy metal, and has released 22 studio albums in a career spanning over 40 years.

==Early life==
Malmsteen was born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerbäck in Stockholm, Sweden, the third child of a musical family. At age 10, Malmsteen created his first band, Track on Earth, consisting of himself and a friend from school playing the drums. At age 12, he took his mother&#x27;s maiden name Malmsten as his surname, then slightly changed it to Malmsteen and altered his third given name Yngve to &quot;Yngwie&quot;. As a teenager he was heavily influenced by classical music, particularly 19th century Italian virtuoso violinist and composer Niccolò Paganini as well as Johann Sebastian Bach. Yngwie Malmsteen has publicly stated that he is not influenced by the blues or the style of Ritchie Blackmore, the virtuoso claims that his guitar playing is inspired by classical violin, not classical guitar. Malmsteen has stated that Jimi Hendrix had no musical impact on him and did not contribute to his style. However watching the TV news reports on 18 September 1970 of Hendrix&#x27;s death, which included footage of Hendrix smashing and burning his guitar at the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967, made Malmsteen think, &quot;This is really cool.&quot;

==Career==
=== 1980s ===
In early 1982, Mike Varney of Shrapnel Records first heard Yngwie Malmsteen&#x27;s music through record store owner Bill Burkard, who played for him a demo tape of Malmsteen&#x27;s early work (likely the 1978 &quot;Powerhouse&quot; demo) recorded when Yngwie was 15. Later in 1982, Malmsteen sent to Varney an untitled demo recording as a submission for Varney&#x27;s Guitar Player magazine column. Guitar Player magazine published this demo for the February 1983 edition of the magazine.

In 1983, Varney brought Malmsteen to the United States to play on the recording of Shrapnel recording artist Steeler for its self-titled album. He then appeared with Graham Bonnet in the band Alcatrazz, playing on its 1983 debut &quot;No Parole from Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; and the 1984 live album &quot;Live Sentence&quot;. Bonnet and Malmsteen clashed about who was the frontman and had a fight during a show. Malmsteen was fired on the spot from Alcatrazz and replaced by Steve Vai. Vai had one day to learn the songs for the ongoing tour.

In 1984, Malmsteen released his first solo album &quot;Rising Force&quot;, which featured Barrie Barlow of Jethro Tull on drums and keyboard player Jens Johansson. His album was meant to be an instrumental side-project of Alcatrazz, but it ended up featuring vocals by Jeff Scott Soto and Malmsteen left Alcatrazz soon after the release of &quot;Rising Force&quot;.

&quot;Rising Force&quot; won the &quot;Guitar Player&quot;&#x27;s award for Best Rock Album and was nominated for a Grammy Award for &#x27;Best Rock Instrumental&#x27;, reaching no. 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. Yngwie J. Malmsteen&#x27;s Rising Force (as his band was thereafter known) next released &quot;Marching Out&quot; (1985). Then he recruited Jens Johansson&#x27;s brother Anders to play drums and bassist Marcel Jacob to record and tour with the band. Jacob left in the middle of a tour and was replaced by Wally Voss. Malmsteen&#x27;s third album, &quot;Trilogy&quot;, featuring the vocals of Mark Boals (and Malmsteen on both guitar and bass), was released in 1986. Boals left the band in the middle of the tour and was replaced by the former singer Jeff Scott Soto. The tour was cancelled after Malmsteen was involved in a serious car accident, smashing his V12 Jaguar E-Type into a tree, which put him in a coma for a week. Nerve damage to his right hand was reported. During this time, Malmsteen&#x27;s mother died from cancer. New line-up changes for the next album with former Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner joined the band, along with session bassist Bob Daisley, who was hired to record some bass parts and help with the lyrics. In April 1988, he released his fourth album &quot;Odyssey&quot;. &quot;Odyssey&quot; was his most successful album, in part due to the success of its first single &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot;. Shows in the Soviet Union during the Odyssey tour were recorded and released in 1989 as a fifth album &quot;Trial by Fire: Live in Leningrad&quot;. The classic Rising Force line-up with Malmsteen and the Johansson brothers was dissolved in 1989 when both Anders and Jens left. That year later, Jens joined Dio replacing keyboardist Claude Schnell.

Malmsteen&#x27;s neoclassical style of metal became popular among hordes of guitarists during the mid-1980s, with contemporaries such as Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, Paul Gilbert, Tony MacAlpine, and Vinnie Moore becoming prominent. In late 1988, Malmsteen&#x27;s signature Fender Stratocaster guitar was released, making him and Eric Clapton the first artists to be honored by Fender.

=== 1990s ===
In the early 1990s, Malmsteen released two albums, &quot;Eclipse&quot; (1990) and &quot;Fire &amp; Ice&quot; (1992), with the singer Göran Edman, followed by &quot;The Seventh Sign&quot; (1994) and &quot;Magnum Opus&quot; (1995) with former Loudness singer Mike Vescera. Despite his early and continuous success in Europe and Asia, by the early 1990s heavy metal styles such as neoclassical metal and shredding had gone out of fashion in the US.

Around 1993, Malmsteen&#x27;s future mother-in-law – who opposed his engagement to her daughter – had him arrested for allegedly holding her daughter hostage with a gun. The charges were later dropped. Malmsteen continued to record and release albums under the Japanese record label Pony Canyon and maintained a devoted following with fans in Europe and Japan and to a lesser extent in the US.

In the mid 1990s, Malmsteen released the albums &quot;Inspiration&quot; (1996) featuring three of his former singers Soto, Boals and Turner, &quot;Facing the Animal&quot; (1997) featuring Mats Levén on vocals and Cozy Powell on drums, followed by a live record &quot;Double Live!&quot; (1998) and another studio recording &quot;Alchemy&quot; (1999) featuring once again Mark Boals on vocals.

===Special guest appearances and side projects===
In 1996, Malmsteen joined forces with former band members Jeff Scott Soto and Marcel Jacob on the &quot;Human Clay&quot; album where he played lead guitar on the track &quot;Jealousy&quot;. In the same year, Malmsteen recorded guitar solos for two different Deep Purple tribute albums, &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; and &quot;Black Night – Deep Purple Tribute According to New York&quot; on the last one using the alias &quot;Lars Y. Loudamp&quot; to avoid contractual conflicts. He also guested with Saxon on the song Denim And Leather on their live album &quot;The Eagle Has Landed – Part II&quot; (released in 1997). Later that year, Malmsteen recorded the tracks &quot;Enigma suite&quot; and &quot;All opposable thumbs&quot; with his former band members Jens Johansson and Anders Johansson on their album &quot;Johansson/Sonic Winter&quot;.

===2000s===

In 2000, he signed a contract with the US record label Spitfire and released his 1990s catalog on the US market for the first time, including what he regards as his masterpiece, &quot;Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra&quot;, recorded with the Czech Philharmonic in Prague.

After the release of &quot;War to End All Wars&quot; in 2000, singer Mark Boals left the band. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Doogie White, whose vocals were well received by fans. In 2003, Malmsteen joined Joe Satriani and Steve Vai as part of the G3 supergroup, a tour showcasing guitar performances. Malmsteen made two guest appearances on keyboardist Derek Sherinian&#x27;s albums &quot;Black Utopia&quot; (2003), and &quot;Blood of the Snake&quot; (2006) where Malmsteen plays on the same tracks as Al Di Meola and Zakk Wylde. In 2004, Malmsteen made two cameo appearances on Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law. In 2005 &quot;Unleash the Fury&quot; was released through Spitfire Records. As stated in an issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, he titled this album after an infamous &#x27;airline incident&#x27;, which occurred on a flight to Japan during a 1988 tour. He was drunk and behaving obnoxiously, until he fell asleep and was roused by a woman pouring a jug of iced water on him. Enraged, he shouted, &quot;You&#x27;ve released the fucking fury!&quot; The audio from this incident was caught on tape by a fellow band member. Malmsteen says that the name of the album refers to both the energy of the album and the incident. The release of &quot;Unleash the Fury&quot; was followed by a DVD release of &quot;Concerto Suite For Electric Guitar And Orchestra in E Flat Minor, Op. 1 – With The New Japan Philharmonic Live&quot;. The DVD chronicles Malmsteen&#x27;s first time playing in front of a live audience with an orchestra, an experience that he describes as &quot;fun but also extremely scary&quot;.

In 2007, Malmsteen was honored in the Xbox 360 version of &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot;. Players can receive the &quot;Yngwie Malmsteen&quot; award by hitting 1000 or more notes in succession. February 2008 saw the replacement of singer Doogie White with former Iced Earth and Judas Priest and current Beyond Fear singer Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, with whom Malmsteen had once recorded a cover of Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s song &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot;, for the 2000 Osbourne tribute album &quot;Bat Head Soup: A Tribute to Ozzy&quot;. The first Malmsteen album to feature Owens is titled &quot;Perpetual Flame&quot; and was released on 4 October. On 25 November 2008, Malmsteen had three of his songs (&quot;Caprici Di Diablo&quot;, &quot;Damnation Game&quot;, and &quot;Red Devil&quot;, all from this latter album) released as downloadable content for the video games &quot;Rock Band Rock Band 2 and later Rock Band 3&quot;.

In 2008, Malmsteen was a special guest on the VH1 Classic show &quot;That Metal Show&quot;. On 10 March 2009, Malmsteen&#x27;s label Rising Force released &quot;Angels of Love&quot;, an all-instrumental album, which featured acoustic arrangements of some of his best-known ballads. Malmsteen recently released another album compilation entitled &quot;High Impact&quot; on 8 December 2009.

===2010–present===

On 23 November 2010, &quot;Relentless&quot; was released, the second album to feature Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens on vocals. The US version featured a remake of &quot;Arpeggios From Hell&quot; as a bonus track. Yngwie appeared on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; on 3 February 2011 to promote his album. On 6 August 2011, Malmsteen made another appearance in the United States, playing a rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Florida Marlins at Sun Life Stadium. Although rarely seen in his native country of Sweden, Malmsteen played one gig there in 2012. On 7 July, he ended the Getaway Rock Festival in Gävle, which he was headlining with Nightwish and Manowar. On 5 December 2012, Malmsteen released the album &quot;Spellbound&quot;. 2013 saw the release of Yngwie&#x27;s official autobiography &quot;Relentless&quot;.

On 12 June 2014, Malmsteen kicked off his &quot;Guitar Gods 2014 Tour&quot; at the F.M. Kirby Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania alongside ex-Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Bumblefoot and guitarist Gary Hoey. In February 2015, it was announced that Malmsteen was in the studio working on a new album. In April and May 2016, Malmsteen was one of five guitarists featured on the Generation Axe tour.
In 2018, it was announced that Malmsteen had signed with Mascot Records, with a new studio album expected the following year. In 2019, Malmsteen released &quot;Blue Lightning&quot;, featuring blues rock songs – mainly covers – with Malmsteen&#x27;s virtuoso playing. As Malmsteen was quoted: 

On 8 May 2021, Yngwie Malmsteen was reported to have launched the &quot;Parabellum&quot; album and video for the &quot;Paganini-referencing&quot; track &quot;Wolves at the Door&quot;. Since COVID-19 restrictions prevented touring, Malmsteen had more time to record the album, and was &quot;clearly delighted with the results.&quot;

On 17 July 2023, Yngwie Malmsteen announced his first-ever interactive video guitar masterclass on TrueFire. Yngwie uses a variety of backing tracks pulled from 10 of his most popular songs as the framework for the masterclass and the way in which he demonstrates his creative process, technical skills, and performance insights. It was released on 31 July 2023.

==Personal life==
Malmsteen was married to Swedish singer Erika Norberg (1991–1992) and was subsequently married to Amber Dawn Landin (1993–1998). Since 1999 he has been married to April Malmsteen, with whom he has a son named Antonio, after Antonio Vivaldi. The family now resides in Miami Shores, Florida.

A Ferrari enthusiast, Malmsteen owned a black 1983 308 GTS for 24 years before selling it on eBay, and a red 1962 250 GTO.

In a 2005 issue of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine, Malmsteen discussed his often-ridiculed behaviour, saying that, &quot;I&#x27;ve probably made more mistakes than anybody. But I don&#x27;t dwell on them. I don&#x27;t expect people to understand me, because I&#x27;m pretty complex, and I think outside the box with everything I do. I&#x27;ve always taken the untraveled path. Obviously, people have their opinions, but I can&#x27;t get too wrapped up in that, because I know what I can do, and I know what kind of person I am. And I have no control over what anybody says about me. Back in Sweden, I&#x27;m &#x27;Mr Personality&#x27; in the tabloids, but obviously I can&#x27;t take that seriously. I know in my heart that if I do the absolute best I can do, maybe ten years from now people may turn around and say, &#x27;he wasn&#x27;t that bad&#x27;.&quot;

In August 2009, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Malmsteen on its list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all time. Malmsteen&#x27;s listing, however, appeared to be sardonic, as the article concluded that: &quot;The Swede&#x27;s superfast &#x27;neoclassical&quot; style&#x27; – he credits Bach and Paganini as influences – is a blur of scales and technical precision. It almost makes you forget that the great bulk of his music is so fast that it&#x27;s unlistenable.&quot;

==Equipment==
===Yngwie Malmsteen Signature Stratocaster===

Malmsteen has been a longtime user of Fender Stratocasters with DiMarzio HS3 single-coil pickups &quot;for playing at blistering volume with no hum or screechiness&quot;. His most famous Stratocaster is his 1972 blonde Stratocaster, nicknamed &quot;The Duck&quot; because of its yellow finish and the Donald Duck stickers on the headstock. An alternative nickname for this guitar is &quot;Play Loud&quot; due to a sticker that Anders Johansson put on the upper horn of the guitar in Rockshire studios in 1984. Fender made 100 replica copies of this guitar and marketed it as the &quot;Play Loud Guitar&quot;. He also has a Fender Yngwie Malmsteen Signature Stratocaster since 1986. It comes in a Vintage White finish with a maple neck, either a maple or rosewood scalloped fretboard and, from 2010, Seymour Duncan STK-S10 YJM &quot;Fury&quot; Model pickups. There is also a signature YJM100 Marshall amplifier, based on the &quot;1959&quot; amplifier range.

=== Other equipment ===
Besides Stratocasters, Malmsteen has played and appeared in ads for non-Fender guitars (like Aria Pro II and Schecter in the early 1980s) and played non-Strat-shaped guitars (like Gibson Flying Vs), early in his career.

Today, for acoustic and nylon string guitars, Malmsteen uses his signature Ovation YM68s. Malmsteen uses light-gauge strings on his guitars, stringing his 25-1/2&quot; scale instruments with his signature string sets by Fender (gauges: .08, .011, .014, .022w, .032, .046 and .08, .011, .014, .026, .036, .048) and pairing them with Dunlop Delrin 500 series guitar picks.

<doc id="34358" wikidata="Q305932" url="?curid=34358" title="Yacc">
<text>Yacc (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler) is a computer program for the Unix operating system developed by Stephen C. Johnson. It is a lookahead left-to-right rightmost derivation (LALR) parser generator, generating a LALR parser (the part of a compiler that tries to make syntactic sense of the source code) based on a formal grammar, written in a notation similar to Backus–Naur form (BNF). Yacc is supplied as a standard utility on BSD and AT&amp;T Unix. GNU-based Linux distributions include Bison, a forward-compatible Yacc replacement.

== History ==
In the early 1970s, Stephen C. Johnson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs / AT&amp;T, developed Yacc because he wanted to insert an exclusive or operator into a B language compiler (developed using McIlroy&#x27;s TMG compiler-compiler), but it turned out to be a hard task. As a result, he was directed by his colleague at Bell Labs Al Aho to Donald Knuth&#x27;s work on LR parsing, which served as the basis for Yacc. Yacc was influenced by and received its name in reference to TMG compiler-compiler.

Yacc was originally written in the B programming language, but was soon rewritten in C by Alan Snyder. It appeared as part of Version 3 Unix, and a full description of Yacc was published in 1975.

Johnson used Yacc to create the Portable C Compiler. Bjarne Stroustrup also attempted to use Yacc to create a formal specification of C++, but &quot;was defeated by C&#x27;s syntax&quot;. While finding it unsuitable for a formal specification of the language, Stroustrup did proceed to use Yacc to implement Cfront, the first implementation of C++.

In a 2008 interview, Johnson reflected that &quot;the contribution Yacc made to the spread of Unix and C is what I&#x27;m proudest of&quot;.

== Description ==
The input to Yacc is a grammar with snippets of C code (called &quot;actions&quot;) attached to its rules. Its output is a shift-reduce parser in C that executes the C snippets associated with each rule as soon as the rule is recognized. Typical actions involve the construction of parse trees. Using an example from Johnson, if the call constructs a binary parse tree node with the specified and children, then the rule

expr : expr &#x27;+&#x27; expr { $$ = node(&#x27;+&#x27;, $1, $3); }

recognizes summation expressions and constructs nodes for them. The special identifiers , and refer to items on the parser&#x27;s stack.

Yacc produces only a parser (phrase analyzer) which can be used alone in the case of scannerless parsing however, full syntactic analysis typically requires an external lexical analyzer to perform a tokenization stage first (word analysis), which is then followed by the parsing stage proper. Lexical analyzer generators, such as Lex or Flex, are widely available for this purpose. The IEEE POSIX P1003.2 standard defines the functionality and requirements for both Lex and Yacc.

Some versions of AT&amp;T Yacc have become open source. For example, source code is available with the standard distributions of Plan 9.

== Impact ==
Yacc and similar programs (largely reimplementations) have been very popular. Yacc itself used to be available as the default parser generator on most Unix systems, though it has since been supplanted by more recent, largely compatible, programs such as Berkeley Yacc, GNU Bison, MKS Yacc, and Abraxas PCYACC. An updated version of the original AT&amp;T Yacc is included as part of Sun&#x27;s OpenSolaris project. Each offers slight improvements and additional features over the original Yacc, but the concept and basic syntax have remained the same.

Yacc was also one of several UNIX tools available for Charles River Data Systems&#x27; UNOS operating system under Bell Laboratories license.

Among the languages that were first implemented with Yacc are AWK, C++, eqn and Pic. Yacc was also used on Unix to implement the Portable C Compiler, as well as parsers for such programming languages as FORTRAN 77, Ratfor, APL, bc, m4, etc.

Yacc has also been rewritten for other languages, including OCaml, Ratfor, ML, Ada, Pascal, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, Common Lisp and Erlang.

* Berkeley Yacc: The Berkeley implementation of Yacc quickly became more popular than AT&amp;T Yacc itself because of its performance and lack of reuse restrictions.
* LALR parser: The underlying parsing algorithm in Yacc-generated parsers.
* Bison: The GNU version of Yacc.
* Lex (and Flex lexical analyser), a token parser commonly used in conjunction with Yacc (and Bison).
* BNF is a metasyntax used to express context-free grammars: that is a formal way to describe context-free languages.
* PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) is an alternative implementation of Lex and Yacc in Python.

<doc id="34359" wikidata="Q320577" url="?curid=34359" title="Yoneda lemma">
<text>In mathematics, the Yoneda lemma is a fundamental result in category theory. It is an abstract result on functors of the type &quot;morphisms into a fixed object&quot;. It is a vast generalisation of Cayley&#x27;s theorem from group theory (viewing a group as a miniature category with just one object and only isomorphisms). It allows the embedding of any locally small category into a category of functors (contravariant set-valued functors) defined on that category. It also clarifies how the embedded category, of representable functors and their natural transformations, relates to the other objects in the larger functor category. It is an important tool that underlies several modern developments in algebraic geometry and representation theory. It is named after Nobuo Yoneda.

== Generalities ==

The Yoneda lemma suggests that instead of studying the locally small category formula_1, one should study the category of all functors of formula_1 into formula_3 (the category of sets with functions as morphisms). formula_3 is a category we think we understand well, and a functor of formula_1 into formula_3 can be seen as a &quot;representation&quot; of formula_1 in terms of known structures. The original category formula_1 is contained in this functor category, but new objects appear in the functor category, which were absent and &quot;hidden&quot; in formula_1. Treating these new objects just like the old ones often unifies and simplifies the theory.

This approach is akin to (and in fact generalizes) the common method of studying a ring by investigating the modules over that ring. The ring takes the place of the category formula_1, and the category of modules over the ring is a category of functors defined on formula_1.

== Formal statement ==

Yoneda&#x27;s lemma concerns functors from a fixed category formula_1 to a category of sets, formula_3. If formula_1 is a locally small category (i.e. the hom-sets are actual sets and not proper classes), then each object formula_15 of formula_1 gives rise to a functor to formula_3 called a hom-functor. This functor is denoted:
:formula_18.
The (covariant) hom-functor formula_19 sends formula_20 to the set of morphisms formula_21 and sends a morphism formula_22 (where formula_23) to the morphism formula_24 (composition with formula_25 on the left) that sends a morphism formula_26 in formula_21 to the morphism formula_28 in formula_29. That is,
: formula_30
: formula_31

Yoneda&#x27;s lemma says that:

Here the notation formula_32 denotes the category of functors from formula_1 to formula_3.

Given a natural transformation formula_35 from formula_36 to formula_37, the corresponding element of formula_38 is formula_39; and given an element formula_40 of formula_38, the corresponding natural transformation is given by formula_42 which assigns to a morphism formula_43 a value of formula_44.

=== Contravariant version ===

There is a contravariant version of Yoneda&#x27;s lemma, which concerns contravariant functors from formula_1 to formula_3. This version involves the contravariant hom-functor
:formula_47
which sends formula_48 to the hom-set formula_49. Given an arbitrary contravariant functor formula_50 from formula_1 to formula_3, Yoneda&#x27;s lemma asserts that
:formula_53

=== Naturality ===
The bijections provided in the (covariant) Yoneda lemma (for each formula_54 and formula_37) are the components of a natural isomorphism between two certain functors from formula_56 to formula_3. One of the two functors is the evaluation functor
:formula_58
:formula_59
that sends a pair formula_60 of a morphism formula_61 in formula_62 and a natural transformation formula_63 to the map
:formula_64
This is enough to determine the other functor since we know what the natural isomorphism is. Under the second functor
:formula_65
:formula_66
the image of a pair formula_60 is the map
:formula_68
that sends a natural transformation formula_69 to the natural transformation formula_70, whose components are
:formula_71

=== Naming conventions ===

The use of formula_19 for the covariant hom-functor and formula_73 for the contravariant hom-functor is not completely standard. Many texts and articles either use the opposite convention or completely unrelated symbols for these two functors. However, most modern algebraic geometry texts starting with Alexander Grothendieck&#x27;s foundational EGA use the convention in this article.

The mnemonic &quot;falling into something&quot; can be helpful in remembering that formula_19 is the covariant hom-functor. When the letter formula_15 is falling (i.e. a subscript), formula_19 assigns to an object formula_48 the morphisms from formula_15 into formula_48.

=== Proof ===
Since formula_80 is a natural transformation, we have the following commutative diagram:

This diagram shows that the natural transformation formula_81 is completely determined by formula_82 since for each morphism formula_83 one has
:formula_84
Moreover, any element formula_85 defines a natural transformation in this way. The proof in the contravariant case is completely analogous.

=== The Yoneda embedding ===

An important special case of Yoneda&#x27;s lemma is when the functor formula_37 from formula_1 to formula_3 is another hom-functor formula_89. In this case, the covariant version of Yoneda&#x27;s lemma states that
:formula_90

That is, natural transformations between hom-functors are in one-to-one correspondence with morphisms (in the reverse direction) between the associated objects. Given a morphism formula_91 the associated natural transformation is denoted formula_92.

Mapping each object formula_15 in formula_1 to its associated hom-functor formula_95 and each morphism formula_91 to the corresponding natural transformation formula_97 determines a contravariant functor formula_98 from formula_1 to formula_32, the functor category of all (covariant) functors from formula_1 to formula_3. One can interpret formula_98 as a covariant functor:
:formula_104
The meaning of Yoneda&#x27;s lemma in this setting is that the functor formula_105 is fully faithful, and therefore gives an embedding of formula_106 in the category of functors to formula_3. The collection of all functors formula_108 is a subcategory of formula_109. Therefore, Yoneda embedding implies that the category formula_106 is isomorphic to the category formula_111.

The contravariant version of Yoneda&#x27;s lemma states that
:formula_112
Therefore, formula_113 gives rise to a covariant functor from formula_1 to the category of contravariant functors to formula_3:
:formula_116
Yoneda&#x27;s lemma then states that any locally small category formula_1 can be embedded in the category of contravariant functors from formula_1 to formula_3 via formula_120. This is called the &quot;Yoneda embedding&quot;.

The Yoneda embedding is sometimes denoted by よ, the hiragana Yo.

=== Representable functor ===

The Yoneda embedding essentially states that for every (locally small) category, objects in that category can be represented by presheaves, in a full and faithful manner. That is,
:formula_121
for a presheaf &quot;P&quot;. Many common categories are, in fact, categories of pre-sheaves, and on closer inspection, prove to be categories of sheaves, and as such examples are commonly topological in nature, they can be seen to be topoi in general. The Yoneda lemma provides a point of leverage by which the topological structure of a category can be studied and understood.

=== In terms of (co)end calculus ===
Given two categories formula_122 and formula_123 with two functors formula_124, natural transformations between them can be written as the following end.

:formula_125

For any functors formula_126 and formula_127 the following formulas are all formulations of the Yoneda lemma.

:formula_128

:formula_129

== Preadditive categories, rings and modules ==
A &quot;preadditive category&quot; is a category where the morphism sets form abelian groups and the composition of morphisms is bilinear; examples are categories of abelian groups or modules. In a preadditive category, there is both a &quot;multiplication&quot; and an &quot;addition&quot; of morphisms, which is why preadditive categories are viewed as generalizations of rings. Rings are preadditive categories with one object.

The Yoneda lemma remains true for preadditive categories if we choose as our extension the category of &quot;additive&quot; contravariant functors from the original category into the category of abelian groups; these are functors which are compatible with the addition of morphisms and should be thought of as forming a &quot;module category&quot; over the original category. The Yoneda lemma then yields the natural procedure to enlarge a preadditive category so that the enlarged version remains preadditive — in fact, the enlarged version is an abelian category, a much more powerful condition. In the case of a ring formula_130, the extended category is the category of all right modules over formula_130, and the statement of the Yoneda lemma reduces to the well-known isomorphism
:formula_132   for all right modules formula_133 over formula_130.

== Relationship to Cayley&#x27;s theorem ==
As stated above, the Yoneda lemma may be considered as a vast generalization of Cayley&#x27;s theorem from group theory. To see this, let formula_1 be a category with a single object formula_136 such that every morphism is an isomorphism (i.e. a groupoid with one object). Then formula_137 forms a group under the operation of composition, and any group can be realized as a category in this way.

In this context, a covariant functor formula_138 consists of a set formula_139 and a group homomorphism formula_140, where formula_141 is the group of permutations of formula_139; in other words, formula_139 is a G-set. A natural transformation between such functors is the same thing as an equivariant map between formula_144-sets: a set function formula_145 with the property that formula_146 for all formula_26 in formula_144 and formula_149 in formula_139. (On the left side of this equation, the formula_151 denotes the action of formula_144 on formula_139, and on the right side the action on formula_154.)

Now the covariant hom-functor formula_155 corresponds to the action of formula_144 on itself by left-multiplication (the contravariant version corresponds to right-multiplication). The Yoneda lemma with formula_157 states that
:formula_158,
that is, the equivariant maps from this formula_144-set to itself are in bijection with formula_144. But it is easy to see that (1) these maps form a group under composition, which is a subgroup of formula_161, and (2) the function which gives the bijection is a group homomorphism. (Going in the reverse direction, it associates to every formula_26 in formula_144 the equivariant map of right-multiplication by formula_26.) Thus formula_144 is isomorphic to a subgroup of formula_161, which is the statement of Cayley&#x27;s theorem.

<text>Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan (4 February 191710 August 1980) was a Pakistani general who served as the third president of Pakistan from 1969 to 1971. He also served as the fifth commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Army from 1966 to 1971.

A Pathan of Punjab, Khan was commissioned into the British Indian Army in 1939 and fought in the Second World War in the Mediterranean theatre. Following the Partition of British India, he joined the Pakistan Army and organized the Staff College, Quetta. In 1965, he played a vital role in executing Operation Grand Slam in Indian-administered Kashmir during the Second India–Pakistan War and was assigned to assume the army command in October 1966 by President Ayub Khan. In the wake of the 1968–1969 Pakistani protests, Ayub Khan resigned and transferred his authority to Yahya Khan.

Khan&#x27;s presidency oversaw martial law by suspending the constitution in 1969. Holding the country&#x27;s first general election in 1970, he barred power transition to the victorious Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from East Pakistan, leading to mass protests in the provincial wing and a call for sovereignty. On 25 March 1971, Khan ordered Operation Searchlight in an effort to suppress Bengali nationalism, which led to the Bangladesh Liberation War. Khan is considered a chief architect of the Bangladesh genocide along with his deputies Hamid Khan and Tikka Khan. In December 1971, Pakistan carried out unsuccessful pre-emptive strikes against the Bengali-allied Indian Army, culminating in the start of the Third India–Pakistan War. The wars resulted in the surrender of Pakistani forces and East Pakistan succeeded as Bangladesh, after which Yahya Khan resigned from the army command and transferred the presidency to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Khan remained under house surveillance prior to 1979 when he was released by Fazle Haq. Khan died the following year in Rawalpindi and was buried in Peshawar.

Khan&#x27;s short regime is widely seen as a key factor in the breakup of Pakistan. His refusal to transfer power to the Awami League, despite their electoral victory in East Pakistan, led to political turmoil. This culminated in Operation Searchlight, a brutal military crackdown that resulted in the Bengali genocide, causing widespread death and displacement. Khan is viewed negatively in both Bangladesh, where he is seen as the architect of the genocide, and Pakistan, where his failure to prevent the country&#x27;s disintegration is considered a national tragedy.

==Early life and education==
Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan was born on 4 February 1917 in the town of Chakwal, Punjab, British India. His family were written to be of Pashtun as well as Qizilbash origin and were descended from the elite soldiers of Iranian conqueror Nader Shah (). Yahya Khan could speak Persian. According to Indian journalist Dewan Barindranath&#x27;s book &quot;Private Life of Yahya Khan&quot; (published in 1974), Yahya&#x27;s father, Saadat Ali Khan, worked in the Indian Imperial Police, in the Punjab province. He joined as a head constable and retired as a deputy superintendent. He was posted in Chakwal, Punjab, British India, when Yahya Khan was born. He was rewarded with the title of Khan Sahib for having removed the bodies of many freedom fighters, including Bhaghat Singh, as they were executed in secrecy and the British needed to get rid of the corpses without attracting much attention, operations Saadat Ali Khan carried out &quot;efficiently and faithfully.&quot;

Yahya&#x27;s father was originally from Peshawar. Their family house, built in 1890, is located in the Muhallah Shaikh Ul Islam street of Ganj area in Peshawar&#x27;s Walled City, once serving as the main administrative area.

Yahya studied in the prestigious Colonel Brown Cambridge School in Dehradun and later enrolled at the University of the Punjab in Lahore, from where he graduated with a B.A. degree, finishing first in his class.

==Military service==
===Career before Pakistan&#x27;s birth===
Yahya Khan was commissioned into the British Indian Army from the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun on 15 July 1939, his date of commission was later antedated to 28 August 1938. An infantry officer from the 4th/10th Baluch Regiment (4th Battalion of 10th Baluch Regiment, later amalgamated with the modern and current form of Baloch Regiment, &#x27;Baloch&#x27; was spelled as &#x27;Baluch&#x27; in Yahya&#x27;s time), Yahya saw action during World War II in North Africa where he was captured by the Axis Forces in June 1942 and interned in a prisoner of war camp in Italy from where he escaped in the third attempt.

Yahya Khan served in World War II as a lieutenant and later captain in the 4th Infantry Division (India). He served in Iraq, Italy and North Africa.

===After the birth of Pakistan===
After the partition of India, he decided to join the Pakistan Army in August 1947, he had already reached the rank of major (acting lieutenant-colonel). In this year, he was instrumental in not letting the Indian officers shift books from the famous library of the Staff College, Quetta where Yahya was posted as an instructor at the time of the partition. He renamed the &#x27;Command and Staff College&#x27; from &#x27;Army Staff College&#x27;. At the age of 34, he was promoted to Brigadier, then the youngest Brigadier of Pakistan. And then he was appointed as commander of the 105th Independent Brigade that was deployed in LoC ceasefire region in Jammu and Kashmir in 1951–1952.

Later Yahya Khan, as Vice Chief of General Staff, was selected to head of the army&#x27;s planning board set up by General Ayub Khan to modernize the Pakistan Army in 1954–57. Yahya also performed the duties of Chief of General Staff from 1957 to 1962 from where he went on to command two infantry divisions from 1962 to 1965. He played a pivotal role in sustaining the support for President Ayub Khan&#x27;s campaign in the 1965 presidential elections against Fatima Jinnah. He was made GOC of the 7th Infantry Division of the Pakistan Army, which he commanded during the 1965 war with India.

During these years, Yahya was also tasked in civil and administrative matters, including being the Administrator of the Islamabad Capital Project, &quot;the job for major execution&quot; being given to him.

===The C-in-C===
Yahya became Pakistan Army&#x27;s C-in-C on 27 October 1966 when General Mohammad Musa went on retirement. When Yahya became the C-in-C, he superseded two of his seniors: Lieutenant-General Altaf Qadir and Lieutenant-General Bakhtiar Rana.

After becoming the commander-in-chief of the army, Yahya energetically started reorganizing the Pakistan Army in 1966. The post-1965 situation saw major organizational and technical changes in the Pakistan Army. Until 1965, it was thought that divisions could function effectively while getting orders directly from the army&#x27;s GHQ. This idea failed miserably in the 1965 war, and the need to have intermediate corps headquarters in between the GHQ and the fighting combat divisions was recognized as a foremost operational necessity after the 1965 war. In the 1965 war, the Pakistan Army had only one corps headquarters (the 1 Corps).

Soon after the war had started, the United States had imposed an embargo on military aid to both India and Pakistan. This embargo did not affect the Indian Army but produced major changes in the Pakistan Army&#x27;s technical composition. US Secretary of State Dean Rusk well summed it up when he said, &quot;Well if you are going to fight, go ahead and fight, but we&#x27;re not going to pay for it&quot;.

Pakistan now turned to China for military aid, and the Chinese tank T-59 started replacing the US M-47/48 tanks as the Pakistan Army&#x27;s MBT (Main Battle Tank) from 1966. 80 tanks, the first batch of T-59s, a low-grade version of the Russian T-54/55 series were delivered to Pakistan in 1965–66. The first batch was displayed in the Joint Services Day Parade on 23 March 1966. The 1965 War had proved that Pakistan Army&#x27;s tank-infantry ratio was lopsided and more infantry was required. Three more infantry divisions (9, 16 and 17 Divisions) largely equipped with Chinese equipment and popularly referred to by the rank and file as &quot;The China Divisions&quot; were raised by the beginning of 1968. Two more corps headquarters: the 2 Corps Headquarters (Jhelum-Ravi Corridor) and the 4 Corps Headquarters (Ravi-Sutlej Corridor) were raised, also in East Pakistan a corps-sized formation (which was titled as the Eastern Command) was created.

== Presidency (1969–1971) ==
A sustained anti-regime mass movement began in the fall of 1968 in West Pakistan. The uprising spread to East Pakistan and gathered strength, adding to a tense political climate that had worsened following President Ayub Khan&#x27;s implementation of the 1966 Tashkent Agreement and sacking of Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Ayub Khan tried to quell the revolt by making concessions to opposition groups including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Awami League (AL), but demonstrations continued. 

Rather than resigning and allowing a constitutional transfer of power, Ayub Khan requested that Yahya Khan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, utilize the military&#x27;s supra-constitutional authority to declare martial law and take power. On 24 March 1969, Ayub directed a letter to Yahya inviting him to deal with the crisis, as it was &quot;beyond the capacity of [civil] government to deal with the... complex situation.&quot; Some sources claim Yahya accepted Ayub&#x27;s proposal on 25 March. On 26 March 1969, General Yahya appeared on national television and announced a state of martial law throughout the entirety of the country. The 1962 constitution was abrogated, the parliament was dissolved, and Ayub&#x27;s civilian officials were dismissed. In his first nationwide address, Yahya maintained, &quot;I will not tolerate disorder. Let everyone remain at his post.&quot;

Yahya Khan&#x27;s new military government featured several active duty military officials:

When Yahya Khan assumed the office on 25 March, he inherited a two-decade constitutional problem of inter-provincial ethnic rivalry between West Pakistan, which was almost exclusively Muslim and was dominated by the Punjabi-Pashtun-Mohajir peoples, and East Pakistan, whose population was largely ethnically Bengali and approximately three-fourths Muslim (as of the 1961 Census). In addition, Yahya also inherited the challenge of transforming a country essentially ruled by one man into a democratic country, which was the ideological basis of the anti-Ayub movement of 1968–69. Once in office, Yahya Khan was tasked with leading the country, drafting of a provisional constitution, resolving the One Unit question, and satisfying the frustrations and the sense of exploitation stirring in the &quot;East Wing&quot; (East Pakistan) by government policies since 1948.

The American political scientist Lawrence Ziring observed:
Yahya Khan attempted to solve Pakistan&#x27;s constitutional and inter-provincial rivalry problems once he took over power from Ayub Khan in March 1969. His earlier initiatives were directed at establishing the National Security Council (NSC), with Major-General Ghulam Omar as its first advisor. It was formed to analyse and prepare assessments towards issues of political and national security.

M.M. Ahmad, then Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission of Pakistan told Henry Kissinger that the state &quot;had now realized that it would have to sacrifice some of its economic growth rate for the sake of social reform and of meeting the problem of disparity in the allocation of resources&quot; between the two wings, and noted that the loss of direct US military aid meant &quot;Pakistan had had to cut back resources devoted to the development budget in order to finance the procurement of military equipment.&quot; In 1971, Yahya conceded that he had failed to improve the national economy, “I inherited a bad economy, and I am going to pass it on,” he noted. The military government-initiated talks with the International Monetary Fund after foreign reserves fell to $160 million. In 1968, Muhajirs from East Pakistan started Muhjairland movement for a separated province. However, Yahya Khan rejected the idea saying it would not bring them solution.

In 1969, President Yahya also promulgated the Legal Framework Order, 1970, which disestablished the One Unit Scheme that had formed West Pakistan and returned the provinces of West Pakistan to their pre-1955 configuration. The decree had no effect on East Pakistan. However, the dissolution of the One Unit policy did not lead to the positive results that it might have yielded if withdrawn earlier. Yahya also made an attempt to accommodate the East Pakistanis by abolishing the principle of parity, in the hope that a greater share in the assembly would redress their wounded ethnic regional pride and ensure the integrity of Pakistan. Instead of satisfying the Bengalis, it intensified their vocalness for separatism, causing a further rise in anti-West Wing sentiment in the East Wing.

===1970 general election===
By 28 July 1969, President Yahya Khan had set a framework for elections that were to be held in December 1970, with Judge Abdus Sattar appointed as Chief Election Commissioner of the Election Commission of Pakistan. On 7 December, the general elections were held all over the country. In East Pakistan, the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, held almost all seats but no seat in any of four provinces of West Pakistan. The socialist Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had won the exclusive mandate in four provinces of West Pakistan but none in East Pakistan. The Pakistan Muslim League (PML), led by Nurul Amin, was the only party to have representation from all over the country, but it failed to gain the mandate to run the government. The Awami League had 160 seats in the National Assembly, all won from East Pakistan; the socialist PPP had 81, and the conservative PML had 10. The general elections&#x27;s results reflected the ugly political reality: the Pakistani electorate was deeply polarized along regional lines, particularly between East Pakistan and West Pakistan.

As a result, Pakistan stood politically divided. A series of bilateral talks between the PPP and Mujibur Rahman produced no results and were unable to come to an agreement regarding any transfer of power from West Pakistan&#x27;s representatives to East Pakistan&#x27;s, on the basis of the six-point programme. West Pakistan politicians generally felt that the proposed six-point programme was a step towards East Pakistan&#x27;s full secession.

===Bangladesh War===
While the political deadlock continued between the Awami League, the PPP, and the military government after the general elections in 1970, Yahya Khan began coordinating with his military strategists concerning ongoing dissent in East Pakistan. Both Yahya Khan and Bhutto flew to Dhaka and tried negotiations one more time in mid-March 1971, but they ultimately yielded no results.

On 25 March 1971, Yahya initiated Operation Searchlight, a crackdown by the Pakistan Armed Forces to suppress Bengali dissent and the Bengali nationalist movement. It was seen as the sequel to Operation Blitz, which had been launched in November 1970. The Pakistani government&#x27;s view was that it had to launch a campaign to neutralise a rebellion in East Pakistan to save the unity of Pakistan.

As a result of Operation Searchlight, agitation turned into full-scale civil war as Bengali members of the Pakistan Armed Forces and the police mutinied, forming the Mukti Bahini along with members of the general public, with the goal of launching unconventional and hit-and-run operations. A government-in-exile formed across the border in India and proclaimed the independent state of Bangladesh, appointing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as its head despite him being in a West Pakistan prison at the time.

Violent disorder and chaos accompanied the Pakistan Army&#x27;s systematic and deliberate campaign of killing and raping the populace of East Pakistan. The original plan for Operation Searchlight envisioned taking control of the major cities on 26 March 1971 and then eliminating all opposition, political or military within one month. The prolonged Bengali resistance had not been anticipated by Pakistani planners, however. The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May.

The total number of people killed in East Pakistan is not known with any degree of accuracy. Bangladeshi authorities claim that 3 million people were killed, while the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, an official Pakistani Government investigation, put the figure as low as 26,000 civilian casualties. In her widely discredited book &quot;Dead Reckoning: Memories of the 1971 Bangladesh War&quot;, Sarmila Bose said between 50,000 and 100,000 combatants and civilians were killed by both sides during the war. A 2008 &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; study by Ziad Obermeyer, Christopher J. L. Murray, and Emmanuela Gakidou estimated that up to 269,000 civilians died as a result of the conflict; the authors note that this is far higher than a previous estimate of 58,000 put forward by Uppsala University and the Peace Research Institute in Oslo.

General Yahya Khan arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on charges of sedition and appointed Brigadier (later General) Rahimuddin Khan to preside over a special tribunal dealing with Mujib&#x27;s case. Rahimuddin gave Mujib the death sentence, but President Yahya put the verdict into abeyance. Yahya&#x27;s crackdown, however, had led to the Bangladesh Liberation War within Pakistan. India would eventually be drawn into said war, fighting on behalf of the Bangladeshis against Pakistan; the war would later extend into the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.

The consequences of the war were mainly that East Pakistan became independent as Bangladesh, and that India captured approximately of land previously in West Pakistan. However, the captured territory was given back to Pakistan in the Simla Agreement signed on 2 July 1972 between Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

The 1971 war led to increased tensions between Pakistan and India, although Pakistan recognised the independence of Bangladesh following severe pressure from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

===US role===

The United States had been a major sponsor of President Yahya&#x27;s military government. American journalist Gary Bass notes in &quot;The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide&quot;, &quot;Nixon liked very few people, but he did like General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan.&quot; Personal initiatives of President Yahya had helped to establish the communication channel between the United States and China, which would be used to set up the Nixon&#x27;s trip in 1972.

Since 1960, Pakistan was perceived in the United States as an integral bulwark against global Communism in the Cold War. The United States cautiously supported Pakistan during the 1971 conflict, although Congress kept an arms embargo in place. The economically-socialist India entered into a formal alliance with the Soviet Union in August 1971.

Nixon urged President Yahya Khan multiple times to exercise restraint. His objective was to prevent a war and safeguard Pakistan&#x27;s interests, though he feared an Indian invasion of Pakistan that would lead to Indian domination of the subcontinent and strengthen the position of the Soviet Union. Similarly, President Yahya feared that an independent Bangladesh could lead to the disintegration of Pakistan, and said publicly in August 1971 that Indian military support for Bengali guerrillas could lead to war between India and Pakistan.

In November 1971, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi met Nixon in Washington. She assured him that she didn&#x27;t want war with Pakistan, but he did not believe her. Witness accounts presented by Kissinger pointed out that Nixon made specific proposals to Prime Minister Gandhi on a solution for the crisis, some of which she heard for the first time, including a mutual withdrawal of troops from the Indo-East Pakistan borders. Nixon also expressed a wish to fix a time limit with Yahya for political accommodation in East Pakistan. Nixon asserted that India could count on US endeavors to ease the crisis within a short time. But, both Kissinger and Gandhi&#x27;s aide Jayakar maintained, Gandhi did not respond to these proposals. Kissinger noted that she &quot;listened to what was, in fact, one of Nixon&#x27;s better presentations with aloof indifference&quot; but &quot;took up none of the points.&quot; Jayakar pointed out that Gandhi listened to Nixon &quot;without a single comment, creating an impregnable space so that no real contact was possible.&quot; She also refrained from assuring Nixon that India would follow Pakistan&#x27;s suit if it withdrew from India&#x27;s borders. As a result, the main agenda was &quot;dropped altogether.&quot;

On 3 December 1971, Yahya preemptively attacked the Indian Air Force and Gandhi retaliated, pushing into East Pakistan. Nixon issued a statement blaming Pakistan for starting the conflict and blaming India for escalating it. He favored a cease-fire. The United States was secretly encouraging the shipment of military equipment from Iran, Turkey, and Jordan to Pakistan, offering to replenish those countries&#x27; weapons stocks later despite Congressional objections. The US used the threat of an aid cut-off to force Pakistan to back down, while its continued military aid to Islamabad prevented India from launching incursions deeper into the country. Pakistan forces in East Pakistan surrendered in Dhaka on 16 December 1971, leading to the creation of the independent state of Bangladesh.

===Fall from power===
When the news of Pakistan&#x27;s surrender was broadcast by West Pakistani media, the spontaneous and overwhelming public anger over the nation&#x27;s defeat by Bangladeshi rebels and the Indian Army, and over the breakup of Pakistan into two parts, boiled into street demonstrations throughout Pakistan. Rumors of an impending coup d&#x27;état by junior military officers against President Yahya Khan swept the country. To forestall further unrest, on 20 December 1971, he handed over the presidency and government to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the ambitious leader of the (at that time) powerful and popular People&#x27;s Party. Yahya became the highest-ranking official in what remained of Pakistan to be forced out due to the war.

Within hours of Yahya Khan stepping down, President Bhutto reversed the Judge Advocate General Branch&#x27;s verdict against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and instead released him, allowing him to fly to London. President Bhutto also issued orders for the house arrest of Yahya, the man who imprisoned Mujib in the first place. Both actions made news headlines around the world.

==Personal life==
=== Religion ===
He was nominally a Shia Muslim, but was non-practising and was known to have indulged in activities prohibited in Islam such as womanizing and the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Indian journalist Dewan Berindranath argued that Yahya turned to alcohol and womanizing when he gained power, as a coping mechanism to deal with stress, and that when he was a soldier he was known for being morally upright, abstaining from partying unlike other officers and instead preferring to spend time with his family and also practicing Islamic rituals such as the fast of Ramadan, eventually quoting Ayub Khan who said that &quot;Give me half a dozen officers of the calibre and moral standards of Yahya Khan and I can show you what can Pakistan do as a great nation of the Islamic world.&quot; 

During his rule from 1969 to 1971, Mian Tufail Mohammad, a prominent leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country&#x27;s main Islamist party, hailed Yahya as &quot;the champion of Islam&quot;, as there was a general view among Islamists that he would fight leftist elements of the country (the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party in West Pakistan and the All-Pakistan Awami League in what was East Pakistan and now Bangladesh) and also push for the Islamization of the Constitution. More generally, Yahya used the intelligence services (the ISI and the IB) &quot;to keep secular political parties under check&quot;, mobilizing the Information Ministry for propaganda and pushing the idea that they put &quot;Islam and Pakistan in danger.&quot;

Towards the end of his life, during and following his imprisonment, Yahya slowly abandoned drinking altogether as he &quot;turned extremely religious.&quot;

=== Relationships ===
Yahya is said to have had a relationship with Akleem Akhtar, nicknamed General Rani, but they never married. His name was linked with the singer and actress Noor Jehan as well. He also had a brief relationship with a Bengali woman called Shamim K. Hussain, also known as &quot;Black Beauty&quot;. The wife of a police officer, Yahya appreciated her company not so much for her looks but mainly because she was fluent in English and could talk about Shakespeare and Lord Byron, among his favourite poets, and she eventually became influential enough to shape the decisions of the foreign office.

=== Family ===
Yahya&#x27;s older brother Agha Muhammad Ali Khan had been the Chief of the Intelligence Bureau. Having joined government service in 1935 as Police Inspector, he woud later serve as Superintendent (SP) in cities such as Lahore.

Yahya and his wife Fakhra had a son, Ali Yahya Khan, and a daughter, Yasmeen Khan.

His nephew Ahmed Ali was a Major who also served as Yahya&#x27;s aide-de-camp from 1966 to 1969.

=== Hobbies ===
A &quot;Time&quot; editorial writer wrote of Yahya in 1971, &quot;His only known interest, outside of the military, is birds—all varieties.&quot; Yahya kept Australian parrots, cranes and swans at the President’s House.

However, Yahya also had a keen interest in poetry, particularly the works of Shakespeare and Lord Byron. He often engaged in discussions about these poets, especially appreciating conversations with individuals fluent in English who could converse on such literary topics.

==Later years and death==

=== House arrest ===

Yahya Khan was placed under house arrest by the succeeding administration of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Initially, Yahya was confined to the Banni rest-house, a forest bungalow near Kharian, without a formal detention order. This location was selected to ensure his isolation and protection as well as to facilitate his forthcoming testimony before the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, which was established on December 26, 1971, to investigate the circumstances leading to Pakistan&#x27;s military and political failures in East Pakistan. 

On January 11, 1972, Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman sent a letter to Yahya, informing him that the commission would commence its proceedings on January 17 and requesting his statement by January 24. 

During his detention in Banni, Yahya was under strict surveillance. The rest-house was secured by military personnel, and his communications with the outside world were heavily restricted to prevent any interference with the confidential commission&#x27;s investigation.

After approximately four months in Banni, on April 20, 1972, Yahya was transferred to his personal residence at 61 Harley Street in central Rawalpindi. His house arrest continued under lessened restrictions. The house was only thinly guarded by a few police officers.

=== Declining health ===
Yahya’s health had significantly deteriorated during his years in house arrest. He was suffering from a combination of serious medical conditions, including diabetes, a heart condition, and reports also suggest that his mental health was affected as well. 

Additionally, a stroke which left him half paralysed and his obesity had worsened his health, making him increasingly frail and incapable of resuming a normal life. Some sources suggest that by the time he was released, he was unable to care for himself fully.

Yahya remained under house arrest until 1977, when he was released from custody by martial law administrator General Fazle Haq due to his failing health. However Yahya remained a recluse. He stayed out from public events and wrote down his memoirs in the form of notes that remain unpublished. He died from a stroke on 10 August 1980 in Rawalpindi, Punjab.

=== State funeral ===
Yahya Khan&#x27;s funeral was marked by full military honors. After his death, the military government under General Zia-ul-Haq, which had taken power in a 1977 Pakistani military coup, accorded him a dignified military funeral. This ceremony reflected the respect given to a former military leader, acknowledging his service as the President and Chief Martial Law Administrator.

The funeral was held in Peshawar, where Yahya was laid to rest at Circle Road Graveyard. The ceremony was attended by senior military officials and dignitaries from the regime. It is likely that the funeral was also a gesture to emphasize continuity within Pakistan’s military leadership, despite the tensions surrounding Yahya&#x27;s legacy.

== Legacy ==

=== In Pakistan ===
Yahya Khan was awarded , but then stripped of his service honours by the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto regime. Khan is viewed largely negatively by Pakistani historians and is considered among the worst but also one of the most misunderstood of the country&#x27;s leaders. His rule is widely regarded as one of the leading causes of the fall of Dhaka and the breakup of Pakistan, but not entirely of his own making.

=== In the United States ===
In the United States, he has been appreciated for facilitating the American opening to China, President Richard Nixon sending a handwritten letter to him, stating that &quot;without your personal assistance the profound breakthrough in relations between the USA and the [Peoples Republic of China] would never have been accomplished... Those who want a more peaceful world in the generations to come will be forever in your debt.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* In 1971, he was portrayed as a monstrous beast in &quot;ANNIHILATE THESE DEMONS&quot;, a poster illustrated by Quamrul Hassan.
* In the 2023 Indian film &quot;Sam Bahadur&quot;, Khan is portrayed by Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub.

<doc id="34361" wikidata="Q42462" url="?curid=34361" title="York">
<text>York is a cathedral city in North Yorkshire, England, with Roman origins, sited at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss. The city has many historic buildings and other structures, such as a minster, castle, and city walls. It is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of the wider City of York district. It is located north-east of Leeds, south of Newcastle upon Tyne and north of London. York&#x27;s built-up area had a recorded population of 141,685 in 2021.

The city was founded under the name of Eboracum in 71 AD. It then became the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior, and later of the kingdoms of Deira, Northumbria, and Scandinavian York. In the Middle Ages, it became the northern England ecclesiastical province&#x27;s centre, and grew as a wool-trading centre. In the 19th century, it became a major railway network hub and confectionery manufacturing centre. In the Second World War, part of the Baedeker Blitz bombed the city. Although York was less targeted during the war than other, more industrialised northern cities, several historic buildings were gutted and restoration took place up until the 1960s.

Historic local governance of the city was as a county corporate, not included in the county&#x27;s riding system. The city has since been locally governed as a municipal borough, county borough, and since 1996, a non-metropolitan district (the City of York), which also includes surrounding villages and rural areas, and the town of Haxby. The current district&#x27;s local council, City of York Council, is responsible for providing all local services and facilities throughout this area.

==Toponymy==

The city&#x27;s name is derived from Brittonic &quot;place of yew trees&quot;, from &quot;yew tree&quot; (compare Welsh , Breton , &quot;alder, buckthorn&quot;; Old Irish , Irish , , , Scottish Gaelic ) + , a suffix of appurtenance meaning &quot;belonging to&quot;, or &quot;place of&quot; (compare Welsh ). However, (, , ) was also a Celtic personal name, so could also mean &quot;the property of Eburos&quot;. Indeed, the 12th‑century chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his fictional account of the prehistoric kings of Britain, , suggests the name derives from that of a pre-Roman city founded by the legendary king Ebraucus.

The name was Latinised by the Romans as or , and is called in Scottish Gaelic and in Irish, derived from the Latin name. The Latin became Anglian in the 7th century: a compound of , from the old name, and , meaning &quot;village&quot;, probably by conflation of the element with a Germanic root (&#x27;boar&#x27;); by the 7th century, the Old English for &#x27;boar&#x27; had become . When the Danish army conquered the city in 866, the name was rendered in Old Norse as .

The Old French and Norman name of the city following the Norman Conquest was recorded as (modern Norman ) in works such as Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Rou&quot; and as &quot;Euruic&quot; in the Domesday Book. , meanwhile, gradually reduced to &quot;York&quot; in the centuries after the Conquest, moving from the Middle English in the 14th century through in the 16th century to &quot;Yarke&quot; in the 17th century. The form &quot;York&quot; was first recorded in the 13th century.

Many company and place names, such as the Ebor race meeting, refer to the Roman name. The Archbishop of York signs his surname as &quot;Ebor&quot; (abbreviating ).

==History==

===Early history===
Archaeological evidence suggests that Mesolithic people settled in the region of York between 8000 and 7000 BC, although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, the area was occupied by a tribe known to the Romans as the Brigantes. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state, but later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman Ninth Legion was sent north of the Humber into Brigantian territory.

The city was founded in 71 AD, when the Ninth Legion conquered the Brigantes and constructed a wooden military fortress on flat ground above the River Ouse close to its confluence with the River Foss. The fortress, whose walls were rebuilt in stone by the VI legion based there subsequent to the IX legion, covered an area of and was inhabited by 6,000 legionary soldiers. The site of the &quot;principia&quot; (HQ) of the fortress lies under the foundations of York Minster, and excavations in the undercroft have revealed part of the Roman structure and columns.

The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus, and Constantius I all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207–211 AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of Britannia Inferior, and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a &#x27;colonia&#x27; or city. Constantius I died in 306 AD during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In 314 AD, a bishop from York attended the Council at Arles to represent Christians from the province.

While the Roman &quot;colonia&quot; and fortress were on high ground, by 400 AD the town was victim to occasional flooding from the Rivers Ouse and Foss, and the population reduced. York declined in the post-Roman era, and was taken and settled by the Angles in the 5th century.

Reclamation of parts of the town was initiated in the 7th century under King Edwin of Northumbria, and York became his chief city. The first wooden minster church was built in York for the baptism of Edwin in 627, according to the Venerable Bede. Edwin ordered the small wooden church be rebuilt in stone; however, he was killed in 633, and the task of completing the stone minster fell to his successor Oswald. In the following century, Alcuin of York came to the cathedral school of York. He had a long career as a teacher and scholar, first at the school at York now known as St Peter&#x27;s School, founded in 627 AD, and later as Charlemagne&#x27;s leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational affairs.

In 866, Northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the Vikings raided and captured York. As a thriving Anglo-Saxon metropolis and prosperous economic hub, York was a clear target for the Vikings. Led by Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan, Scandinavian forces attacked the town on All Saints&#x27; Day. Launching the assault on a holy day proved an effective tactical move – most of York&#x27;s leaders were in the cathedral, leaving the town vulnerable to attack and unprepared for battle.

After it was conquered, the city was renamed from the Old English Eoforwic to Jorvik. It became the capital of Viking territory in Britain, and at its peak boasted more than 10,000 inhabitants. This was a population second only to London within Great Britain. Jorvik proved an important economic and trade centre for the Vikings. Norse coinage was created at the Jorvik mint, while archaeologists have found evidence of a variety of craft workshops around the town&#x27;s central Coppergate area. These demonstrate that textile production, metalwork, carving, glasswork and jewellery-making were all practised in Jorvik. Materials from as far afield as the Persian Gulf have also been discovered, suggesting that the town was part of an international trading network. Under Viking rule the city became a major river port, part of the extensive Viking trading routes throughout northern Europe.
The last ruler of an independent Jórvík, Eric Bloodaxe, was driven from the city in 954 AD by King Eadred in his successful attempt to complete the unification of England.

===After the conquest===
In 1068, two years after the Norman conquest of England, the people of York rebelled. Initially they succeeded, but upon the arrival of William the Conqueror the rebellion was put down. William at once built a wooden fortress on a motte. In 1069, after another rebellion, the king built another timbered castle across the River Ouse. These were destroyed in 1069 and rebuilt by William about the time of his ravaging Northumbria in what is called the &quot;Harrying of the North&quot; where he destroyed everything from York to Durham. The remains of the rebuilt castles, now in stone, are visible on either side of the River Ouse.

The first stone minster church was badly damaged by fire in the uprising, and the Normans built a minster on a new site. Around the year 1080, Archbishop Thomas started building the cathedral that in time became the current Minster.

In the 12th century, York started to prosper. In 1190, York Castle was the site of an infamous massacre of its Jewish inhabitants, in which at least 150 people were murdered, although some authorities put the figure as high as 500.

The city, through its location on the River Ouse and its proximity to the Great North Road, became a major trading centre. King John granted the city&#x27;s first charter in 1212, confirming trading rights in England and Europe. During the later Middle Ages, York merchants imported wine from France, cloth, wax, canvas, and oats from the Low Countries, timber and furs from the Baltic and exported grain to Gascony and grain and wool to the Low Countries.

York became a major cloth manufacturing and trading centre. Edward I further stimulated the city&#x27;s economy by using the city as a base for his war in Scotland. The city was the location of significant unrest during the so-called Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381. The city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of Richard II in 1396.

===16th to 18th centuries===
The city underwent a period of economic decline during Tudor times. Under King Henry VIII, the Dissolution of the Monasteries saw the end of York&#x27;s many monastic houses, including several orders of friars, the hospitals of St Nicholas and of St Leonard, the largest such institution in the north of England. This led to the Pilgrimage of Grace, an uprising of northern Catholics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire opposed to religious reform. Henry VIII restored his authority by establishing the Council of the North in York in the dissolved St Mary&#x27;s Abbey. The city became a trading and service centre during this period. King Henry VIII spent a lot of time travelling around the country on official Royal Tours also known as &quot;progresses.&quot; In the year 1541, Henry VIII and Catherine Howard visited the city of York on their royal tour. The Royal Party would have been met outside the walls by civic dignitaries before formally entering the city. The civic dignitary would have been the Lord Mayor of York, who at the time of their arrival on 15 September 1541 was Robert Hall. He owned the residential property at 74 Low Petergate. Following a special service held in their honour at York minster. Henry VIII and Catherine rode from the minster down to Petergate, one of the five gateways, and over to the closed Benedictine abbey of St. Mary which had been converted into a palace for the King to stay in while he visited York on his Royal Tour.

Anne of Denmark came to York with her children Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth on 11 June 1603. The Mayor gave her a tour and offered her spiced wine, but she preferred beer. Guy Fawkes, who was born and educated in York, was a member of a group of Roman Catholic restorationists that planned the Gunpowder Plot. Its aim was to displace Protestant rule by blowing up the Houses of Parliament while King James I, the entire Protestant, and even most of the Catholic aristocracy and nobility were inside.

In 1644, during the Civil War, the Parliamentarians besieged York, and many medieval houses outside the city walls were lost. The barbican at Walmgate Bar was undermined and explosives laid, but the plot was discovered. On the arrival of Prince Rupert, with an army of 15,000 men, the siege was lifted. The Parliamentarians retreated some from York with Rupert in pursuit, before turning on his army and soundly defeating it at the Battle of Marston Moor. Of Rupert&#x27;s 15,000 troops, 4,000 were killed and 1,500 captured. The siege was renewed and the city surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax on 15 July.

Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants, although the clergy were still important. Competition from Leeds and Hull, together with silting of the River Ouse, resulted in York losing its pre-eminent position as a trading centre, but its role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was rising. York&#x27;s many elegant townhouses, such as the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Mansion House and Fairfax House date from this period, as do the Assembly Rooms, the Theatre Royal, and the racecourse.

===Modern history===
The railway promoter George Hudson was responsible for bringing the railway to York in 1839. Although Hudson&#x27;s career as a railway entrepreneur ended in disgrace and bankruptcy, his promotion of York over Leeds, and of his own railway company (the York and North Midland Railway), helped establish York as a major railway centre by the late 19th century.

The introduction of the railways established engineering in the city. At the turn of the 20th century, the railway accommodated the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway, which employed more than 5,500 people. The railway was instrumental in the expansion of Rowntree&#x27;s Cocoa Works. It was founded in 1862 by Henry Isaac Rowntree, who was joined in 1869 by his brother the philanthropist Joseph. Another chocolate manufacturer, Terry&#x27;s of York, was a major employer. By 1900, the railways and confectionery had become the city&#x27;s two major industries.

York was a centre of early photography, as described by Hugh Murray in his 1986 book &quot;Photographs and Photographers of York: The Early Years, 1844–79&quot;. Photographers who had studios in York included William Hayes, William Pumphrey, and Augustus Mahalski who operated on Davygate and Low Petergate in the 19th century, having come to England as a refugee after serving as a Polish lancer in the Austro-Hungarian war.

In 1942, the city was bombed during the Second World War (part of the Baedeker Blitz) by the German Luftwaffe and 92 people were killed and hundreds injured. Buildings damaged in the raid included the Railway Station, Rowntree&#x27;s Factory, Poppleton Road Primary School, St Martin-le-Grand Church, the Bar Convent and the Guildhall which was left in total disrepair until 1960.

With the emergence of tourism, the historic core of York became one of the city&#x27;s major assets, and in 1968 it was designated a conservation area. The existing tourist attractions were supplemented by the establishment of the National Railway Museum in York in 1975, the Jorvik Viking Centre in 1984 and the York Dungeon in 1986. The opening of the University of York in 1963 added to the prosperity of the city. In March 2012, York&#x27;s Chocolate Story opened.

York was voted European Tourism City of the Year by European Cities Marketing in June 2007, beating 130 other European cities to gain first place, surpassing Gothenburg in Sweden (second) and Valencia in Spain (third). York was also voted safest place to visit in the 2010 &quot;Condé Nast Traveller&quot; Readers&#x27; Choice Awards. In 2018, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; deemed York to be its overall &#x27;Best Place to Live&#x27; in Britain, highlighting the city&#x27;s &quot;perfect mix of heritage and hi-tech&quot; and as a &quot;mini-metropolis with cool cafes, destination restaurants, innovative companies – plus the fastest internet in Britain&quot;. The result was confirmed in a YouGov survey, reported in August 2018, with 92% of respondents saying that they liked the city, more than any of 56 other British cities.

==Governance==
===Local===
The City of York is governed by the City of York Council. It is a unitary authority that operates on a leader and cabinet style of governance, having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. It provides a full range of local government services including Council Tax billing, libraries, social services, processing planning applications, waste collection and disposal, and it is a local education authority. The city council consists of 47 councillors representing 21 wards, with one, two or three per ward serving four-year terms. Its headquarters are at the Guildhall and West Offices in the city centre.

York is divided into 21 administrative wards: Acomb, Bishopthorpe, Clifton, Copmanthorpe, Dringhouses and Woodthorpe, Fishergate, Fulford and Heslington, Guildhall, Haxby and Wigginton, Heworth, Heworth Without, Holgate, Hull Road, Huntington and New Earswick, Micklegate, Osbaldwick and Derwent, Rawcliffe and Clifton Without, Rural West York, Strensall, Westfield, and Wheldrake.

The members of the cabinet, led by the Council Leader, makes decisions on their portfolio areas individually. Following the Local Government Act 2000, the Council Leader commands the confidence of the city council; the leader of the largest political group and head of the City of York Council. The Leader of the council and the cabinet (consisting of all the executive councillors) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the city council. The current Council Leader, Liberal Democrats&#x27; Cllr Keith Aspden, was appointed on 22 May 2019, following the 2019 City of York Council election.

York&#x27;s first citizen and civic head is the Lord Mayor, who is the chairman of the City of York Council. The appointment is made by the city council each year in May, at the same time appointing the Sheriff, the city&#x27;s other civic head. The offices of Lord Mayor and Sheriff are purely ceremonial. The Lord Mayor carries out civic and ceremonial duties in addition to chairing full council meetings. The incumbent Lord Mayor since 26 May 2022 is Councillor David Carr, and the Sheriff is Suzie Mercer.

York Youth Council consists of several young people who negotiate with the councillors to get better facilities for York&#x27;s young people, and who also elect York&#x27;s Member of Youth Parliament.

The results of the 2023 City of York Council election saw the Conservative Party with three councillors, the Liberal Democrats with 19 councillors, the Labour Party had 24 councillors and one Independent. The council went from no overall control in the 2019 election, to being run by the Labour Party holding a majority.
York is the traditional county town of Yorkshire, and therefore did not form part of any of its three historic ridings, or divisions. Its Mayor has had the status of Lord Mayor since 1370, one of 23 in England. Only five of these have the title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;, the others being the Lord Mayors of London, Bristol, Cardiff and Belfast. York is an ancient borough, and was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 to form a municipal borough. It gained the status of a county borough in 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888, and existed so until 1974, when, under the Local Government Act 1972, it became a non-metropolitan district in the county of North Yorkshire, whilst retaining its Lord Mayor and its Sheriff. As a result of 1990s UK local government reform, York regained unitary status and saw a substantial alteration in its borders, taking in parts of Selby and Harrogate districts, and about half the population of the Ryedale district. The new boundary was imposed after central government rejected the former city council&#x27;s own proposal.

===Parliament===
From 1997 to 2010, the central part of the district was covered by the City of York constituency, while the remainder was split between the constituencies of Ryedale, Selby, and Vale of York. These constituencies were represented by Hugh Bayley, John Greenway, John Grogan, and Anne McIntosh respectively.

Following their review in 2003 of parliamentary representation in North Yorkshire, the Boundary Commission for England recommended the creation of two new seats for the City of York, in time for the general election in 2010. These are York Central, which covers the inner urban area, and is entirely surrounded by the York Outer constituency.
===Ceremonial===
York is within the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire and, until 1974, was within the jurisdiction of the Lord Lieutenant of the County of York, West Riding and the County of The City of York. The city does retain the right to appoint its own Sheriff. The holder of the Royal dukedom of York has no responsibilities either ceremonially or administratively as regards to the city.

==Geography==
===Location===

York lies in the Vale of York, a flat area of fertile arable land bordered by the Pennines, the North York Moors and the Yorkshire Wolds. The city was built at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal moraine left by the last ice age.


During Roman times, the land surrounding the Ouse and Foss was marshy, making the site easy to defend. The city is prone to flooding from the River Ouse, and has an extensive network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a liftable barrier across the Foss where it joins the Ouse at the &quot;Blue Bridge&quot;. In October and November 2000, York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years; more than 300 homes were flooded. In December 2015, the flooding was more extensive and caused major disruption. The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister David Cameron. Much land in and around the city is on flood plains too flood-prone for development other than agriculture. The &quot;ings&quot; are flood meadows along the Ouse, while the &quot;strays&quot; are open common grassland in various locations around the city.

===Climate===
York has a temperate climate (Cfb) with four distinct seasons. As with the rest of the Vale of York, the city&#x27;s climate is drier and warmer than the rest of the Yorkshire and the Humber region. Owing to its lowland location, York is prone to frosts, fog, and cold winds during winter, spring, and very early summer. Snow can fall in winter from December onwards to as late as April but quickly melts. As with much of the British Isles, the weather is changeable. York experiences most sunshine from May to July, an average of six hours per day. With its inland location, summers are often warmer than the Yorkshire coast with temperatures of 27 °C or more. Extremes recorded at the University of York campus between 1998 and 2010 include a highest temperature of and a lowest temperature of on 6 December 2010. The most rainfall in one day was .

===Green belt===
York&#x27;s urbanised areas are surrounded by a green belt that restricts development in the rural areas and parts of surrounding villages, to preserve the setting and historic character of the city. The green belt surrounds nearly all of the city and its outer villages, extending out into North Yorkshire.

==Demography==


The York urban area (built-up area) had a population of 153,717 at the time of the 2011 UK census, compared with 137,505 in 2001.
The population of the City of York (Local Authority) was 198,051 and its ethnic composition was 94.3% White, 1.2% Mixed, 3.4% Asian and 0.6% Black. York&#x27;s elderly population (those 65 and over) was %, however only 13.2% were listed as retired.

In 2001, the population density was . Of those aged 16–74 in York, 24.6% had no academic qualifications, a little lower than 28.9% in all of England. Of York&#x27;s residents, 5.1% were born outside the United Kingdom, significantly lower than the national average of 9.2%. White British form 95% of the population; the largest single minority group was recorded as Asian, at 1.9% of the population.

The number of theft-from-a-vehicle offences and theft of a vehicle per 1,000 of the population was 8.8 and 2.7, compared to the English national average of 6.9 and 2.7 respectively. The number of sexual offences was 0.9, in line with the national average. The national average of violence against another person was 16.2 compared to the York average of 17.5. The figures for crime statistics were all recorded during the 2006–07 financial year.

The city&#x27;s estimated population in 2019 was 210,620.

===Population change===


===Ethnicity===
===Religion===


Having &quot;No Religion&quot; was higher than the national average for York in 2011 and 0.9% lower than having a religion in 2021.

Christianity has the largest religious following in York, 43.9% residents reported as Christian in the 2021 census. York has multiple churches, most present churches in York are from the medieval period. Leaders of different Christian denominations work together across the city, forming a network of churches known as One Voice York.

There are 33 active Anglican churches in York. It is the northern province&#x27;s administrative centre, home to the Archbishop of York and the province&#x27;s Mother Church (York Minster). St William&#x27;s College behind the Minster, and Bedern Hall, off Goodramgate, are former dwelling places of the canons of the York Minster.

York, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Middlesbrough, has eight churches and a number of different Catholic religious orders. Other Christian denominations active in York include the Religious Society of Friends who have three meeting houses, Methodists, and Unitarians. St Columba&#x27;s United Reformed Church in Priory Street, originally built for the Presbyterians, dates from 1879.

Percentages in York following non-Christian religion were below England&#x27;s national average, in the 2011 census. York&#x27;s only Mosque is located in the Layerthorpe area, and the city also has a UK Islamic Mission centre. Various Buddhist traditions are represented in the city and around York. There is also an active Jewish community.

==Economy==
===Overview===

A July 2020 report by Council stated that York is worth &quot;£5.2 billion to the UK economy ... with 9,000 businesses and 110,000 people employed across the city&quot;. According to &quot;Make It York&quot;, the city benefits from features that include a well-educated workforce, &quot;excellent transport links to both national and international markets, pronounced strengths in a range of high value sectors, a pioneering digital infrastructure, outstanding business support networks ...&quot;.

York&#x27;s economy is based on the service industry, which in 2000 was responsible for 88.7% of employment in the city.

Statistics based on 2019 data indicated that tourism was worth over £765 million to the city, supported 24,000 jobs and attracted 8.4 million visitors each year.

The Employment Rate in 2018 was 78.8%. The private sector accounted for 77,000 jobs in 2019 while 34,500 jobs were in the public sector.

The service industries include public sector employment, health, education, finance, information technology (IT) and tourism that accounted for 10.7% of employment as of 2016. Tourism has become an important element of the economy, with the city offering a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural activities. As a holiday destination York was the 6th most visited English city by UK residents (2014–16) and the 13th most visited by overseas visitors (2016).
A 2014 report, based on 2012 data, stated that the city receives 6.9 million visitors annually; they contribute £564 million to the economy and support over 19,000 jobs. In the 2017 Condé Nast Traveller survey of readers, York rated 12th among The 15 Best Cities in the UK for visitors. In a 2020 Condé Nast Traveller report, York rated as the sixth best among ten &quot;urban destinations [in the UK] that scored the highest marks when it comes to ... nightlife, restaurants, and friendliness&quot;.

Unemployment in York was low at 4.2% in 2008 compared to the United Kingdom national average of 5.3%. The biggest employer in York is the City of York Council, with over 7,500 employees. Employers with more than 2,000 staff include Aviva (formerly Norwich Union Life), Network Rail, Northern Trains, York Hospitals NHS Trust and the University of York. Other major employers include BT Group, CPP Group, Nestlé, NFU Mutual and a number of railway companies.

A 2007 report stated that the economic position at that time very different from the 1950s, when its prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and the railways. This position continued until the early 1980s when 30% of the workforce were employed by just five employers and 75% of manufacturing jobs were in four companies. Most industry around the railway has gone, including the York Carriage Works, which at its height in the 1880s employed 5,500 people, but closed in the mid-1990s. York is the headquarters of the confectionery manufacturer Nestlé York (formerly Nestlé Rowntrees) and home to the &quot;KitKat&quot; and eponymous &quot;Yorkie&quot; bar chocolate brands. Terry&#x27;s chocolate factory, makers of the &quot;Chocolate Orange&quot;, was located in the city; but it closed on 30 September 2005, when production was moved by its owners, Kraft Foods, to Poland. The historic factory building is situated next to the Knavesmire racecourse.

On 20 September 2006, Nestlé announced that it would cut 645 jobs at the Rowntree&#x27;s chocolate factory in York. This came after a number of other job losses in the city at Aviva, British Sugar, and Terry&#x27;s chocolate factory. Despite this, the employment situation in York remained fairly buoyant until the effects of the late 2000s recession began to be felt.

Since the closure of the carriage works, the site has been developed into offices. York&#x27;s economy has been developing in the areas of science, technology and the creative industries. The city became a founding National Science City with the creation of a science park near the University of York. Between 1998 and 2008, York gained 80 new technology companies and 2,800 new jobs in the sector.

===Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic===
The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached England after cases were discovered in York on 31 January 2020. The pandemic caused an economic slowdown because of restrictions imposed on businesses and on travel in the UK; by January 2021, many cities were in their third lockdown and the country&#x27;s unemployment rate had reached its highest level in over four years. The retail, hospitality, and tourism sectors were especially hard hit in York. In August 2020, the campaign &quot;Make It York&quot; and the city council embarked on a six-month tourism marketing plan &quot;to reenergise the city while building resident and visitor confidence&quot;.

A report in June 2020 stated that unemployment had risen 114% over the previous year because of restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic. In addition to high unemployment during lockdown periods, one analysis by the York and North Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership predicted in August 2020 that &quot;as many as 13,835 jobs in York will be lost in the scenario considered most likely, taking the city&#x27;s unemployment rate to 14.5%&quot;. Some critics claimed that part of the problem was caused by &quot;over-reliance on the booming tourism industry at the expense of a long-term economic plan&quot;. Other analyses suggested that &quot;York is well-placed for the high street to recover and evolve from the pandemic if new businesses focus on creating an attraction or experience rather than traditional retail&quot;. The North Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership also &quot;predicted a significant rise in staycation trips to York in 2021&quot;.

==Public services==
Under the requirements of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, York City Council appointed a watch committee which established a police force and appointed a chief constable. On 1 June 1968 the York City, East Riding of Yorkshire, and North Riding of Yorkshire police forces were amalgamated to form the York and North East Yorkshire Police. Since 1974, Home Office policing in York has been provided by the North Yorkshire Police. The force&#x27;s central headquarters for policing York and nearby Selby are in Fulford. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, based in Northallerton.

The city&#x27;s first hospital, York County Hospital, opened in 1740 in Monkgate funded by public subscription. It closed in 1976 when it was replaced by York Hospital, which opened the same year and gained Foundation status in April 2007. It has 524 adult inpatient beds and 127 special purpose beds providing general healthcare and some specialist inpatient, daycase, and outpatient services. It is also known as York District Hospital and YDH.

The Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust was formed on 1 July 2006 bringing together South Yorkshire Ambulance Service, West Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and the North and East Yorkshire parts of Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service to provide patient transport. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by clinics and surgeries.

Since 1998, waste management has been co-ordinated via the York and North Yorkshire Waste Partnership. York&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is CE Electric UK; there are no power stations in the city. Yorkshire Water, which has a local water extraction plant on the River Derwent at Elvington, manages York&#x27;s drinking and waste water.

The city has a magistrates&#x27; court, and venues for the Crown Court and the County Court. York Crown Court was designed by the architect John Carr, and built next to the then prison (including execution area).

Between 1773 and 1777, the Grand Jury House was replaced by John Carr&#x27;s elegant Court House for the Assizes of the whole county.
 The Female Prison was built opposite and mirrors the court building positioned around a circular lawn which became known as the &quot;Eye of the Ridings&quot;, or the &quot;Eye of York&quot;.

1776 saw the last recorded instance of a wife hanged and burnt for poisoning her husband. Horse theft was a capital offence. The culprits of lesser crimes were brought to court by the city constables and would face a fine. The corporation employed a &quot;common informer&quot; whose task was to bring criminals to justice.

The former prison is now the Castle Museum but still contains the cells.

==Transport==
===Water===
York&#x27;s location on the River Ouse, and in the centre of the Vale of York, means that it has always had a significant position in the nation&#x27;s transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the Ouse and the Foss. The Ouse was originally a tidal river, accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today, both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A lock at Naburn on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.

Until the end of the 20th century, the Ouse was used by barges to carry freight between York and the port of Hull. The last significant such traffic was the supply of newsprint to the local newspaper&#x27;s Foss-side print works, which continued until 1997. Today, navigation is almost exclusively leisure-oriented.

===Roads===
Like most cities founded by the Romans, York is well served by long-distance trunk roads. The city lies at the intersection of the A19 road from Doncaster to Tyneside, the A59 road from Liverpool to York, the A64 road from Leeds to Scarborough and the A1079 road from York to Hull. The A64 road provides the principal link to the motorway network, linking York to both the A1(M) and the M1 motorways at a distance of about from the city. The trans-Pennine M62 motorway is less than away providing links to Manchester and Liverpool.
The city is surrounded on all sides by an outer ring road, at a distance of some from the centre of the city, which allows through traffic to by-pass the city. The street plan of the historic core of the city dates from medieval times and is not suitable for modern traffic. As a consequence, many of the routes inside the city walls are designated as car-free during business hours or restrict traffic entirely. To alleviate this situation, six bus-based park and ride sites operate in York. The sites are located towards the edge of the urban area, with easy access from the ring road and allow out of town visitors to complete their journey into the city centre by bus.

===Buses===
Public transport within the city is largely bus-based. First York operates the majority of the city&#x27;s local bus services, as well as the York park and ride services. York was the location of the first implementation of FirstGroup&#x27;s experimental and controversial FTR bus concept, which sought to confer the advantages of a modern tramway system at a lower cost. The service was withdrawn following an election manifesto pledge by the Labour Group at the 2011 local government election. Transdev York also operates a large number of local bus services. Open-top tourist and sightseeing buses are operated by Transdev York, on behalf of City Sightseeing and York Pullman on behalf of Golden Tours.

Rural services, linking local towns and villages with York, are provided by a number of companies with Transdev York &amp; Country, East Yorkshire and Reliance Motor Services operating most of them. Longer-distance bus services are provided by a number of operators, including Arriva Yorkshire services to Selby, East Yorkshire services to Hull, Beverley, Market Weighton and Pocklington, and Transdev York &amp; Country services to Boroughbridge, Knaresborough, Harrogate, Castle Howard and Malton. Yorkshire Coastliner links Leeds and York with Scarborough, Malton, Pickering and Whitby.

===Railway===
The city has been a major railway centre since the first line arrived in 1839, at the beginning of the railway age. For many years, the city hosted the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway.

York railway station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line. It is served by five train operating companies:

===Air===
The closest international airports are Leeds Bradford, which is away from the city centre, Teesside , Humberside . Further afield are Manchester and Newcastle .

Manchester Airport – with connections to Europe, North America, Africa and Asia – has direct rail links by TransPennine Express with its . By road, it is accessible by the A64 to the M60 via the A1(M) motorway, M1 and M62.

Teesside Airport has one rail connection via Darlington and Eaglescliffe, with a limited service by bus from . By road, it is accessible by the A19 north to the A67. Newcastle Airport has one connection via Newcastle station, with the metro to ; it is accessible by the A1(M) north to the A1 then the A696.

Leeds Bradford and Humberside have no direct railway stations, with bus route connections instead. Leeds Bradford serves most major European and North African airports. Humberside is accessible by the A1079 to the A15 via the A63; Leeds Bradford by the A59 to the A658 via the A661.

York has an airfield at the former RAF Elvington, south-east of the city centre, which is the home of the Yorkshire Air Museum and used for private aviation. In 2003, plans were drafted to expand the site for business aviation or a full commercial service. Former RAF Church Fenton is also near the city and private; it is now called Leeds East.

==Education==
===Institutions===

York Castle, a complex of buildings ranging from the medieval Clifford&#x27;s Tower to the 20th-century entrance to the York Castle Museum (formerly a prison) has had a chequered history. As well as the Castle Museum, the city contains numerous other museums and historic buildings such as the Yorkshire Museum and its Museum Gardens, Jorvik Viking Centre, York Art Gallery, Merchant Adventurers&#x27; Hall, the reconstructed medieval house Barley Hall (owned by the York Archaeological Trust), the 18th-century Fairfax House, the Mansion House (the historic home of the Lord Mayor) and the so-called Treasurer&#x27;s House (owned by the National Trust). The National Railway Museum is situated just beyond the station, and is home to a vast range of transport material and the largest collection of railway locomotives in the world. Included in this collection are the world&#x27;s fastest steam locomotive LNER Class A4 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; and the world-famous LNER Class A3 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;, which has been overhauled in the Museum.
Although noted for its Medieval history, visitors can also gain an understanding of the Cold War through visiting the York Cold War Bunker, former headquarters of No 20 Group of the Royal Observer Corps.

The city&#x27;s first subscription library opened in 1794. The first free public library, the York Library, was built on Clifford Street in 1893, to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s jubilee. A new building was erected on Museum Street in 1927, and this is still the library today; it was extended in 1934 and 1938.

===Higher and further===
The University of York&#x27;s main campus is on the southern edge of the city at Heslington. The Department of Archaeology and the graduate Centres for Eighteenth Century Studies and Medieval Studies are located in the historic King&#x27;s Manor in the city centre.

It was York&#x27;s only institution with university status until 2006, when the more centrally located York St John University, formerly an autonomous college of the University of Leeds, attained full university status. The city formerly hosted a branch of the University of Law before it moved to Leeds. The University of York also has a medical school, Hull York Medical School.

The city has two major further education institutions. York College is an amalgamation of York Technical College and York Sixth Form College. Students there study a very wide range of academic and vocational courses, and range from school leavers and sixth formers to people training to make career moves. Askham Bryan College offers further education courses, foundation and honours degrees, specialising in more vocational subjects such as horticulture, agriculture, animal management and even golf course management.

===Secondary and primary===
There are 70 local council schools with over 24,000 pupils in the City of York Council area. The City of York Council manages most primary and secondary schools within the city. Primary schools cover education from ages 5–11, with some offering early years education from age 3. From 11 to 16 education is provided by 10 secondary schools, four of which offer additional education up to the age of 18. In 2007, Oaklands Sports College and Lowfield Comprehensive School merged to become one school known as York High School.

There is one &quot;outstanding&quot; Roman Catholic secondary school in the city, All Saints School, which was founded in 1665, the school is split-site meaning that the education of lower years (years 7–9) happens on the Lower Site attached to the oldest running convent in the country, Bar Convent. And the upper years including sixth form are taught on the Upper Site which is on Mill Mount, the former site of Mill Mount County Grammar School for Girls. The Sixth form is the largest sixth form in the city. As a school it plays an essential role in York&#x27;s Catholic community being the only secondary institution dedicated to the denomination. It was the first Catholic school in the country to admit girls for education in the 1660s.

York also has several private schools. St Peter&#x27;s School was founded in 627. The scholar Alcuin, who went on to serve Charlemagne, taught there. It was also the school attended by Guy Fawkes.

Two schools have Quaker origins: Bootham School is co-educational and The Mount School is all-girls. Another all-girls school is Queen Margaret&#x27;s School, which was established under the Woodard Foundation.

==Culture==
The city is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a city of &quot;Media Arts&quot;. An unsuccessful 2010 bid by York city council and a number of heritage organisations to make a UNESCO World Heritage Site indirectly led to the city making a successful bid for its title.

===Theatre===
The Theatre Royal, which was established in 1744, produces an annual pantomime which attracts loyal audiences from around the country. The theatre&#x27;s veteran star, Berwick Kaler, often played the dame, before he retired from acting in the pantomime in 2019, and officially parted ways with the theatre after the so-called &quot;Panto Wars&quot;. The Theatre Royal continues to produce an annual pantomime without Kaler, who came out of retirement in 2021 to star in a new panto at The Grand Opera House. Both the Grand Opera House and Joseph Rowntree Theatre also offer a variety of productions. The city is home to the Riding Lights Theatre Company, which as well as operating a busy national touring department, also operates a busy youth theatre and educational departments. York is also home to a number of amateur dramatic groups. The Department of Theatre, Film and Television and Student Societies of the University of York put on public drama performances.

The York Mystery Plays are performed in public at intervals, using texts based on the original medieval plays of this type that were performed by the guilds – often with specific connections to the subject matter of each play. (For instance the Shipwrights&#x27; Play is the &quot;Building of Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; and the fish-sellers and mariners the &quot;Landing of Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;). The York Cycle of Mystery Plays or Pageants is the most complete in England. Originally performed from wagons at various locations around the city from the 14th century until 1570, they were revived in 1951 during the Festival of Britain, when York was one of the cities with a regional festival. They became part of the York City Festival every three years and later four years. They were mostly produced in a temporary open-air theatre within the ruins of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, using some professional but mostly amateur actors. Lead actors have included Christopher Timothy and Robson Green (in the role of Christ) and Dame Judi Dench as a school girl, in 1951, 1954 and 1957. (She remains a Patron of the plays). The cycle was presented in the Theatre Royal in 1992 and 1996, within York Minster in 2000 and in 2002, 2006 and 2010 by Guild groups from wagons in the squares, in the Dean&#x27;s Park, or at the Eye of York. They go around the streets, recreating the original productions. In 2012, the York Mystery Plays were performed between 2 and 27 August at St Mary&#x27;s Abbey in the York Museum Gardens.

===Music===
The Academy of St Olave&#x27;s, a chamber orchestra which gives concerts in St Olave&#x27;s Church, Marygate, is one of the music groups that perform regularly in York. A former church, St Margaret&#x27;s, Walmgate, is the National Centre for Early Music, which hosts concerts, broadcasts, competitions and events including the York Early Music Festival. Students, staff and visiting artists of York St John University music department regularly perform lunchtime concerts in the university chapel. The staff and students of the University of York also perform in the city.

===Food and drink===
Each September since 1997, York has held an annual Festival of Food and Drink. The aim of the festival is to spotlight food culture in York and North Yorkshire by promoting local food production. The Festival attracts up to 150,000 visitors over 10 days from all over the country.

The Assize of Ale is an annual event in the city where people in medieval costume take part in a pub crawl to raise money for local charities. It has its origins in the 13th century, when an Assize of Bread and Ale was used to regulate the quality of goods. The current version was resurrected in 1990/91 by the then Sheriff of York, Peter Brown, and is led by the Guild of Scriveners.

The Knavesmire, home of York Racecourse, plays host to Yorkshire&#x27;s largest beer festival every September run by York CAMRA – York Beer &amp; Cider Festival. It is housed in a marquee opposite the grandstand of the racecourse in the enclosure and in 2016 offered over 450 real ales and over 100 ciders.
A product claimed to be local is York ham, a mild-flavoured ham with delicate pink colouring. It is traditionally served with Madeira Sauce. The ham has been described as a lightly smoked, dry-cured ham that is saltier but milder in flavour than other European dry-cured hams. Folklore has it that the oak construction for York Minster provided the sawdust for smoking the ham. A likely apocryphal story attributes Robert Burrow Atkinson&#x27;s butchery shop, in Blossom Street, to be the birthplace of the original York ham, or at least to have made it famous.

==Attractions==
===Architecture===
York Minster, a large Gothic cathedral, dominates the city.

York&#x27;s centre is enclosed by the city&#x27;s medieval walls, which are a popular walk. These defences are the most complete in England. They have the only walls set on high ramparts and they retain all their principal gateways. They incorporate part of the walls of the Roman fortress and some Norman and medieval work, as well as 19th- and 20th-century renovations.

The entire circuit is approximately , and encloses an area of . The north-east section includes a part where walls never existed, because the Norman moat of York Castle, formed by damming the River Foss, also created a lake which acted as a city defence. This lake was later called the King&#x27;s Fishpond, as the rights to fish belonged to the Crown.
A feature of central York is the Snickelways, narrow pedestrian routes, many of which led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson&#x27;s Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Its unusual name comes from an old English term for an open-air slaughterhouse or meat market. Most of these premises were once butchers&#x27; shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, although it is not located in the house where she lived. Goodramgate has many medieval houses including the early-14th‑century Lady Row built to finance a Chantry, at the edge of the churchyard of Holy Trinity church.
===Pubs===
In June 2015, York CAMRA listed 101 pubs on its map of the city centre, some of which are hundreds of years old. These include the Golden Fleece, Ye Olde Starre Inne, noted for its sign which has spanned the street since 1733, and The Kings Arms, often photographed during floods. On 18 June 2016, York CAMRA undertook a &quot;Beer Census&quot; and found 328 unique real ales being served in over 200 pubs in York, reinforcing the city&#x27;s reputation as a top UK beer destination.

===Tea Rooms===
In the centre of York, in St Helen&#x27;s Square, there is the York branch of Bettys Café Tea Rooms. Bettys&#x27; founder, Frederick Belmont, travelled on the maiden voyage of the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of the ship that he employed the Queen Mary&#x27;s designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into an elegant café in St Helen&#x27;s Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement &#x27;Bettys Bar&#x27; became a favourite haunt of the thousands of airmen stationed around York. &#x27;Bettys Mirror&#x27;, on which many of them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display today as a tribute to them.

==Media==
The York area is served by a local newspaper, &quot;The Press&quot; (known as the &quot;Evening Press&quot; until April 2006), &quot;The York Advertiser&quot; newspaper (based at &quot;The Press&quot; on Walmgate), and four local radio stations: BBC Radio York, YorkMix Radio, YO1 Radio and Jorvik Radio. A local commercial radio station, Minster FM, broadcast until 2020 when it was replaced by Greatest Hits Radio York and North Yorkshire. Another digital news and radio website is YorkMix run by former print journalists, that incorporates Local News; What&#x27;s On; Food &amp; Drink; Things To Do and Business sections with articles written by residents and local journalists. In August 2016 YorkMix was nominated in two categories in the O2 Media Awards for Yorkshire and The Humber.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and BBC North East and Cumbria on BBC One and ITV Yorkshire and ITV Tyne Tees on ITV. Television signals are received from either the Emley Moor or Bilsdale transmitters. 

On 27 November 2013, Ofcom awarded the 12-year local TV licence for the York area to a consortium entitled The York Channel, with the channel due to be on air in spring 2015. This service is now on air as That&#x27;s TV North Yorkshire.

York St John University has a Film and Television Production department with links to many major industrial partners. The department hosts an annual festival of student work and a showcase of other regional films.

The University of York has its own television station York Student Television (YSTV) and two campus newspapers &quot;Nouse&quot; and &quot;York Vision&quot;. Its radio station URY is the longest running legal independent radio station in the UK, and was voted Student Radio Station of the Year 2020 at the Student Radio Awards.

==Sport==
===Football===
The city&#x27;s association football team is York City who are competing in the as of the 2023–24 season. York have played as high as the old Second Division but are best known for their &#x27;giant killing&#x27; status in cup competitions, having reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1955 and beaten Manchester United 3–0 during the 1995–96 League Cup.

York also has a strong rugby league history. York FC, later known as York Wasps, formed in 1868, were one of the oldest rugby league clubs in the country but the effects of a move to the out of town Huntington Stadium, poor results and falling attendances led to their bankruptcy in 2002. The supporters formed a new club, York City Knights, who played at the same stadium until 2015 when they moved to Bootham Crescent. In 2021, they moved to York Community Stadium. In 2022, the club was renamed York RLFC and the men&#x27;s team (York Knights) play in The Championship and the women&#x27;s team (York Valkyrie) play in the Super League. There are three amateur rugby league teams in York; New Earswick All Blacks (in New Earswick), York Acorn and Heworth. York International 9s was an annual rugby league nines tournament which took place in York between 2002 and 2009. Amateur side York Lokomotive compete in the Rugby League Conference.

This major horseracing venue is located on the Knavesmire and sees thousands flocking to the city every year for the 15 race meetings. The Knavesmire Racecourse also hosted Royal Ascot in 2005. In August, racing takes place over the four-day Ebor Festival that includes the Ebor Handicap dating from 1843.

On 6 July 2014, York hosted the start of Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France. Starting the Départ Fictif from York Racecourse, the riders travelled through the city centre to the Départ Actuel on the A59 just beyond the junction with the Outer Ring Road heading towards Knaresborough. In 2015, the inaugural Tour de Yorkshire was held as a legacy event to build on the popularity of the previous year, with the Day 2 stage finishing in York.

<doc id="34363" wikidata="Q960841" url="?curid=34363" title="Fujiwara no Yoshifusa">
<text>, also known as &quot;Somedono no Daijin&quot; or &quot;Shirakawa-dono&quot;, was a Japanese statesman, courtier and politician during the Heian period.

When Yoshifusa&#x27;s grandson was enthroned as Emperor Seiwa, Yoshifusa assumed the role of regent (&quot;sesshō&quot;) for the young monarch. He was the first &quot;sesshō&quot; in Japanese history who was not himself of imperial rank; and he was the first of a series of regents from the Fujiwara clan.

==Career==
He was a minister during the reigns of Emperor Ninmyō, Emperor Montoku and Emperor Seiwa.

* 834 (&quot;Jōwa 1, 9th day of the 7th month&quot;): Sangi
* 835 (&quot;Jōwa 2&quot;): Gon-no-Chūnagon
* 840 (&quot;Jōwa 7&quot;): Chūnagon
* 842 (&quot;Jōwa 9&quot;): Dainagon
* 848 (&quot;Saikō 1, 1st month&quot;): Udaijin
* 857 (&quot;Saikō 4, 19th day of the 2nd month&quot;): Daijō Daijin
* 858 (&quot;Ten&#x27;an 2, 7th day of the 11th month&quot;): Sesshō for Emperor Seiwa.
* October 7, 872 (&quot;Jōgan 14, 2nd day of the 9th month&quot;): Yoshifusa died at the age of 69.

Yoshifusa conceived the programme of boy-sovereigns with Fujiwara regents; and his adopted son, Mototsune, carried out the plans.

==Genealogy==
This member of the Fujiwara clan was the son of Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu. Yoshifusa&#x27;s brothers were Fujiwara no Nagayoshi, Fujiwara no Yoshisuke and Fujiwara no Yoshikado.

==Marriages and children==
He was married to Minamoto no Kiyohime (源 潔姫), daughter of Emperor Saga.

They had only one daughter.
* Akirakeiko/&quot;Meishi&quot; (明子) (829–899), consort of Emperor Montoku

He adopted his brother Nagara&#x27;s third son.
*Mototsune (基経) (836–891) – Daijō Daijin and Kampaku

Yoshifusa is referred to as &quot;Chūjin Kō&quot; (忠仁公) (posthumous title was Daijō Daijin).

<doc id="34364" wikidata="Q231443" url="?curid=34364" title="Yellow journalism">
<text>In journalism, yellow journalism and the yellow press are American newspapers that use eye-catching headlines and sensationalized exaggerations for increased sales. This term is chiefly used in American English, whereas in the United Kingdom, the similar term &quot;tabloid journalism &quot; is more common. Other languages, e.g. Russian (жёлтая пресса &quot;zhyoltaya pressa&quot;), sometimes have terms derived from the American term. Yellow journalism emerged in the intense battle for readers by two newspapers in New York City in the 1890s. It was not common in other cities.

Joseph Pulitzer purchased the &quot;New York World&quot; in 1883 and told his editors to use sensationalism, crusades against corruption, and lavish use of illustrations to boost circulation. William Randolph Hearst then purchased the rival &quot;New York Journal&quot; in 1895. They engaged in an intense circulation war, at a time when most men bought one copy every day from rival street vendors shouting their paper&#x27;s headlines. The term &quot;yellow journalism&quot; originated from the innovative popular &quot;Yellow Kid&quot; comic strip that was published first in the &quot;World&quot; and later in the &quot;Journal.&quot;

This type of reporting was characterized by exaggerated headlines, unverified claims, partisan agendas, and a focus on topics like crime, scandal, sports, and violence. Historians have debated whether Yellow journalism played a large role in inflaming public opinion about Spain&#x27;s atrocities in Cuba at the time, and perhaps pushing the U.S. into the Spanish-American War of 1898. Most historians say it did not do so. The two papers reached a working class Democratic audience, and the nation&#x27;s upscale Republican decision makers (such as President William McKinley and leaders in Congress) seldom read the Yellow press.

==Definitions==
Journalism historian W. Joseph Campbell described yellow press newspapers as having daily multi-column front-page headlines covering a variety of topics, such as sports and scandal, using bold layouts (with large illustrations and perhaps color), heavy reliance on unnamed sources, and unabashed self-promotion. The term was extensively used to describe two major New York City newspapers around 1900 as they battled for circulation.

Journalism historian Frank Luther Mott used five characteristics to identify yellow journalism:
# scare headlines in huge print, often sensationalizing minor news
# lavish use of pictures, or imaginary drawings
# use of faked interviews, misleading headlines, pseudoscience, and a parade of false learning from so-called experts
# emphasis on full-color Sunday supplements, usually with superficial articles and comics
# dramatic sympathy with the &quot;underdog&quot; against the system.
Another common feature was emphasizing sensationalized crime reporting to boost sales and excite public opinion.

== Origins: Pulitzer vs. Hearst ==
=== Coinage and early usage ===
An English magazine in 1898 noted, &quot;All American journalism is not &#x27;yellow&#x27;, though all strictly &#x27;up-to-date&#x27; yellow journalism is American!&quot;

The term was coined in the mid-1890s to characterize the sensational journalism in the circulation war between Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;New York World&quot; and William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot;. The battle peaked from 1895 to about 1898, and historical usage often refers specifically to this period. Both papers were sensationalizing the news in order to drive up circulation, although the newspapers did serious reporting as well. Richard F. Outcault, the author of a popular cartoon strip, the Yellow Kid, was tempted away from the &quot;World&quot; by Hearst and the cartoon accounted substantially towards a big increase in sales of the &quot;Journal&quot;.

The term was coined by Ervin Wardman, the editor of the &quot;New York Press&quot;. Wardman was the first to publish the term but there is evidence that expressions such as &quot;yellow journalism&quot; and &quot;school of yellow kid journalism&quot; were already used by newsmen of that time. Wardman never defined the term exactly. Possibly it was a mutation from earlier slander where Wardman twisted &quot;new journalism&quot; into &quot;nude journalism&quot;. Wardman had also used the expression &quot;yellow kid journalism&quot; referring to the then-popular comic strip which was published by both Pulitzer and Hearst during a circulation war.

===Hearst in San Francisco, Pulitzer in New York===
Joseph Pulitzer purchased the &quot;New York World&quot; in 1883 after making the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; the dominant daily in that city. Pulitzer strove to make the &quot;New York World&quot; an entertaining read, and filled his paper with pictures, games and contests that drew in new readers. Crime stories filled many of the pages, with headlines like &quot;Was He a Suicide?&quot; and &quot;Screaming for Mercy&quot;. In addition, Pulitzer charged readers only two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information (the only other two-cent paper in the city never exceeded four pages).

While there were many sensational stories in the &quot;New York World&quot;, they were by no means the only pieces, or even the dominant ones. Pulitzer believed that newspapers were public institutions with a duty to improve society, and he put the &quot;World&quot; in the service of social reform. Pulitzer explained that: The American people want something terse, forcible, picturesque, striking, something that will arrest their attention, enlist their sympathy, arouse their indignation, stimulate their imagination, convince their reason, [and] awaken their conscience.

Just two years after Pulitzer took it over, the &quot;World&quot; became the highest-circulation newspaper in New York, aided in part by its strong ties to the Democratic Party. Older publishers, envious of Pulitzer&#x27;s success, began criticizing the &quot;World&quot;, harping on its crime stories and stunts while ignoring its more serious reporting—trends which influenced the popular perception of yellow journalism. Charles Dana, editor of the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, attacked &quot;The World&quot; and said Pulitzer was &quot;deficient in judgment and in staying power.&quot;

Pulitzer&#x27;s approach made an impression on William Randolph Hearst, a mining heir who acquired the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; from his father in 1887. Hearst studied the &quot;World&quot; and resolved to make the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; as bright as Pulitzer&#x27;s paper.

Hearst could be hyperbolic in his crime coverage; one of his early pieces, regarding a &quot;band of murderers&quot;, attacked the police for forcing &quot;Examiner&quot; reporters to do their work for them. But while indulging in these stunts, the &quot;Examiner&quot; also increased its space for international news, and sent reporters out to uncover municipal corruption and inefficiency.

In one well remembered story, &quot;Examiner&quot; reporter Winifred Black was admitted into a San Francisco hospital and discovered that poor women were treated with &quot;gross cruelty&quot;. The entire hospital staff was fired the morning the piece appeared.

===Competition in New York===

With the success of the &quot;Examiner&quot; established by the early 1890s, Hearst began looking for a New York newspaper to purchase, and acquired the &quot;New York Journal&quot; in 1895, a penny paper.

Metropolitan newspapers started going after department store advertising in the 1890s, and discovered the larger the circulation base, the better. This drove Hearst; following Pulitzer&#x27;s earlier strategy, he kept the &quot;Journal&quot;″s price at one cent (compared to &quot;The World&quot;″s two-cent price) while providing as much information as rival newspapers. The approach worked, and as the &quot;Journal&quot;″s circulation jumped to 150,000, Pulitzer cut his price to a penny, hoping to drive his young competitor into bankruptcy.

In a counterattack, Hearst raided the staff of the &quot;World&quot; in 1896. While most sources say that Hearst simply offered more money, Pulitzer—who had grown increasingly abusive to his employees—had become a difficult man to work for, and many &quot;World&quot; employees were willing to jump for the sake of getting away from him.

Although the competition between the &quot;World&quot; and the &quot;Journal&quot; was fierce, the papers were temperamentally alike. Both were Democratic, both were sympathetic to labor and immigrants (a sharp contrast to upscale papers like the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;″s Whitelaw Reid, that blamed poverty on moral defects). Both invested enormous resources in their Sunday editions, which functioned like weekly magazines, going beyond the normal scope of daily journalism.

Their Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages. &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley,&quot; a comic strip revolving around a bald child in a yellow nightshirt (nicknamed The Yellow Kid), became exceptionally popular when cartoonist Richard F. Outcault began drawing it in the &quot;World&quot; in early 1896. When Hearst hired Outcault away, Pulitzer asked artist George Luks to continue the strip with his characters, giving the city two Yellow Kids. The use of &quot;yellow journalism&quot; as a synonym for over-the-top sensationalism thus started with more serious newspapers commenting on the excesses of &quot;the Yellow Kid papers&quot;.

== Spanish–American War ==

Pulitzer and Hearst in the 1920s and 1930s were blamed as a cause of entry into the Spanish–American War due to sensationalist stories or exaggerations of the terrible conditions in Cuba. However, the majority of Americans did not live in New York City, and the decision-makers who did live there relied more on staid newspapers like the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot;, or the &quot;Post&quot;. James Creelman wrote an anecdote in his memoir that artist Frederic Remington telegrammed Hearst to tell him all was quiet in Cuba and &quot;There will be no war.&quot; Creelman claimed Hearst responded &quot;Please remain. You furnish the pictures and I&#x27;ll furnish the war.&quot; Hearst denied the veracity of the story, and no one has found any evidence of the telegrams existing. Historian Emily Erickson states:

Hearst became a war hawk after a rebellion broke out in Cuba in 1895. Stories of Cuban virtue and Spanish brutality soon dominated his front page. While the accounts were of dubious accuracy, the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not expect, or necessarily want, his stories to be pure nonfiction. Historian Michael Robertson has said that &quot;Newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact-based reporting, opinion and literature.&quot;

Pulitzer, though lacking Hearst&#x27;s resources, kept the story on his front page. The yellow press covered the revolution extensively and often inaccurately, but conditions on Cuba were horrific enough. The island was in a terrible economic depression, and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler, sent to crush the rebellion, herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps, leading hundreds of Cubans to their deaths. Having clamored for a fight for two years, Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came: A week after the United States declared war on Spain, he ran &quot;How do you like the &quot;Journal&#x27;s&quot; war?&quot; on his front page. In fact, President William McKinley never read the &quot;Journal&quot;, nor newspapers like the &quot;Tribune&quot; and the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;. Moreover, journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism was largely confined to New York City, and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not follow their lead. The &quot;Journal&quot; and the &quot;World&quot; were pitched to Democrats in New York City and were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers; they seldom made headlines outside New York City. Piero Gleijeses looked at 41 major newspapers and finds:
:Eight of the papers in my sample advocated war or measures that would lead to war before the Maine blew up; twelve joined the pro-war ranks in the wake of the explosion; thirteen strongly opposed the war until hostilities began. The borders between the groups are fluid. For example, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Dun&#x27;s Review&quot; opposed the war, but their opposition was muted. The &quot;New York Herald&quot;, the &quot;New York Commercial Advertiser&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Times-Herald&quot; came out in favour of war in March, but with such extreme reluctance that it is misleading to include them in the pro-war ranks.
War came because public opinion was sickened by the bloodshed, and because leaders like McKinley realized that Spain had lost control of Cuba. These factors weighed more on the president&#x27;s mind than the melodramas in the &quot;New York Journal.&quot; Nick Kapur says that McKinley&#x27;s actions were based more on his values of arbitrationism, pacifism, humanitarianism, and manly self-restraint, than on external pressures.

When the invasion began, Hearst sailed directly to Cuba as a war correspondent, providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting. Creelman later praised the work of the reporters for exposing the horrors of Spanish misrule, arguing, &quot;no true history of the war ... can be written without an acknowledgment that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the Spanish–American War was due to the enterprise and tenacity of &quot;yellow journalists,&quot; many of whom lie in unremembered graves.&quot;

===After the war===
Hearst was a leading Democrat who promoted William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896 and 1900. He later ran for mayor and governor and even sought the presidential nomination, but lost much of his personal prestige when outrage exploded in 1901 after columnist Ambrose Bierce and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that suggested the assassination of William McKinley. When McKinley was shot on September 6, 1901, critics accused Hearst&#x27;s Yellow Journalism of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed. It was later presumed that Hearst did not know of Bierce&#x27;s column, and he claimed to have pulled Brisbane&#x27;s after it ran in a first edition, but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life, and all but destroyed his presidential ambitions.

When later asked about Hearst&#x27;s reaction to the incident, Bierce reportedly said, &quot;I have never mentioned the matter to him, and he never mentioned it to me.&quot;

Pulitzer, haunted by his &quot;yellow sins,&quot; returned the &quot;World&quot; to its crusading roots as the new century dawned. By the time of his death in 1911, the &quot;World&quot; was a widely respected publication, and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in 1931. Its name lived on in the Scripps-Howard &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;, and then later the &quot;New York World-Telegram and Sun&quot; in 1950, and finally was last used by the &quot;New York World-Journal-Tribune&quot; from September 1966 to May 1967. At that point, only one broadsheet newspaper was left in New York City.

<text>Yersinia pestis (&quot;Y. pestis&quot;; formerly &quot;Pasteurella pestis&quot;) is a gram-negative, non-motile, coccobacillus bacterium without spores that is related to both &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot; and &quot;Yersinia pseudotuberculosis&quot;, the pathogen from which &quot;Y. pestis&quot; evolved and responsible for the Far East scarlet-like fever. It causes the disease plague, which caused the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, the deadliest pandemic in recorded history. Plague takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic. It is a facultative anaerobic organism that can infect humans primarily via the Oriental rat flea (&quot;Xenopsylla cheopis&quot;), but also through airborne droplets for its pneumonic form. &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; is a parasite of its host, the rat flea, which is also a parasite of rats, hence &quot;Y. pestis&quot; is a hyperparasite.

&quot;Y. pestis&quot; was discovered in 1894 by Alexandre Yersin, a Swiss/French physician and bacteriologist from the Pasteur Institute, during an epidemic of the plague in Hong Kong. Yersin was a member of the Pasteur school of thought. Kitasato Shibasaburō, a Japanese bacteriologist who practised Koch&#x27;s methodology, was also engaged at the time in finding the causative agent of the plague. However, Yersin actually linked plague with a bacillus, initially named &quot;Pasteurella pestis&quot;; it was renamed &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; in 1944.

Between one thousand and two thousand cases of the plague are still reported to the World Health Organization every year. With proper antibiotic treatment, the prognosis for victims is much better than before antibiotics were developed. Cases in Asia increased five- to six-fold during the time of the Vietnam War, possibly due to the disruption of ecosystems and closer proximity between people and animals. The plague is now commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, areas that now account for over 95% of reported cases. The plague also has a detrimental effect on non-human mammals; in the United States, these include the black-tailed prairie dog and the endangered black-footed ferret.

== General features ==
&quot;Y. pestis&quot; is a non-motile coccobacillus, a facultative anaerobic bacterium with bipolar staining (giving it a safety pin appearance) that produces an antiphagocytic slime layer. Similar to other &quot;Yersinia&quot; species, it tests negative for urease, lactose fermentation, and indole. The species grows best in temperatures of 28–30 °C, and at a pH of 7.2–7.6 (it still grows slowly), but can live in a large temperature and pH range. It dies very rapidly if exposed to a UV light, gets dried out, or in temperatures higher than 40°C. There are 11 species in the &quot;Yersinia&quot; genus, and three of them cause human diseases. The other two are &quot;Yersinia pseudotuberculosis&quot; and &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot;, infections by either of these are usually acquired from ingesting contaminated food or water.

==Genome and proteome==
===Genome===
Several complete genome sequences are available for various strains and subspecies of &quot;Y. pestis&quot;: strain KIM (of biovar &quot;Y. p. medievalis&quot;), and strain CO92 (of biovar &quot;Y. p. orientalis&quot;, obtained from a clinical isolate in the United States). In 2006 the genome sequence of a strain of biovar Antiqua was completed. Some strains are non-pathogenic, such as that of strain 91001, whose sequence was published in 2004.
=== Plasmids ===
Like &quot;Y. pseudotuberculosis&quot; and &quot;Y. enterocolitica&quot;, &quot;Y. pestis&quot; is host to the plasmid pCD1. It also hosts two other plasmids, pPCP1 (also called pPla or pPst) and pMT1 (also called pFra) that are not carried by the other &quot;Yersinia&quot; species. pFra codes for a phospholipase D that is important for the ability of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; to be transmitted by fleas. pPla codes for a protease, Pla, that activates plasmin in human hosts and is a very important virulence factor for pneumonic plague. Together, these plasmids, and a pathogenicity island called HPI, encode several proteins that cause the pathogenesis for which &quot;Y. pestis&quot; is famous. Among other things, these virulence factors are required for bacterial adhesion and injection of proteins into the host cell, invasion of bacteria in the host cell (via a type-III secretion system), and acquisition and binding of iron harvested from red blood cells (by siderophores). &quot;Y. pestis&quot; is thought to be descended from &quot;Y. pseudotuberculosis&quot;, DNA studies have found that the two are 83% similar, which is high enough to be considered the same species. In 1981 it was proposed that &quot;Y. pestis&quot; be reclassified as a subspecies of &quot;Y. pseudotuberculosis&quot;, but the Judicial Commission of the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology declined to do this because the course of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; disease is so different than that of &quot;Y. pseudotuberculosis&quot;, which usually causes a mild diarrhea, that reclassification would generate confusion.

=== Proteome ===
A comprehensive and comparative proteomics analysis of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; strain KIM was performed in 2006. The analysis focused on growth under four different sets of conditions that were designed to model flea and mammal hosts.

===Small noncoding RNA===
Numerous bacterial small noncoding RNAs have been identified to play regulatory functions. Some can regulate the virulence genes. Some 63 novel putative sRNAs were identified through deep sequencing of the &quot;Y. pestis&quot; sRNA-ome. Among them was &quot;Yersinia&quot;-specific (also present in &quot;Y. pseudotuberculosis&quot; and &quot;Y. enterocolitica&quot;) Ysr141 (&quot;Yersinia&quot; small RNA 141). Ysr141 sRNA was shown to regulate the synthesis of the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector protein YopJ. The Yop-Ysc T3SS is a critical component of virulence for &quot;Yersinia&quot; species. Many novel sRNAs were identified from &quot;Y. pestis&quot; grown &quot;in vitro&quot; and in the infected lungs of mice suggesting they play role in bacterial physiology or pathogenesis. Among them sR035 predicted to pair with SD region and transcription initiation site of a thermo-sensitive regulator ymoA, and sR084 predicted to pair with fur, ferric uptake regulator.

==Pathogenesis and immunity==
In the urban and sylvatic (forest) cycles of &quot;Y. pestis,&quot; most of the spreading occurs between rodents and fleas. In the sylvatic cycle, the rodent is wild, but in the urban cycle, the rodent is primarily the brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;). In addition, &quot;Y. pestis&quot; can spread from the urban environment and back. Transmission to humans is usually through the bite of infected fleas. If the disease has progressed to the pneumonic form, humans can spread the bacterium to others through airborne respiratory droplets; others who catch plague this way will mostly contract the pneumonic form themselves.

===Mammals as hosts===
Several species of rodents serve as the main reservoir for &quot;Y. pestis&quot; in the environment. In the steppes, the natural reservoir is believed to be principally the marmot. In the western United States, several species of rodents are thought to maintain &quot;Y. pestis&quot;. However, the expected disease dynamics have not been found in any rodent. Several species of rodents are known to have a variable resistance, which could lead to an asymptomatic carrier status. Evidence indicates fleas from other mammals have a role in human plague outbreaks.

The lack of knowledge of the dynamics of plague in mammal species is also true among susceptible rodents such as the black-tailed prairie dog (&quot;Cynomys ludovicianus&quot;), in which plague can cause colony collapse, resulting in a massive effect on prairie food webs. However, the transmission dynamics within prairie dogs do not follow the dynamics of blocked fleas; carcasses, unblocked fleas, or another vector could possibly be important, instead.

The CO92 strain was isolated from a patient who died from pneumonia and who contracted the infection from an infected cat.

In other regions of the world, the reservoir of the infection is not clearly identified, which complicates prevention and early-warning programs. One such example was seen in a 2003 outbreak in Algeria.

===Fleas as vector===
The transmission of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; by fleas is well characterized. Initial acquisition of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; by the vector occurs during feeding on an infected animal. Several proteins then contribute to the maintenance of the bacteria in the flea digestive tract, among them the hemin storage system and &quot;Yersinia&quot; murine toxin (Ymt). Although Ymt is highly toxic to rodents and was once thought to be produced to ensure reinfection of new hosts, it is essential for flea colonization and for the survival of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; in fleas.

The hemin storage system plays an important role in the transmission of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; back to a mammalian host. While in the insect vector, proteins encoded by hemin storage system genetic loci induce biofilm formation in the proventriculus, a valve connecting the midgut to the esophagus. The presence of this biofilm seems likely to be required for stable infection of the flea. Aggregation in the biofilm inhibits feeding, as a mass of clotted blood and bacteria forms (referred to as &quot;Bacot&#x27;s block&quot; after entomologist A.W. Bacot, the first to describe this phenomenon). Transmission of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; occurs during the futile attempts of the flea to feed. Ingested blood is pumped into the esophagus, where it dislodges bacteria lodged in the proventriculus, which is regurgitated back into the host circulatory system.

===In humans and other susceptible hosts===
Pathogenesis due to &quot;Y. pestis&quot; infection of mammalian hosts is due to several factors, including an ability of these bacteria to suppress and avoid normal immune system responses such as phagocytosis and antibody production. Flea bites allow for the bacteria to pass the skin barrier. &quot;Y. pestis&quot; expresses a plasmin activator that is an important virulence factor for pneumonic plague and that might degrade on blood clots to facilitate systematic invasion. Many of the bacteria&#x27;s virulence factors are antiphagocytic in nature. Two important antiphagocytic antigens, named F1 (fraction 1) and V or LcrV, are both important for virulence. These antigens are produced by the bacterium at normal human body temperature. Furthermore, &quot;Y. pestis&quot; survives and produces F1 and V antigens while it is residing within white blood cells such as monocytes, but not in neutrophils. Natural or induced immunity is achieved by the production of specific opsonic antibodies against F1 and V antigens; antibodies against F1 and V induce phagocytosis by neutrophils.

In addition, the type-III secretion system (T3SS) allows &quot;Y. pestis&quot; to inject proteins into macrophages and other immune cells. These T3SS-injected proteins, called &quot;Yersinia&quot; outer proteins (Yops), include Yop B/D, which form pores in the host cell membrane and have been linked to cytolysis. The YopO, YopH, YopM, YopT, YopJ, and YopE are injected into the cytoplasm of host cells by T3SS into the pore created in part by YopB and YopD. The injected Yops limit phagocytosis and cell signaling pathways important in the innate immune system, as discussed below. In addition, some &quot;Y. pestis&quot; strains are capable of interfering with immune signaling (e.g., by preventing the release of some cytokines).

&quot;Y. pestis&quot; proliferates inside lymph nodes, where it is able to avoid destruction by cells of the immune system such as macrophages. The ability of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; to inhibit phagocytosis allows it to grow in lymph nodes and cause lymphadenopathy. YopH is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that contributes to the ability of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; to evade immune system cells. In macrophages, YopH has been shown to dephosphorylate p130Cas, Fyb (FYN binding protein) SKAP-HOM and Pyk, a tyrosine kinase homologous to FAK. YopH also binds the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, the Gab1, the Gab2 adapter proteins, and the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor.

YopE functions as a GTPase-activating protein for members of the Rho family of GTPases such as RAC1. YopT is a cysteine protease that inhibits RhoA by removing the isoprenyl group, which is important for localizing the protein to the cell membrane. YopE and YopT has been proposed to function to limit YopB/D-induced cytolysis. This might limit the function of YopB/D to create the pores used for Yop insertion into host cells and prevent YopB/D-induced rupture of host cells and release of cell contents that would attract and stimulate immune system responses.

YopJ is an acetyltransferase that binds to a conserved α-helix of MAPK kinases. YopJ acetylates MAPK kinases at serines and threonines that are normally phosphorylated during activation of the MAP kinase cascade. YopJ is activated in eukaryotic cells by interaction with target cell phytic acid (IP6). This disruption of host cell protein kinase activity causes apoptosis of macrophages, and this is proposed to be important for the establishment of infection and for evasion of the host immune response. YopO is a protein kinase also known as &quot;Yersinia&quot; protein kinase A (YpkA). YopO is a potent inducer of human macrophage apoptosis.

It has also been suggested that a bacteriophage – Ypφ – may have been responsible for increasing the virulence of this organism.

Depending on which form of the plague infects the individual, the plague develops a different illness; however, the plague overall affects the host cell&#x27;s ability to communicate with the immune system, hindering the body bringing phagocytic cells to the area of infection.

&quot;Y. pestis&quot; is a versatile killer. In addition to rodents and humans, it is known to have killed camels, chickens, and pigs. Domestic dogs and cats are susceptible to plague, as well, but cats are more likely to develop illness when infected. In either, the symptoms are similar to those experienced by humans, and can be deadly to the animal. People can be exposed by coming into contact with an infected animal (dead or alive), or inhaling infectious droplets that a sick dog or cat has coughed into the air.

===Immunity===

A formalin-inactivated vaccine was available in the United States for adults in 1993 at high risk of contracting the plague until removal from the market by the Food and Drug Administration. It was of limited effectiveness and could cause severe inflammation. Experiments with genetic engineering of a vaccine based on F1 and V antigens are underway and show promise. However, bacteria lacking antigen F1 are still virulent, and the V antigens are sufficiently variable such that vaccines composed of these antigens may not be fully protective. The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases has found that an experimental F1/V antigen-based vaccine protects crab-eating macaques, but fails to protect African green monkey species. A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found no studies of sufficient quality to make any statement on the efficacy of the vaccine.

==Isolation and identification==

In 1894, two bacteriologists, Alexandre Yersin of Switzerland and Kitasato Shibasaburō of Japan, independently isolated in Hong Kong the bacterium responsible for the 1894 Hong Kong plague. Though both investigators reported their findings, a series of confusing and contradictory statements by Kitasato eventually led to the acceptance of Yersin as the primary discoverer of the organism. Yersin named it &quot;Pasteurella pestis&quot; in honor of the Pasteur Institute, where he worked. In 1967, it was moved to a new genus and renamed &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; in his honor. Yersin also noted that rats were affected by plague not only during plague epidemics, but also often preceding such epidemics in humans and that plague was regarded by many locals as a disease of rats; villagers in China and India asserted that when large numbers of rats were found dead, plague outbreaks soon followed.

In 1898, French scientist Paul-Louis Simond (who had also come to China to battle the Third Pandemic) discovered the rat–flea vector that drives the disease. He had noted that persons who became ill did not have to be in close contact with each other to acquire the disease. In Yunnan, China, inhabitants would flee from their homes as soon as they saw dead rats, and on the island of Formosa (Taiwan), residents considered the handling of dead rats heightened the risks of developing plague. These observations led him to suspect that the flea might be an intermediary factor in the transmission of plague, since people acquired plague only if they were in contact with rats that had died less than 24 hours before. In a now classic experiment, Simond demonstrated how a healthy rat died of the plague after infected fleas had jumped to it from a rat that had recently died of the plague. The outbreak spread to Chinatown, San Francisco, from 1900 to 1904 and then to Oakland and the East Bay from 1907 to 1909. It has been present in the rodents of western North America ever since, as fear of the consequences of the outbreak on trade caused authorities to hide the dead of the Chinatown residents long enough for the disease to be passed to widespread species of native rodents in outlying areas.

Three main strains are recognised: &quot;Y. p. antiqua&quot;, which caused a plague pandemic in the sixth century; &quot;Y. p. medievalis&quot;, which caused the Black Death and subsequent epidemics during the second pandemic wave; and &quot;Y. p. orientalis&quot;, which is responsible for current plague outbreaks.

==21st century==

On January 15, 2018, researchers at the University of Oslo and the University of Ferrara suggested that humans and their parasites (most likely fleas and lice at the time) were the biggest carriers of the plague.

===Ancient DNA evidence===
In 2010, researchers in Germany definitively established, using PCR evidence from samples obtained from Black Death victims, that &quot;Y. pestis&quot; was the cause of the medieval Black Death.

In 2011, the first genome of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; isolated from Black Death victims was published, and concluded that this medieval strain was ancestral to most modern forms of &quot;Y. pestis&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;Cell&quot; published results from a study of ancient graves. Plasmids of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; were detected in archaeological samples of the teeth of seven Bronze Age individuals, in the Afanasievo culture in Siberia, the Corded Ware culture in Estonia, the Sintashta culture in Russia, the Unetice culture in Poland, and the Andronovo culture in Siberia. In 2018, the emergence and spread of the pathogen during the Neolithic decline (as far back as 6,000 years ago) was published. A site in Sweden was the source of the DNA evidence and trade networks were proposed as the likely avenue of spread rather than migrations of populations. There is evidence that suggests &quot;Y. pestis&quot; may have originated in Europe in the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, not in Asia as is more commonly believed.

DNA evidence published in 2015 indicates &quot;Y. pestis&quot; infected humans 5,000 years ago in Bronze Age Eurasia, but genetic changes that made it highly virulent did not occur until about 4,000 years ago. The highly virulent version capable of transmission by fleas through rodents, humans, and other mammals was found in two individuals associated with the Srubnaya culture from the Samara region in Russia from around 3,800 years ago and an Iron Age individual from Kapan, Armenia, from around 2,900 years ago. This indicates that at least two lineages of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; were circulating during the Bronze Age in Eurasia. The &quot;Y. pestis&quot; bacterium has a relatively large number of nonfunctioning genes and three &quot;ungainly&quot; plasmids, suggesting an origin less than 20,000 years ago. One such strain has been identified from about 4000 BP (the &quot;LNBA lineage&quot; (Late Neolithic and Bronze Age lineage)) in western Britain, indicating that this highly transmissible form spread from Eurasia to the far north-western edges of Europe.

In 2016, the &quot;Y. pestis&quot; bacterium was identified from DNA in teeth found at a Crossrail building site in London. The human remains were found to be victims of the Great Plague of London, which lasted from 1665 to 1666.

In 2021, researchers found a 5,000-year-old victim of &quot;Y. pestis&quot;, the world&#x27;s oldest-known, in hunter-gatherer remains in the modern Latvian and Estonian border area.

Between 5,300 and 4,900 YBP the population of neolithic farmers in northern Europe underwent a marked decline. It had not been determined whether this was the result of agricultural recession or from &quot;Y. pestis&quot; infection within the population. A 2024 study of Neolithic graves in Denmark and western Sweden concluded that plague was sufficiently widespread to be the cause of the decline, and that there were three outbreaks in Northern Europe between 5,200 years ago and 4,900 years ago, with the final outbreak caused by a strain of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; with reshuffled genes. However, another recent study, contests this notion. On the basis of 133 individuals from gallery graves of the Wartberg Culture, a research team from Kiel University (Collaborative Research Centre 1266) found &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; in two individuals only. This indicates that there was no large-scale disease outbreak in this cultural context. Moreover, they found that a dog was infected.

===Events===
Between 1970 and 2020, 496 cases were reported in the United States. Cases have been found predominantly in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, California, Oregon, and Nevada.

In 2008, plague was commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, areas that accounted for over 95% of the reported cases.

In September 2009, the death of Malcolm Casadaban, a molecular genetics professor at the University of Chicago, was linked to his work on a weakened laboratory strain of &quot;Y. pestis&quot;. Hemochromatosis was hypothesised to be a predisposing factor in Casadaban&#x27;s death from this attenuated strain used for research.

On November 3, 2019, two cases of pneumonic plague were diagnosed at a hospital in Beijing&#x27;s Chaoyang district, prompting fears of an outbreak. The patient was a middle-aged man with fever, who had complained of difficulty breathing for some ten days, accompanied by his wife with similar symptoms. Police quarantined the emergency room at the hospital and controls were placed on Chinese news aggregators. On 18 November a third case was reported, in a 55-year-old man from Xilingol League, one of the twelve Mongolian autonomous regions in Northern China. The patient received treatment, and 28 symptomless contacts were placed in quarantine.

In July 2020, officials increased precautions after a case of bubonic plague was confirmed in Bayannur, a city in China&#x27;s Inner Mongolia autonomous region. The patient was quarantined and treated. According to China&#x27;s &quot;Global Times&quot;, a second suspected case was also investigated, and a level 3 alert was issued, in effect until the end of the year. It forbade hunting and eating of animals that could carry plague, and called on the public to report suspected cases.

<text>Yellow is the color between green and orange on the spectrum of light. It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 575585 nm. It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity. Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves, corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and bananas. They absorb light energy and protect plants from photo damage in some cases. Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon, due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths (green, blue, and violet).
Because it was widely available, yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art; the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse 17,000 years old. Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs, then in the murals in Roman villas. In the early Christian church, yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of the Kingdom, but it was also associated with Judas Iscariot and used to mark heretics. In the 20th century, Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star. In China, bright yellow was the color of the Middle Kingdom, and could be worn only by the emperor and his household; special guests were welcomed on a yellow carpet.
According to surveys in Europe, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, yellow is the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, humor, happiness, and spontaneity; however it can also be associated with duplicity, envy, jealousy, greed, justice, and, in the U.S., cowardice. In Iran it has connotations of pallor/sickness, but also wisdom and connection. In China and many Asian countries, it is seen as the color of royalty, nobility, respect, happiness, glory, harmony and wisdom.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;yellow&quot; is from the Old English (oblique case), meaning &quot;yellow, and yellowish&quot;, derived from the Proto-Germanic word &quot;gelwaz&quot; &quot;yellow&quot;. It has the same Indo-European base, &quot;&quot;, as the words &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;yell&quot;; &quot;gʰel-&quot; means both bright and gleaming, and to cry out.

The English term is related to other Germanic words for &quot;yellow&quot;, namely Scots &#x27;, East Frisian &quot;jeel&quot;, West Frisian &#x27;, Dutch &#x27;, German &#x27;, and Swedish and Norwegian &quot;&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the oldest known use of this word in English is from &quot;The Epinal Glossary&quot; in 700.

== Science and nature ==
=== Optics, color printing, and computer screens ===


Yellow is found between green and red on the spectrum of visible light. It is the color the human eye sees when it looks at light with a dominant wavelength between 570 and 590 nanometers.

In color printing, yellow is one of the three subtractive primary colors of ink along with magenta and cyan. Together with black, they can be overlaid in the right combination to print any full color image. (See the CMYK color model). A particular yellow is used, called Process yellow (also known as &quot;pigment yellow&quot;, &quot;printer&#x27;s yellow&quot;, and &quot;canary yellow&quot;). Process yellow is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer&#x27;s ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure yellow ink.

The yellow on a color television or computer screen is created in a completely different way; by combining green and red light at the right level of intensity. (See RGB color model).

==== Complementary colors ====

Traditionally, the complementary color of yellow is purple; the two colors are opposite each other on the color wheel long used by painters. Vincent van Gogh, an avid student of color theory, used combinations of yellow and purple in several of his paintings for the maximum contrast and harmony.

Hunt defines that &quot;two colors are complementary when it is possible to reproduce the tristimulus values of a specified achromatic stimulus by an additive mixture of these two stimuli.&quot; That is, when two colored lights can be mixed to match a specified white (achromatic, non-colored) light, the colors of those two lights are complementary. This definition, however, does not constrain what version of white will be specified. In the nineteenth century, the scientists Grassmann and Helmholtz did experiments in which they concluded that finding a good complement for spectral yellow was difficult, but that the result was indigo, that is, a wavelength that today&#x27;s color scientists would call violet or purple. Helmholtz says &quot;Yellow and indigo blue&quot; are complements. Grassmann reconstructs Newton&#x27;s category boundaries in terms of wavelengths and says &quot;This indigo therefore falls within the limits of color between which, according to Helmholtz, the complementary colors of yellow lie.&quot;

Newton&#x27;s own color circle has yellow directly opposite the boundary between indigo and violet. These results, that the complement of yellow is a wavelength shorter than 450 nm, are derivable from the modern CIE 1931 system of colorimetry if it is assumed that the yellow is about 580 nm or shorter wavelength, and the specified white is the color of a blackbody radiator of temperature 2800 K or lower (that is, the white of an ordinary incandescent light bulb). More typically, with a daylight-colored or around 5000 to 6000 K white, the complement of yellow will be in the blue wavelength range, which is the standard modern answer for the complement of yellow.

Because of the characteristics of paint pigments and use of different color wheels, painters traditionally regard the complement of yellow as the color indigo or blue-violet.

==== Lasers ====
Lasers emitting in the yellow part of the spectrum are less common and more expensive than most other colors. In commercial products diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology is employed to create the yellow light. An infrared laser diode at 808 nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit at two frequencies (281.76 THz and 223.39 THz: 1064 nm and 1342 nm wavelengths) simultaneously. This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is the sum of the two incident beams (505.15 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 593.5 nm (&quot;yellow&quot;). This wavelength is also available, though even more rarely, from a helium–neon laser. However, this not a true yellow, as it exceeds 590 nm. A variant of this same DPSS technology using slightly different starting frequencies was made available in 2010, producing a wavelength of 589 nm, which is considered a true yellow color. The use of yellow lasers at 589 nm and 594 nm have recently become more widespread thanks to the field of optogenetics.

=== Astronomy ===
Stars of spectral classes F and G have color temperatures that make them look &quot;yellowish&quot;. The first astronomer to classify stars according to their color was F. G. W. Struve in 1827. One of his classifications was , or yellow, and this roughly corresponded to stars in the modern spectral range F5 to K0. The Strömgren photometric system for stellar classification includes a &#x27;y&#x27; or yellow filter that is centered at a wavelength of 550 nm and has a bandwidth of 20–30 nm.

Supergiant stars are rarely yellow supergiants because F and G class supergiants are physically unstable; they are most often a transitional phase between blue supergiants and red supergiants. Some yellow supergiants, the Cepheid variables, pulsate with a period proportional to their absolute magnitude; hence, if their apparent magnitude is known, the distance to them can be calculated with great precision. Cepheid variables were hence used to determine distances within and beyond the Milky Way galaxy. The most famous example is the current North Pole star, Polaris.

=== Biology ===
Autumn leaves, yellow flowers, bananas, oranges and other yellow fruits all contain carotenoids, yellow and red organic pigments that are found in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants and some other photosynthetic organisms like algae, some bacteria and some fungi. They serve two key roles in plants and algae: they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis, and they protect the green chlorophyll from photodamage.

In late summer, as daylight hours shorten and temperatures cool, the veins that carry fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off. The water and mineral intake into the leaf is reduced, slowly at first, and then more rapidly. It is during this time that the chlorophyll begins to decrease. 
As the chlorophyll diminishes, the yellow and red carotenoids become more and more visible, creating the classic autumn leaf color.

Carotenoids are common in many living things; they give the characteristic color to carrots, maize, daffodils, rutabagas, buttercups and bananas. They are responsible for the red of cooked lobsters, the pink of flamingoes and salmon and the yellow of canaries and egg yolks.

Xanthophylls are the most common yellow pigments that form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group. The name is from Greek &quot;xanthos&quot; (, &quot;yellow&quot;) + &quot;phyllon&quot; (, &quot;leaf&quot;). Xanthophylls are most commonly found in the leaves of green plants, but they also find their way into animals through the food they eat. For example, the yellow color of chicken egg yolks, fat, and skin comes from the feed the chickens consume. Chicken farmers understand this, and often add xanthophylls, usually lutein, to make the egg yolks more yellow.

Bananas are green when they are picked because of the chlorophyll their skin contains. Once picked, they begin to ripen; hormones in the bananas convert amino acids into ethylene gas, which stimulates the production of several enzymes. These enzymes start to change the color, texture and flavor of the banana. The green chlorophyll supply is stopped and the yellow color of the carotenoids replaces it; eventually, as the enzymes continue their work, the cell walls break down and the bananas turn brown.

==== Fish ====
* Yellowtail is the common name for dozens of different fish species that have yellow tails or a yellow body. Most of the time, yellowtail(fish) actually refers to Japanese amberjack, a fish that lives between Japan and Hawaii.
* Yellowfin tuna (&quot;Thunnus albacares&quot;) is a species of tuna, having bright yellow anal and second dorsal fins. Found in tropical and subtropical seas and weighing up to , it is caught as a replacement for depleted stocks of bluefin tuna.
* Smallmouth yellowfish (Labeobarbus aeneus) is a species of ray-finned fish in the genus Labeobarbus. It has become an invasive species in rivers of the Eastern Cape, South Africa, such as the Mbhashe River.

==== Insects ====

* The yellow-fever mosquito (&quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;) is a mosquito so named because it transmits dengue fever and yellow fever, the mosquito-borne viruses.
* Yellowjackets are black-and-yellow wasps of the genus &quot;Vespula&quot; or &quot;Dolichovespula&quot; (though some can be black-and-white, the most notable of these being the bald-faced hornet, &quot;Dolichovespula maculata&quot;). They can be identified by their distinctive black-and-yellow color, small size (slightly larger than a bee), and entirely black antennae.

==== Trees ====

* Populus tremuloides is a deciduous tree native to cooler areas of North America, one of several species referred to by the common name aspen. &quot;Populus tremuloides&quot; is the most widely distributed tree in North America, being found from Canada to central Mexico.
* The yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleghaniensis&quot;) is a birch species native to eastern North America, from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and southern Quebec west to Minnesota, and south in the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia. They are medium-sized deciduous trees and can reach about tall, trunks up to in diameter. The bark is smooth and yellow-bronze, and the wood is extensively used for flooring, cabinetry, and toothpicks.
* The Thorny Yellowwood is an Australian rainforest tree which has deep yellow wood.
* Yellow poplar is a common name for &quot;Liriodendron&quot;, the tuliptree. The common name is inaccurate as this genus is not related to poplars.
* The &quot;Handroanthus albus&quot; is a tree with yellow flowers native to the Cerrado of Brazil.

==History, art, and fashion ==
=== Prehistory ===
Yellow, in the form of yellow ochre pigment made from clay, was one of the first colors used in prehistoric cave art. The cave of Lascaux has an image of a horse colored with yellow estimated to be 17,300 years old.

=== Ancient history ===
In Ancient Egypt, yellow was associated with gold, which was considered to be imperishable, eternal and indestructible. The skin and bones of the gods were believed to be made of gold. The Egyptians used yellow extensively in tomb paintings; they usually used either yellow ochre or the brilliant orpiment, though it was made of arsenic and was highly toxic. A small paintbox with orpiment pigment was found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun. Men were always shown with brown faces, women with yellow ochre or gold faces.

The ancient Romans used yellow in their paintings to represent gold and also in skin tones. It is found frequently in the murals of Pompeii.

=== Post-classical history ===
During the Post-Classical period, yellow became firmly established as the color of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus Christ, even though the Bible never describes his clothing. From this connection, yellow also took on associations with envy, jealousy and duplicity.

The tradition started in the Renaissance of marking non-Christian outsiders, such as Jews, with the color yellow. In 16th-century Spain, those accused of heresy and who refused to renounce their views were compelled to come before the Spanish Inquisition dressed in a yellow cape.

The color yellow has been historically associated with moneylenders and finance. The National Pawnbrokers Association&#x27;s logo depicts three golden spheres hanging from a bar, referencing the three bags of gold that the patron saint of pawnbroking, St. Nicholas, holds in his hands. Additionally, the symbol of three golden orbs is found in the coat of arms of the House of Medici, a famous fifteenth-century Italian dynasty of bankers and lenders.
=== Modern history ===
==== 18th and 19th centuries ====
The 18th and 19th century saw the discovery and manufacture of synthetic pigments and dyes, which quickly replaced the traditional yellows made from arsenic, cow urine, and other substances.

, Jean-Honoré Fragonard painted &quot;A Young Girl Reading&quot;. She is dressed in a bright saffron yellow dress. This painting is &quot;considered by many critics to be among Fragonard&#x27;s most appealing and masterly&quot;.

The 19th-century British painter J. M. W. Turner was one of the first in that century to use yellow to create moods and emotions, the way romantic composers were using music. His painting &quot;Rain, Steam, and Speed – the Great Central Railway&quot; was dominated by glowing yellow clouds.

Georges Seurat used the new synthetic colors in his experimental paintings composed of tiny points of primary colors, particularly in his famous &quot;Sunday Afternoon on the Isle de la Grand jatte&quot; (1884–86). He did not know that the new synthetic yellow pigment, zinc yellow or zinc chromate, which he used in the light green lawns, was highly unstable and would quickly turn brown.

The painter Vincent van Gogh was a particular admirer of the color yellow, the color of sunshine. Writing to his sister from the south of France in 1888, he wrote, &quot;Now we are having beautiful warm, windless weather that is very beneficial to me. The sun, a light that for lack of a better word I can only call yellow, bright sulfur yellow, pale lemon gold. How beautiful yellow is!&quot; In Arles, Van Gogh painted sunflowers inside a small house he rented at 2 Place Lamartine, a house painted with a color that Van Gogh described as &quot;buttery yellow&quot;. Van Gogh was one of the first artists to use commercially manufactured paints, rather than paints he made himself. He used the traditional yellow ochre, but also chrome yellow, first made in 1809; and cadmium yellow, first made in 1820.

In 1895 a new popular art form began to appear in New York newspapers; the color comic strip. It took advantage of a new color printing process, which used color separation and three different colors of ink; magenta, cyan, and yellow, plus black, to create all the colors on the page. One of the first characters in the new comic strips was a humorous boy of the New York streets named Mickey Dugen, more commonly known as the Yellow Kid, from the yellow nightshirt he wore. He gave his name (and color) to the whole genre of popular, sensational journalism, which became known as &quot;yellow journalism&quot;.
==== 20th and 21st centuries ====
In the 20th century, yellow was revived as a symbol of exclusion, as it had been in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Jews in Nazi Germany and German-occupied countries were required to sew yellow triangles with the star of David onto their clothing.

In the 20th century, modernist painters reduced painting to its simplest colors and geometric shapes. The Dutch modernist painter Piet Mondrian made a series of paintings which consisted of a pure white canvas with a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of yellow, red, and blue.

Yellow was particularly valued in the 20th century because of its high visibility. Because of its ability to be seen well from greater distances and at high speeds, yellow makes for the ideal color to be viewed from moving automobiles. It often replaced red as the color of fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, and was popular in neon signs, especially in Las Vegas and in China, where yellow was the most esteemed color.

In the 1960s, Pickett Brand developed the &quot;Eye Saver Yellow&quot; slide rule, which was produced with a specific yellow color (Angstrom 5600) that reflects long-wavelength rays and promotes optimum eye-ease to help prevent eyestrain and improve visual accuracy.

The 21st century saw the use of unusual materials and technologies to create new ways of experiencing the color yellow. One example was &quot;The weather project&quot;, by Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, which was installed in the open space of the Turbine Hall of London&#x27;s Tate Modern in 2003.

Eliasson used humidifiers to create a fine mist in the air via a mixture of sugar and water, as well as a semi-circular disc made up of hundreds of monochromatic lamps which radiated yellow light. The ceiling of the hall was covered with a huge mirror, in which visitors could see themselves as tiny black shadows against a mass of light.
===Fruits, vegetables, and eggs===
Many fruits are yellow when ripe, such as lemons and bananas, their color derived from carotenoid pigments. Egg yolks gain their color from xanthophylls, also a type of carotenoid pigment.

==== Flowers ====
Yellow is a common color of flowers.
==== Other plants ====
* Rapeseed (Brassica napus), also known as rape or oilseed rape, is a bright yellow flowering member of the family &quot;Brassicaceae&quot; (mustard or cabbage family).
* Goldenrod is a yellow flowering plant in the family &quot;Asteraceae&quot;.

=== Minerals and chemistry ===

* Yellowcake (also known as urania and uranic oxide) is concentrated uranium oxide, obtained through the milling of uranium ore. Yellowcake is used in the preparation of fuel for nuclear reactors and in uranium enrichment, one of the essential steps for creating nuclear weapons.
* Titan yellow (also known as clayton yellow), chemical formula has been used to determine magnesium in serum and urine, but the method is prone to interference, making the ammonium phosphate method superior when analysing blood cells, food or fecal material.
* Methyl yellow (&quot;p&quot;-dimethylaminoazobenzene) is a pH indicator used to determine acidity. It changes from yellow at pH 4.0 to red at pH 2.9.
* Yellow fireworks are produced by adding sodium compounds to the firework mixture. Sodium has a strong emission at 589.3 nm (D-line), a very slightly orange-tinted yellow.
* Amongst the elements, sulfur and gold are most obviously yellow. Phosphorus, arsenic and antimony have allotropes which are yellow or whitish-yellow; fluorine and chlorine are pale yellowish gases.
* Many crystalline chemical compounds, such as 2,4-Dinitrophenol, are yellowish in color.

==== Pigments ====

* Yellow ochre (also known as Mars yellow, Pigment yellow 42, 43), hydrated ferric oxide (), is a naturally occurring pigment found in clays in many parts of the world. It is non-toxic and has been used in painting since prehistoric times.
* Indian yellow is a transparent, fluorescent pigment used in oil paintings and watercolors. Originally magnesium euxanthate, it was claimed to have been produced from the urine of Indian cows fed only on mango leaves. It has now been replaced by synthetic Indian yellow hue.
* Naples Yellow (lead antimonate yellow) is one of the oldest synthetic pigments, derived from the mineral bindheimite and used extensively up to the 20th century. It is toxic and nowadays is replaced in paint by a mixture of modern pigments.
* Cadmium Yellow (cadmium sulfide, CdS) has been used in artists&#x27; paints since the mid-19th century. Because of its toxicity, it may nowadays be replaced by azo pigments.
* Chrome yellow (lead chromate, ), derived from the mineral crocoite, was used by artists in the earlier part of the 19th century, but has been largely replaced by other yellow pigments because of the toxicity of lead.
* Zinc yellow or zinc chromate is a synthetic pigment made in the 19th century, and used by the painter Georges Seurat in his pointillist paintings. He did not know that it was highly unstable, and would quickly turn brown.
* Titanium yellow (nickel antimony titanium yellow rutile, ) is created by adding small amounts of the oxides of nickel and antimony to titanium dioxide and heating. It is used to produce yellow paints with good white coverage and has the LBNL paint code &quot;Y10&quot;.
* Gamboge is an orange-brown resin, derived from trees of the genus Garcinia, which becomes yellow when powdered. It was used as a watercolor pigment in the far east from the 8th century – the name &quot;gamboge&quot; is derived from &quot;Cambodia&quot; – and has been used in Europe since the 17th century.
* Orpiment, also called King&#x27;s Yellow or Chinese Yellow is arsenic trisulfide () and was used as a paint pigment until the 19th century when, because of its high toxicity and reaction with lead-based pigments, it was generally replaced by Cadmium Yellow.
* Azo dye-based pigment (a brightly colored transparent or semitransparent dye with a white pigment) is used as the colorant in most modern paints requiring either a highly saturated yellow or simplicity of color mixing. The most common is the monoazo arylide yellow family, first marketed as Hansa Yellow.

==== Dyes ====
* Curcuma longa, also known as turmeric, is a plant grown in India and Southeast Asia which serves as a dye for clothing, especially monks&#x27; robes; as a spice for curry and other dishes; and as a popular medicine. It is also used as a food coloring for mustard and other products.
* Saffron, like turmeric, is one of the rare dyes that is also a spice and food colorant. It is made from the dried red stigma of the crocus sativus flower. It must be picked by hand and it takes 150 flowers to obtain a single gram of stigma, so it is extremely expensive. It probably originated in the Mediterranean or Southwest Asia, and its use was detailed in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal. It was known in India at the time of the Buddha, and after his death his followers decreed that monks should wear robes the color of saffron. Saffron was used to dye the robes of the senior Buddhist monks, while ordinary monks wore robes dyed with Gamboge or Curcuma longa, also known as Turmeric.

The color of saffron comes from crocin, a red variety of carotenoid natural pigment. The color of the dyed fabric varies from deep red to orange to yellow, depending upon the type of saffron and the process. Most saffron today comes from Iran, but it is also grown commercially in Spain, Italy and Kashmir in India, and as a boutique crop in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and other countries. In the United States, it has been cultivated by the Pennsylvania Dutch community since the early 18th century. Because of the high price of saffron, other similar dyes and spices are often sold under the name saffron; for instance, what is called &quot;Indian saffron&quot; is often really turmeric.
* Reseda luteola, also known as dyers weed, yellow weed or weld, has been used as a yellow dye from neolithic times. It grew wild along the roads and walls of Europe, and was introduced into North America, where it grows as a weed. It was used as both as a yellow dye, whose color was deep and lasting, and to dye fabric green, first by dyeing it blue with indigo, then dyeing it with reseda luteola to turn it a rich, solid and lasting green. It was the most common yellow dye in Europe from the Middle Ages until the 18th century, when it was replaced first by the bark of the quercitron tree from North America, then by synthetic dyes. It was also widely used in North Africa and in the Ottoman Empire.
* Gamboge is a deep saffron to mustard yellow pigment and dye. In Asia, it is frequently used to dye Buddhist monks&#x27; robes. Gamboge is most often extracted by tapping resin from various species of evergreen trees of the family &quot;Guttiferae&quot;, which grow in Cambodia, Thailand, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. &quot;Kambuj&quot; (Sanskrit: कंबुज) is the ancient Sanskrit name for Cambodia.
==== Food coloring ====
The most common yellow food coloring in use today is called Tartrazine. It is a synthetic lemon yellow azo dye. It is also known as E number E102, C.I. 19140, FD&amp;C yellow 5, acid yellow 23, food yellow 4, and trisodium 1-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-4-(4-sulfonatophenylazo)-5-pyrazolone-3-carboxylate. It is the yellow most frequently used such processed food products as corn and potato chips, breakfast cereals such as corn flakes, candies, popcorn, mustard, jams and jellies, gelatin, soft drinks (notably Mountain Dew), energy and sports drinks, and pastries. It is also widely used in liquid and bar soap, shampoo, cosmetics and medicines. Sometimes it is mixed with blue dyes to color processed products green.

It is typically labelled on food packages as &quot;color&quot;, &quot;tartrazine&quot;, or &quot;E102&quot;. In the United States, because of concerns about possible health problems related to intolerance to tartrazine, its presence must be declared on food and drug product labels.

Another popular synthetic yellow coloring is Sunset Yellow FCF (also known as &quot;orange yellow S&quot;, &quot;FD&amp;C yellow 6&quot; and &quot;C.I. 15985&quot;) It is manufactured from aromatic hydrocarbons from petroleum. When added to foods sold in Europe, it is denoted by E number E110.

== Symbolism and associations ==
In the west, yellow is not a well-loved color. In a year 2000 survey, only 6% of respondents in Europe and America named it as their favorite color, compared with 45% for blue, 15% for green, 12% for red, and 10% for black. For 7% of respondents, it was their least favorite color. Yellow is considered a color of ambivalence and contradiction. It is associated with optimism and amusement, but also with betrayal, duplicity, and jealousy. However, in China and other parts of Asia, yellow is a color of virtue and nobility.
=== In China ===

Yellow has strong historical and cultural associations in China, where &quot;huáng&quot; ( or ) is the color of happiness, glory, and wisdom. Although &quot;huáng&quot; originally and occasionally still covers a range inclusive of tans and oranges, speakers of modern Standard Mandarin tend to map their use of &quot;huáng&quot; to shades corresponding to English yellow.

In Chinese symbolism, yellow, red, and green are masculine colors, while black and white are considered feminine. After the development of the theory of five elements, the Chinese reckoned various correspondences. On a five season model, late summer was characterized by yellowing leaves. Yellow was taken as the color of the fifth direction of the compass, the central. China is called the Middle Kingdom; the palace of the Emperor was considered to be in the exact center of the world. The legendary first emperor of China was called the Yellow Emperor and the last, Puyi (1906–67), described in his memoirs how every object which surrounded him as a child was yellow. &quot;It made me understand from my most tender age that I was of a unique essence, and it instilled in me the consciousness of my &#x27;celestial nature&#x27; which made me different from every other human.&quot; The Chinese Emperor was literally considered the child of heaven, with both a political and religious role, both symbolized by yellow. After the Song dynasty, laws banned the use of certain bright yellow shades by anyone but the emperor. Distinguished visitors were honored with a yellow, not a red, carpet.

In current Chinese pop culture, the term &quot;yellow movie&quot; () refers to films and other cultural items of a pornographic nature, analogous to the English &quot;&quot;. This was the basis of the 2007 &quot;very erotic very violent&quot; meme, with the word &quot;erotic&quot; calquing Chinese &quot;yellow&quot;.

=== Light and reason ===

Yellow, as the color of sunlight when sun is near the horizon, is commonly associated with warmth. Yellow combined with red symbolized heat and energy. A room painted yellow feels warmer than a room painted white, and a lamp with yellow light seems more natural than a lamp with white light.

As the color of light, yellow is also associated with knowledge and wisdom. In English and many other languages, &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;bright&quot; mean intelligent. In Islam, the yellow color of gold symbolizes wisdom. In medieval European symbolism, red symbolized passion, blue symbolized the spiritual, and yellow symbolized reason. In many European universities, yellow gowns and caps are worn by members of the faculty of physical and natural sciences, as yellow is the color of reason and research.

=== Gold and blond ===

In ancient Greece and Rome, the gods were often depicted with yellow, or blonde hair, which was described in literature as &#x27;golden&#x27;. The color yellow was associated with the sun gods Helios and Apollo. It was fashionable in ancient Greece for men and women to dye their hair yellow, or to spend time in the sun to bleach it. In ancient Rome, prostitutes were required to bleach their hair, to be easily identified, but it also became a fashionable hair color for aristocratic women, influenced by the exotic blonde hair of many of the newly conquered slaves from Gaul, Britain, and Germany. However, in medieval Europe and later, the word yellow often had negative connotations; associated with betrayal, so yellow hair was more poetically called &#x27;blond,&#x27; &#x27;light&#x27;, &#x27;fair,&#x27; or most often &quot;golden&quot;.

=== Visibility and caution ===
Yellow is the most visible color from a distance, so it is often used for objects that need to be seen, such as fire engines, road maintenance equipment, school buses and taxicabs. It is also often used for warning signs, since yellow traditionally signals caution, rather than danger. Safety yellow is often used for safety and accident prevention information. A yellow light on a traffic signal means slow down, but not stop. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) uses Pantone 116 (a yellow hue) as their standard color implying &quot;general warning&quot;, while the Federal Highway Administration similarly uses yellow to communicate warning or caution on highway signage. A yellow penalty card in a soccer match means warning, but not expulsion.
=== Optimism and pleasure ===
Yellow is the color most associated with optimism and pleasure; it is a color designed to attract attention, and is used for amusement. Yellow dresses in fashion are rare, but always associated with gaiety and celebration.
=== Mayan and Italian ===
The ancient Maya associated the color yellow with the direction South. The Maya glyph for &quot;yellow&quot; (k&#x27;an) also means &quot;precious&quot; or &quot;ripe&quot;.

&quot;Giallo&quot;, in Italian, refers to crime stories, both fictional and real. This association began in about 1930, when the first series of crime novels published in Italy had yellow covers.

* The March 1967 album by Donovan called &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot; reached number 2 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1966 and number 8 in the UK in early 1967. The song of the same name popularized a widely-held belief that it was possible to get high by smoking scrapings from the inside of banana peels. This rumor was actually started in 1966 by Country Joe McDonald.
* Coldplay achieved worldwide fame with their 2000 single &quot;Yellow&quot;.
* &quot;Yellow River&quot; is a song recorded by the British band Christie in 1970.

=== Politics ===

* Yellow as a political color is most commonly associated with liberalism, libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism. Contemporary political parties using yellow include the Liberal Democrats and UKIP in the United Kingdom, the SNP in Scotland, ACT in New Zealand, and Libertarian Party in the United States.
* In the United States, a yellow dog Democrat was a Southern voter who consistently voted for Democratic candidates in the late 19th and early 20th centuries because of lingering resentment against the Republicans dating back to the Civil War and Reconstruction period. Today the term refers to a hard-core Democrat, supposedly referring to a person who would vote for a &quot;yellow dog&quot; before voting for a Republican.
* In China the Yellow Turbans were a Daoist sect that staged an extensive rebellion during the Han dynasty.
* The 1986 People Power Revolution in the Philippines was also known as the Yellow Revolution due to the presence of yellow ribbons during the demonstrations. Liberal and pro-democracy political parties and organizations such as UNIDO, PDP-Laban, and the Liberal Party have used the color yellow. More recently, it has become a pejorative term used by some pro-Ferdinand Marcos and pro-Rodrigo Duterte against the opposition.
* In France in November and December 2018, an opposition movement called the Yellow Vests went into the streets to protest against the fiscal policies of President Emmanuel Macron. They wore yellow safety vests, which French motorists are required by law to have in their cars.

=== Selected national and international flags ===
Three of the five most populous countries in the world (China and Brazil) have yellow or gold in their flag, representing about half of the world&#x27;s population. While many flags use yellow, their symbolism varies widely, from civic virtue to golden treasure, golden fields, the desert, royalty, the keys to Heaven and the leadership of the Communist Party. In classic European heraldry, yellow, along with white, is one of the two metals (called gold and silver) and therefore flags following heraldic design rules must use either yellow or white to separate any of their other colors (see the rule of tincture and insignia).

=== Religion ===
* In Buddhism, the saffron colors of robes to be worn by monks were defined by the Buddha himself and his followers in the 5th century BCE. The robe and its color is a sign of renunciation of the outside world and commitment to the order. The candidate monk, with his master, first appears before the monks of the monastery in his own clothes, with his new robe under his arm, and asks to enter the order. He then takes his vows, puts on the robes, and with his begging bowl, goes out to the world. Thereafter, he spends his mornings begging and his afternoons in contemplation and study, either in a forest, garden, or in the monastery. According to Buddhist scriptures and commentaries, the robe dye is allowed to be obtained from six kinds of substances: roots and tubers, plants, bark, leaves, flowers and fruits. The robes should also be boiled in water a long time to get the correctly sober color. Saffron and ochre, usually made with dye from the curcuma longa plant or the heartwood of the jackfruit tree, are the most common colors. The so-called forest monks usually wear ochre robes and city monks saffron, though this is not an official rule. The color of robes also varies somewhat among the different &quot;vehicles&quot;, or schools of Buddhism, and by country, depending on their doctrines and the dyes available. The monks of the strict Vajrayana, or Tantric Buddhism, practiced in Tibet, wear the most colorful robes of saffron and red. The monks of Mahayana Buddhism, practiced mainly in Japan, China and Korea, wear lighter yellow or saffron, often with white or black. Monks of Hinayana Buddhism, practiced in Southeast Asia, usually wear ochre or saffron color. Monks of the forest tradition in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia wear robes of a brownish ochre, dyed from the wood of the jackfruit tree.
* In Hinduism, the divinity Krishna is commonly portrayed dressed in yellow. Yellow and saffron are also the colors worn by sadhu, or wandering holy men in India. The Hindu almighty and divine god Lord Ganesha or Ganpati is mostly dressed with a dhotar in yellow, which is popularly known as pivla pitambar and is considered to be the most auspicious one.
* In Sikhism: The Sikh Rehat Maryada clearly states that the Nishan Sahib hoisted outside every Gurudwara should be xanthic (Basanti in Punjabi) or greyish blue (modern day Navy blue) (Surmaaee in Punjabi) color.
* In Islam, the yellow color of gold symbolizes wisdom.
* In the religions of the islands of Polynesia, yellow is a sacred color, the color of the divine essence; the word &quot;yellow&quot; in the local languages is the same as the name of the curcuma longa plant, which is considered the food of the gods.
* In the Roman Catholic Church, yellow symbolizes gold, and in Christian mythology the golden key to the Kingdom of Heaven, which divine Christ gave to Saint Peter. The flag of the Vatican City and the colors of the pope are yellow and white, symbolizing the gold key and the silver key. White and yellow together can also symbolize Easter, rebirth and Resurrection. Yellow also has a negative meaning, symbolizing betrayal; Judas Iscariot is usually portrayed wearing a pale yellow toga. Yellow and golden halos mark the saints in religious paintings.
*In Wicca, yellow represents intellect, inspiration, imagination, and knowledge. It is used for communication, confidence, divination, and study.

=== New Age Spiritual Metaphysics ===
* In the metaphysics of the New Age author, Alice A. Bailey, in her system called the Seven Rays which classifies humans into seven different metaphysical psychological types, the &quot;fourth ray&quot; of &quot;harmony through conflict&quot; is represented by the color &quot;yellow&quot;. People who have this metaphysical psychological type are said to be &quot;on the Yellow Ray&quot;.&quot;
* Yellow is used to symbolically represent the third, solar plexus chakra (Manipura).
* Psychics who claim to be able to observe the aura with their third eye report that someone with a yellow aura is typically someone who is in an requiring intellectual acumen, such as a scientist.

=== Sports ===

* In Association football (soccer), the referee shows a yellow card to indicate that a player has been officially warned because they have committed a foul or have wasted time.
* Originally in Rugby league and then later, also in Rugby Union, the referee shows a yellow card to indicate that a player has been sent to the sin bin.
* In cycle racing, the yellow jersey – or &quot;maillot jaune&quot; – is awarded to the leader in some stage races. The tradition was begun in the Tour de France where the sponsoring &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; newspaper (later &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;) was printed on distinctive yellow newsprint.

* National teams of Brazil, Sweden and Ukraine usually play in yellow shirts.

=== Transportation ===
* In some countries, taxicabs are commonly yellow. This practice began in Chicago, where taxi entrepreneur John D. Hertz painted his taxis yellow based on a University of Chicago study alleging that yellow is the color most easily seen at a distance.
* In Canada and the United States, school buses are almost uniformly painted a yellow color (often referred to as &quot;school bus yellow&quot;) for purposes of visibility and safety, and British bus operators such as FirstGroup are attempting to introduce the concept there.
* &quot;Caterpillar yellow&quot; and &quot;high-visibility yellow&quot; are used for highway construction equipment.
* In the rules of the road, yellow (called &quot;amber&quot; in Britain) is a traffic light signal meaning &quot;slow down&quot;, &quot;caution&quot;, or &quot;slow speed ahead&quot;. It is intermediate between green (go) and red (stop). In railway signaling, yellow is often the color for warning, slow down, such as with distant signals.
* Selective yellow is used in some automotive headlamps and fog lights to reduce the dazzling effects of rain, snow, and fog.

<text>The Politics of Serbia and Montenegro, known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, later renamed as Serbia and Montenegro, took place in a framework of a federal parliamentary republic with a multi-party system, and after 2003, in the context of a confederation. The president was head of state and, following constitutional reforms in 2003, simultaneously head of government. Executive power was exercised by the Council of Ministers. Federal legislative power was vested in the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament.

==History==
In January 1998, Milo Đukanović became president of Montenegro, following the bitterly contested presidential election in November 1997, which were pronounced free and fair by international monitors. His coalition followed up with the parliamentary election in May. Having weathered Milošević&#x27;s campaign to undermine his government, Đukanović struggled to balance the pro-independence stance of his coalition with the changed domestic and international environment of the post-October 5 country. In December 2002, Đukanović resigned as president and was appointed Prime Minister. The new President of Montenegro became Filip Vujanović.

Before the October 5 overthrow as opposition grew, Milošević continued to hold significant power. Although his political party, the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) (in electoral cartel with Mirjana Markovic&#x27; Yugoslav Left), did not enjoy a majority in either the federal or Serbian parliaments, it dominated the governing coalitions and held all the key administrative posts. An essential element of Milošević&#x27;s grasp on power was his control of the police. Routine federal elections in September 2000 resulted in Vojislav Koštunica, leader of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia block - receiving less than a majority, requiring a second round. Immediately, street protests and rallies filled cities across the country as the nation rallied around Vojislav Koštunica, the recently formed candidate for FRY president. There had been widespread fear that the second round would be canceled on the basis of foreign interference in the elections.

On 5 October 2000, Slobodan Milošević was forced to concede defeat after days of mass protests across Serbia. New FRY President Vojislav Koštunica was supported by Zoran Đinđić, who was elected Prime Minister of Serbia in the December 2000 republican elections. After an initial honeymoon period in the wake of October 5, DSS and the rest of DOS, led by Đinđić and his DS, found themselves increasingly at odds over the nature and pace of the governments&#x27; reform programs. By mid-2002, Koštunica and Đinđić were openly at odds over the direction of the country&#x27;s future. Koštunica&#x27;s party, having informally withdrawn from all DOS decision-making bodies, was agitating for early elections in an effort to force Đinđić from the scene. After the initial euphoria of replacing Milošević, the population in reaction to this political maneuvering, was sliding into apathy and disillusionment with its leading politicians. This political stalemate continued for much of 2002, and reform initiatives stalled. Finally in February 2003, the Constitutional Charter was ratified by both republics, and Yugoslavia became a confederacy. Under the new Constitutional Charter, most federal functions and authorities devolved to the republic level. Svetozar Marović was elected as the new president of Yugoslavia.

On 6 February 2003, the country became a confederation pursuant to amendments agreed the previous year. This was to be a confederacy with more powers devolved to the constituent republics, Montenegro and Serbia, operating as a commonwealth. The central government largely became a ceremonial outfit.

On 12 March 2003, Serbia′s prime minister Zoran Đinđić was assassinated. The newly formed confederate government of Yugoslavia reacted swiftly by calling a state of emergency and undertaking an unprecedented crackdown on organized crime which led to the arrest of more than 4,000 people.

On 3 June 2006, Montenegro declared independence. On 5 June 2006, Serbia also declared independence, thus ending the 88 year old unity of the two Serbian countries - Serbia and Montenegro.

==Executive branch==
The president was elected by the Parliament for a four-year term. He chaired the Council of Ministers, composed of five members.
|President
|Svetozar Marović
|DPS
|7 March 2003 - 3 June 2006

==Legislative branch==
The Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro (&quot;Skupština Srbije i Crne Gore&quot;) had 126 members elected for a four-year term, 91 in Serbia and 35 in Montenegro. The first parliament was elected 25 February 2003 by the members of the old federal and the republican parliaments. Mandates were divided among parties and coalitions in proportion to the number of their benches in Serbia&#x27;s and Montenegro&#x27;s parliaments. Every time one of the parliaments was re-elected, the composition changes.

==Political parties and elections==
==Judicial branch==
The FR Yugoslavia had a Federal Court and a Constitutional Court. Judges were elected by the Federal Assembly for nine-year terms. After the promulgation of the new Constitution, the Federal Court would&#x27;ve had constitutional and administrative functions; it would&#x27;ve had an equal number of judges from each republic.

<text>As the economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia collapsed and entered a prolonged decline in 1989, the country broke up into five new sovereign states by 1992, independence of which was fought over in a series of Yugoslav Wars. The rump state that continued to designate itself as &#x27;Yugoslavia&#x27; (Federated Republic of) was established as a confederation of two of these successor states, Serbia and Montenegro.

With hyperinflation exacerbated by the economic embargo imposed during the Bosnian War, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) economy&#x27;s downward spiral showed no real sign of recovery until 1995. GDP was nowhere near its 1990 level, but the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia of the basic infrastructure of the country and many factories, as well as a renewed embargo, caused a further huge drop in GDP in relation to the 1991 level. The first sign of an economic recovery occurred in 2001 after the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević, which occurred on 5 October 2000. A vigorous team of economic reformers worked to tame inflation (non-energy inflation is less than 9% in 2002, down from over 120% two years earlier) and rationalize the Serbian and Montenegrin economy. By January 2005, GDP recovered to 55-60% of its 1990 level, due to GDP growth of 8.5% in 2004.

Following the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum, the union dissolved as Montenegro became an independent country. Thereafter, the economy of Montenegro and economy of Serbia would follow different trajectories.

==Hyperinflation==

The FRY&#x27;s monetary unit, the dinar, remained volatile throughout Milošević&#x27;s rule. Alarmed FRY officials took several steps to tighten monetary policy in 1998, including ruling out a devaluation in the near term, increasing reserve requirements, and issuing bonds. During this period, Montenegro rejected the dinar and adopted the Deutsche Mark (now replaced by the euro) as its official currency. As 1999 began, the damage control operation had succeeded in returning the exchange rate to reasonable levels. However, it was not until 2002, after intense macroeconomic reform measures, that the dinar became convertible—a first since the Bretton Woods Agreements laid out the post-World War II international exchange rate regime.

==Stabilization efforts==
Privatization efforts have not succeeded as well as macroeconomic reform. The process of privatization was not popular among workers of large socially owned companies, and many citizens appeared to believe the tendering process was overly centralized and controlled from Belgrade. Furthermore, international investment was lagging in Serbia and Montenegro, as a result of both domestic and international investment climates. Managers tended to blame the dearth of interest on the current negative business climate in Serbia and Montenegro.

<text>Telecommunication in Serbia is an important economic sector, accounting for 8.1% of country&#x27;s GDP in 2023.

==Telephony==
* Fixed-line telephones: 81% of households (2016)
* Telephone - fixed lines in use: 2.55 million, 36% penetration rate (2016)
* Telephone - mobile cellular: 9.09 million, 128% penetration rate (2016)
* International - country code: 381
* International - satellite earth station: 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)

===Fixed telephony===
Serbia has a developed and efficient telephone network infrastructure. Domestic line system is 100% digital, with digital cable trunk line connecting switching centres. A drop in fixed-line connections in the last decade has been more than offset by a sharp increase in mobile-cellular telephone use. Telekom Srbija, the former state monopoly, is the predominant player in landline telephony with 93.8% of market share. Since the liberalization of the telecommunications market in 2013, Telekom Srbija has been very slowly losing market share to 16 other telecom operators, of which the most significant ones include SBB and Orion Telekom.

===Mobile telephony===

As of December 2023 Serbia has three mobile networks, Telekom Srbija, Yettel, and A1, all of which are licensed for 2G GSM, 3G UMTS, and 4G LTE. The largest mobile operator is Telekom Srbija, marketed as &quot;mts&quot;, with 44.1% market share, followed by Yettel with 31.9% and A1 with 24% market share. In addition, SBB gained mobile virtual network operator licence in 2013 but is still not offering services.

==Radio and television==

* Radios (2016): 75.7% of households
* Radio broadcast stations: 247 (including six national stations, 34 regional stations, and 207 local stations)
* Televisions (2016): 97.8% of households
* Television broadcast stations: 122 (including seven national stations, 26 regional stations, and 89 local stations)

===Free-to-air terrestrial television===
Digital television transition has been completed in 2015 with MPEG-4 compression standard and DVB-T2 standard for signal transmission.

===Pay television===
Some 67% of households are provided with pay television services (i.e. 38.7% cable television, 16.9% IPTV, and 10.4% satellite). There are 90 pay television operators (cable, IPTV, DTH), largest of which are SBB (mainly cable) with 48% market share, Telekom Srbija (&quot;mts TV&quot;) with 25%, followed by PoštaNet with 5%, and Ikom and Kopernikus with 4% and 3%, respectively.

==IT Industry==
The Serbian IT industry is rapidly growing and changing pace. In 2018, IT services exports reached $1.3 billion. With 6,924 companies in the IT sector (), Belgrade is one of the information technology centres in this part of Europe, with strong growth. The Microsoft Development Center in Belgrade was, at the time of its establishment, the fifth such centre in the world. Many worlds IT companies choose Belgrade as regional or European centre such as Asus, Intel, Dell, Huawei, NCR, Ubisoft etc. These companies have taken advantage of Serbia&#x27;s large pool of engineers and relatively low wages.

Large investments by global tech companies like Microsoft, typical of the 2000s, are being eclipsed by a growing number of domestic startups which obtain funding from domestic and international investors. What brought companies like Microsoft in the first place was a large pool of talented engineers and mathematicians. In just the first quarter of 2016, more than US$65 million has been raised by Serbian startups including $45 million for Seven Bridges (a Bioinformatics firm) and $14 million for Vast (a data analysis firm). One of the most successful startups have been Nordeus which was founded in Belgrade in 2010 and is one of Europe&#x27;s fastest-growing companies in the field of computer games (the developer of Top Eleven Football Manager, a game played by over 20 million people).

==Internet==
* Top-level domains: .rs and .срб 
* Internet users: 5.8 million, 87.7% of the population (2024)
* Fixed internet access: 2.08 million households, 80% of households (2023)

<text>Transport in Serbia includes transport by road, rail, air and water. Road transport incorporates a comprehensive network of major (i.e. state) and minor (i.e. municipal) roads. Rail transport is fairly developed, although dual track and electrification are not very common. Water transport revolves around river transport while air transport around country&#x27;s three main international airports.

==Road transport==


Serbian road network carries the bulk of traffic in the country: some 55.8 million passengers (carried by buses) and 13 million tons (carried by trucks) in 2018. The road network are of comparatively lower quality to the Western European standards because of lack of financial resources for their maintenance in the last 20 years.

As of 2019, total length of roads is 45,419 km; major roads are categorized as &quot;state roads&quot; (with total length of 16,179 km) while minor roads are categorized as &quot;municipal roads&quot; (with total length of 23,780 km). By type of roads:

* motorways: 891 km
* expressways: 24 km
* other roads (paved): 29,300 km
* other roads (unpaved): 15,250 km

In 2018, statistics on registered vehicles were as follows:
* 1,999,771 passenger cars (1 per 3.5 inhabitants)
* 9,929 buses and coaches
* 223,629 lorries and vans
* 66,433 motorcycles and mopeds
Coach transport is very extensive: almost every place in the country is connected by bus, from largest cities to the villages. In addition, there are international routes to the neighboring countries (such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia) as well as to Western Europe (mainly to countries of Western Europe with large Serb diaspora such as Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland, etc.). Routes, both domestic and international, are served by more than hundred intercity coach services, biggest of which are Lasta and Niš-Ekspres.

=== Electric charging network ===
, 148 EVs were registered. Serbia has a network of over 30 charging stations (including 5 that are solar powered &amp; 2 Tesla Super Chargers) with more planned for construction. In 2020, Serbia introduced new purchase &amp; tax incentives for EVs &amp; Hybrids offering up to 5000 euros to help accelerate electrification. 
Serbia is also home to about 1% of global Lithium reserves, the mining &amp; processing of which will be done in partnership with Rio Tinto who have committed $1.5 billion of investment in the country. The government is currently looking to utilize this resource to produce a major EV battery plant &amp; Rio Tinto is helping locate a strategic partner for this venture.

===Historical preview===

The Brotherhood and Unity Highway was one of the first motorways of Central-Eastern Europe. Opened as early as 1950, it became the backbone of Yugoslav road system, and linked Belgrade through Zagreb and Ljubljana with Austrian border, and through Niš and Skopje with Greek border. It became the main road link between Central Europe and South-Eastern Europe and Middle East. Nowadays, the section going from Belgrade to the Croatian border is known as the A3, and links Serbia directly by motorway to Slovenia, Italy, Austria and the rest of Western Europe. While the section linking Belgrade to Niš and further to the border with North Macedonia is the A1 motorway and stretches all the way until Athens, passing through Skopje and Thessaloniki. With the break-up of Yugoslavia and the geostrategical change, the A1 was linked with the motorway linking Belgrade further North towards Novi Sad, Subotica and the border with Hungary going all way until Budapest. In Niš, the motorway has an extension that runs through Pirot towards the border with Bulgaria, linking it further with Bulgarian capital Sofia and running all the way until Istanbul becoming the most accessible motorway linking the Balkans with Turkey, Middle East and rest of Asia.

==Rail transport==

In March 2015, the Government of Serbia announced its plan to establish three additional new railway companies, splitting the Serbian Railways in separate businesses. Those companies are: Srbija Voz operating passenger transport, Srbija Kargo operating cargo transport and Serbian Railways Infrastructure operating as infrastructure management company.

Rail remains a popular mode for freight transportation with 12.3 million tons carried in 2018. Passenger services are less utilized, carrying just over 16 million passengers in 2018 plus the 5 million riderships in the Belgrade urban rail system.

The railway system in Serbia consists of 3,739 km of rails, of which 295 km is double track (7.9% of the network). 33.6% of the network (1,279 km) is electrified. Railroads are categorized as either main lines, regional lines, local lines or sidings. Serbia has rail links with all of its neighbouring countries.

==Air transport==
There are in total 39 airports and 2 heliports in Serbia. In addition, three airports are with regular passenger traffic service: Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, Niš Constantine the Great Airport and Kraljevo Morava Airport.The total air traffic in 2022 reached 6,014,625 passengers and 20 thousand tons in annual cargo tonnage. This figure includes all three airports with schedule international and domestic flights.

Airports of Serbia is Public Enterprise company owned by the Government of Serbia for the purpose of better and more efficient management of the airports in the whole country. The company currently manages 5 airports in Serbia and 1 in Bosnia and Hercegovina. VINCI Airports took over Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport under concession at the end of 2018. from the state for a period of 25 years.

The national carrier of the Republic of Serbia is Air Serbia, a legacy carrier which carried some 2.75 million passengers in 2022 flying to the total of 80 domestic and international destinations in more than 30 countries. This includes intercontinental flights to New York City, Chicago and Tianjin. Beside Air Serbia, other established airline companies that fly to Serbia include Lufthansa, Air France, Turkish Airlines, Aeroflot, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, and LOT Polish Airlines. Currently, the following low-cost airlines are flying to Serbia: Ryanair, EasyJet, Wizz Air, Transavia and Norwegian Air Shuttle.
===Historical preview===
Serbia was among the pioneers in mail, freight and passenger air transport. The first airfields were inaugurated in 1910. In 1914, the Banjica airfield was the base for the Serbian Air Force squadron and the Balloon Company. After the end of the First World War, the Banjica airfield was used for airmail traffic and included the routes Novi Sad–Belgrade–Niš–Skoplje and Belgrade–Sarajevo–Mostar. Regular passenger transport greatly expanded with the creation of Aeroput in 1927 which became the Yugoslav flag-carrier and with over 30 planes and having its hub in Belgrade, it became the 21st airline in the world. It linked Belgrade and other Serbian cities such as Niš and Podujevo with destinations all around Yugoslavia and also with the main airports in Austria, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Greece. As early as 1923 foreign companies started regular routes that included Belgrade. Besides Aeroput, Air France, Deutsche Luft Hansa, KLM, Imperial Airways and airlines from Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Poland also used the airport until the outbreak of the Second World War. It was one of them, the CFRNA, that on its route linking Belgrade with Paris and Bucharest, in 1923, that made the first world night flight ever in history. The constantly increasing number of passengers made inevitable the building of a modern airport in 1931, which included a modern terminal building and top landing equipment for poor visibility conditions, that were installed in 1936.

At the end of Second World War the country changed from a monarchy to a communist regime. Aeroput was rebranded as JAT Yugoslav Airlines and the reconstruction of the much destroyed infrastructure begin. After Tito–Stalin Split in 1948, Yugoslavia became one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement. Following this policy, JAT inaugurated inter-continental flights linking capital Belgrade with all five continents. Its geopolitical position made it able to acquire both, West and East build aircraft. A new modern airport, the Belgrade international airport was inaugurated in 1962. Belgrade became a national and regional hub. Besides JAT, a number of other charter and regional airlines were created, with Aviogenex being the one based in Belgrade. Also, Adria Airways, partially owned by Serbian company InterExport, included numerous flights linking Belgrade with different destinations around the world. During SFRY period Belgrade was linked with flights to destinations as far as Sydney, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Beijing, Johannesburg, New York, Chicago, Montreal or Toronto. Passengers from the region could access all these destinations through connection flights through Belgrade.

The air transport industry was in continuous growth and expansion until the beginning of the Yugoslav wars and the break-up of Yugoslavia. During the war, severe sanctions were imposed upon Serbia and Montenegro which included no-flight zone over Serbia and prohibition of international flights to and from Serbia and Montenegro. This was a major set-back for Serbian airline industry. It will be only after Kosovo War and overthrow of Milosevic that by year 2000 air transport industry started to recover.

==Water transport==
Serbia has a fairly developed inland water transport which carried over 2 million tons of cargo in 2016. There are 1,716 kilometers of navigable inland waterways (1,043 km of navigable rivers and 673 km of navigable canals), which are almost all located in northern third of the country. The most important inland waterway is the Danube, that is part of Pan-European Corridor VII. Other navigable rivers in Serbia include Sava, Tisza, Begej and Timiş River, all of which connect Serbia with Northern and Western Europe through the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal and North Sea route. To Eastern Europe Serbia is connected via the Begej and Danube via Black Sea route, and to Southern Europe via the Sava river.

Important ports on Danube river are: Port of Novi Sad (1.18 million tons of cargo tonnage in 2016) and Port of Belgrade are the largest, while other river ports on the same river include: Pančevo, Smederevo, Prahovo, Apatin and Bačka Palanka. On Sava river, Šabac Port is the most significant and on Begej river that is Senta Port.

Merchant river fleet include 149 ships: 146 cargo vessels (with total capacity of 173 thousand tons) and 3 passenger ships.

==Pipelines==
 
Through pipeline network some 6.2 million tons of gas and oil were transported in 2018. The natural gas transportation system comprises 3,177 kilometers of trunk and regional natural gas pipelines with 450 million cubic meter underground gas storage facility at Banatski Dvor. There are 155 kilometers of crude oil pipelines connecting Pančevo and Novi Sad refineries as a part of trans-national Adria oil pipeline.

<text>The Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro (, [ВСЦГ / VSCG]) included ground forces with internal and border troops, naval forces, air and air defense forces, and civil defense. From 1992 to 2003, the &quot;VSCG&quot; was called the Yugoslav Army (, ), created from the remnants of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA), the military of SFR Yugoslavia until the country disbanded. The rump state, then named Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, participated in the Yugoslav Wars with limited direct intervention of its own armed forces. Following the end of the Wars and the constitutional reforms of 2003 by which the state was renamed &quot;Serbia and Montenegro&quot;, the military accordingly changed its name. The military was heavily involved in combating Albanian separatists during the Kosovo War and Preševo Valley conflict, and also engaged NATO warplanes during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

Upon the dissolution of Serbia and Montenegro with the Montenegrin independence referendum (2006), a fraction of the joint military was given to Montenegro, with the bulk of the force remaining in Serbia. Montenegro inherited the navy as Serbia is landlocked.

<text>Since the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFR Yugoslavia) in the early 1990s, the foreign policy of the newly established [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003) was characterized primarily by a desire to secure its political and geopolitical position and the solidarity with ethnic Serbs in other former Yugoslav republics through a strong nationalist campaign. While the country was involved in Yugoslav Wars and therefore exposed to several rounds of devastating sanctions against Yugoslavia this involvement was often denied for political or ideological reasons. In the initial period Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FR Yugoslavia) unsuccessfully aspired to gain international recognition as the sole legal successor state to SFR Yugoslavia, the country which was one of the most prominent foreign policy subjects during the Cold War.

Unwilling to accept the interpretation that it is a new state that shares succession with other former SFR Yugoslav republics, FR Yugoslavia rejected to reapply for membership in international organizations leading the country to international isolation and it sometimes being described as a pariah state all up until the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in 2000. International status of the country improved somewhat following the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement which ended Bosnian War and 1995 Erdut Agreement which opened the space for mutual recognition and establishment of full diplomatic relations with Croatia in 1996. This improvement was nevertheless not long lasting with the beginning of Kosovo War and 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

Following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević on 5 October 2000 and the victory of Democratic Opposition of Serbia led by new Prime Minister of Serbia Zoran Đinđić and the new President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Vojislav Koštunica the country has worked to stabilize and strengthen its bilateral relationships with neighboring countries and the world. The country has joined multiple international organizations such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations and is actively participating in International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank projects.

Following the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum which led to the dissolution of the state union two constituents (Republic of Serbia and Republic of Montenegro) agreed on Serbian sole succession of rights and obligations of the FR Yugoslavia with foreign relations of Serbia directly continuing all memberships in international organizations, inheriting federal properties (for example embassies) and accessions to various treaties. &quot;Memorandum of Agreement&quot; reached on 30 November 2006 additionally ensures Serbian provision of consular services to the Montenegrin citizens on the territory of states in which Montenegro has no missions of its own.

==History==
In spring and summer 2002, Yugoslavia resolved its longstanding border dispute with Republic of Macedonia. Although a difficult political issue domestically, the country has established a solid working relationship with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and has released all disputed ethnic Albanian prisoners from Kosovo to the competent UN bodies.

In 2002, the government established a commission to coordinate cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and began serving warrants for the arrest of indicted war criminals who have sought refuge in the country. The crackdown on organized crime following the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić; also resulted in the apprehension and transfer to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Hague of several persons indicted for war crimes.

Immediately preceding the NATO bombing campaign of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in spring 1999, the U.S. and most European countries severed relations with Yugoslavia, and the U.S. embassy was closed. Since October 5, 2000, foreign embassies, including that of the U.S., have reopened, and the country has regained its seat in such international organizations as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations and is actively participating in International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank projects. As of summer 2003, Serbia and Montenegro has been admitted to the Council of Europe and has indicated that it wishes to join NATO&#x27;s Partnership for Peace.

==Foreign aid==
Subsequent to the outbreak of hostilities with NATO, Belgrade received no foreign aid from the United States and other west European countries, but has received much aid from other countries such as Russia, China, and Greece. Since October 2000, however, the European Union aid has steadily increased, and U.S. restrictions on aid have fallen away as the union of Serbia and Montenegro stepped forward to meet its international obligations. In June 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell was able to certify that Serbia and Montenegro relationship with the Republika Srpska was consistent with the Dayton Accords, had released all political prisoners, and was cooperating with ICTY. As a result, the United States is now free to release aid money and support Serbia and Montenegro in international financial institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank. Total U.S. aid to Serbia and Montenegro, including debt forgiveness, exceeded $180 million in fiscal year 2002. The U.S. is the single-largest donor of aid to Serbia and Montenegro.

==International disputes==
* Several Albanian political parties in Kosovo voice union with Albania
* Has delimited about half of the boundary with Bosnia and Herzegovina, but sections along the Drina River remain in dispute.
* There is also a dispute with Bosnia regarding the exclave of Sastavci village in Priboj municipality (which is entirely surrounded by Serbian territory), as well as Serbian &quot;practical&quot; exclave comprising several villages in the same area.
* Some disputes with Croatia regarding the border. In 2002 there was a border incident regarding river island near Šarengrad, when Serbian border police prevented landowners from Croatia to visit their properties (lying in Serbian territory) using boats.
* In late 2002, Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia adopted an interim agreement to settle the disputed Prevlaka Peninsula, allowing the withdrawal of the UN monitoring mission (UNMOP), but discussions could be complicated by the inability of Serbia and Montenegro to come to an agreement on the economic aspects of the new federal union.
* After a recent shooting of an Albanian youth crossing the border with Macedonia there has been calls for autonomy for Albanians in the Preševo region, having international troops put as border guards, and making of more border crossings.

==Illicit drugs==
* Transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin moving to Western Europe on the Balkan route; economy vulnerable to money laundering

<doc id="34378" wikidata="Q423449" url="?curid=34378" title="Yogh">
<text>The letter yogh (ȝogh) ( ; Scots: ; Middle English: ) was used in Middle English and Older Scots, representing &quot;y&quot; () and various velar phonemes. It was derived from the Insular form of the letter &quot;g&quot;, Ᵹᵹ.

In Middle English writing, tailed z came to be indistinguishable from yogh.

In Middle Scots, the character yogh became confused with a cursive z and the early Scots printers often used z when yogh was not available in their fonts. Consequently, some Modern Scots words have a &quot;z&quot; in place of a yogh—the common surname Menzies was originally written Menȝies (pronounced &quot;mingis&quot;).

Yogh is shaped similarly to the Cyrillic letter З and the Arabic numeral 3, which are sometimes substituted for the character in online reference works. There is some confusion about the letter in the literature, as the English language was far from standardised at the time. Capital is represented in Unicode by code point , and lower case by code point .

== Pronunciation ==

In Modern English &quot;yogh&quot; is pronounced , using short o or , , , using long o.

It stood for and its various allophones—including and the voiced velar fricative —as well as the phoneme ( in modern English orthography). In Middle English, it also stood for the phoneme and its allophone [ç] as in (&quot;night&quot;, in an early Middle English way still often pronounced as spelled so: ), and also represented the phonemes /j/ and /dʒ/. Sometimes, yogh stood for or , as in the word , &quot;yowling&quot;.

In Middle Scots, it represented the sound in the clusters , and written &quot;l&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. Yogh was generally used for rather than &quot;y&quot;.

In medieval Cornish manuscripts, yogh was used to represent the voiced dental fricative , as in its , now written , pronounced .

== History ==
===Old English===

The original Germanic &quot;g&quot; sound was expressed by the gyfu rune in the Anglo-Saxon futhorc (which is itself sometimes rendered as in modern transliteration). Following palatalization, both &quot;gyfu&quot; and Latin &quot;g&quot; in Old English expressed the sound before front vowels. For example, &quot;year&quot; was written as &quot;gear&quot;, even though the word had never had a &quot;g&quot; sound (deriving from Proto-Germanic &quot;*jērą&quot;).

With the re-introduced possibility of a sound before front vowels, notably in the form of loanwords from the Old Norse (such as &quot;gere&quot; from Norse &quot;gervi&quot;, Modern English &quot;gear&quot;), this orthographical state of affairs became a source of confusion, and a distinction of &quot;real &quot;g&quot;&quot; () from &quot;palatalized &quot;g&quot;&quot; () became desirable.

In the Old English period, ᵹ was simply the way Latin &quot;g&quot; was written in the Insular script introduced at the Christianisation of England by the Hiberno-Scottish mission. It only came to be used as a letter &quot;distinct&quot; from &quot;g&quot; in the Middle English period, where it evolved in appearance into ȝ, now considered a separate character.

===Middle English===
In the 14th century, the digraph &quot;gh&quot; arose as an alternative to yogh for /x/, and eventually overtook yogh in popularity; still, the variety of pronunciations persisted, as evidenced by &quot;cough&quot;, &quot;taught&quot;, and &quot;though&quot;. The process of replacing the yogh with &quot;gh&quot; was slow, and was not completed until the arrival of printing presses (which lacked yogh) in England around the end of the fifteenth century. Not every English word that contains a &quot;gh&quot; was originally spelled with a yogh: for example, &quot;spaghetti&quot; is Italian, where the &quot;h&quot; makes the &quot;g&quot; hard (i.e., instead of ); &quot;ghoul&quot; is Arabic, in which the &quot;gh&quot; was .

The medieval author Orm used this letter in three ways when writing Early Middle English. By itself, it represented , so he used this letter for the &quot;y&quot; in &quot;yet&quot;. Doubled, it represented , so he ended his spelling of &quot;may&quot; with two yoghs. Finally, the digraph of &quot;ȝh&quot; represented .

In the late Middle English period, yogh was no longer used: came to be spelled &quot;night&quot;. Middle English re-imported G in its French form for (As a further side note, French also used to represent in words like &quot;voyage&quot; and &quot;yeux&quot;).

===Scots===
In words of French and Gaelic origin, the Early Scots palatal consonant had become or in some cases , and the palatal consonant had become by the Middle Scots period. Those were variously written , , or , and , or (cf. &quot;gn&quot; and &quot;gli&quot; in Italian). By the Modern Scots period the yogh had been replaced by the character &quot;z&quot;, in particular for , (&quot;n&quot;) and (&quot;l&quot;), written &quot;nz&quot; and &quot;lz&quot;. The original and developed into in some words such as or &quot;Zetland&quot; for &quot;Shetland&quot;. Yogh was also used to represent in words such as , &quot; (yesterday) and &quot; but by the Modern Scots period &quot;y&quot; had replaced yogh. The pronunciation of MacKenzie (and its variant spellings) (from Scottish Gaelic ), originally pronounced in Scots, shows where yogh became z. Menzies Campbell is another example.

===After the development of printing===
In Middle Scots orthography, the use of yogh became confused with a cursive &quot;z&quot; and the early Scots printers often used &quot;z&quot; when yogh was not available in their fonts.

The yogh glyph can be found in surnames that start with a &quot;Y&quot; in Scotland and Ireland; for example the surname Yeoman, which would have been spelled . Sometimes, the yogh would be replaced by the letter &quot;z&quot;, because the shape of the yogh was identical to some forms of handwritten &quot;z&quot;.

In Unicode 1.0, the character yogh was mistakenly unified with the quite different character ezh (Ʒ ʒ), and yogh itself was not added to Unicode until version 3.0.

<text>Yevgeny Ivanovich Zamyatin (; – 10 March 1937), sometimes anglicized as Eugene Zamyatin, was a Russian author of science fiction, philosophy, literary criticism, and political satire.

The son of a Russian Orthodox priest, Zamyatin lost his faith in Christianity at an early age and became a Bolshevik. As a member of his Party&#x27;s Pre-Revolutionary underground, Zamyatin was repeatedly arrested, beaten, imprisoned, and exiled. However, Zamyatin was just as deeply disturbed by the policies pursued by the All-Union Communist Party (b) [VKP (b)] following the October Revolution as he had been by Tsarist policy.

Due to his subsequent use of literature to both satirize and criticize the Soviet Union&#x27;s enforced conformity and increasing totalitarianism, Zamyatin, whom Mirra Ginsburg has dubbed &quot;a man of incorruptible and uncompromising courage,&quot; is now considered one of the first Soviet dissidents. He is most famous for his highly influential and widely imitated 1921 dystopian science fiction novel &quot;We&quot;, which is set in a futuristic police state.

In 1921, &quot;We&quot; became the first work banned by the Soviet censorship board. Ultimately, Zamyatin arranged for &quot;We&quot; to be smuggled to the West for publication. The outrage this sparked within the Party and the Union of Soviet Writers led directly to the State-organized defamation and blacklisting of Zamyatin and his successful request for permission from Joseph Stalin to leave his homeland. In 1937 he died in poverty in Paris.

After his death, Zamyatin&#x27;s writings were circulated in &quot;samizdat&quot; and continued to inspire multiple generations of Soviet dissidents.

==Early life==
Zamyatin was born in Lebedyan, Tambov Governorate, south of Moscow. His father was a Russian Orthodox priest and schoolmaster, and his mother a musician. In a 1922 essay, Zamyatin recalled: &quot;You will see a very lonely child, without companions of his own age, on his stomach, over a book, or under the piano, on which his mother is playing Chopin.&quot; Zamyatin may have had synesthesia since he gave letters and sounds qualities. He saw the letter Л as having pale, cold and light blue qualities.

He studied engineering for the Imperial Russian Navy in Saint Petersburg, from 1902 until 1908. During this time, Zamyatin lost his faith in Christianity, became an atheist and a Marxist, and joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.

==1905: Revolt and repression==
Zamyatin later recalled the Russian Revolution of 1905 as follows: &quot;In those years, being a Bolshevik meant following the line of greatest resistance, and I was a Bolshevik at that time. In the fall of 1905 there were strikes, and the dark Nevsky Prospekt was pierced by a searchlight from the Admiralty Building. October 17. Meetings in the universities.&quot;

In December 1905, Zamyatin agreed to hide in his flat a paper bag filled with the explosive pyroxylin. The following day, he and thirty other Bolsheviks were arrested by the Okhrana inside their &quot;revolutionary headquarters of the Vyborg district, at the very moment when plans and pistols of various types were spread out on the table.&quot;

After being arrested and beaten up, Zamyatin managed to smuggle a note out of the prison, instructing his fellow Bolsheviks, &quot;to remove everything compromising from my room and the rooms of my four comrades.&quot; Although this was immediately done, Zamyatin did not know of it until much later. During the months he spent in solitary confinement, Zamyatin recalled that he had almost daily nightmares about the paper bag in his flat containing pyroxylin.
In the spring of 1906, Zamyatin was released and sent into exile in his native Tambov Governorate. However, Zamyatin later wrote that he could not stand life among the devoutly Russian Orthodox peasantry of Lebedyan. Therefore, he escaped and returned to Saint Petersburg where he lived illegally before moving to Helsinki, in the Grand Duchy of Finland.

After illegally returning to St. Petersburg, &quot;disguised, clean-shaven, with a pince-nez astride my nose,&quot; Zamyatin began to write fiction as a hobby. He was arrested and exiled a second time in 1911. He later recalled, &quot;I lived first in an empty dacha at Sestroretsk, then, in winter, in Lakhta. There amidst snow, solitude, quiet, I wrote &quot;A Provincial Tale&quot;.&quot;

==Life as a naval engineer==
In 1913, Zamyatin was granted an amnesty as part of the celebrations for 300-years of rule by the House of Romanov and granted the right to return to St. Petersburg. His &quot;A Provincial Tale&quot;, which satirized life in a small Russian town, was immediately published and brought him a degree of fame. The next year he was tried and acquitted for defaming the Imperial Russian Army in his story &quot;Na Kulichkakh&quot; (&quot;At the World&#x27;s End&quot;). He continued to contribute articles to Marxist newspapers. After graduating as an engineer for the Imperial Russian Navy, Zamyatin worked professionally at home and abroad.

===Sojourn in England===
In March 1916, he was sent to the United Kingdom to supervise the construction of icebreakers at the shipyards of Armstrong Whitworth in Walker and Swan Hunter in Wallsend while living in Newcastle upon Tyne. He supervised the building of the &quot;Krassin&quot;, which retained the distinction of being the most powerful icebreaker in the world into the 1950s. He also worked on the &quot;Lenin&quot;.

Zamyatin later wrote, &quot;My only previous visit to the West had been to Germany. Berlin had impressed me as a condensed, 80-percent version of Petersburg. In England it was quite different: everything was as new and strange as Alexandria and Jerusalem had been some years before.&quot;
Zamyatin later recalled, &quot;In England, I built ships, looked at ruined castles, listened to the thud of bombs dropped by German Zeppelins, and wrote &quot;The Islanders&quot;. I regret that I did not see the February Revolution, and know only the October Revolution (I returned to Petersburg, past German submarines, in a ship with lights out, wearing a life belt the whole time, just in time for October). This is the same as never having been in love and waking up one morning already married for ten years or so.&quot;

==1917–1931: Return to Russia==
Zamyatin&#x27;s &quot;The Islanders&quot;, satirizing English life, and the similarly themed &quot;A Fisher of Men&quot;, were both published after his return to Russia.

According to Mirra Ginsburg: &quot;In 1917 he returned to Petersburg and plunged into the seething literary activity that was one of the most astonishing by-products of the revolution in ruined, ravaged, hungry, and epidemic-ridden Russia. He wrote stories, plays, and criticism; he lectured on literature and the writer&#x27;s craft; he participated in various literary projects and committees – many of them initiated and presided over by Maxim Gorky – and served on various editorial boards, with Gorky, Blok, Korney Chukovsky, Gumilev, Shklovsky, and other leading writers, poets, critics, and linguists. And very soon he came under fire from the newly &#x27;orthodox&#x27; – the Proletarian Writers who sought to impose on all art the sole criterion of &#x27;usefulness to the revolution.&#x27;&quot;

But, as the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923 continued, Zamyatin&#x27;s writings and statements became increasingly satirical and critical toward the Bolshevik party. Even though he was an Old Bolshevik and even though &quot;he accepted the revolution&quot;, Zamyatin believed that independent speech and thought are necessary to any healthy society and opposed the Party&#x27;s increasing suppression of freedom of speech and the censorship of literature, the media, and the arts.

In his 1918 essay &quot;Scythians?&quot; Zamyatin wrote: &quot;Christ on Golgotha, between two thieves, bleeding to death drop by drop, is the victor – because he has been crucified, because, in practical terms, he has been vanquished. But Christ victorious in practical terms is the Grand Inquisitor. And worse, Christ victorious in practical terms is a paunchy priest in a silk-lined purple robe, who dispenses benedictions with his right hand and collects donations with his left. The Fair Lady, in legal marriage, is simply Mrs. So-and-So, with hair curlers at night and a migraine in the morning. And Marx, having come down to earth, is simply a Krylenko. Such is the irony and such is the wisdom of fate. Wisdom because this ironic law holds the pledge of eternal movement forward. The realization, materialisation, practical victory of an idea immediately gives it a philistine hue. And the true Scythian will smell from a mile away the odor of dwellings, the odor of cabbage soup, the odor of the priest in his purple cassock, the odor of Krylenko – and will hasten away from the dwellings, into the steppe, to freedom.&quot;

Later in the same essay, Zamyatin quoted a recent poem by Andrei Bely and used it to further criticize People&#x27;s Commissar for Military Affairs Nikolai Krylenko and those like him for having, &quot;covered Russia with a pile of carcasses&quot; and for &quot;dreaming of socialist-Napoleonic Wars in Europe – throughout the world, throughout the universe! But let us not jest incautiously. Bely is honest, and did not &quot;intend&quot; to speak about the Krylenkos.&quot;

In 1919, Zamyatin wrote: &quot;He who has found his ideal today is, like Lot&#x27;s wife, already turned into a pillar of salt and does not move ahead. The world is kept alive only by heretics: the heretic Christ, the heretic Copernicus, the heretic Tolstoy. Our symbol of faith is heresy.&quot;

Zamyatin&#x27;s novel &quot;We&quot;, which he wrote between 1920 and 1921, is set many centuries in the future. D-503, a mathematician, lives in the One State, an urban society constructed almost entirely of glass apartment-buildings, which assist mass surveillance by the secret police, or Bureau of Guardians. The structure of the One State is Panopticon-like, and life is scientifically managed based on the theories of F. W. Taylor. People march in step with each other and are uniformed. There is no way of referring to people except by numbers assigned by the One State. The society is run strictly by logic or reason as the primary justification for the laws or the construct of the society. The individual&#x27;s behaviour is based on logic by way of formulas and equations outlined by the One State.

As the novel opens, the spaceship &quot;Integral&quot; is being built in order to visit extraterrestrial planets. In a deliberate swipe at the expansionist dreams of Nikolai Krylenko and others like him, the One State intends to &quot;force&quot; alien races &quot;to be happy&quot; by accepting the absolutism of the One State and its leader, the Benefactor. Meanwhile, as the spaceship&#x27;s chief engineer, D-503 begins a journal that he intends to be carried upon the completed spaceship.

Like all other citizens of One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment-building and is carefully watched by the Bureau of Guardians. D-503&#x27;s lover, O-90, has been assigned by the One State to visit him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and is deeply grieved by her state in life. O-90&#x27;s other lover and D-503&#x27;s best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public executions.

While on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks vodka, and shamelessly flirts with D-503 instead of applying for a pink-ticket sex-visit; all of these acts are highly illegal according to the laws of One State.

Both repelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his attraction to I-330. He begins dreaming, which people of the One State know to be a serious mental illness.
Slowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she is in a member of MEPHI, an organization of rebels against the One State. I-330 also takes D-503 through secret tunnels to the untamed wilderness outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the city-state. There, D-503 meets human inhabitants whom the One State claims do not exist: hunter-gatherers whose bodies are covered with animal fur. MEPHI aims to topple the One State, destroy the Green Wall, and reunite the people of the city with the outside world.

Like many other dystopian novels, &quot;We&quot; does not end happily for I-330 and D-503, it also ends with a general uprising by MEPHI and with the One State&#x27;s survival in doubt. A recurring theme throughout &quot;We&quot; is that, just as there is no highest number, there can be no &quot;final&quot; revolution. Unsurprisingly, the Soviet Government refused to allow the publication of &quot;We&quot;.

In his 1921 essay &quot;I Am Afraid&quot;, Zamyatin began by criticizing the poets who unconditionally sang the praises of the new Soviet Government. Zamyatin compared them with the Court Poets under the House of Romanov and under the French House of Bourbon. Zamyatin further criticized &quot;these nimble authors&quot; for knowing &quot;when to sing hail to the Tsar, and when to the Hammer and Sickle&quot;. Zamyatin then wrote: &quot;True literature can exist only when it is created, not by diligent and reliable officials, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels and skeptics.&quot; Zamyatin continued by pointing out that writers in the new Soviet Union were forbidden to criticize and satirise, in the vein of Jonathan Swift and Anatole France, the foibles and failings of the new society. Zamyatin added that, while many compared Russia after the October Revolution to the Athenian democracy at its inception, the Athenian government and people did not fear the satirical stage-plays of Aristophanes, in which everyone was mocked and criticized. Zamyatin concluded by pointing out that if the Party did not rid itself of &quot;this new Catholicism, which is every bit as fearful of every heretical word as the old one&quot;, then the only future possible for Russian literature was &quot;in the past.&quot;

In Zamyatin&#x27;s 1923 essay, &quot;The New Russian Prose&quot;, he wrote: &quot;In art, the surest way to destroy is to canonize one given form and one philosophy: that which is canonized dies of obesity, of entropy.&quot;

In his 1923 essay, &quot;On Literature, Revolution, Entropy, and Other Matters&quot;, Zamyatin wrote: &quot;The law of revolution is red, fiery, deadly; but this death means the birth of a new life, a new star. And the law of entropy is cold, ice blue, like the icy interplanetary infinities. The flame turns from red to an even, warm pink, no longer deadly, but comfortable. The sun ages into a planet, convenient for highways, stores, beds, prostitutes, prisons; this is the law. And if the planet is to be kindled into youth again, it must be set on fire, it must be thrown off the smooth highway of evolution: this is the law. The flame will cool tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow (in the Book of Genesis days are equal to years, ages). But someone must see this already, and speak heretically today about tomorrow. Heretics are the only (bitter) remedy against the entropy of human thought. When the flaming, seething sphere (in science, religion, social life, art) cools, the fiery magma becomes coated with dogma – a rigid, ossified, motionless crust. Dogmatization in science, religion, social life, or art is the entropy of thought. What has become dogma no longer burns; it only gives off warmth – it is tepid, it is cool. Instead of the Sermon on the Mount, under the scorching sun, to upraised-arms and sobbing people, there is drowsy prayer in a magnificent abbey. Instead of Galileo&#x27;s, &#x27;Be still, it turns!&#x27; there are dispassionate computations in a well-heated room in an observatory. On the Galileos, the s build their own structures, slowly, bit by bit, like corals. This is the path of evolution – until a new heresy explodes the crush of dogma and all the edifices of the most enduring which have been raised upon it. Explosions are not very comfortable. And therefore the exploders, the heretics, are justly exterminated by fire, by axes, by words. To every today, to every civilization, to the laborious, slow, useful, most useful, creative, coral-building work, heretics are a threat. Stupidly, recklessly, they burst into today from tomorrow; they are romantics. Babeuf was justly beheaded in 1797; he leaped into 1797 across 150 years. It is just to chop off the head of a heretical literature which challenges dogma; this literature is harmful. But harmful literature is more useful than useful literature, for it is anti-entropic, it is a means of challenging calcification, sclerosis, crust, moss, quiescence. It is Utopian, absurd – like Babeuf in 1797. It is right 150 years later.&quot;

Zamyatin also wrote a number of short stories, in fairy-tale form, that constituted satirical criticism of Communist ideology. According to Mirra Ginsburg: &quot;Instead of idealized eulogies to the Revolution, Zamyatin wrote stories like &quot;The Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Cave&quot;, and &quot;A Story about the Most Important Thing&quot;, reflecting the starkness and the territory of the time: the little man lost in his uniform, transformed into a dragon with a gun; the starving, frozen intellectual reduced to stealing a few logs of wood; the city turned into a barren, prehistoric landscape – a desert of caves and cliffs and roaring mammoths; fratricide and destruction and blood. In &quot;The Church of God&quot;, he questions the Bolshevik tenet that the end justifies the means. In &quot;The Flood&quot;, he gives the central place to individual passions against a background that reflects the vast changes of the time as marginally and obliquely as they are reflected in the consciousness of his characters – residents of an outlying suburb, whose knowledge of the history around them is limited to such facts as the deteriorating quality of coal, the silent machines, the lack of bread.&quot;

In 1923, Zamyatin arranged for the manuscript of his dystopian science-fiction novel &quot;We&quot; to be smuggled to E.P. Dutton and Company in New York City. After being translated into English by Russian refugee Gregory Zilboorg, the novel was published in 1924.

Then, in 1927, Zamyatin went much further. He smuggled the original Russian text to Marc Lvovich Slonim (1894–1976), the editor of an anti-communist Russian émigré magazine and publishing house based in Prague. To the fury of the Soviet State, copies of the Czechoslovakian edition began being smuggled back to the USSR and secretly passed from hand to hand. Zamyatin&#x27;s secret dealings with Western publishers triggered a mass offensive by the Soviet State against him.

These attitudes, writings, and actions, which the Party considered Deviationism made Zamyatin&#x27;s position increasingly difficult as the 1920s wore on. Zamyatin became, according to Mirra Ginsburg, one of &quot;the first to become the target of concerted hounding by the Party critics and writers.&quot;

According to Mirra Ginsburg: &quot;Zamyatin&#x27;s vision was too far-reaching, too nonconformist, and too openly expressed to be tolerated by the purveyors of official and compulsory dogma. Very early he was branded by Trotsky as an internal émigré. He was repeatedly attacked as a bourgeois intellectual, out of tune with the revolution. When the Party-line Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP) gained full sway in the latter 1920s, with the end of the New Economic Policy and the introduction of the first Five Year Plan, it set out systematically to end all originality and independence in the arts. Art had to serve the ends of the Party or it had no right to exist.&quot;

Max Eastman, an American Communist who had similarly broken with his former beliefs, described the Politburo&#x27;s war against Zamyatin in his 1934 book &quot;Artists in Uniform&quot;.

According to Mirra Ginsburg: &quot;All the instruments of power were brought into use in the campaign for conformity. Faced with grim alternatives, most of Zamyatin&#x27;s erstwhile pupils and colleagues yielded to pressure, recanted publicly, in many cases rewrote their works, and devoted themselves to turning out the gray eulogies to Communist construction demanded by the dictatorship. Other writers, like Babel and Olesha, chose silence. Many committed suicide. Zamyatin&#x27;s destruction took a different form. One of the most active and influential figures in the , which included a variety of literary schools, he became the object of a frenzied campaign of vilification. He was dismissed from his editorial posts; magazines and publishing houses closed their doors to him; those which ventured to publish his work were persecuted; his plays were withdrawn from the stage. Under the pressure of the Party inquisitors, his friends began to be afraid to see him and many of his comrades in the Writer&#x27;s Union denounced him. He was, in effect, presented with the choice of repudiating his work and his views, or total expulsion from literature.&quot;

Instead of surrendering, Zamyatin, whom Mirra Ginsburg has dubbed &quot;a man of incorruptible and uncompromising courage,&quot; on 24 September 1929, wrote and mailed a letter resigning his membership in the Union of Soviet Writers. According to Mirra Ginsburg: &quot;in his letter of resignation, he wrote that it was impossible for him to remain in a literary organization which, even indirectly, took part in the persecution of its members.&quot;

In 1931, Zamyatin appealed directly to Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, requesting permission to leave the Soviet Union. In this letter Zamyatin wrote: &quot;I do not wish to conceal that the basic reason for my request for permission to go abroad with my wife is my hopeless position here as a writer, the death sentence that has been pronounced upon me as a writer here at home.&quot;

During the spring of 1931, Zamyatin asked Maxim Gorky, to intercede with Stalin on his behalf.

After Gorky&#x27;s death in 1936, Zamyatin wrote: 
&quot;One day, Gorky&#x27;s secretary telephoned to say that Gorky wished me to have dinner with him at his country home. I remember clearly that extraordinarily hot day and the rainstorm – a tropical downpour- in Moscow. Gorky&#x27;s car sped through a wall of water, bringing me and several other invited guests to dinner at his home. It was a literary dinner, and close to twenty people sat around the table. At first Gorky was silent, visibly tired. Everybody drank wine, but his glass contained water – he was not allowed to drink wine. After a while, he rebelled, poured himself a glass of wine, then another and another, and became the old Gorky. The storm ended, and I walked out onto the large stone terrace. Gorky followed me immediately and said to me, &#x27;The affair of your passport is settled. But if you wish, you can return the passport and stay.&#x27; I said I would go. Gorky frowned and went back to the other guests in the dining room. It was late. Some of the guests remained overnight; others, including myself, were returning to Moscow. In parting, Gorky said, &#x27;When shall we meet again? If not in Moscow, then perhaps in Italy? If I go there, you must come to see me! In any case, until we meet again, eh?&#x27; This was the last time I saw Gorky.&quot;
Zamyatin left the Soviet union in November 1931.

==Life in exile==
After their emigration, Zamyatin and his wife settled in Paris. According to Mirra Ginsburg: &quot;Zamyatin&#x27;s last years in Paris were years of great material hardship and loneliness. As Remizov wrote, &#x27;He came with sealed lips and a sealed heart.&#x27; He found little in common with most of the emigrés who had left Russia a decade earlier.&quot;

The screenplay for Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; (1936) from Maxim Gorky&#x27;s stage play was co-written by Zamyatin.

Zamyatin later wrote: &quot;Gorky was informed of this, and wrote that he was pleased at my participation in the project, that he would like to see the adaptation of his play, and would wait to receive the manuscript. The manuscript was never sent: by the time it was ready for mailing, Gorky was dead.&quot; After the film premiered, Zamyatin wrote articles for French magazines and worked on a novel titled &quot;The Scourge of God&quot;, with Attila as the main character. The novel was never finished.

==Death and burial==
Yevgeny Zamyatin died in poverty of a heart attack on 10 March 1937. Only a small group of friends were present for his burial at the Cimetière de Thiais, in the Parisian suburb of the same name.

One of the mourners, however, was Zamyatin&#x27;s Russian language publisher Marc Lvovich Slonim, who had befriended the Zamyatins after their arrival in the West. His death was unreported in the Soviet press.

==Legacy==
Writing in 1967, Mirra Ginsburg commented: &quot;Like Bulgakov and like Babel, Zamyatin gives us a glimpse of what post-revolutionary Russian literature might have become had independence, daring, and individuality not been stamped out so ruthlessly by the dictatorship. The Russian reader – and by the same token, the Russian writer – was deprived of the work of these rich and germinal writers, and the effects, alas, are sadly evident.&quot;

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union&#x27;s vengeance, however, against Zamyatin for sending his novel &quot;We&quot; to the West for publication was remembered by Soviet poets and writers long after the writer&#x27;s death. This is why it was 1957 before another Soviet writer took the risk of doing so again. In that year, when he handed the manuscript to his novel &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; over to an emissary from billionaire Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, Boris Pasternak said: &quot;You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad.&quot;

Even though Pasternak was accordingly subjected to State-organized character assassination, ostracism, and blacklisting almost identical to what had been experienced by Zamyatin, Pasternak&#x27;s decision to publish &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; in the West also helped him to win the 1958 Nobel Prize for Literature.

Not surprisingly, many other Soviet dissidents after Pasternak would also go on to both use and expand upon the ideas and tactics pioneered by the author of &quot;We&quot;. For example, Alexander Solzhenitsyn was Christianizing Zamyatin&#x27;s attacks against State-enforced conformity when he wrote, in his 1973 &quot;Letter to Soviet Leaders&quot;: &quot;Our present system is unique in world history, because over and above its physical and economic constraints, it demands of us total surrender of our souls, continuous and willing participation in the general, conscious &quot;lie&quot;. To this putrefaction of the soul, this spiritual enslavement, human beings who wish to be human cannot submit. When Caesar, having exacted what is Caesar&#x27;s, demands still more insistently that we render unto him what is God&#x27;s – that is a sacrifice we dare not make.&quot;

In the same year, Solzhenitsyn responded to the KGB&#x27;s seizure of a hidden manuscript of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, his nonfiction exposé of the Soviet secret police, the Soviet concentration camps, and the role of Vladimir Lenin in setting up both, by ordering his publisher in France to publish the whole book immediately. This resulted, as with Zamyatin, in Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s departure from his homeland.

As part of last Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reformist policies of glasnost and perestroika, Zamyatin&#x27;s writing began to again be published legally in his homeland in 1988.

Even since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Zamyatin&#x27;s many denunciations of enforced conformity and groupthink, as well as his belief that writers and intellectuals have a duty to oppose the calcification and entropy of human thought has meant that his writings continue to have both readers and admirers.

=== Science fiction ===
&quot;We&quot; has often been discussed as a political satire aimed at the police state of the Soviet Union. There are many other dimensions, however. It may variously be examined as (1) a polemic against the optimistic scientific socialism of H. G. Wells, whose works Zamyatin had previously published, and with the heroic verses of the (Russian) Proletarian Poets, (2) as an example of Expressionist theory, and (3) as an illustration of the archetype theories of Carl Jung as applied to literature.

George Orwell believed that Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1932) must be partly derived from &quot;We&quot;. However, in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins, Huxley says that he wrote &quot;Brave New World&quot; as a reaction to H.G. Wells&#x27;s utopias long before he had heard of &quot;We&quot;. Kurt Vonnegut said that in writing &quot;Player Piano&quot; (1952) he &quot;cheerfully ripped off the plot of &quot;Brave New World&quot;, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin&#x27;s &quot;We&quot;.&quot;

&quot;We&quot; directly inspired:
* Aldous Huxley &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1932) 
* Ayn Rand &quot;Anthem&quot; (1938) 
* George Orwell &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949) 
* Kurt Vonnegut &quot;Player Piano&quot; (1952)
* Ursula K. Le Guin &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; (1974)

In 1994, &quot;We&quot; received a Prometheus Award in the Libertarian Futurist Society&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; category.

<doc id="34382" wikidata="Q132994" url="?curid=34382" title="Yom Kippur">
<text>Yom Kippur ( ; , ) is the holiest day of the year in Judaism. It occurs annually on the 10th of Tishrei, corresponding to a date in late September or early October.

For traditional Jewish people, it is primarily centered on atonement and repentance. The day&#x27;s main observances consist of full fasting and asceticism, both accompanied by extended prayer services (usually at synagogue) and sin confessions. Many Jewish denominations, such as Reconstructionist Judaism (vs. Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, etc.), focus less on sins and more on one&#x27;s goals and accomplishments and setting yearly intentions.

Alongside the related holiday of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur is one of the two components of the High Holy Days of Judaism. It is also the last of the Ten Days of Repentance.

==Name==
The formal Hebrew name of the holiday is , &#x27;day [of] the atonements&#x27;. This name is used in the Bible, Mishnah, and Shulchan Aruch. The word &#x27;atonement&#x27; is one of many Biblical Hebrew words which, while using a grammatical plural form, refers to a singular abstract concept.

Beginning in the classical period, the singular form began to be used in piyyut, for example in Unetanneh Tokef, alongside the standard plural form . Use of spread in the medieval period, with () becoming the holiday&#x27;s name in Yiddish and () in Ladino. In modern Hebrew, or simply is the common name, while () is used in formal writing.

In older English texts, the translation &quot;Day of Atonement&quot; is often used.

== In the Torah ==
The Torah calls the day (), and decrees fasting (&quot;affliction of the soul&quot;) and a strict prohibition of work on the tenth day of the seventh month, later known as Tishrei. The laws of Yom Kippur are commanded by God to Moses in three passages in the Torah:
# : Aaron may only enter the sanctuary by performing a complex sacrificial procedure, later known as the Yom Kippur Temple service. This service must be performed yearly on the date of Yom Kippur, while the people are to fast and not work on this date.
# : The tenth day of Tishrei is a holy day of atonement. A Temple sacrifice must be offered, while the people must fast and not work, &quot;on the ninth day from evening until evening&quot;.
# : The tenth day of Tishrei is a holy day; one must fast and not work. The &quot;mussaf&quot; (additional) sacrifice for the day is specified.

Yom Kippur is mentioned briefly in another context: on Yom Kippur of the Jubilee year the shofar was to be blown. According to some, this is the source for the current custom of blowing the shofar at the conclusion of Yom Kippur.

=== Temple service ===
When the Temple in Jerusalem stood, Yom Kippur was the occasion of an elaborate sacrificial service, as commanded by . The rabbis summarized the laws of this service in Mishnah tractate Yoma, and they appear in contemporary traditional Jewish prayer books for Yom Kippur, and are studied as part of a traditional Jewish Yom Kippur worship service. The Mussaf prayer on Yom Kippur includes a section known as the Avodah, where a poem is recited describing this Temple service.

==Significance==
===High Holy Days===
Yom Kippur is one of the two High Holy Days, or &quot;Days of Awe&quot; (Hebrew ), alongside Rosh Hashanah (which falls nine days previously). According to Jewish tradition, on Rosh Hashanah God inscribes each person&#x27;s fate for the coming year into the Book of Life, and waits until Yom Kippur to &quot;seal&quot; the verdict. This process is described dramatically in the poem Unetanneh Tokef, which is recited on Rosh Hashanah in the Ashkenazic and Italian rites and on Yom Kippur in the Eastern Ashkenazic and Italian rites:
During the Days of Awe, a Jew reflects on the year, goals, and past actions, how his or her behavior has possibly hurt others and seek forgiveness for wrongs done against God and against other human beings.

=== Repentance (&quot;&quot;) ===

Repentance in Judaism (Hebrew: ), traditionally, consists of regretting having committed the sin, resolving not to commit that sin in the future, and confessing that sin before God.

While repentance for one&#x27;s sins can and should be done at any time, it is considered especially desirable during the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, and particularly on Yom Kippur itself. Thus, the Yom Kippur prayers contain extended confessions which list varieties of errors and sins, and to which one can add their own missteps, along with requests for forgiveness from God.

According to the Talmud, &quot;Yom Kippur atones for sins done against God (), but does not atone for sins done against other human beings () until the other person has been appeased.&quot; Therefore, it is considered imperative to repair the harm that one has done to others before or during Yom Kippur. Yom Kippur is described in the prayers as &quot;a day of creating love and brotherhood, a day of abandoning jealousy and strife&quot;. It is said that &quot;if one does not remove hatred [from their heart] on Yom Kippur, their prayers are not heard&quot;.

===Thirteen attributes===
According to the Bible, after the golden calf sin, Moses descended from Mount Sinai and broke the Tablets of Stone, which contained the Ten Commandments and symbolized the covenant with God. After God agreed to forgive the people&#x27;s sin, Moses was told to return to Mount Sinai for a second 40-day period, in order to receive a second set of tablets. According to rabbinic tradition, the date Moses descended with the second set of tablets was Yom Kippur. On this day Moses announced to the people that they had been forgiven; as a result the Torah fixed this date as a permanent holiday of forgiveness.

The new covenant, which God announced by proclaiming the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy to Moses, is textually similar to the covenant of the Ten Commandments except that God&#x27;s nature is described as merciful and forgiving, rather than zealous. When the Jewish people sinned in later eras, prophets would repeatedly quote the Thirteen Attributes to God as a reminder of God&#x27;s commitment to mercy and forgiveness. This is continued to the present day, as recitation of the Thirteen Attributes remains an important part of the Yom Kippur prayers (in Maariv and Neilah).

===Closeness to God===
While many of the observances of Yom Kippur (such as fasting and long prayers) can be difficult, there is also a tradition in which they are interpreted positively, as indications of closeness of God. Various sources compare the observances of Yom Kippur – fasting, barefootness (not wearing leather shoes), standing (in prayer), particular manners of prayer, even the peace that exists between Jews on this day – with the behavior of angels, suggesting that on Yom Kippur Jews become like angels in heaven, purified and close to God and not limited by physicality.

Yom Kippur was also unique as a time of closeness to God in the Yom Kippur Temple service. Yom Kippur was the only occasion on which the High Priest of Israel was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, the innermost chamber of the Temple in Jerusalem, where God&#x27;s presence was said to dwell. On Yom Kippur the High Priest entered the Holy of Holies several times, first to create a cloud of incense smoke in which (the Bible promises) God would reveal Himself without being seen, and later to offer sacrifices of atonement.

While the encounter with God and the atonement may appear to be unrelated, in fact they are mutually dependent. On one hand, the priest is only worthy to approach God when in a state of purity, with the sins of the people being forgiven. On the other hand, only by approaching God with an intimate, personal request can God be persuaded to abandon justice for mercy, permitting the purification to take place.

According to the Torah, the Yom Kippur Temple service was commanded in wake of the deaths of Nadab and Abihu on the eighth day of the Tabernacle inauguration. Not only was this eighth day the occasion of the Yom Kippur command, but the eighth day was also similar in its nature to Yom Kippur, both in biblical texts (e.g. the sacrifices offered on each day) and in rabbinic interpretation. The purpose of the eighth day was the revelation of God&#x27;s presence to the people; similarly, the Yom Kippur service was a unique opportunity for the people&#x27;s representative to obtain closeness with God.

A midrash compares the Yom Kippur prayers to a verse from the Song of Songs, describing a woman who rises from bed at night to begin a romantic encounter with her lover. With each Yom Kippur prayer, it is implied, Jews approach closer to God:

Using a similar metaphor, the Mishnah describes Yom Kippur as a wedding date, as on this date Moses returned having reestablished the covenant between God and Israel. Along with Tu B&#x27;Av, Yom Kippur was historically considered one of the two happiest days of the Jewish year, for on this day Jews receive forgiveness for their sins, and on this date the covenant with God was reestablished.

===Purification===
In , the Torah summarizes the purpose of Yom Kippur as follows:
There are two forms of impurity in Judaism (see Tumah and taharah): ritual impurity (e.g. when one touches a corpse) and moral impurity (when one commits a serious sin). While the Yom Kippur Temple service did purify the Temple if it had become ritually impure, the emphasis of the day is on the Jewish people&#x27;s purification from moral impurity.

Leviticus 16:30 mentions purification twice. According to Netziv, the first mention is a promise that God will purify Israel on this day, while the second is a command, calling on Israel to purify themselves through repentance. Thus, on this day Jews do their utmost to repent. But if, by the end of the day, they have reached the limits of their ability and are still morally flawed, God extends them forgiveness and purification anyway.

 states that &quot;Israel&#x27;s hope () is in God&quot;. According to Rabbi Akiva, this verse alludes to a ritual purification bath (also pronounced &quot;mikveh&quot;), and thus on Yom Kippur God metaphorically becomes a mikveh in which Israel immerses and purifies itself. This idea is symbolized by immersion in an actual mikveh. In the Yom Kippur Temple service, the High Priest would immerse upon putting on and taking off his white Yom Kippur garments; the rabbis counted no fewer than five immersions over the course of the day&#x27;s service. Among modern-day Jews, too, there is a custom of immersion before Yom Kippur (though not on Yom Kippur itself, as bathing is forbidden in normal circumstances).

When the scapegoat was selected on Yom Kippur to symbolically carry the people&#x27;s sins to the desert, a crimson cord was tied around its horns. While the practical purpose of this cord was to distinguish the scapegoat from the goat which was to be slaughtered, it also symbolized the sin which the scapegoat was carrying away. promises that if the Jewish people repents, &quot;if [their] sins are like crimson, they shall become white as snow.&quot; According to tradition, in some years the scapegoat&#x27;s cord would miraculously turn white to indicate that the people&#x27;s sins were forgiven and purification achieved in that year.

===Jewish unity===
Yom Kippur is considered a day of Jewish unity. In Kol Nidre, in which vows are released, vows of excommunication against sinning Jews were similarly lifted and these &quot;transgressors&quot; were allowed to pray alongside other Jews. According to the Talmud, &quot;Any fast in which Jewish sinners do not also participate is not a valid fast&quot;.

Similarly, the Mishnah describes Yom Kippur as a day on which men and women would once meet each other in the vineyards in order to arrange marriages. While this story is surprising given the generally somber nature of the day, it is based on the Biblical episode where the oath against marrying Benjaminites was circumvented by allowing them to take women from the vineyards as wives, and thus indicates the day&#x27;s theme of abandoning grudges in order for the Jewish people to be reunited.

== Customs ==

=== Erev Yom Kippur ===
On the day preceding Yom Kippur, known as (lit. &#x27;eve [of] day [of] atonement&#x27;), a number of activities are customarily performed in preparation for Yom Kippur. These activities generally relate to the themes of the holiday, but are forbidden or impractical to do on Yom Kippur itself.

According to the Talmud, &quot;Yom Kippur does not atone for sins between a person and his fellow until he has appeased his fellow.&quot; Thus, it is common practice on Erev Yom Kippur to request forgiveness from other individuals for misdeeds one has done to them. The Talmud records no less than 14 stories attesting to the importance of the day for repairing relationships with one&#x27;s spouses, parents, children, coworkers, the poor, and other individuals. The day before a major Jewish holiday is often devoted towards preparing for that holiday (as with burning &quot;chametz&quot; before Passover or obtaining the Four Species before Sukkot); for Yom Kippur, the appropriate preparation is to seek forgiveness from one&#x27;s fellow man. Nevertheless, one should not ask forgiveness if this will cause further harm (for example, by bringing up an insult the victim was unaware of).

According to &quot;halakha&quot;, one must eat on Erev Yom Kippur. A variety of reasons have been suggested for this requirement, among them:
* Most obviously, eating well before the fast will make it easier to complete the fast in good health.
* Eating before the fast will actually make the fast subjectively more difficult, due to &quot;withdrawal&quot; from the previous day&#x27;s feast, and thus increase a person&#x27;s level of &quot;affliction&quot; on this day (though it is not agreed that a person should in fact attempt to increase their affliction beyond the basic requirements).
* In general, Jewish holidays are celebrated with festive meals. Since a meal celebrating Yom Kippur cannot be held on the day itself, it is held beforehand.
* One celebrates the forgiveness they are about to receive for their sins, thus demonstrating that they are in fact bothered by their sins, and thus are more deserving of forgiveness.

Kreplach are traditionally served at the pre-fast meal. Also, it is common to ask for and receive lekach on Erev Yom Kippur.

Many Orthodox men immerse themselves in a &quot;mikveh&quot; on this day. Opinions differ on whether this is a technical act to remove ritual impurity, or else a symbolic one to symbolize one&#x27;s cleansing from sin on Yom Kippur.

The &quot;kapparot&quot; ritual, in which either money or a chicken is given to charity, is performed by some on Erev Yom Kippur as a means to enhance atonement.

Prior to this day&#x27;s morning prayer service (Shacharit), &quot;selichot&quot; prayers are recited, as they have been for the entire High Holiday period. In the afternoon prayer (Mincha), the long confession is recited, just as it is on Yom Kippur itself. This confession is recited before the last Erev Yom Kippur meal (the &quot;Separation Meal&quot; - in Hebrew &quot;se&#x27;udah&quot; &quot;hamafseket&quot; or &quot;aruha&quot; &quot;hamafseket&quot;), in case one becomes intoxicated at this meal and is unable to confess properly afterwards, or else because a person might choke to death at that meal and die without confessing (seemingly an unlikely possibility, but one which reminds a person of their mortality). Nevertheless, some recommend repeating the Vidui immediately before Kol Nidrei if time allows.

=== Fasting and asceticism ===

The Torah commands Jews to &quot;afflict themselves&quot; () on Yom Kippur. While these verses do not explicitly mention the form of affliction, the phrase &quot;afflicting oneself&quot; frequently appears elsewhere in connection with fasting or lack of food, and public fast days for repentance were a common practice in Biblical times. According to the Jewish oral tradition, the Yom Kippur &quot;affliction&quot; consists of the following five prohibitions:
# Fasting (no eating and drinking)
# No wearing of leather shoes
# No bathing or washing
# No anointing oneself with perfumes or lotions
# No sex

In traditional custom, the fast is required of males over age 13 and females over age 12. However, fasting is waived in the case of dangerous medical conditions (pikuach nefesh), and in such a case one is actually required to break the fast. Just as it is a mitzvah to fast on Yom Kippur, it may also be a mitzvah to eat or drink on Yom Kippur to safeguard a person&#x27;s health. In such situations, though, it is preferable (if the medical situation allows for it) to consume only small amounts of food or drink at a time.

Fasting, along with the other restrictions, begins at sundown, and ends after nightfall the following day. One should add a few minutes to the beginning and end of the day, called , lit. &#x27;addition to Yom Kippur&#x27;.

Yom Kippur is one of the only occasions when fasting is permitted on Shabbat.

====Symbolism====

A number of different interpretations of these restrictions have been suggested.

In one approach, fasting replaces animal sacrifices. Fasting causes one&#x27;s fat and blood to be diminished, just as the fat and blood of a sacrifice were burned on the altar. Thus, the fast is a form of sacrifice which can atone for sin like the Temple sacrifices once did.

Other approaches suggest that the prohibitions represent not suffering, but rather special holiness. For example, on Yom Kippur, Jews are said to become like angels. Just as angels do not need to eat, drink, or wear shoes, so too Jews do not engage on these activities on Yom Kippur. By detaching themselves from physical needs, Jews become purified and resemble angels.

Similarly, the prohibitions allude to the experience of Moses on Mount Sinai, who did not eat or drink while receiving the Torah and while receiving forgiveness for the people&#x27;s sins.

Similarly, the prohibitions have been interpreted as a return to the purity of the biblical Garden of Eden. Upon leaving Eden shoes became necessary for the first time (&quot;thorns and thistles will grow in your way...the snake will raise its head (to bite you) and you will give your heel (to crush it)&quot;); thus on Yom Kippur Jews do not wear (leather) shoes. While in Eden food and drink were easily obtained, but after the expulsion man must work for food &quot;by the sweat of [his] brow&quot;; thus food and drink are refrained from on Yom Kippur, as well as washing, and the use of cosmetics to remove sweat or its odor. In Eden death was unknown and procreation unnecessary; similarly on Yom Kippur marital relations are avoided.

According to Maimonides, the purpose of fasting (and the restriction on work) is to remove distractions from the task of repentance.

By refraining from these activities, the body is uncomfortable but can still survive. The soul is considered to be the life force in a body. Therefore, by making one&#x27;s body uncomfortable, one&#x27;s soul is uncomfortable. By feeling pain, one can feel how others feel when they are in pain.

===Prohibition on work===
The Torah calls Yom Kippur a day of rest () on which work is prohibited. Thus, the activities forbidden on Shabbat are also forbidden on Yom Kippur: the 39 categories of work as well as the rabbinic Shabbat prohibitions.

===Other observances===
Wearing white clothing is traditional to symbolize one&#x27;s purity on this day. Various reasons have been suggested for this custom:
* On Yom Kippur, Jews are similar to the angels in heaven who are said to wear white.
* To alludes to the verse &quot;If your sins are like crimson, they shall become white as snow&quot; ()
* To recall the High Priest who wore white for the Yom Kippur Temple service (and on no other occasion)

Many Ashkenazi Jewish men wear a kittel which, in addition to being white, symbolizes the seriousness of God&#x27;s judgment on this day, as in some communities the deceased are buried wearing kittels.

Yom Kippur is honored in the same ways as Shabbat and other holidays, to the extent permitted. Thus, the house is cleaned ahead of time, and the table covered with a nice tablecloth, even though it will not be used for eating. The synagogue is cleaned ahead of time, and all the lights left on. One bathes before Yom Kippur, and clean clothes are worn. Smelling pleasant smells is allowed on Yom Kippur, so many make a point of smelling pleasant spices throughout the day.

In most communities, candles are lit just before Yom Kippur, as is done before Shabbat. However, there were communities which had the custom not to light candles when Yom Kippur falls on a weekday (when it falls on Shabbat, everyone agrees that there is an obligation to light just like any other Sabbath), and therefore the Halachic authorities debate whether or not a blessing is recited on this lighting.

It is traditional for parents to give their children a special blessing before beginning the Yom Kippur prayers. Those whose parents have died light a yahrzeit candle in their memory before Yom Kippur begins.

=== Breaking of the fast ===
Following the fast, Sephardic Jewish communities traditionally serve a drink made from melon seeds similar to the Turkish &quot;sübye&quot;. Turkish Jews refer to it as &quot;subiye&quot;, while Greek Jews call it &quot;pepitada&quot;. This is followed by coffee with milk and &quot;biscochos&quot; (savory ring-shaped cookies), pieces of bread dipped in olive oil and &quot;za&#x27;atar&quot; alongside tomato, and later, chicken cooked with dry quinces or plums.

== Prayer services ==
The Yom Kippur prayer service includes several unique aspects. One is the number of prayer services. Unlike a regular day which has three prayer services (Shacharit, Mincha, and Maariv), or a Shabbat or Yom Tov which has four prayer services (those three, plus Mussaf), Yom Kippur has five prayer services (those four, plus &quot;Ne&#x27;ila&quot;, the closing prayer). The prayer services also include private and public confessions of sins (&quot;Vidui&quot;), and a unique prayer dedicated to the special Yom Kippur (service) of the Kohen Gadol (high priest) in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. The Yom Kippur prayer services include additional poems (&quot;piyyutim&quot;) and petitions for forgiveness (&quot;selichot&quot;). Notable poems recited include Avinu Malkeinu, Unetanneh Tokef (in Eastern Ashkenazic and Italian communities), Ki Anu Amecha (in Ashkenazic communities, although the order of the verses varies between communities), the Ten Martyrs (in Eastern Ashkenazic and some Western Ashkenazic communities), HaAderet v&#x27;HaEmunah (in Ashkenazic communities), and Mareh Kohen (in Ashkenazic communities). If Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat, Avinu Malkeinu is recited by Ashkenazic only during the Ne&#x27;ila prayer service, whereas the Sephardic and Italian rite recite it as normal at Shacharit and Mincha.

Many married Ashkenazi Orthodox men wear a &quot;kittel&quot;, a white robe-like garment for evening prayers on Yom Kippur, also used in Eastern European communities by men on their wedding day. They also wear a tallit (prayer shawl), which is typically worn only during morning services.

===Order of prayers===
Before the beginning of Yom Kippur, many Jews recite the optional (&#x27;the pure prayer&#x27;), in which (among other topics) one declares that they forgive anyone who has harmed them in the past, &quot;except for damages which can be recovered in court, and except for those who say: I will harm him and he will forgive me&quot;, asks God not to punish anyone who has been so forgiven, and asks God to show similar graciousness in forgiving their own sins.

Like all Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur begins in the evening, and the evening prayer () is preceded by the special Kol Nidre (described below) prayer.

The next morning, the morning prayer () is recited. The Torah reading is from , describing the Yom Kippur Temple service and the laws of the day. The Yom Kippur Torah reading is divided into six portions, and seven on the Sabbath. The Haftarah is from , according to which God will ignore the prayers of one who fasts while continuing to perform evil deeds. In most communities, Yizkor is then recited.

Next is the added prayer () as on all other holidays. The highlight of this prayer is the Avodah recitation, where the prayer leader recounts the Yom Kippur Temple service by which the High Priest would once obtain atonement from God in the Temple in Jerusalem. Other notable additions to Yom Kippur Mussaf in the Eastern Ashkenazic rite include the Unetanneh Tokef and Ten Martyrs poems.

While the original custom was for the Yom Kippur prayer service to take the entire day with no break, in recent years some have instituted a short break after Mussaf before the next prayers, which last until the conclusion of the fast.

Next is the afternoon prayer () and a Torah reading. The Haftarah that follows is the entire Book of Jonah, which has as its theme the story of God&#x27;s willingness to forgive those who repent. The service concludes with the &quot;Ne&#x27;ila&quot; (&quot;closing&quot;) prayer, which begins shortly before sunset, when the &quot;gates of prayer&quot; will be closed. After Ne&#x27;ila, Yom Kippur comes to an end with a recitation of &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; and the blowing of the &quot;shofar&quot;, which marks the conclusion of the fast and symbolizes freedom from sin. Finally, the brief weekday Maariv prayer is recited, before the recitation of Havdalah.

===Kol Nidre===

Before sunset on Yom Kippur eve, worshipers gather in the synagogue. The cantor stands with two community members at his sides, and chants the Kol Nidre prayer (Aramaic: כל נדרי, English translation: &#x27;All vows&#x27;). It is recited in a dramatic manner, before the open ark, with an Ashkenazic melody that dates back to the 16th century. Kol Nidre is recited in Aramaic, except in the Italian and Romaniote rites where it is recited in Hebrew.

All personal vows we are likely to make, all personal oaths and pledges we are likely to take between this Yom Kippur and the next Yom Kippur (in some versions: which we took between last Yom Kippur and this Yom Kippur), we publicly renounce. Let them all be relinquished and abandoned, null and void, neither firm nor established. Let our personal vows, pledges and oaths be considered neither vows nor pledges nor oaths.

Then the service continues with the evening prayers () and an extended Selichot service.

=== Avodah ===

The (&#x27;service&#x27;) passage in the Musaf prayer recounts in detail the Yom Kippur Temple service which was once performed in the Temple in Jerusalem. This passage traditionally features prominently in both the liturgy and the religious thought of the holiday. During its recitation, Jews &quot;imagine themselves in place of the priests when the Temple stood&quot;.

This traditional prominence is rooted in the Babylonian Talmud&#x27;s description of how to attain atonement following the destruction of the Temple in tractate Yoma. The recitation poetically describes the High Priest&#x27;s confessions of his and the people&#x27;s sins, his entry into the Holy of Holies, his sending away of the scapegoat, and all other parts of this day&#x27;s complex Temple service. A variety of liturgical poems are added, including a poem recounting the radiance of the High Priest after exiting the Holy of Holies, as well as prayers for the speedy rebuilding of the Temple and the restoration of sacrificial worship.

In most Orthodox and some Conservative synagogues, the entire congregation prostrates themselves at each point in the recitation where the High Priest would pronounce God&#x27;s holiest name (during recitation of 
). These three times, plus in some congregations the &quot;Aleinu&quot; prayer during the Musaf Amidah on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, are the only times in Jewish services when Jews engage in prostration (except for some Yemenite Jews and (&#x27;disciples of Maimonides&#x27;) who may prostrate themselves on other occasions during the year).

Orthodox liturgies include prayers lamenting the inability to perform the Temple service and petitioning for its restoration, which Conservative synagogues generally omit. In some Conservative synagogues, only the &quot;Hazzan&quot; (cantor) engages in full prostration. Some Conservative synagogues abridge the recitation of the Avodah service to varying degrees, and some omit it entirely. Reconstructionist services omit the entire service as inconsistent with modern sensibilities.

===Confession===
As confession is a core aspect of repentance, confession (or ) is a major part of the Yom Kippur prayer services. A confession is recited ten times on Yom Kippur, twice in each of the five standard prayers. In each prayer service, the confession is recited once by the individual in their silent prayer, and again communally during the cantor&#x27;s repetition of the Amidah. (The prayer has no repetition, so the second confession is instead recited in the communal Selichot recitation which follows the silent prayer.) Confession is recited an 11th time by individuals in the Mincha prayer of Yom Kippur eve, before the beginning of the holiday, and in some communities this is repeated by the Chazzan.

The Yom Kippur confession text consists of two parts: a short confession beginning with the word (, &#x27;we have sinned&#x27;), which is a series of words describing sin arranged according to the (Hebrew alphabetic order), and a long confession, beginning with the words (, &#x27;for the sin&#x27;), which is a set of 22 acrostics, in some communities double acrostics, also arranged according to the , enumerating a range of sins. Al Cheyt is omitted in both recitations of the confession in Neilah.

=== In Reform Judaism ===
Reform synagogues generally experience their largest attendance of the year on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah for worship services. The prayer philosophy of Reform, as described in the introduction of the movement&#x27;s High Holy Day prayerbook, &quot;Mishkan HaNefesh&quot;, is to reflect &quot;varied theological approaches that enable a diverse congregation to share religious experience... with a commitment to Reform tradition, as well as [to] the larger Jewish tradition.&quot; A central feature of these Reform services is the rabbinic sermon. &quot;For more than a century and a half in the Reform Movement,&quot; writes Rabbi Lance Sussman, &quot;High Holiday sermons were among the most anticipated events in synagogue life, especially on the eve of Rosh Hashanah and Kol Nidre night.&quot;

== Observance ==
As one of the most culturally significant Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur is observed by many secular Jews who may not observe other holidays. Many secular Jews attend synagogue on Yom Kippur – for many secular Jews the High Holy Days are the only times of the year during which they attend synagogue – causing synagogue attendance to soar.

=== Observance in Israel ===

Yom Kippur is a legal holiday in Israel. There are no radio or television broadcasts, airports are shut down, there is no public transportation, and all shops and businesses are closed.

In 2013, 73% of the Jewish people of Israel said that they were intending to fast on Yom Kippur. It is very common in Israel to wish &quot;Tsom Kal&quot; ([an] easy fast) or &quot;&quot; ([a] benefiting fast) to everyone before Yom Kippur, even if one does not know whether they will fast or not.

It is considered impolite to eat in public on Yom Kippur or to play music or to drive a motor vehicle. There is no legal prohibition on any of these, but in practice such actions are almost universally avoided in Israel during Yom Kippur, except for emergency services.

Over the last few decades, bicycle-riding and inline skating on the empty streets have become common among secular Israeli youths, especially on the eve of Yom Kippur in Tel Aviv.

In 1973, an air raid siren was sounded on the afternoon of Yom Kippur and radio broadcasts were resumed to alert the public to the surprise attack on Israel by Egypt and Syria that launched the Yom Kippur War.

=== Observance by athletes ===
Since the early 20th century, numerous Jewish athletes have opted not to participate in their sport on Yom Kippur if a sporting event coincides with the High Holy Day. Such incidents throw into sharp highlight the conflict many Jewish people face between social pressures and personal beliefs on a daily basis. Athletes observing Yom Kippur are often lauded for their decision not to play, which is also seen as a source of pride by many in the Jewish community.

The most famous example of this phenomenon is Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Los Angeles Dodgers, who refused to play on Yom Kippur when it clashed with Game 1 of the 1965 World Series which Koufax, as the team&#x27;s best pitcher, was slated to start. Koufax garnered national attention for his decision, which was seen as an example of the conflict between social pressures and personal beliefs.

Similarly, another Baseball Hall of Famer, first baseman Hank Greenberg, garnered national attention in 1934 when he refused to play on Yom Kippur, even though his Detroit Tigers were in the middle of a pennant race and Greenberg himself was leading the league in runs batted in. When Greenberg arrived in synagogue on Yom Kippur, the service stopped suddenly, and the congregation gave an embarrassed Greenberg a standing ovation.

The examples of Greenberg and Koufax have been followed by numerous athletes, including fellow baseball players Shawn Green, Kevin Youkilis, Brad Ausmus, and Art Shamsky. Outside of baseball, notable players to sit out Yom Kippur include: football player Gabe Carimi, golfer Laetitia Beck, chess player Boris Gelfand, and professional wrestler Bill Goldberg.

=== Recognition by the United Nations ===
Since 2016 the United Nations has officially recognized Yom Kippur, stating that from then on no official meetings would take place on the day. In addition, the United Nations stated that, beginning in 2016, they would have nine official holidays and seven floating holidays of which each employee would be able to choose one. It stated that the floating holidays will be Yom Kippur, Day of Vesak, Diwali, Gurpurab, Orthodox Christmas, Orthodox Good Friday, and Presidents&#x27; Day. This was the first time the United Nations officially recognized any Jewish holiday.

== Date of Yom Kippur ==

Yom Kippur falls each year on the tenth day of the Jewish month of Tishrei, which is nine days after the first day of Rosh Hashanah. In terms of the Gregorian calendar, the earliest date on which Yom Kippur can fall is September 14, as happened most recently in 1899 and 2013. The latest Yom Kippur can occur relative to the Gregorian dates is on October 14, as happened in 1967 and will happen again in 2043. After 2089, the differences between the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar will result in Yom Kippur falling no earlier than September 15. Gregorian calendar dates for recent and upcoming Yom Kippur holidays are:

<doc id="34384" wikidata="Q92748" url="?curid=34384" title="Yukihiro Matsumoto">
<text>, also known as Matz, is a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer best known as the chief designer of the Ruby programming language and its original reference implementation, Matz&#x27;s Ruby Interpreter (MRI). His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community: &quot;Matz is nice and so we are nice,&quot; commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.

, Matsumoto is the Chief Architect of Ruby at Heroku, an online cloud platform-as-a-service in San Francisco. He is a fellow of the Rakuten Institute of Technology, a research and development organization within Rakuten Group, Inc. He was appointed to the role of technical advisor for VASILY, Inc. starting in June 2014.

==Early life==
Born in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, he was raised in Tottori from the age of four. According to an interview conducted by &quot;Japan Inc.&quot;, he was a self-taught programmer until the end of high school. He graduated with an information science degree from University of Tsukuba where he was a member of Ikuo Nakata&#x27;s research lab on programming languages and compilers.

==Work==
He works for the Japanese open source company Netlab.jp. Matsumoto is known as one of the open-source evangelists in Japan. He has released several open source products, including cmail, the Emacs-based mail user agent, written entirely in Emacs Lisp. Ruby is his first piece of software that became known outside Japan.

===Ruby===
Matsumoto released the first version of the Ruby programming language on 21 December 1995. He still leads the development of the language&#x27;s reference implementation, MRI (Matz&#x27;s Ruby Interpreter).

===mruby===
In April 2012, Matsumoto open sourced his work on a new implementation of Ruby called mruby. It is a minimal implementation based on his virtual machine, ritevm, and is designed to allow software developers to embed Ruby in other programs while keeping memory footprint small and performance optimized.

===streem===
In December 2014, Matsumoto open sourced his work on a new scripting language called &quot;streem&quot;, a concurrent language based on a programming model similar to shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang, and other functional programming languages.

===Treasure Data===
Matsumoto has been listed as an investor for Treasure Data; many of the company&#x27;s programs such as Fluentd use Ruby as their primary language.

==Written works==
* &quot;オブジェクト指向スクリプト言語 Ruby&quot; 
* &quot;Ruby in a Nutshell&quot; 
* &quot;The Ruby Programming Language&quot; 

==Recognition==
Matsumoto received the 2011 Award for the Advancement of Free Software from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) at the 2012 LibrePlanet conference at the University of Massachusetts Boston in Boston.

==Personal life==
Matsumoto is married and has four children. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, having performed standard missionary service and become a counselor in the bishopric in his church ward.
