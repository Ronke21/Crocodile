<text>Publius Ovidius Naso (; 20 March 43 BC – AD 17/18), known in English as Ovid ( ), was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was a younger contemporary of Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. Although Ovid enjoyed enormous popularity during his lifetime, the emperor Augustus exiled him to Tomis, the capital of the newly-organised province of Moesia, on the Black Sea, where he remained for the last nine or ten years of his life. Ovid himself attributed his banishment to a &quot;poem and a mistake&quot;, but his reluctance to disclose specifics has resulted in much speculation among scholars.

Ovid is most famous for the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, a continuous mythological narrative in fifteen books written in dactylic hexameters. He is also known for works in elegiac couplets such as (&quot;The Art of Love&quot;) and &quot;Fasti&quot;. His poetry was much imitated during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and greatly influenced Western art and literature. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; remains one of the most important sources of classical mythology today.

==Life==
Ovid wrote more about his own life than most other Roman poets. Information about his biography is drawn primarily from his poetry, especially &quot;Tristia&quot; 4.10, which gives a lengthy autobiographical account of his life. Other sources include Seneca the Elder and Quintilian.

===Birth, early life, and marriage===

Ovid was born in the Paelignian town of Sulmo (modern-day Sulmona, in the province of L&#x27;Aquila, Abruzzo), in an Apennine valley east of Rome, to an important equestrian family, the &quot;gens Ovidia&quot;, on 20 March 43 BC – a significant year in Roman politics. Along with his brother, who excelled at oratory, Ovid was educated in rhetoric in Rome under the teachers Arellius Fuscus and Porcius Latro.

His father wanted him to study rhetoric so that he might practice law. According to Seneca the Elder, Ovid tended to the emotional, not the argumentative pole of rhetoric. Following the death of his brother at 20 years of age, Ovid renounced law and travelled to Athens, Asia Minor, and Sicily. He held minor public posts, as one of the &quot;tresviri capitales&quot;, as a member of the Centumviral court and as one of the &quot;decemviri litibus iudicandis&quot;, but resigned to pursue poetry probably around 29–25 BC, a decision of which his father apparently disapproved.

Ovid&#x27;s first recitation has been dated to around 25 BC, when he was eighteen. He was part of the circle centered on the esteemed patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, and likewise seems to have been a friend of poets in the circle of Maecenas. In &quot;Tristia&quot; 4.10.41–54, Ovid mentions friendships with Macer, Propertius, Ponticus and Bassus, and claims to have heard Horace recite. He only barely met Virgil and Tibullus, a fellow member of Messalla&#x27;s circle, whose elegies he admired greatly. 

He married three times and had divorced twice by the time he was thirty. He had one daughter and grandchildren through her. His last wife was connected in some way to the influential &quot;gens Fabia&quot; and helped him during his exile in Tomis (now Constanța in Romania).

===Literary success===
Ovid spent the first 25 years of his literary career primarily writing poetry in elegiac meter with erotic themes. The chronology of these early works is not secure, but scholars have established tentative dates. His earliest extant work is thought to be the &quot;Heroides&quot;, letters of mythological heroines to their absent lovers, which may have been published in 19 BC, although the date is uncertain as it depends on a notice in &quot;Am.&quot; 2.18.19–26 that seems to describe the collection as an early published work.

The authenticity of some of these poems has been challenged, but this first edition probably contained the first 14 poems of the collection. The first five-book collection of the &quot;Amores&quot;, a series of erotic poems addressed to a lover, Corinna, is thought to have been published in 16–15 BC; the surviving version, redacted to three books according to an epigram prefixed to the first book, is thought to have been published –3 BC. Between the publications of the two editions of the &quot;Amores&quot; can be dated the premiere of his tragedy &quot;Medea&quot;, which was admired in antiquity but is no longer extant.

Ovid&#x27;s next poem, the &quot;Medicamina Faciei&quot; (a fragmentary work on women&#x27;s beauty treatments), preceded the (the &quot;Art of Love&quot;), a parody of didactic poetry and a three-book manual about seduction and intrigue, which has been dated to AD 2 (Books 1–2 would go back to 1 BC). Ovid may identify this work in his exile poetry as the &quot;carmen&quot;, or song, which was one cause of his banishment. The was followed by the &quot;Remedia Amoris&quot; in the same year. This corpus of elegiac, erotic poetry earned Ovid a place among the chief Roman elegists Gallus, Tibullus, and Propertius, of whom he saw himself as the fourth member.

By AD 8, Ovid had completed &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, a hexameter epic poem in 15 books, which comprehensively catalogs the metamorphoses in Greek and Roman mythology, from the emergence of the cosmos to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar. The stories follow each other in the telling of human beings transformed to new bodies: trees, rocks, animals, flowers, constellations, etc. Simultaneously, he worked on the &quot;Fasti&quot;, a six-book poem in elegiac couplets on the theme of the calendar of Roman festivals and astronomy. The composition of this poem was interrupted by Ovid&#x27;s exile, and it is thought that Ovid abandoned work on the piece in Tomis. It is probably in this period that the double letters (16–21) in the &quot;Heroides&quot; were composed, although there is some contention over their authorship.

===Exile to Tomis===

In AD 8, Ovid was banished to Tomis, on the Black Sea, by the exclusive intervention of the Emperor Augustus without any participation of the Senate or of any Roman judge. This event shaped all his following poetry. Ovid wrote that the reason for his exile was &quot;carmen et error&quot; – &quot;a poem and a mistake&quot;, claiming that his crime was worse than murder, more harmful than poetry.

The Emperor&#x27;s grandchildren, Julia the Younger and Agrippa Postumus (the latter adopted by him), were also banished around the same time. Julia&#x27;s husband, Lucius Aemilius Paullus, was put to death for a conspiracy against Augustus, a conspiracy of which Ovid potentially knew.

The Julian marriage laws of 18 BC, which promoted monogamous marriage to increase the population&#x27;s birth rate, were fresh in the Roman mind. Ovid&#x27;s writing in the concerned the serious crime of adultery. He may have been banished for these works, which appeared subversive to the emperor&#x27;s moral legislation. However, in view of the long time that elapsed between the publication of this work (1 BC) and the exile (AD 8), some authors suggest that Augustus used the poem as a mere justification for something more personal.
In exile, Ovid wrote two poetry collections, &quot;Tristia&quot; and &quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot;, which illustrated his sadness and desolation. Being far from Rome, he had no access to libraries, and thus might have been forced to abandon his &quot;Fasti&quot;, a poem about the Roman calendar, of which only the first six books exist – January through June. He learned Sarmatian and Getic.

The five books of the elegiac &quot;Tristia&quot;, a series of poems expressing the poet&#x27;s despair in exile and advocating his return to Rome, are dated to AD 9–12. The &quot;Ibis&quot;, an elegiac curse poem attacking an unnamed adversary, may also be dated to this period. The &quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot;, a series of letters to friends in Rome asking them to effect his return, are thought to be his last compositions, with the first three books published in AD 13 and the fourth book between AD 14 and 16. The exile poetry is particularly emotive and personal. In the &quot;Epistulae&quot; he claims friendship with the natives of Tomis (in the &quot;Tristia&quot; they are frightening barbarians) and to have written a poem in their language (&quot;Ex Ponto&quot;, 4.13.19–20).

Yet he pined for Rome – and for his third wife, addressing many poems to her. Some are also to the Emperor Augustus, yet others are to himself, to friends in Rome, and sometimes to the poems themselves, expressing loneliness and hope of recall from banishment or exile.

The obscure causes of Ovid&#x27;s exile have given rise to much speculation by scholars. The medieval texts that mention the exile offer no credible explanations: their statements seem incorrect interpretations drawn from the works of Ovid. Ovid himself wrote many references to his offense, giving obscure or contradictory clues.

In 1923, scholar J. J. Hartman proposed a theory that is little considered among scholars of Latin civilization today: that Ovid was never exiled from Rome and that all of his exile works are the result of his fertile imagination. This theory was supported and rejected in the 1930s, especially by Dutch authors.

In 1985, a research paper by Fitton Brown advanced new arguments in support of Hartman&#x27;s theory. Brown&#x27;s article was followed by a series of supports and refutations in the short space of five years. Among the supporting reasons Brown presents are: Ovid&#x27;s exile is only mentioned by his own work, except in &quot;dubious&quot; passages by Pliny the Elder and Statius, but no other author until the 4th century; that the author of &quot;Heroides&quot; was able to separate the poetic &quot;I&quot; of his own and real life; and that information on the geography of Tomis was already known by Virgil, by Herodotus and by Ovid himself in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

Most scholars, however, oppose these hypotheses. One of the main arguments of these scholars is that Ovid would not let his &quot;Fasti&quot; remain unfinished, mainly because this poem meant his consecration as an imperial poet.

===Death===
Ovid died at Tomis in AD 17 or 18. It is thought that the &quot;Fasti&quot;, which he spent time revising, were published posthumously.

==Works==

===&quot;Heroides&quot; (&quot;The Heroines&quot;)===


The &quot;Heroides&quot; (&quot;Heroines&quot;) or &quot;Epistulae Heroidum&quot; are a collection of twenty-one poems in elegiac couplets. The &quot;Heroides&quot; take the form of letters addressed by famous mythological characters to their partners expressing their emotions at being separated from them, pleas for their return, and allusions to their future actions within their own mythology. The authenticity of the collection, partially or as a whole, has been questioned, although most scholars would consider the letters mentioned specifically in Ovid&#x27;s description of the work at &quot;Am.&quot; 2.18.19–26 as safe from objection. The collection comprises a new type of generic composition without parallel in earlier literature.

The first fourteen letters are thought to comprise the first published collection and are written by the heroines Penelope, Phyllis, Briseis, Phaedra, Oenone, Hypsipyle, Dido, Hermione, Deianeira, Ariadne, Canace, Medea, Laodamia, and Hypermnestra to their absent male lovers. Letter 15, from the historical Sappho to Phaon, seems spurious (although referred to in &quot;Am.&quot; 2.18) because of its length, its lack of integration in the mythological theme, and its absence from Medieval manuscripts. The final letters (16–21) are paired compositions comprising a letter to a lover and a reply. Paris and Helen, Hero and Leander, and Acontius and Cydippe are the addressees of the paired letters. These are considered a later addition to the corpus because they are never mentioned by Ovid and may or may not be spurious.

The &quot;Heroides&quot; markedly reveal the influence of rhetorical declamation and may derive from Ovid&#x27;s interest in rhetorical &quot;suasoriae&quot;, persuasive speeches, and &quot;ethopoeia&quot;, the practice of speaking in another character. They also play with generic conventions; most of the letters seem to refer to works in which these characters were significant, such as the &quot;Aeneid&quot; in the case of Dido and Catullus 64 for Ariadne, and transfer characters from the genres of epic and tragedy to the elegiac genre of the &quot;Heroides&quot;. The letters have been admired for their deep psychological portrayals of mythical characters, their rhetoric, and their unique attitude to the classical tradition of mythology. They also contribute significantly to conversations on how gender and identity were constructed in Augustan Rome.

A popular quote from the Heroides anticipates Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;the end justifies the means&quot;. Ovid had written &quot;Exitus acta probat&quot; – the result justifies the means.

===&quot;Amores&quot; (&quot;The Loves&quot;)===
The &quot;Amores&quot; is a collection in three books of love poetry in elegiac meter, following the conventions of the elegiac genre developed by Tibullus and Propertius. Elegy originates with Propertius and Tibullus, but Ovid is an innovator in the genre. Ovid changes the leader of his elegies from the poet, to Amor (Love or Cupid). This switch in focus from the triumphs of the poet, to the triumphs of love over people is the first of its kind for this genre of poetry. This Ovidian innovation can be summarized as the use of love as a metaphor for poetry. The books describe the many aspects of love and focus on the poet&#x27;s relationship with a mistress called Corinna. Within the various poems, several describe events in the relationship, thus presenting the reader with some vignettes and a loose narrative.

Book 1 contains 15 poems. The first tells of Ovid&#x27;s intention to write epic poetry, which is thwarted when Cupid steals a metrical foot from him, changing his work into love elegy.
Poem 4 is didactic and describes principles that Ovid would develop in the . The fifth poem, describing a noon tryst, introduces Corinna by name. Poems 8 and 9 deal with Corinna selling her love for gifts, while 11 and 12 describe the poet&#x27;s failed attempt to arrange a meeting. Poem 14 discusses Corinna&#x27;s disastrous experiment in dyeing her hair and 15 stresses the immortality of Ovid and love poets.

The second book has 19 pieces; the opening poem tells of Ovid&#x27;s abandonment of a Gigantomachy in favor of elegy. Poems 2 and 3 are entreaties to a guardian to let the poet see Corinna, poem 6 is a lament for Corinna&#x27;s dead parrot; poems 7 and 8 deal with Ovid&#x27;s affair with Corinna&#x27;s servant and her discovery of it, and 11 and 12 try to prevent Corinna from going on vacation. Poem 13 is a prayer to Isis for Corinna&#x27;s illness, 14 a poem against abortion, and 19 a warning to unwary husbands.

Book 3 has 15 poems. The opening piece depicts personified Tragedy and Elegy fighting over Ovid. Poem 2 describes a visit to the races, 3 and 8 focus on Corinna&#x27;s interest in other men, 10 is a complaint to Ceres because of her festival that requires abstinence, 13 is a poem on a festival of Juno, and 9 a lament for Tibullus. In poem 11 Ovid decides not to love Corinna any longer and regrets the poems he has written about her. The final poem is Ovid&#x27;s farewell to the erotic muse. Critics have seen the poems as highly self-conscious and extremely playful specimens of the elegiac genre.

===&quot;Medicamina Faciei Femineae&quot; (&quot;Women&#x27;s Facial Cosmetics&quot;)===
About a hundred elegiac lines survive from this poem on beauty treatments for women&#x27;s faces, which seems to parody serious didactic poetry. The poem says that women should concern themselves first with manners and then prescribes several compounds for facial treatments before breaking off. The style is not unlike the shorter Hellenistic didactic works of Nicander and Aratus.

===&quot;Ars Amatoria&quot; (&quot;The Art of Love&quot;)===

&lt;poem&gt;
 Si quis in hoc artem populo non novit amandi,
 hoc legat et lecto carmine doctus amet.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The &quot;Ars Amatoria&quot; is a didactic elegiac poem in three books that sets out to teach the arts of seduction and love. The first book addresses men and teaches them how to seduce women, the second, also to men, teaches how to keep a lover. The third addresses women and teaches seduction techniques. The first book opens with an invocation to Venus, in which Ovid establishes himself as a &quot;praeceptor amoris&quot; (1.17) – a teacher of love. Ovid describes the places one can go to find a lover, like the theater, a triumph, which he thoroughly describes, or arena – and ways to get the girl to take notice, including seducing her covertly at a banquet. Choosing the right time is significant, as is getting into her associates&#x27; confidence.

Ovid emphasizes care of the body for the lover. Mythological digressions include a piece on the Rape of the Sabine women, Pasiphaë, and Ariadne. Book 2 invokes Apollo and begins with a telling of the story of Icarus. Ovid advises men to avoid giving too many gifts, keep up their appearance, hide affairs, compliment their lovers, and ingratiate themselves with slaves to stay on their lover&#x27;s good side. The care of Venus for procreation is described as is Apollo&#x27;s aid in keeping a lover; Ovid then digresses on the story of Vulcan&#x27;s trap for Venus and Mars. The book ends with Ovid asking his &quot;students&quot; to spread his fame. Book 3 opens with a vindication of women&#x27;s abilities and Ovid&#x27;s resolution to arm women against his teaching in the first two books. Ovid gives women detailed instructions on appearance telling them to avoid too many adornments. He advises women to read elegiac poetry, learn to play games, sleep with people of different ages, flirt, and dissemble. Throughout the book, Ovid playfully interjects, criticizing himself for undoing all his didactic work to men and mythologically digresses on the story of Procris and Cephalus. The book ends with his wish that women will follow his advice and spread his fame saying &quot;Naso magister erat,&quot; &quot;Ovid was our teacher&quot;. (Ovid was known as &quot;Naso&quot; to his contemporaries.)

===&quot;Remedia Amoris&quot; (&quot;The Cure for Love&quot;)===
This elegiac poem proposes a cure for the love Ovid teaches in the &quot;Ars Amatoria&quot;, and is primarily addressed to men. The poem criticizes suicide as a means for escaping love and, invoking Apollo, goes on to tell lovers not to procrastinate and be lazy in dealing with love. Lovers are taught to avoid their partners, not perform magic, see their lover unprepared, take other lovers, and never be jealous. Old letters should be burned and the lover&#x27;s family avoided. The poem throughout presents Ovid as a doctor and utilizes medical imagery. Some have interpreted this poem as the close of Ovid&#x27;s didactic cycle of love poetry and the end of his erotic elegiac project.

===&quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (&quot;Transformations&quot;)===
The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Ovid&#x27;s most ambitious and well-known work, consists of a 15-book catalogue written in dactylic hexameter about transformations in Greek and Roman mythology set within a loose mytho-historical framework. The word &quot;metamorphoses&quot; is of Greek origin and means &quot;transformations&quot;. Appropriately, the characters in this work undergo many different transformations. Within an extent of nearly 12,000 verses, almost 250 different myths are mentioned. Each myth is set outdoors where the mortals are often vulnerable to external influences. The poem stands in the tradition of mythological and etiological catalogue poetry such as Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, Callimachus&#x27; &quot;Aetia&quot;, Nicander&#x27;s &quot;Heteroeumena&quot;, and Parthenius&#x27; &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

The first book describes the formation of the world, the ages of man, the flood, the story of Daphne&#x27;s rape by Apollo and Io&#x27;s by Jupiter. The second book opens with Phaethon and continues describing the love of Jupiter with Callisto and Europa. The third book focuses on the mythology of Thebes with the stories of Cadmus, Actaeon, and Pentheus. The fourth book focuses on three pairs of lovers: Pyramus and Thisbe, Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, and Perseus and Andromeda. The fifth book focuses on the song of the Muses, which describes the rape of Proserpina. The sixth book is a collection of stories about the rivalry between gods and mortals, beginning with Arachne and ending with Philomela. The seventh book focuses on Medea, as well as Cephalus and Procris. The eighth book focuses on Daedalus&#x27; flight, the Calydonian boar hunt, and the contrast between pious Baucis and Philemon and the wicked Erysichthon. The ninth book focuses on Heracles and the incestuous Byblis. The tenth book focuses on stories of doomed love, such as Orpheus, who sings about Hyacinthus, as well as Pygmalion, Myrrha, and Adonis. The eleventh book compares the marriage of Peleus and Thetis with the love of Ceyx and Alcyone. The twelfth book moves from myth to history describing the exploits of Achilles, the battle of the centaurs, and Iphigeneia. The thirteenth book discusses the contest over Achilles&#x27; arms, and Polyphemus. The fourteenth moves to Italy, describing the journey of Aeneas, Pomona and Vertumnus, and Romulus and Hersilia. The final book opens with a philosophical lecture by Pythagoras and the deification of Caesar. The end of the poem praises Augustus and expresses Ovid&#x27;s belief that his poem has earned him immortality.

In analyzing the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, scholars have focused on Ovid&#x27;s organization of his vast body of material. The ways that stories are linked by geography, themes, or contrasts creates interesting effects and constantly forces the reader to evaluate the connections. Ovid also varies his tone and material from different literary genres; G. B. Conte has called the poem &quot;a sort of gallery of these various literary genres&quot;. In this spirit, Ovid engages creatively with his predecessors, alluding to the full spectrum of classical poetry. Ovid&#x27;s use of Alexandrian epic, or elegiac couplets, shows his fusion of erotic and psychological style with traditional forms of epic.

A concept drawn from the Metamorphoses is the idea of the white lie or pious fraud: &quot;pia mendacia fraude&quot;.

===&quot;Fasti&quot; (&quot;The Festivals&quot;)===
Six books in elegiacs survive of this second ambitious poem that Ovid was working on when he was exiled. The six books cover the first semester of the year, with each book dedicated to a different month of the Roman calendar (January to June). The project seems unprecedented in Roman literature. It seems that Ovid planned to cover the whole year, but was unable to finish because of his exile, although he did revise sections of the work at Tomis, and he claims at &quot;Trist.&quot; 2.549–52 that his work was interrupted after six books. Like the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, the &quot;Fasti&quot; was to be a long poem and emulated etiological poetry by writers like Callimachus and, more recently, Propertius and his fourth book. The poem goes through the Roman calendar, explaining the origins and customs of important Roman festivals, digressing on mythical stories, and giving astronomical and agricultural information appropriate to the season. The poem was probably dedicated to Augustus initially, but perhaps the death of the emperor prompted Ovid to change the dedication to honor Germanicus. Ovid uses direct inquiry of gods and scholarly research to talk about the calendar and regularly calls himself a &quot;vates&quot;, a seer. He also seems to emphasize unsavory, popular traditions of the festivals, imbuing the poem with a popular, plebeian flavor, which some have interpreted as subversive to the Augustan moral legislation. While this poem has always been invaluable to students of Roman religion and culture for the wealth of antiquarian material it preserves, it recently has been seen as one of Ovid&#x27;s finest literary works and a unique contribution to Roman elegiac poetry.

===&quot;Ibis&quot; (&quot;The Ibis&quot;)===
The &quot;Ibis&quot; is an elegiac poem in 644 lines, in which Ovid uses a dazzling array of mythic stories to curse and attack an enemy who is harming him in exile. At the beginning of the poem, Ovid claims that his poetry up to that point had been harmless, but now he is going to use his abilities to hurt his enemy. He cites Callimachus&#x27; &quot;Ibis&quot; as his inspiration and calls all the gods to make his curse effective. Ovid uses mythical exempla to condemn his enemy in the afterlife, cites evil prodigies that attended his birth, and then in the next 300 lines wishes that the torments of mythological characters befall his enemy. The poem ends with a prayer that the gods make his curse effective.

===&quot;Tristia&quot; (&quot;Sorrows&quot;)===
The &quot;Tristia&quot; consist of five books of elegiac poetry composed by Ovid in exile in Tomis.

Book 1 contains 11 poems; the first piece is an address by Ovid to his book about how it should act when it arrives in Rome. Poem 3 describes his final night in Rome, poems 2 and 10 Ovid&#x27;s voyage to Tomis, 8 the betrayal of a friend, and 5 and 6 the loyalty of his friends and wife. In the final poem Ovid apologizes for the quality and tone of his book, a sentiment echoed throughout the collection.

Book 2 consists of one long poem in which Ovid defends himself and his poetry, uses precedents to justify his work, and begs the emperor for forgiveness.

Book 3 has 14 poems focusing on Ovid&#x27;s life in Tomis. The opening poem describes his book&#x27;s arrival in Rome to find Ovid&#x27;s works banned. Poems 10, 12, and 13 focus on the seasons spent in Tomis, 9 on the origins of the place, and 2, 3, and 11 his emotional distress and longing for home. The final poem is again an apology for his work.

The fourth book has ten poems addressed mostly to friends. Poem 1 expresses his love of poetry and the solace it brings; while 2 describes a triumph of Tiberius. Poems 3–5 are to friends, 7 a request for correspondence, and 10 an autobiography.

The final book of the &quot;Tristia&quot; with 14 poems focuses on his wife and friends. Poems 4, 5, 11, and 14 are addressed to his wife, 2 and 3 are prayers to Augustus and Bacchus, 4 and 6 are to friends, 8 to an enemy. Poem 13 asks for letters, while 1 and 12 are apologies to his readers for the quality of his poetry.

===&quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot; (&quot;Letters from the Black Sea&quot;)===
The &quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot; is a collection in four books of further poetry from exile. The &quot;Epistulae&quot; are each addressed to a different friend and focus more desperately than the &quot;Tristia&quot; on securing his recall from exile. The poems mainly deal with requests for friends to speak on his behalf to members of the imperial family, discussions of writing with friends, and descriptions of life in exile. The first book has ten pieces in which Ovid describes the state of his health (10), his hopes, memories, and yearning for Rome (3, 6, 8), and his needs in exile (3). Book 2 contains impassioned requests to Germanicus (1 and 5) and various friends to speak on his behalf at Rome while he describes his despair and life in exile. Book 3 has nine poems in which Ovid addresses his wife (1) and various friends. It includes a telling of the story of Iphigenia in Tauris (2), a poem against criticism (9), and a dream of Cupid (3). Book 4, the final work of Ovid, in 16 poems talks to friends and describes his life as an exile further. Poems 10 and 13 describe Winter and Spring at Tomis, poem 14 is halfhearted praise for Tomis, 7 describes its geography and climate, and 4 and 9 are congratulations on friends for their consulships and requests for help. Poem 12 is addressed to a Tuticanus, whose name, Ovid complains, does not fit into meter. The final poem is addressed to an enemy whom Ovid implores to leave him alone. The last elegiac couplet is translated: &quot;Where&#x27;s the joy in stabbing your steel into my dead flesh?/ There&#x27;s no place left where I can be dealt fresh wounds.&quot;

===Lost works===
One loss, which Ovid himself described, is the first five-book edition of the &quot;Amores&quot;, from which nothing has come down to us. The greatest loss is Ovid&#x27;s only tragedy, &quot;Medea&quot;, from which only a few lines are preserved. Quintilian admired the work a great deal and considered it a prime example of Ovid&#x27;s poetic talent. Lactantius quotes from a lost translation by Ovid of Aratus&#x27; &quot;Phaenomena&quot;, although the poem&#x27;s ascription to Ovid is insecure because it is never mentioned in Ovid&#x27;s other works.
A line from a work entitled &quot;Epigrammata&quot; is cited by Priscian.
Even though it is unlikely, if the last six books of the &quot;Fasti&quot; ever existed, they constitute a great loss. Ovid also mentions some occasional poetry (&quot;Epithalamium&quot;, dirge, even a rendering in Getic) which does not survive. Also lost is the final portion of the &quot;Medicamina&quot;.

==Spurious works==

===&quot;Consolatio ad Liviam&quot; (&quot;Consolation to Livia&quot;)===
The &quot;Consolatio&quot; is a long elegiac poem of consolation to Augustus&#x27; wife Livia on the death of her son Nero Claudius Drusus. The poem opens by advising Livia not to try to hide her sad emotions and contrasts Drusus&#x27; military virtue with his death. Drusus&#x27; funeral and the tributes of the imperial family are described as are his final moments and Livia&#x27;s lament over the body, which is compared to birds. The laments of the city of Rome as it greets his funeral procession and the gods are mentioned, and Mars from his temple dissuades the Tiber river from quenching the pyre out of grief.

Grief is expressed for his lost military honors, his wife, and his mother. The poet asks Livia to look for consolation in Tiberius. The poem ends with an address by Drusus to Livia assuring him of his fate in Elysium. Although this poem was connected to the &quot;Elegiae in Maecenatem&quot;, it is now thought that they are unconnected. The date of the piece is unknown, but a date in the reign of Tiberius has been suggested because of that emperor&#x27;s prominence in the poem.

===&quot;Halieutica&quot; (&quot;On Fishing&quot;)===
The &quot;Halieutica&quot; is a fragmentary didactic poem in 134 poorly preserved hexameter lines and is considered spurious. The poem begins by describing how every animal possesses the ability to protect itself and how fish use &quot;ars&quot; to help themselves. The ability of dogs and land creatures to protect themselves is described. The poem goes on to list the best places for fishing, and which types of fish to catch. Although Pliny the Elder mentions a &quot;Halieutica&quot; by Ovid, which was composed at Tomis near the end of Ovid&#x27;s life, modern scholars believe Pliny was mistaken in his attribution and that the poem is not genuine.

===&quot;Nux&quot; (&quot;The Walnut Tree&quot;)===
This short poem in 91 elegiac couplets is related to Aesop&#x27;s fable of &quot;The Walnut Tree&quot; that was the subject of human ingratitude. In a monologue asking boys not pelt it with stones to get its fruit, the tree contrasts the formerly fruitful golden age with the present barren time, in which its fruit is violently ripped off and its branches broken. In the course of this, the tree compares itself to several mythological characters, praises the peace that the emperor provides and prays to be destroyed rather than suffer. The poem is considered spurious because it incorporates allusions to Ovid&#x27;s works in an uncharacteristic way, although the piece is thought to be contemporary with Ovid.

===&quot;Somnium&quot; (&quot;The Dream&quot;)===
This poem, traditionally placed at &quot;Amores&quot; 3.5, is considered spurious. The poet describes a dream to an interpreter, saying that he sees while escaping from the heat of noon a white heifer near a bull; when the heifer is pecked by a crow, it leaves the bull for a meadow with other bulls. The interpreter interprets the dream as a love allegory; the bull represents the poet, the heifer a girl, and the crow an old woman. The old woman spurs the girl to leave her lover and find someone else. The poem is known to have circulated independently and its lack of engagement with Tibullan or Propertian elegy argue in favor of its spuriousness; however, the poem does seem to be datable to the early empire.

==Style==
Ovid is traditionally considered the final significant love elegist in the evolution of the genre and one of the most versatile in his handling of the genre&#x27;s conventions. Like the other canonical elegiac poets Ovid takes on a persona in his works that emphasizes subjectivity and personal emotion over traditional militaristic and public goals, a convention that some scholars link to the relative stability provided by the Augustan settlement. However, although Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius may have been inspired in part by personal experience, the validity of &quot;biographical&quot; readings of these poets&#x27; works is a serious point of scholarly contention.

Ovid has been seen as taking on a persona in his poetry that is far more emotionally detached from his mistress and less involved in crafting a unique emotional realism within the text than the other elegists. This attitude, coupled with the lack of testimony that identifies Ovid&#x27;s Corinna with a real person has led scholars to conclude that Corinna was never a real person, and that Ovid&#x27;s relationship with her is an invention for his elegiac project. Some scholars have even interpreted Corinna as a metapoetic symbol for the elegiac genre itself.

Ovid has been considered a highly inventive love elegist who plays with traditional elegiac conventions and elaborates the themes of the genre; Quintilian even calls him a &quot;sportive&quot; elegist. In some poems, he uses traditional conventions in new ways, such as the &quot;paraklausithyron&quot; of &quot;Am.&quot; 1.6, while other poems seem to have no elegiac precedents and appear to be Ovid&#x27;s own generic innovations, such as the poem on Corinna&#x27;s ruined hair (&quot;Am.&quot; 1.14). Ovid has been traditionally seen as far more sexually explicit in his poetry than the other elegists.

His erotic elegy covers a wide spectrum of themes and viewpoints; the &quot;Amores&quot; focus on Ovid&#x27;s relationship with Corinna, the love of mythical characters is the subject of the &quot;Heroides&quot;, and the and the other didactic love poems provide a handbook for relationships and seduction from a (mock-)&quot;scientific&quot; viewpoint. In his treatment of elegy, scholars have traced the influence of rhetorical education in his enumeration, in his effects of surprise, and in his transitional devices.

Some commentators have also noted the influence of Ovid&#x27;s interest in love elegy in his other works, such as the &quot;Fasti,&quot; and have distinguished his &quot;elegiac&quot; style from his &quot;epic&quot; style. Richard Heinze in his famous &quot;Ovids elegische Erzählung&quot; (1919) delineated the distinction between Ovid&#x27;s styles by comparing the &quot;Fasti&quot; and &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; versions of the same legends, such as the treatment of the Ceres–Proserpina story in both poems. Heinze demonstrated that, &quot;whereas in the elegiac poems a sentimental and tender tone prevails, the hexameter narrative is characterized by an emphasis on solemnity and awe...&quot; His general line of argument has been accepted by Brooks Otis, who wrote:

Otis wrote that in the Ovidian poems of love, he &quot;was burlesquing an old theme rather than inventing a new one&quot;. Otis states that the &quot;Heroides&quot; are more serious and, though some of them are &quot;quite different from anything Ovid had done before [...] he is here also treading a very well-worn path&quot; to relate that the motif of females abandoned by or separated from their men was a &quot;stock motif of Hellenistic and neoteric poetry (the classic example for us is, of course, Catullus 66)&quot;.

Otis also states that Phaedra and Medea, Dido and Hermione (also present in the poem) &quot;are clever re-touchings of Euripides and Vergil&quot;. Some scholars, such as Kenney and Clausen, have compared Ovid with Virgil. According to them, Virgil was ambiguous and ambivalent while Ovid was defined and, while Ovid wrote only what he could express, Virgil wrote for the use of language.

==Legacy==

===Criticism===

Ovid&#x27;s works have been interpreted in various ways over the centuries with attitudes that depended on the social, religious and literary contexts of different times. It is known that since his own lifetime, he was already famous and criticized. In the &quot;Remedia Amoris&quot;, Ovid reports criticism from people who considered his books insolent. Ovid responded to this criticism with the following:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Gluttonous Envy, burst: my name&#x27;s well known already
it will be more so, if only my feet travel the road they&#x27;ve started.
But you&#x27;re in too much of a hurry: if I live you&#x27;ll be more than sorry:
many poems, in fact, are forming in my mind.
&lt;/poem&gt;

After such criticism subsided, Ovid became one of the best known and most loved Roman poets during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

Writers in the Middle Ages used his work as a way to read and write about sex and violence without orthodox &quot;scrutiny routinely given to commentaries on the Bible&quot;. In the Middle Ages the voluminous &quot;Ovide moralisé&quot;, a French work that moralizes 15 books of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was composed. This work then influenced Chaucer. Ovid&#x27;s poetry provided inspiration for the Renaissance idea of humanism, and more specifically, for many Renaissance painters and writers.

Likewise, Arthur Golding moralized his own translation of the full 15 books, and published it in 1567. This version was the same version used as a supplement to the original Latin in the Tudor-era grammar schools that influenced such major Renaissance authors as Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare. Many non-English authors were heavily influenced by Ovid&#x27;s works as well. Montaigne, for example, alluded to Ovid several times in his &quot;Essais&quot;, specifically in his comments on &quot;Education of Children&quot; when he says:

 Miguel de Cervantes also used the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; as a platform of inspiration for his prodigious novel &quot;Don Quixote.&quot; Ovid is both praised and criticized by Cervantes in his &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, where he warns against satires that can exile poets, as happened to Ovid.

In the 16th century, some Jesuit schools of Portugal cut several passages from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. While the Jesuits saw his poems as elegant compositions worthy of being presented to students for educational purposes, they also felt his works as a whole might corrupt students. The Jesuits took much of their knowledge of Ovid to the Portuguese colonies. According to (1949), the &quot;ratio studiorum&quot; was in effect in Colonial Brazil during the early 17th century, and in this period Brazilian students read works like the &quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot; to learn Latin grammar.

In the 16th century, Ovid&#x27;s works were criticized in England. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London ordered that a contemporary translation of Ovid&#x27;s love poems be publicly burned in 1599. The Puritans of the following century viewed Ovid as a pagan, thus as an immoral influence. John Dryden composed a famous translation of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; into stopped rhyming couplets during the 17th century, when Ovid was &quot;refashioned [...] in its own image, one kind of Augustanism making over another&quot;.

The Romantic movement of the 19th century, in contrast, considered Ovid and his poems &quot;stuffy, dull, over-formalized and lacking in genuine passion&quot;. Romantics might have preferred his poetry of exile. The picture &quot;Ovid among the Scythians&quot;, painted by Delacroix, portrays the last years of the poet in exile in Scythia, and was seen by Baudelaire, Gautier and Edgar Degas. Baudelaire took the opportunity to write a long essay about the life of an exiled poet like Ovid. This shows that the exile of Ovid had some influence in 19th century Romanticism since it makes connections with its key concepts such as wildness and the misunderstood genius.

The exile poems were once viewed unfavorably in Ovid&#x27;s oeuvre. They have enjoyed a resurgence of scholarly interest in recent years, though critical opinion remains divided on several qualities of the poems, such as their intended audience and whether Ovid was sincere in the &quot;recantation of all that he stood for before&quot;.

In 1992, classical scholar Amy Richlin published an influential article critiquing the prevalence of rape within Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; and there has been renewed focus on sexual assault within Ovid&#x27;s poetry since the #MeToo Movement in 2017. In the 21st-century, there have been several feminist reinterpretations of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; which directly or indirectly criticize his treatment of women in his texts. Ali Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;Girl Meets Boy&quot; (2007), published as part of the Canongate Myth Series, reimagines the lesbian relationship between Iphis and Ianthe in Book 9 of the &quot;Metamorphoses.&quot; Madeleine Miller&#x27;s novella &quot;Galatea&quot; (2013) is a retelling of a passage from Book 10 of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, in which sculptor Pygmalion carves a statue (Galatea) and falls in love with her after she is brought to life by the gods. In &quot;Galatea&quot;, Miller imagines Galatea grappling with her identity as a statue-turned-woman and gives her the space to exhibit her resilience and resistance to her husband&#x27;s oppressive control. In Fiona Benson&#x27;s Forward Prize-winning poetry anthology &quot;Vertigo and Ghost&quot; (2019), the poet experiments with different forms to represent Ovid&#x27;s depictions of the female victims of Zeus&#x27; rape and sexual violence in the &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; including Danäe, Semele, Cyane and Io. Nina MacLaughlin likewise focused on the theme of sexual assault in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; for her collection of short stories, &quot;Wake Siren&quot; (2019).

<doc id="37803" wikidata="Q42934" url="?curid=37803" title="Cubism">
<text>Cubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement begun in Paris that revolutionized painting and the visual arts, and influenced artistic innovations in music, ballet, literature, and architecture. Cubist subjects are analyzed, broken up, and reassembled in an abstract form—instead of depicting objects from a single perspective, the artist depicts the subject from multiple perspectives to represent the subject in a greater context. Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The term &quot;cubism&quot; is broadly associated with a variety of artworks produced in Paris (Montmartre and Montparnasse) or near Paris (Puteaux) during the 1910s and throughout the 1920s.

The movement was pioneered in partnership by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, and joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Juan Gris, and Fernand Léger. One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne&#x27;s paintings was held at the of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 , followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.

In France, offshoots of Cubism developed, including Orphism, abstract art and later Purism. The impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging in the arts and in popular culture. Cubism introduced collage as a modern art form. In France and other countries Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, De Stijl and Art Deco developed in response to Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time or successively, also called multiple perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity, while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso&#x27;s technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements. Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.

==History==
Scholars have divided the history of Cubism into phases. In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as &quot;Analytic Cubism&quot;, a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori, was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, &quot;Synthetic Cubism&quot;, remained vital until around 1919, when the Surrealist movement gained popularity. English art historian Douglas Cooper proposed another scheme, describing three phases of Cubism in his book, &quot;The Cubist Epoch&quot;. According to Cooper there was &quot;Early Cubism&quot;, (from 1906 to 1908) when the movement was initially developed in the studios of Picasso and Braque; the second phase being called &quot;High Cubism&quot;, (from 1909 to 1914) during which time Juan Gris emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and finally Cooper referred to &quot;Late Cubism&quot; (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of Cubism as a radical avant-garde movement. Douglas Cooper&#x27;s restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris (from 1911) and Léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement.

===Proto-Cubism: 1907–1908===

Cubism burgeoned between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso&#x27;s 1907 painting &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot; has often been considered a proto-Cubist work.

In 1908, in his review of Georges Braque&#x27;s exhibition at Kahnweiler&#x27;s gallery, the critic Louis Vauxcelles called Braque a daring man who despises form, &quot;reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes&quot;.

Vauxcelles recounted how Matisse told him at the time, &quot;Braque has just sent in [to the 1908 ] a painting made of little cubes&quot;. The critic Charles Morice relayed Matisse&#x27;s words and spoke of Braque&#x27;s little cubes. The motif of the viaduct at l&#x27;Estaque had inspired Braque to produce three paintings marked by the simplification of form and deconstruction of perspective.

Georges Braque&#x27;s 1908 &quot;Houses at L’Estaque&quot; (and related works) prompted Vauxcelles, in &quot;Gil Blas&quot;, 25 March 1909, to refer to &quot;bizarreries cubiques&quot; (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as &quot;Reservoir at Horta de Ebro&quot;, as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris during the spring of 1911 in a room called &#x27;Salle 41&#x27;; it included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.

By 1911 Picasso was recognized as the inventor of Cubism, while Braque&#x27;s importance and precedence was argued later, with respect to his treatment of space, volume and mass in the L’Estaque landscapes. But &quot;this view of Cubism is associated with a distinctly restrictive definition of which artists are properly to be called Cubists,&quot; wrote the art historian Christopher Green: &quot;Marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1911 [...]&quot;

The assertion that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness of the canvas was made by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler as early as 1920, but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by Clement Greenberg.

Contemporary views of Cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the &quot;Salle 41&quot; Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the &quot;Salle 41&quot; artists, e.g., Francis Picabia; the brothers Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp, who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the Section d&#x27;Or (or the Puteaux Group); the sculptors Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and Ossip Zadkine as well as Jacques Lipchitz and Henri Laurens; and painters such as Louis Marcoussis, Roger de La Fresnaye, František Kupka, Diego Rivera, Léopold Survage, Auguste Herbin, André Lhote, Gino Severini (after 1916), María Blanchard (after 1916), and Georges Valmier (after 1918). More fundamentally, Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper&#x27;s terms were &quot;later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation.&quot;

John Berger identifies the essence of Cubism with the mechanical diagram. &quot;The metaphorical model of Cubism is the diagram: The diagram being a visible symbolic representation of invisible processes, forces, structures. A diagram need not eschew certain aspects of appearance but these too will be treated as signs not as imitations or recreations.&quot;

===Early Cubism: 1909–1914===

There was a distinct difference between Kahnweiler&#x27;s Cubists and the Salon Cubists. Prior to 1914, Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) gained the support of a single committed art dealer in Paris, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy. Picasso worked in Montmartre until 1912, while Braque and Gris remained there until after the First World War. Léger was based in Montparnasse.

In contrast, the Salon Cubists built their reputation primarily by exhibiting regularly at the and the Salon des Indépendants, both major non-academic Salons in Paris. They were inevitably more aware of public response and the need to communicate. Already in 1910 a group began to form which included Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Léger. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier&#x27;s studio near the boulevard du Montparnasse. These soirées often included writers such as Guillaume Apollinaire and André Salmon. Together with other young artists, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color.

Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier as &quot;ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.&quot; At the 1910 , a few months later, Metzinger exhibited his highly fractured &quot;Nu à la cheminée (Nude)&quot;, which was subsequently reproduced in both &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; (1912) and &quot;Les Peintres Cubistes&quot; (1913).

The first public controversy generated by Cubism resulted from Salon showings at the Indépendants during the spring of 1911. This showing by Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, le Fauconnier and Léger brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the first time. Amongst the Cubist works presented, Robert Delaunay exhibited his &quot;Eiffel Tower, Tour Eiffel&quot; (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York).
At the of the same year, in addition to the Indépendants group of &quot;Salle 41&quot;, were exhibited works by André Lhote, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Villon, Roger de La Fresnaye, André Dunoyer de Segonzac and František Kupka. The exhibition was reviewed in the October 8, 1911 issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. This article was published a year after Gelett Burgess&#x27; &quot;The Wild Men of Paris&quot;, and two years prior to the Armory Show, which introduced astonished Americans, accustomed to realistic art, to the experimental styles of the European avant garde, including Fauvism, Cubism, and Futurism. The 1911 &quot;New York Times&quot; article portrayed works by Picasso, Matisse, Derain, Metzinger and others dated before 1909; not exhibited at the 1911 Salon. The article was titled &quot;The &quot;Cubists&quot; Dominate Paris&#x27; Fall Salon&quot; and subtitled &quot;Eccentric School of Painting Increases Its Vogue in the Current Art Exhibition – What Its Followers Attempt to Do.&quot;

Among all the paintings on exhibition at the Paris Fall Salon none is attracting so much attention as the extraordinary productions of the so-called &quot;Cubist&quot; school. In fact, dispatches from Paris suggest these works are easily the main feature of the exhibition. [...]

In spite of the crazy nature of the &quot;Cubist&quot; theories the number of those professing them is fairly respectable. Georges Braque, André Derain, Picasso, Czobel, Othon Friesz, Herbin, Metzinger—these are a few of the names signed to canvases before which Paris has stood and now again stands in blank amazement.

What do they mean? Have those responsible for them taken leave of their senses? Is it art or madness? Who knows?

====Salon des Indépendants====
The subsequent 1912 Salon des Indépendants located in Paris (20 March to 16 May 1912) was marked by the presentation of Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2&quot;, which itself caused a scandal, even amongst the Cubists. It was in fact rejected by the hanging committee, which included his brothers and other Cubists. Although the work was shown in the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or in October 1912 and the 1913 Armory Show in New York, Duchamp never forgave his brothers and former colleagues for censoring his work. Juan Gris, a new addition to the Salon scene, exhibited his &quot;Portrait of Picasso&quot; (Art Institute of Chicago), while Metzinger&#x27;s two showings included &quot;La Femme au Cheval&quot; (&quot;Woman with a horse&quot;, 1911–1912, National Gallery of Denmark). Delaunay&#x27;s monumental &quot;La Ville de Paris&quot; (Musée d&#x27;art moderne de la Ville de Paris) and Léger&#x27;s &quot;La Noce&quot; (&quot;The Wedding&quot;, Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne, Paris), were also exhibited.

====Galeries Dalmau====
In 1912, Galeries Dalmau presented the first declared group exhibition of Cubism worldwide (&quot;Exposició d&#x27;Art Cubista&quot;), with a controversial showing by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Marie Laurencin and Marcel Duchamp (Barcelona, 20 April to 10 May 1912). The Dalmau exhibition comprised 83 works by 26 artists. Jacques Nayral&#x27;s association with Gleizes led him to write the Preface for the Cubist exhibition, which was fully translated and reproduced in the newspaper &quot;La Veu de Catalunya&quot;. Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2&quot; was exhibited for the first time.

Extensive media coverage (in newspapers and magazines) before, during and after the exhibition launched the Galeries Dalmau as a force in the development and propagation of modernism in Europe. While press coverage was extensive, it was not always positive. Articles were published in the newspapers &quot;Esquella de La Torratxa&quot; and &quot;El Noticiero Universal&quot; attacking the Cubists with a series of caricatures laced with derogatory text. Art historian Jaime Brihuega writes of the Dalmau show: &quot;No doubt that the exhibition produced a strong commotion in the public, who welcomed it with a lot of suspicion.

A major development in Cubism occurred in 1912 with Braque&#x27;s and Picasso&#x27;s introduction of collage in the modernist sense. Picasso is credited with creating the first Cubist collage, &quot;Still life With Chair Caning&quot;, in May 1912, while Braque preceded Picasso in the creation of Cubist cardboard sculptures and papiers collés. Papiers collés were often composed of pieces of everyday paper artifacts such as newspaper, table cloth, wallpaper and sheet music, whereas Cubist collages combined disparate materials—in the case of &quot;Still-life With Chair Caning&quot;, freely brushed oil paint and commercially printed oilcloth together on a canvas.

====Salon d&#x27;Automne====
The Cubist contribution to the 1912 Salon d&#x27;Automne created scandal regarding the use of government owned buildings, such as the Grand Palais, to exhibit such artwork. The indignation of the politician Jean Pierre Philippe Lampué made the front page of &quot;Le Journal&quot;, 5 October 1912. The controversy spread to the Municipal Council of Paris, leading to a debate in the Chambre des Députés about the use of public funds to provide the venue for such art. The Cubists were defended by the Socialist deputy, Marcel Sembat.

It was against this background of public anger that Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes wrote &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; (published by Eugène Figuière in 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913). Among the works exhibited were Le Fauconnier&#x27;s vast composition &quot;Les Montagnards attaqués par des ours (Mountaineers Attacked by Bears)&quot; now at Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Joseph Csaky&#x27;s &quot;Deux Femme, Two Women&quot; (a sculpture now lost), in addition to the highly abstract paintings by Kupka, &quot;Amorpha&quot; (The National Gallery, Prague), and Picabia, &quot;La Source (The Spring)&quot; (Museum of Modern Art, New York).

====Abstraction and the ready-made====

The most extreme forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque, who resisted total abstraction. Other Cubists, by contrast, especially František Kupka, and those considered Orphists by Apollinaire (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka&#x27;s two entries at the 1912 Salon d&#x27;Automne, &quot;Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs&quot; and &quot;Amorpha chromatique chaude&quot;, were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled &quot;Simultaneous Windows&quot;, followed by a series entitled &quot;Formes Circulaires&quot;, in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled &quot;Contrasts of Forms&quot;, giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in &quot;Les Peintres cubistes&quot; (1913), writing of a new &quot;pure&quot; painting in which the subject was vacated. But in spite of his use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.

Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was responsible for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The ready-made arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.

====Section d&#x27;Or====
The &quot;Section d&#x27;Or&quot;, also known as &quot;Groupe de Puteaux&quot;, founded by some of the most conspicuous Cubists, was a collective of painters, sculptors and critics associated with Cubism and Orphism, active from 1911 through about 1914, coming to prominence in the wake of their controversial showing at the 1911 Salon des Indépendants. The &quot;Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or&quot; at the &quot;Galerie La Boétie&quot; in Paris, October 1912, was arguably the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition; exposing Cubism to a wide audience. Over 200 works were displayed, and the fact that many of the artists showed artworks representative of their development from 1909 to 1912 gave the exhibition the allure of a Cubist retrospective.

The group seems to have adopted the name Section d&#x27;Or to distinguish themselves from the narrower definition of Cubism developed in parallel by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the Montmartre quarter of Paris, and to show that Cubism, rather than being an isolated art-form, represented the continuation of a grand tradition (indeed, the golden ratio had fascinated Western intellectuals of diverse interests for at least 2,400 years).

The idea of the Section d&#x27;Or originated in the course of conversations between Metzinger, Gleizes and Jacques Villon. The group&#x27;s title was suggested by Villon, after reading a 1910 translation of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Trattato della Pittura&quot; by Joséphin Péladan.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Europeans were discovering African, Polynesian, Micronesian and Native American art. Artists such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those foreign cultures. Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through Gertrude Stein, at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and African tribal masks. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of Greek, Iberian and African art. Picasso&#x27;s paintings of 1907 have been characterized as Protocubism, as notably seen in &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;, the antecedent of Cubism.
Art historian Douglas Cooper says Paul Gauguin and Paul Cézanne &quot;were particularly influential to the formation of Cubism and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907&quot;. Cooper goes on to say: &quot;The &quot;Demoiselles&quot; is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, expressionist element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the &quot;Demoiselles&quot; is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it.&quot;

The most serious objection to regarding the &quot;Demoiselles&quot; as the origin of Cubism, with its evident influence of primitive art, is that &quot;such deductions are unhistorical&quot;, wrote the art historian Daniel Robbins. This familiar explanation &quot;fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso&#x27;s new painting developed.&quot; Between 1905 and 1908, a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, and Russia. The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both Les Nabis and the Symbolists (who also admired Cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. Neo-Impressionist structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of Georges Seurat (e.g., &quot;Parade de Cirque&quot;, &quot;Le Chahut&quot; and &quot;Le Cirque&quot;), was another important influence. There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought.

In addition to Seurat, the roots of cubism are to be found in the two distinct tendencies of Cézanne&#x27;s later work: first his breaking of the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by binocular vision, and second his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones. However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne. They represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.
The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of Guillaume Apollinaire. It came to rely heavily on Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler&#x27;s book &quot;Der Weg zum Kubismus&quot; (published in 1920), which centered on the developments of Picasso, Braque, Léger, and Gris. The terms &quot;analytical&quot; and &quot;synthetic&quot; which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s. Both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify. Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created. &quot;If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque,&quot; wrote Daniel Robbins, &quot;our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists&#x27; works to the rigors of that limited definition.&quot;

The traditional interpretation of &quot;Cubism&quot;, formulated &quot;post facto&quot; as a means of understanding the works of Braque and Picasso, has affected our appreciation of other twentieth-century artists. It is difficult to apply to painters such as Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, whose fundamental differences from traditional Cubism compelled Kahnweiler to question whether to call them Cubists at all. According to Daniel Robbins, &quot;To suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in Cubism is a profound mistake.&quot;

The history of the term &quot;Cubism&quot; usually stresses the fact that Matisse referred to &quot;cubes&quot; in connection with a painting by Braque in 1908, and that the term was published twice by the critic Louis Vauxcelles in a similar context. However, the word &quot;cube&quot; was used in 1906 by another critic, Louis Chassevent, with reference not to Picasso or Braque but rather to Metzinger and Delaunay:

::&quot;M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]&quot;.

The critical use of the word &quot;cube&quot; goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing the work of Henri-Edmond Cross at the Indépendants in &quot;Art et Littérature&quot;, commented that he &quot;uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments.&quot; (Robert Herbert, 1968, p. 221)

The term Cubism did not come into general usage until 1911, mainly with reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, and Léger. In 1911, the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants. The following year, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of Cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d&#x27;Automne in Paris). Clarifying their aims as artists, this work was the first theoretical treatise on Cubism and it still remains the clearest and most intelligible. The result, not solely a collaboration between its two authors, reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in Puteaux and Courbevoie. It mirrored the attitudes of the &quot;artists of Passy&quot;, which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, to whom sections of it were read prior to publication. The concept developed in &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously, i.e., the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image (multiple viewpoints, mobile perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity), is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists.

The 1912 manifesto &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; by Metzinger and Gleizes was followed in 1913 by &quot;Les Peintres Cubistes&quot;, a collection of reflections and commentaries by Guillaume Apollinaire. Apollinaire had been closely involved with Picasso beginning in 1905, and Braque beginning in 1907, but gave as much attention to artists such as Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Picabia, and Duchamp.

The fact that the 1912 exhibition had been curated to show the successive stages through which Cubism had transited, and that &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; had been published for the occasion, indicates the artists&#x27; intention of making their work comprehensible to a wide audience (art critics, art collectors, art dealers and the general public). Undoubtedly, due to the great success of the exhibition, Cubism became avant-garde movement recognized as a genre or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal.

===Crystal Cubism: 1914–1918===
A significant modification of Cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards a strong emphasis on large overlapping geometric planes and flat surface activity. This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector Léonce Rosenberg. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic Maurice Raynal as &#x27;crystal&#x27; Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of World War I—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, the occult, and Henri Bergson&#x27;s concept of duration—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.

Crystal Cubism, and its associative &quot;rappel à l&#x27;ordre&quot;, has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader ideological transformation towards conservatism in both French society and French culture.

===Cubism after 1918===
The most innovative period of Cubism was before 1914. After World War I, with the support given by the dealer Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism returned as a central issue for artists, and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable by the emergence of geometric abstraction and Surrealism in Paris. Many Cubists, including Picasso, Braque, Gris, Léger, Gleizes, Metzinger and Emilio Pettoruti while developing other styles, returned periodically to Cubism, even well after 1925. Cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the American Stuart Davis and the Englishman Ben Nicholson. In France, however, Cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. Léonce Rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by Kahnweiler&#x27;s exile but others including Laurens, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In 1918 Rosenberg presented a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de l’Effort Moderne in Paris. Attempts were made by Louis Vauxcelles to argue that Cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized Cubist show at the 1920 Salon des Indépendants and a revival of the Salon de la Section d’Or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive.

The reemergence of Cubism coincided with the appearance from about 1917 to 1924 of a coherent body of theoretical writing by Pierre Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and, among the artists, by Gris, Léger and Gleizes. The occasional return to classicism—figurative work either exclusively or alongside Cubist work—experienced by many artists during this period (called Neoclassicism) has been linked to the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or Latin image of France during and immediately following the war. Cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards conservatism in both French society and culture. Yet, Cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition. Its theoretical purity made it a gauge against which such diverse tendencies as Realism or Naturalism, Dada, Surrealism and abstraction could be compared.

==== Influence in Asia ====
Japan and China were among the first countries in Asia to be influenced by Cubism. Contact first occurred via European texts translated and published in Japanese art journals in the 1910s. In the 1920s, Japanese and Chinese artists who studied in Paris, for example those enrolled at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, brought back with them both an understanding of modern art movements, including Cubism. Notable works exhibiting Cubist qualities were Tetsugorō Yorozu&#x27;s &quot;Self Portrait with Red Eyes&quot; (1912) and Fang Ganmin&#x27;s &quot;Melody in Autumn&quot; (1934).

==Interpretation==
===Intentions and criticism===

The Cubism of Picasso and Braque had more than a technical or formal significance, and the distinct attitudes and intentions of the Salon Cubists produced different kinds of Cubism, rather than a derivative of their work. &quot;It is by no means clear, in any case,&quot; wrote Christopher Green, &quot;to what extent these other Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, &#x27;passage&#x27; and multiple perspective; they could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of &#x27;true&#x27; Cubism in its early stages, guided above all by their own understanding of Cézanne.&quot; The works exhibited by these Cubists at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézanne-like subjects—the posed model, still-life and landscape—favored by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale modern-life subjects. Aimed at a large public, these works stressed the use of multiple perspective and complex planar faceting for expressive effect while preserving the eloquence of subjects endowed with literary and philosophical connotations.

In &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot; Metzinger and Gleizes explicitly related the sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression to the notion of ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher Henri Bergson according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. The Salon Cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. One of the major theoretical innovations made by the Salon Cubists, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of &quot;simultaneity&quot;, drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, Charles Henry, Maurice Princet, and Henri Bergson. With simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. Linear perspective developed during the Renaissance was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.

This technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or relative motion) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Nu à la cheminée&quot;, exhibited at the 1910 Salon d&#x27;Automne; Gleizes&#x27; monumental &quot;Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)&quot;, exhibited at the 1912 Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or; Le Fauconnier&#x27;s &quot;Abundance&quot; shown at the Indépendants of 1911; and Delaunay&#x27;s &quot;City of Paris&quot;, exhibited at the Indépendants in 1912. These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding&quot;, also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force. The conjunction of such subject matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early Futurist paintings by Umberto Boccioni, Gino Severini and Carlo Carrà; themselves made in response to early Cubism.

Cubism and modern European art was introduced into the United States at the now legendary 1913 Armory Show in New York City, which then traveled to Chicago and Boston. In the Armory show Pablo Picasso exhibited &quot;La Femme au pot de moutarde&quot; (1910), the sculpture &quot;Head of a Woman (Fernande)&quot; (1909–10), &quot;Les Arbres&quot; (1907) amongst other cubist works. Jacques Villon exhibited seven important and large drypoints, while his brother Marcel Duchamp shocked the American public with his painting &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2&quot; (1912). Francis Picabia exhibited his abstractions &quot;La Danse à la source&quot; and &quot;La Procession, Seville&quot; (both of 1912). Albert Gleizes exhibited &quot;La Femme aux phlox&quot; (1910) and &quot;L&#x27;Homme au balcon&quot; (1912), two highly stylized and faceted cubist works. Georges Braque, Fernand Léger, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Roger de La Fresnaye and Alexander Archipenko also contributed examples of their cubist works.

==Cubist sculpture==


Just as in painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne&#x27;s reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones). And just as in painting, it became a pervasive influence and contributed fundamentally to Constructivism and Futurism.

Cubist sculpture developed in parallel to Cubist painting. During the autumn of 1909 Picasso sculpted &quot;Head of a Woman (Fernande)&quot; with positive features depicted by negative space and vice versa. According to Douglas Cooper: &quot;The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso&#x27;s impressive &quot;Woman&#x27;s Head&quot;, modeled in 1909–10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time.&quot; These positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by Alexander Archipenko in 1912–13, for example in &quot;Woman Walking&quot;. Joseph Csaky, after Archipenko, was the first sculptor in Paris to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onwards. They were followed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and then in 1914 by Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens and Ossip Zadkine.

Indeed, Cubist construction was as influential as any pictorial Cubist innovation. It was the stimulus behind the proto-Constructivist work of both Naum Gabo and Vladimir Tatlin and thus the starting-point for the entire constructive tendency in 20th-century modernist sculpture.

==Architecture==

Cubism formed an important link between early-20th-century art and architecture. The historical, theoretical, and socio-political relationships between avant-garde practices in painting, sculpture and architecture had early ramifications in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia. Though there are many points of intersection between Cubism and architecture, only a few direct links between them can be drawn. Most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics: faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity.

Architectural interest in Cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes, juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective. Diverse elements could be superimposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. Cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 (&quot;La Maison Cubiste&quot;, by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and André Mare) onwards, developing in parallel with architects such as Peter Behrens and Walter Gropius, with the simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass.
Cubism was relevant to an architecture seeking a style that needed not refer to the past. Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of &quot;a profound reorientation towards a changed world&quot;. The Cubo-Futurist ideas of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. The influential De Stijl movement embraced the aesthetic principles of Neo-plasticism developed by Piet Mondrian under the influence of Cubism in Paris. De Stijl was also linked by Gino Severini to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of Purism, Amédée Ozenfant and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier,) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published &quot;Après le cubisme&quot; in 1918. Le Corbusier&#x27;s ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, Le Corbusier and his cousin Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects.

===La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)===


At the 1912 an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as &quot;Maison Cubiste&quot; (Cubist House), with architecture by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and interior decoration by André Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, written during the assemblage of the &quot;Maison Cubiste&quot;, wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the &quot;antithesis of the picture&quot;. &quot;The true picture&quot; wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, &quot;bears its &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...&quot;.

&quot;La Maison Cubiste&quot; was a fully furnished model house, with a facade, a staircase, wrought iron banisters, and two rooms: a living room—the &quot;Salon Bourgeois&quot;, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (&quot;Woman with a Fan&quot;), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger were hung, and a bedroom. It was an example of &quot;L&#x27;art décoratif&quot;, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the passed through the plaster facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon, to the two furnished rooms. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston, listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled &quot;Facade architectural, plaster&quot; (&quot;Façade architecturale&quot;).

The furnishings, wallpaper, upholstery and carpets of the interior were designed by André Mare, and were early examples of the influence of cubism on what would become Art Deco. They were composed of very brightly colored roses and other floral patterns in stylized geometric forms.

Mare called the living room in which Cubist paintings were hung the &quot;Salon Bourgeois&quot;. Léger described this name as &#x27;perfect&#x27;. In a letter to Mare prior to the exhibition Léger wrote: &quot;Your idea is absolutely splendid for us, really splendid. People will see Cubism in its domestic setting, which is very important.

&quot;Mare&#x27;s ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence&quot;, Christopher Green wrote, &quot;creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare&#x27;s old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye&quot;.

In 1927, Cubists Joseph Csaky, Jacques Lipchitz, Louis Marcoussis, Henri Laurens, the sculptor Gustave Miklos, and others collaborated in the decoration of a Studio House, rue Saint-James, Neuilly-sur-Seine, designed by the architect Paul Ruaud and owned by the French fashion designer Jacques Doucet, also a collector of Post-Impressionist and Cubist paintings (including &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;, which he bought directly from Picasso&#x27;s studio). Laurens designed the fountain, Csaky designed Doucet&#x27;s staircase, Lipchitz made the fireplace mantel, and Marcoussis made a Cubist rug.
===Czech Cubist architecture===
The original Cubist architecture is very rare. Cubism was applied to architecture only in Bohemia (today Czech Republic) and especially in its capital, Prague. Czech architects were the first and only ones to ever design original Cubist buildings. Cubist architecture flourished for the most part between 1910 and 1914, but the Cubist or Cubism-influenced buildings were also built after World War I. After the war, the architectural style called &quot;Rondo-Cubism&quot; was developed in Prague fusing the Cubist architecture with round shapes.
In their theoretical rules, the Cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called diamond cut, or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late Gothic architecture. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. hexagonal windows. Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture.

The leading Cubist architects were Pavel Janák, Josef Gočár, Vlastislav Hofman, Emil Králíček and Josef Chochol. They worked mostly in Prague but also in other Bohemian towns. The best-known Cubist building is the House of the Black Madonna in the Old Town of Prague built in 1912 by Josef Gočár with the only Cubist café in the world, Grand Café Orient. Vlastislav Hofman built the entrance pavilions of Ďáblice Cemetery in 1912–1914, Josef Chochol designed several residential houses under Vyšehrad. A Cubist streetlamp has also been preserved near the Wenceslas Square, designed by Emil Králíček in 1912, who also built the Diamond House in the New Town of Prague around 1913.

==Cubism in other fields==

The influence of Cubism extended to other artistic fields, outside painting and sculpture. In literature, the written works of Gertrude Stein employ repetition and repetitive phrases as building blocks in both passages and whole chapters. Most of Stein&#x27;s important works utilize this technique, including the novel &quot;The Making of Americans&quot; (1906–08). Not only were they the first important patrons of Cubism, Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo were also important influences on Cubism as well. In turn, Picasso was an important influence on Stein&#x27;s writing. In the field of American fiction, William Faulkner&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; can be read as an interaction with the cubist mode. The novel features narratives of the diverse experiences of 15 characters which, when taken together, produce a single cohesive body.

The poets generally associated with Cubism are Guillaume Apollinaire, Blaise Cendrars, Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, André Salmon and Pierre Reverdy. As American poet Kenneth Rexroth explains, Cubism in poetry &quot;is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada.&quot; Nonetheless, the Cubist poets&#x27; influence on both Cubism and the later movements of Dada and Surrealism was profound; Louis Aragon, founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was &quot;our immediate elder, the exemplary poet.&quot; Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets John Ashbery and Ron Padgett have recently produced new translations of Reverdy&#x27;s work. Wallace Stevens&#x27; &quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird&quot; is also said to demonstrate how cubism&#x27;s multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry. Ballet’s first cubist sets and costumes were designed by Picasso in 1917 for Sergei Diaghilev’s &quot;Parade&quot;. This preceded six more ballets in which Picasso &quot;left a mark on the ballet world, influencing generations of designers and choreographers&quot;. Braque followed suit with four ballets of his own commencing in 1924 Diaghliev’s &quot;Les Fâcheux&quot;. Gris as well designed sets and costumes for Diaghilev’s Ballet Russes. Artists such as the prolific poster designers A.M. Cassandre and Edward McKnight Kauffer popularized Cubism in the fields of commercial graphic design and typography. Paul Poiret and Callot Soeurs were among the couturiers that brought cubist elements—such as overlapping layers and flat planes that obscure the volumes of the body—into the world of fashion design.

John Berger said: &quot;It is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of Cubism. It was a revolution in the visual arts as great as that which took place in the early Renaissance. Its effects on later art, on film, and on architecture are already so numerous that we hardly notice them.&quot;

<text>Colin Macmillan Turnbull (23 November 1924 – 28 July 1994) was a British-American anthropologist who came to public attention with the popular books &quot;The Forest People&quot; (on the Mbuti Pygmies of Zaire) and &quot;The Mountain People&quot; (on the Ik people of Uganda), and one of the first anthropologists to work in the field of ethnomusicology.

==Early life==
Turnbull was born in London and educated at Westminster School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied politics and philosophy. During World War II he was in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve after which he was awarded a two-year grant in the Department of Indian Religion and Philosophy, Banaras Hindu University, India, from which he graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in Indian Religion and Philosophy.

==Career==
In 1951, after his graduation from Banaras, Turnbull traveled to the Belgian Congo (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) with Newton Beal, a schoolteacher from Ohio he met in India. Turnbull and Beal first studied the Mbuti pygmies during this time, though that was not the goal of the trip.

An &quot;odd job&quot; Turnbull picked up while in Africa at this time was working for the Hollywood producer Sam Spiegel. Spiegel hired Turnbull to assist in the construction and transportation of a boat needed for his film. This boat was the &quot;African Queen&quot;, which was used for the feature film &quot;The African Queen&quot; (starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn; 1951). After his first trip to Africa, Turnbull traveled to Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, where he worked as a geologist and gold miner for a year, before he went back to school to obtain another degree.

Upon returning to Oxford in 1954, Turnbull began specializing in the anthropology of Africa. He remained in Oxford for two years before another field trip to Africa, finally focusing on the Belgian Congo (1957–58) and Uganda. After years of fieldwork, he finally achieved his anthropology doctorate from Oxford in 1964.

Turnbull became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1965, after he moved to New York City to become curator in charge of African Ethnology at the American Museum of Natural History in 1959. He later resided in Lancaster County, and was on staff in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond, Virginia. Other professional associations included corresponding membership of Royal Museum for Central Africa and a fellowship in the British Royal Anthropological Institute. He first gained prominence with his book &quot;The Forest People&quot; (1961), a study of the Mbuti people.

In 1972, having been commissioned to come up with an explanation and solution to the difficulties experienced by the Ik people, he published his controversial ethnography &quot;The Mountain People&quot;. The Ik were a hunter-gatherer tribe who had been forced to stop moving around ancestral lands, through the seasons, because it now involved the three national borders of Uganda, Kenya and Sudan. Forced to become stationary in Uganda, and without a knowledge base and culture for survival under such conditions, they failed to thrive, even to the point of starvation and death. He described the Ik as driven to a radically selfish condition in which they felt no care or responsibility for anyone else, even their children.

&quot;The Mountain People&quot; was later adapted into a theatrical work by playwright Peter Brook.

===Contributions to music===
Some of Turnbull&#x27;s recordings of Mbuti music were commercially released, and his works inspired other ethnomusicological studies, such as those of Simha Arom and Mauro Campagnoli. His recording of &quot;Music of the Rainforest Pygmies&quot;, recorded in 1961, was released on CD by Lyrichord Discs. His recording of a Zaire pygmy girls&#x27; initiation song was used on the Voyager Golden Record.

==Personal life==
Turnbull&#x27;s partner, Joseph Allen Towles, was born in Senora, Virginia, on 17 August 1937. In 1957 he moved to New York City to pursue a career as an actor and writer. He met Turnbull in 1959 and they exchanged marriage vows the following year.

From 1965 to 1967, Turnbull and Towles conducted fieldwork among the Ik of Northern Uganda in Africa. In the Congo in 1970, they conducted fieldwork on the Nkumbi circumcision initiation ritual for boys and the Asa myth of origin among the Mbo of the Ituri forest.

In 1979, they traveled studying the concept of tourism as pilgrimage. Towles criticised Turnbull&#x27;s semi-autobiographical work &quot;The Human Cycle&quot; (1983), which omitted all references to their relationship.

Turnbull arranged for Towles&#x27; research to be published posthumously. It appeared in 1993 as &quot;Nkumbi initiation ritual and structure among the Mbo of Zaïre&quot; and as &quot;Asa: Myth of Origin of the Blood Brotherhood Among the Mbo of the Ituri Forest&quot;, both in &quot;Annales&quot; of the Royal Museum for Central Africa (Tervuren, Belgium), vol. 137.

==Later years==
Late in life Turnbull took up the political cause of death row inmates. After his partner&#x27;s death, Turnbull donated all his belongings to the United Negro College Fund. He donated all their research materials, most of which were the product of his career, to the College of Charleston, insisting that the collection be known under Towles&#x27; name alone.

In 1989, Turnbull moved to Bloomington, Indiana, to participate in the building of Tibetan Cultural Center with his friend Thupten Jigme Norbu, elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama. Later Turnbull moved to Dharamsala, India where he took the monks&#x27; vow of Tibetan Buddhism, given to him by the Dalai Lama. Turnbull&#x27;s partner, Joseph A Towles died of AIDS in 1988, and Turnbull had Towles&#x27;s book &quot;Nkumbi Initiation and Asa: Myth of Origin of the Blood Brotherhood Among the Mbo of the Ituri Forest&quot; published posthumously. Turnbull himself died of AIDS in 1994.

==Controversy==
Some later scholars criticized Turnbull&#x27;s account of the Ik. Bernd Heine, who visited the tribe 20 years after Turnbull, provided new information in a 1985 article that appeared to discredit Turnbull&#x27;s unflattering portrayal. According to a 2021 BBC radio documentary, Turnbull had drawn much of his image of the tribe from interviews with older Ik who contrasted their current situation with their memories of a better life prior to displacement, and therefore exaggerated the tribe&#x27;s social dysfunction in the years Turnbull was present.

<doc id="37808" wikidata="Q12824566" url="?curid=37808" title="Catalase">
<text>Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as bacteria, plants, and animals) which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Catalase has one of the highest turnover numbers of all enzymes; one catalase molecule can convert millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules to water and oxygen each second.

Catalase is a tetramer of four polypeptide chains, each over 500 amino acids long. It contains four iron-containing heme groups that allow the enzyme to react with hydrogen peroxide. The optimum pH for human catalase is approximately 7, and has a fairly broad maximum: the rate of reaction does not change appreciably between pH 6.8 and 7.5. The pH optimum for other catalases varies between 4 and 11 depending on the species. The optimum temperature also varies by species.

== Structure ==
Human catalase forms a tetramer composed of four subunits, each of which can be conceptually divided into four domains. The extensive core of each subunit is generated by an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel (β1-8), with nearest neighbor connectivity capped by β-barrel loops on one side and α9 loops on the other. A helical domain at one face of the β-barrel is composed of four C-terminal helices (α16, α17, α18, and α19) and four helices derived from residues between β4 and β5 (α4, α5, α6, and α7). Alternative splicing may result in different protein variants.

== History ==
Catalase was first noticed in 1818 by Louis Jacques Thénard, who discovered hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Thénard suggested its breakdown was caused by an unknown substance. In 1900, Oscar Loew was the first to give it the name catalase, and found it in many plants and animals. In 1937 catalase from beef liver was crystallized by James B. Sumner and Alexander Dounce and the molecular weight was measured in 1938.

The amino acid sequence of bovine catalase was determined in 1969, and the three-dimensional structure in 1981.

== Function ==

=== Molecular mechanism ===
While the complete mechanism of catalase is not currently known, the reaction is believed to occur in two stages:

: H2O2 + Fe(III)-E → H2O + O=Fe(IV)-E(.+)

: H2O2 + O=Fe(IV)-E(.+) → H2O + Fe(III)-E + O2

Here Fe()-E represents the iron center of the heme group attached to the enzyme. Fe(IV)-E(.+) is a mesomeric form of Fe(V)-E, meaning the iron is not completely oxidized to +V, but receives some stabilising electron density from the heme ligand, which is then shown as a radical cation (.+).

As hydrogen peroxide enters the active site, it does not interact with the amino acids Asn148 (asparagine at position 148) and His75, causing a proton (hydrogen ion) to transfer between the oxygen atoms. The free oxygen atom coordinates, freeing the newly formed water molecule and Fe(IV)=O. Fe(IV)=O reacts with a second hydrogen peroxide molecule to reform Fe(III)-E and produce water and oxygen. The reactivity of the iron center may be improved by the presence of the phenolate ligand of Tyr358 in the fifth coordination position, which can assist in the oxidation of the Fe(III) to Fe(IV). The efficiency of the reaction may also be improved by the interactions of His75 and Asn148 with reaction intermediates. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase proceeds according to first-order kinetics, the rate being proportional to the hydrogen peroxide concentration.

Catalase can also catalyze the oxidation, by hydrogen peroxide, of various metabolites and toxins, including formaldehyde, formic acid, phenols, acetaldehyde and alcohols. It does so according to the following reaction:

: H2O2 + H2R → 2H2O + R

The exact mechanism of this reaction is not known.

Any heavy metal ion (such as copper cations in copper(II) sulfate) can act as a noncompetitive inhibitor of catalase. However, &quot;Copper deficiency can lead to a reduction in catalase activity in tissues, such as heart and liver.&quot; Furthermore, the poison cyanide is a noncompetitive inhibitor of catalase at high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.
Arsenate acts as an activator. Three-dimensional protein structures of the peroxidated catalase intermediates are available at the Protein Data Bank.

=== Cellular role ===
Hydrogen peroxide is a harmful byproduct of many normal metabolic processes; to prevent damage to cells and tissues, it must be quickly converted into other, less dangerous substances. To this end, catalase is frequently used by cells to rapidly catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into less-reactive gaseous oxygen and water molecules.

Mice genetically engineered to lack catalase are initially phenotypically normal. However, catalase deficiency in mice may increase the likelihood of developing obesity, fatty liver, and type 2 diabetes. Some humans have very low levels of catalase (acatalasia), yet show few ill effects.

The increased oxidative stress that occurs with aging in mice is alleviated by over-expression of catalase. Over-expressing mice do not exhibit the age-associated loss of spermatozoa, testicular germ and Sertoli cells seen in wild-type mice. Oxidative stress in wild-type mice ordinarily induces oxidative DNA damage (measured as 8-oxodG) in sperm with aging, but these damages are significantly reduced in aged catalase over-expressing mice. Furthermore, these over-expressing mice show no decrease in age-dependent number of pups per litter. Overexpression of catalase targeted to mitochondria extends the lifespan of mice.

In eukaryotes, catalase is usually located in a cellular organelle called the peroxisome. Peroxisomes in plant cells are involved in photorespiration (the use of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide) and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (the breaking apart of diatomic nitrogen (N2) to reactive nitrogen atoms). Hydrogen peroxide is used as a potent antimicrobial agent when cells are infected with a pathogen. Catalase-positive pathogens, such as &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, and &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot;, make catalase to deactivate the peroxide radicals, thus allowing them to survive unharmed within the host.

Like alcohol dehydrogenase, catalase converts ethanol to acetaldehyde, but it is unlikely that this reaction is physiologically significant.

== Distribution among organisms ==
The large majority of known organisms use catalase in every organ, with particularly high concentrations occurring in the liver in mammals. Catalase is found primarily in peroxisomes and the cytosol of erythrocytes (and sometimes in mitochondria)

Almost all aerobic microorganisms use catalase. It is also present in some anaerobic microorganisms, such as &quot;Methanosarcina barkeri&quot;. Catalase is also universal among plants and occurs in most fungi.

One unique use of catalase occurs in the bombardier beetle. This beetle has two sets of liquids that are stored separately in two paired glands. The larger of the pair, the storage chamber or reservoir, contains hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, while the smaller, the reaction chamber, contains catalases and peroxidases. To activate the noxious spray, the beetle mixes the contents of the two compartments, causing oxygen to be liberated from hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen oxidizes the hydroquinones and also acts as the propellant. The oxidation reaction is very exothermic (ΔH = −202.8 kJ/mol) and rapidly heats the mixture to the boiling point.

Long-lived queens of the termite &quot;Reticulitermes speratus&quot; have significantly lower oxidative damage to their DNA than non-reproductive individuals (workers and soldiers). Queens have more than two times higher catalase activity and seven times higher expression levels of the catalase gene RsCAT1 than workers. It appears that the efficient antioxidant capability of termite queens can partly explain how they attain longer life.

Catalase enzymes from various species have vastly differing optimum temperatures. Poikilothermic animals typically have catalases with optimum temperatures in the range of 15-25 °C, while mammalian or avian catalases might have optimum temperatures above 35 °C, and catalases from plants vary depending on their growth habit. In contrast, catalase isolated from the hyperthermophile archaeon &quot;Pyrobaculum calidifontis&quot; has a temperature optimum of 90 °C.

== Clinical significance and application ==

Catalase is used in the food industry for removing hydrogen peroxide from milk prior to cheese production. Another use is in food wrappers, where it prevents food from oxidizing. Catalase is also used in the textile industry, removing hydrogen peroxide from fabrics to make sure the material is peroxide-free.

A minor use is in contact lens hygiene – a few lens-cleaning products disinfect the lens using a hydrogen peroxide solution; a solution containing catalase is then used to decompose the hydrogen peroxide before the lens is used again.

=== Bacterial identification (catalase test) ===

The catalase test is one of the three main tests used by microbiologists to identify species of bacteria. If the bacteria possess catalase (i.e., are catalase-positive), bubbles of oxygen are observed when a small amount of bacterial isolate is added to hydrogen peroxide. The catalase test is done by placing a drop of hydrogen peroxide on a microscope slide. An applicator stick is touched to the colony, and the tip is then smeared onto the hydrogen peroxide drop.
* If the mixture produces bubbles or froth, the organism is said to be &#x27;catalase-positive&#x27;. Staphylococci and Micrococci are catalase-positive. Other catalase-positive organisms include &quot;Listeria, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Burkholderia cepacia, Nocardia&quot;, the family Enterobacteriaceae (&quot;Citrobacter, E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Shigella, Yersinia, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia&quot;), &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Aspergillus&quot;, &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;, and &quot;Rhodococcus equi&quot;.
* If not, the organism is &#x27;catalase-negative&#x27;. &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Enterococcus&quot; spp. are catalase-negative.

While the catalase test alone cannot identify a particular organism, it can aid identification when combined with other tests such as antibiotic resistance. The presence of catalase in bacterial cells depends on both the growth condition and the medium used to grow the cells.

Capillary tubes may also be used. A small sample of bacteria is collected on the end of the capillary tube, without blocking the tube, to avoid false negative results. The opposite end is then dipped into hydrogen peroxide, which is drawn into the tube through capillary action, and turned upside down, so that the bacterial sample points downwards. The hand holding the tube is then tapped on the bench, moving the hydrogen peroxide down until it touches the bacteria. If bubbles form on contact, this indicates a positive catalase result. This test can detect catalase-positive bacteria at concentrations above about 105 cells/mL, and is simple to use.

=== Bacterial virulence ===
Neutrophils and other phagocytes use peroxide to kill bacteria. The enzyme NADPH oxidase generates superoxide within the phagosome, which is converted via hydrogen peroxide to other oxidising substances like hypochlorous acid which kill phagocytosed pathogens. In individuals with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), phagocytic peroxide production is impaired due to a defective NADPH oxidase system. Normal cellular metabolism will still produce a small amount of peroxide and this peroxide can be used to produce hypochlorous acid to eradicate the bacterial infection. However, if individuals with CGD are infected with catalase-positive bacteria, the bacterial catalase can destroy the excess peroxide before it can be used to produce other oxidising substances. In these individuals the pathogen survives and becomes a chronic infection. This chronic infection is typically surrounded by macrophages in an attempt to isolate the infection. This wall of macrophages surrounding a pathogen is called a granuloma. Many bacteria are catalase positive, but some are better catalase-producers than others. Some catalase-positive bacteria and fungi include: &quot;Nocardia, Pseudomonas, Listeria, Aspergillus, Candida, E. coli, Staphylococcus, Serratia, B. cepacia&quot; and &quot;H. pylori&quot;.

=== Acatalasia ===
Acatalasia is a condition caused by homozygous mutations in CAT, resulting in a lack of catalase. Symptoms are mild and include oral ulcers. A heterozygous CAT mutation results in lower, but still present catalase.

=== Gray hair ===
Low levels of catalase may play a role in the graying process of human hair. Hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced by the body and broken down by catalase. Hydrogen peroxide can accumulate in hair follicles and if catalase levels decline, this buildup can cause oxidative stress and graying. These low levels of catalase are associated with old age. Hydrogen peroxide interferes with the production of melanin, the pigment that gives hair its color.

== Interactions ==
Catalase has been shown to interact with the &quot;ABL2&quot; and &quot;Abl&quot; genes. Infection with the murine leukemia virus causes catalase activity to decline in the lungs, heart and kidneys of mice. Conversely, dietary fish oil increased catalase activity in the heart, and kidneys of mice.

== Methods for determining catalase activity ==
In 1870, Schoenn discovered a formation of yellow color from the interaction of hydrogen peroxide with molybdate; then, from the middle of the 20th century, this reaction began to be used for colorimetric determination of unreacted hydrogen peroxide in the catalase activity assay. The reaction became widely used after publications by Korolyuk et al. (1988) and Goth (1991). The first paper describes serum catalase assay with no buffer in the reaction medium; the latter describes the procedure based on phosphate buffer as a reaction medium. Since phosphate ion reacts with ammonium molybdate, the use of MOPS buffer as a reaction medium is more appropriate.

Direct UV measurement of the decrease in the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is also widely used after the publications by Beers &amp; Sizer and Aebi.

<doc id="37817" wikidata="Q226843" url="?curid=37817" title="Möbius strip">
<text>In mathematics, a Möbius strip, Möbius band, or Möbius loop is a surface that can be formed by attaching the ends of a strip of paper together with a half-twist. As a mathematical object, it was discovered by Johann Benedict Listing and August Ferdinand Möbius in 1858, but it had already appeared in Roman mosaics from the third century CE. The Möbius strip is a non-orientable surface, meaning that within it one cannot consistently distinguish clockwise from counterclockwise turns. Every non-orientable surface contains a Möbius strip.

As an abstract topological space, the Möbius strip can be embedded into three-dimensional Euclidean space in many different ways: a clockwise half-twist is different from a counterclockwise half-twist, and it can also be embedded with odd numbers of twists greater than one, or with a knotted centerline. Any two embeddings with the same knot for the centerline and the same number and direction of twists are topologically equivalent. All of these embeddings have only one side, but when embedded in other spaces, the Möbius strip may have two sides. It has only a single boundary curve.

Several geometric constructions of the Möbius strip provide it with additional structure. It can be swept as a ruled surface by a line segment rotating in a rotating plane, with or without self-crossings. A thin paper strip with its ends joined to form a Möbius strip can bend smoothly as a developable surface or be folded flat; the flattened Möbius strips include the trihexaflexagon. The Sudanese Möbius strip is a minimal surface in a hypersphere, and the Meeks Möbius strip is a self-intersecting minimal surface in ordinary Euclidean space. Both the Sudanese Möbius strip and another self-intersecting Möbius strip, the cross-cap, have a circular boundary. A Möbius strip without its boundary, called an open Möbius strip, can form surfaces of constant curvature. Certain highly symmetric spaces whose points represent lines in the plane have the shape of a Möbius strip.

The many applications of Möbius strips include mechanical belts that wear evenly on both sides, dual-track roller coasters whose carriages alternate between the two tracks, and world maps printed so that antipodes appear opposite each other. Möbius strips appear in molecules and devices with novel electrical and electromechanical properties, and have been used to prove impossibility results in social choice theory. In popular culture, Möbius strips appear in artworks by M. C. Escher, Max Bill, and others, and in the design of the recycling symbol. Many architectural concepts have been inspired by the Möbius strip, including the building design for the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Performers including Harry Blackstone Sr. and Thomas Nelson Downs have based stage magic tricks on the properties of the Möbius strip. The canons of J. S. Bach have been analyzed using Möbius strips. Many works of speculative fiction feature Möbius strips; more generally, a plot structure based on the Möbius strip, of events that repeat with a twist, is common in fiction.

==History==

The discovery of the Möbius strip as a mathematical object is attributed independently to the German mathematicians Johann Benedict Listing and August Ferdinand Möbius in However, it had been known long before, both as a physical object and in artistic depictions; in particular, it can be seen in several Roman mosaics from the In many cases these merely depict coiled ribbons as boundaries. When the number of coils is odd, these ribbons are Möbius strips, but for an even number of coils they are topologically equivalent to untwisted rings. Therefore, whether the ribbon is a Möbius strip may be coincidental, rather than a deliberate choice. In at least one case, a ribbon with different colors on different sides was drawn with an odd number of coils, forcing its artist to make a clumsy fix at the point where the colors did not Another mosaic from the town of Sentinum (depicted) shows the zodiac, held by the god Aion, as a band with only a single twist. There is no clear evidence that the one-sidedness of this visual representation of celestial time was intentional; it could have been chosen merely as a way to make all of the signs of the zodiac appear on the visible side of the strip. Some other ancient depictions of the ourobouros or of figure-eight-shaped decorations are also alleged to depict Möbius strips, but whether they were intended to depict flat strips of any type is 

Independently of the mathematical tradition, machinists have long known that mechanical belts wear half as quickly when they form Möbius strips, because they use the entire surface of the belt rather than only the inner surface of an untwisted belt. Additionally, such a belt may be less prone to curling from side to side. An early written description of this technique dates to 1871, which is after the first mathematical publications regarding the Möbius strip. Much earlier, an image of a chain pump in a work of Ismail al-Jazari from 1206 depicts a Möbius strip configuration for its drive Another use of this surface was made by seamstresses in Paris (at an unspecified date): they initiated novices by requiring them to stitch a Möbius strip as a collar onto a 

==Properties==

The Möbius strip has several curious properties. It is a non-orientable surface: if an asymmetric two-dimensional object slides one time around the strip, it returns to its starting position as its mirror image. In particular, a curved arrow pointing clockwise (↻) would return as an arrow pointing counterclockwise (↺), implying that, within the Möbius strip, it is impossible to consistently define what it means to be clockwise or counterclockwise. It is the simplest non-orientable surface: any other surface is non-orientable if and only if it has a Möbius strip as a Relatedly, when embedded into Euclidean space, the Möbius strip has only one side. A three-dimensional object that slides one time around the surface of the strip is not mirrored, but instead returns to the same point of the strip on what appears locally to be its other side, showing that both positions are really part of a single side. This behavior is different from familiar orientable surfaces in three dimensions such as those modeled by flat sheets of paper, cylindrical drinking straws, or hollow balls, for which one side of the surface is not connected to the other. However, this is a property of its embedding into space rather than an intrinsic property of the Möbius strip itself: there exist other topological spaces in which the Möbius strip can be embedded so that it has two For instance, if the front and back faces of a cube are glued to each other with a left-right mirror reflection, the result is a three-dimensional topological space (the Cartesian product of a Möbius strip with an interval) in which the top and bottom halves of the cube can be separated from each other by a two-sided Möbius In contrast to disks, spheres, and cylinders, for which it is possible to simultaneously embed an uncountable set of disjoint copies into three-dimensional space, only a countable number of Möbius strips can be simultaneously 

A path along the edge of a Möbius strip, traced until it returns to its starting point on the edge, includes all boundary points of the Möbius strip in a single continuous curve. For a Möbius strip formed by gluing and twisting a rectangle, it has twice the length of the centerline of the strip. In this sense, the Möbius strip is different from an untwisted ring and like a circular disk in having only one A Möbius strip in Euclidean space cannot be moved or stretched into its mirror image; it is a chiral object with right- or Möbius strips with odd numbers of half-twists greater than one, or that are knotted before gluing, are distinct as embedded subsets of three-dimensional space, even though they are all equivalent as two-dimensional topological More precisely, two Möbius strips are equivalently embedded in three-dimensional space when their centerlines determine the same knot and they have the same number of twists as each With an even number of twists, however, one obtains a different topological surface, called the 

The Möbius strip can be continuously transformed into its centerline, by making it narrower while fixing the points on the centerline. This transformation is an example of a deformation retraction, and its existence means that the Möbius strip has many of the same properties as its centerline, which is topologically a circle. In particular, its fundamental group is the same as the fundamental group of a circle, an infinite cyclic group. Therefore, paths on the Möbius strip that start and end at the same point can be distinguished topologically (up to homotopy) only by the number of times they loop around the strip.
Cutting a Möbius strip along the centerline with a pair of scissors yields one long strip with four half-twists in it (relative to an untwisted annulus or cylinder) rather than two separate strips. Two of the half-twists come from the fact that this thinner strip goes two times through the half-twist in the original Möbius strip, and the other two come from the way the two halves of the thinner strip wrap around each other. The result is not a Möbius strip, but instead is topologically equivalent to a cylinder. Cutting this double-twisted strip again along its centerline produces two linked double-twisted strips. If, instead, a Möbius strip is cut lengthwise, a third of the way across its width, it produces two linked strips. One of the two is a central, thinner, Möbius strip, while the other has two These interlinked shapes, formed by lengthwise slices of Möbius strips with varying widths, are sometimes called &quot;paradromic&quot; 
The Möbius strip can be cut into six mutually-adjacent regions, showing that maps on the surface of the Möbius strip can sometimes require six colors, in contrast to the four color theorem for the Six colors are always enough. This result is part of the Ringel–Youngs theorem, which states how many colors each topological surface The edges and vertices of these six regions form Tietze&#x27;s graph, which is a dual graph on this surface for the six-vertex complete graph but cannot be drawn without crossings on a plane. Another family of graphs that can be embedded on the Möbius strip, but not on the plane, are the Möbius ladders, the boundaries of subdivisions of the Möbius strip into rectangles meeting These include the utility graph, a six-vertex complete bipartite graph whose embedding into the Möbius strip shows that, unlike in the plane, the three utilities problem can be solved on a transparent Möbius The Euler characteristic of the Möbius strip is zero, meaning that for any subdivision of the strip by vertices and edges into regions, the numbers formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 of vertices, edges, and regions satisfy formula_4. For instance, Tietze&#x27;s graph has formula_5 vertices, formula_6 edges, and formula_7 regions; 

==Constructions==
There are many different ways of defining geometric surfaces with the topology of the Möbius strip, yielding realizations with additional geometric properties.

===Sweeping a line segment===
One way to embed the Möbius strip in three-dimensional Euclidean space is to sweep it out by a line segment rotating in a plane, which in turn rotates around one of its For the swept surface to meet up with itself after a half-twist, the line segment should rotate around its center at half the angular velocity of the plane&#x27;s rotation. This can be described as a parametric surface defined by equations for the Cartesian coordinates of its points,
formula_8
for formula_9 and 
where one parameter formula_10 describes the rotation angle of the plane around its central axis and the other parameter describes the position of a point along the rotating line segment. This produces a Möbius strip of width 1, whose center circle has radius 1, lies in the formula_11-plane and is centered at The same method can produce Möbius strips with any odd number of half-twists, by rotating the segment more quickly in its plane. The rotating segment sweeps out a circular disk in the plane that it rotates within, and the Möbius strip that it generates forms a slice through the solid torus swept out by this disk. Because of the one-sidedness of this slice, the sliced torus remains 

A line or line segment swept in a different motion, rotating in a horizontal plane around the origin as it moves up and down, forms Plücker&#x27;s conoid or cylindroid, an algebraic ruled surface in the form of a self-crossing Möbius It has applications in the design of 

===Polyhedral surfaces and flat foldings===

A strip of paper can form a flattened Möbius strip in the plane by folding it at formula_12 angles so that its center line lies along an equilateral triangle, and attaching the ends. The shortest strip for which this is possible consists of three equilateral triangles, folded at the edges where two triangles meet. Its aspect ratiothe ratio of the strip&#x27;s length to its widthis and the same folding method works for any larger aspect For a strip of nine equilateral triangles, the result is a trihexaflexagon, which can be flexed to reveal different parts of its For strips too short to apply this method directly, one can first &quot;accordion fold&quot; the strip in its wide direction back and forth using an even number of folds. With two folds, for example, a formula_13 strip would become a formula_14 folded strip whose cross section is in the shape of an &#x27;N&#x27; and would remain an &#x27;N&#x27; after a half-twist. The narrower accordion-folded strip can then be folded and joined in the same way that a longer strip 
The Möbius strip can also be embedded as a polyhedral surface in space or flat-folded in the plane, with only five triangular faces sharing five vertices. In this sense, it is simpler than the cylinder, which requires six triangles and six vertices, even when represented more abstractly as a simplicial complex. A five-triangle Möbius strip can be represented most symmetrically by five of the ten equilateral triangles of a four-dimensional regular simplex. This four-dimensional polyhedral Möbius strip is the only &quot;tight&quot; Möbius strip, one that is fully four-dimensional and for which all cuts by hyperplanes separate it into two parts that are topologically equivalent to disks or 

Other polyhedral embeddings of Möbius strips include one with four convex quadrilaterals as faces, another with three non-convex quadrilateral and one using the vertices and center point of a regular octahedron, with a triangular Every abstract triangulation of the projective plane can be embedded into 3D as a polyhedral Möbius strip with a triangular boundary after removing one of its an example is the six-vertex projective plane obtained by adding one vertex to the five-vertex Möbius strip, connected by triangles to each of its boundary However, not every abstract triangulation of the Möbius strip can be represented geometrically, as a polyhedral To be realizable, it is necessary and sufficient that there be no two disjoint non-contractible 3-cycles in the 

===Smoothly embedded rectangles===
A rectangular Möbius strip, made by attaching the ends of a paper rectangle, can be embedded smoothly into three-dimensional space whenever its aspect ratio is greater than the same ratio as for the flat-folded equilateral-triangle version of the Möbius This flat triangular embedding can lift to a smooth embedding in three dimensions, in which the strip lies flat in three parallel planes between three cylindrical rollers, each tangent to two of the Mathematically, a smoothly embedded sheet of paper can be modeled as a developable surface, that can bend but cannot As its aspect ratio decreases toward formula_15, all smooth embeddings seem to approach the same triangular 

The lengthwise folds of an accordion-folded flat Möbius strip prevent it from forming a three-dimensional embedding in which the layers are separated from each other and bend smoothly without crumpling or stretching away from the Instead, unlike in the flat-folded case, there is a lower limit to the aspect ratio of smooth rectangular Möbius strips. Their aspect ratio cannot be less than even if self-intersections are allowed. Self-intersecting smooth Möbius strips exist for any aspect ratio above this Without self-intersections, the aspect ratio must be at 
formula_16
For aspect ratios between this bound it has been an open problem whether smooth embeddings, without self-intersection, In 2023, Richard Schwartz announced a proof that they do not exist, but this result still awaits peer review and publication. If the requirement of smoothness is relaxed to allow continuously differentiable surfaces, the Nash–Kuiper theorem implies that any two opposite edges of any rectangle can be glued to form an embedded Möbius strip, no matter how small the aspect ratio The limiting case, a surface obtained from an infinite strip of the plane between two parallel lines, glued with the opposite orientation to each other, is called the &quot;unbounded Möbius strip&quot; or the real tautological line bundle. Although it has no smooth closed embedding into three-dimensional space, it can be embedded smoothly as a closed subset of four-dimensional Euclidean 

The minimum-energy shape of a smooth Möbius strip glued from a rectangle does not have a known analytic description, but can be calculated numerically, and has been the subject of much study in plate theory since the initial work on this subject in 1930 by Michael Sadowsky. It is also possible to find algebraic surfaces that contain rectangular developable Möbius 

===Making the boundary circular===

The edge, or boundary, of a Möbius strip is topologically equivalent to a circle. In common forms of the Möbius strip, it has a different shape from a circle, but it is unknotted, and therefore the whole strip can be stretched without crossing itself to make the edge perfectly One such example is based on the topology of the Klein bottle, a one-sided surface with no boundary that cannot be embedded into three-dimensional space, but can be immersed (allowing the surface to cross itself in certain restricted ways). A Klein bottle is the surface that results when two Möbius strips are glued together edge-to-edge, andreversing that processa Klein bottle can be sliced along a carefully chosen cut to produce two Möbius For a form of the Klein bottle known as Lawson&#x27;s Klein bottle, the curve along which it is sliced can be made circular, resulting in Möbius strips with circular 

Lawson&#x27;s Klein bottle is a self-crossing minimal surface in the unit hypersphere of 4-dimensional space, the set of points of the form formula_17 for Half of this Klein bottle, the subset with formula_18, gives a Möbius strip embedded in the hypersphere as a minimal surface with a great circle as its This embedding is sometimes called the &quot;Sudanese Möbius strip&quot; after topologists Sue Goodman and Daniel Asimov, who discovered it in the Geometrically Lawson&#x27;s Klein bottle can be constructed by sweeping a great circle through a great-circular motion in the 3-sphere, and the Sudanese Möbius strip is obtained by sweeping a semicircle instead of a circle, or equivalently by slicing the Klein bottle along a circle that is perpendicular to all of the swept Stereographic projection transforms this shape from a three-dimensional spherical space into three-dimensional Euclidean space, preserving the circularity of its The most symmetric projection is obtained by using a projection point that lies on that great circle that runs through the midpoint of each of the semicircles, but produces an unbounded embedding with the projection point removed from its Instead, leaving the Sudanese Möbius strip unprojected, in the 3-sphere, leaves it with an infinite group of symmetries isomorphic to the orthogonal group the group of symmetries of a 
The Sudanese Möbius strip extends on all sides of its boundary circle, unavoidably if the surface is to avoid crossing itself. Another form of the Möbius strip, called the cross-cap or crosscap, also has a circular boundary, but otherwise stays on only one side of the plane of this making it more convenient for attaching onto circular holes in other surfaces. In order to do so, it crosses itself. It can be formed by removing a quadrilateral from the top of a hemisphere, orienting the edges of the quadrilateral in alternating directions, and then gluing opposite pairs of these edges consistently with this The two parts of the surface formed by the two glued pairs of edges cross each other with a pinch point like that of a Whitney umbrella at each end of the crossing the same topological structure seen in Plücker&#x27;s 

===Surfaces of constant curvature===
The open Möbius strip is the relative interior of a standard Möbius strip, formed by omitting the points on its boundary edge. It may be given a Riemannian geometry of constant positive, negative, or zero Gaussian curvature. The cases of negative and zero curvature form geodesically complete surfaces, which means that all geodesics (&quot;straight lines&quot; on the surface) may be extended indefinitely in either direction.

;Zero curvature
:An open strip with zero curvature may be constructed by gluing the opposite sides of a plane strip between two parallel lines, described above as the tautological line The resulting metric makes the open Möbius strip into a (geodesically) complete flat surface (i.e., having zero Gaussian curvature everywhere). This is the unique metric on the Möbius strip, up to uniform scaling, that is both flat and complete. It is the quotient space of a plane by a glide reflection, and (together with the plane, cylinder, torus, and Klein bottle) is one of only five two-dimensional complete 
;Negative curvature
:The open Möbius strip also admits complete metrics of constant negative curvature. One way to see this is to begin with the upper half plane (Poincaré) model of the hyperbolic plane, a geometry of constant curvature whose lines are represented in the model by semicircles that meet the formula_19-axis at right angles. Take the subset of the upper half-plane between any two nested semicircles, and identify the outer semicircle with the left-right reversal of the inner semicircle. The result is topologically a complete and non-compact Möbius strip with constant negative curvature. It is a &quot;nonstandard&quot; complete hyperbolic surface in the sense that it contains a complete hyperbolic half-plane (actually two, on opposite sides of the axis of glide-reflection), and is one of only 13 nonstandard Again, this can be understood as the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by a glide 
;Positive curvature
:A Möbius strip of constant positive curvature cannot be complete, since it is known that the only complete surfaces of constant positive curvature are the sphere and the projective plane. However, in a sense it is only one point away from being a complete surface, as the open Möbius strip is homeomorphic to the once-punctured projective plane, the surface obtained by removing any one point from the projective 

The minimal surfaces are described as having constant zero mean curvature instead of constant Gaussian curvature. The Sudanese Möbius strip was constructed as a minimal surface bounded by a great circle in a 3-sphere, but there is also a unique complete (boundaryless) minimal surface immersed in Euclidean space that has the topology of an open Möbius strip. It is called the Meeks Möbius after its 1982 description by William Hamilton Meeks, III. Although globally unstable as a minimal surface, small patches of it, bounded by non-contractible curves within the surface, can form stable embedded Möbius strips as minimal Both the Meeks Möbius strip, and every higher-dimensional minimal surface with the topology of the Möbius strip, can be constructed using solutions to the Björling problem, which defines a minimal surface uniquely from its boundary curve and tangent planes along this 

===Spaces of lines===
The family of lines in the plane can be given the structure of a smooth space, with each line represented as a point in this space. The resulting space of lines is topologically equivalent to the open Möbius One way to see this is to extend the Euclidean plane to the real projective plane by adding one more line, the line at infinity. By projective duality the space of lines in the projective plane is equivalent to its space of points, the projective plane itself. Removing the line at infinity, to produce the space of Euclidean lines, punctures this space of projective Therefore, the space of Euclidean lines is a punctured projective plane, which is one of the forms of the open Möbius The space of lines in the hyperbolic plane can be parameterized by unordered pairs of distinct points on a circle, the pairs of points at infinity of each line. This space, again, has the topology of an open Möbius 

These spaces of lines are highly symmetric. The symmetries of Euclidean lines include the affine transformations, and the symmetries of hyperbolic lines include the The affine transformations and Möbius transformations both form Lie groups, topological spaces having a compatible algebraic structure describing the composition of Because every line in the plane is symmetric to every other line, the open Möbius strip is a homogeneous space, a space with symmetries that take every point to every other point. Homogeneous spaces of Lie groups are called solvmanifolds, and the Möbius strip can be used as a counterexample, showing that not every solvmanifold is a nilmanifold, and that not every solvmanifold can be factored into a direct product of a compact solvmanifold These symmetries also provide another way to construct the Möbius strip itself, as a &quot;group model&quot; of these Lie groups. A group model consists of a Lie group and a stabilizer subgroup of its action; contracting the cosets of the subgroup to points produces a space with the same topology as the underlying homogenous space. In the case of the symmetries of Euclidean lines, the stabilizer of the consists of all symmetries that take the axis to itself. Each line formula_20 corresponds to a coset, the set of symmetries that map formula_20 to the Therefore, the quotient space, a space that has one point per coset and inherits its topology from the space of symmetries, is the same as the space of lines, and is again an open Möbius 

==Applications==

Beyond the already-discussed applications of Möbius strips to the design of mechanical belts that wear evenly on their entire surface, and of the Plücker conoid to the design of gears, other applications of Möbius strips include:

*Graphene ribbons twisted to form Möbius strips with new electronic characteristics including helical magnetism
*Möbius aromaticity, a property of organic chemicals whose molecular structure forms a cycle, with molecular orbitals aligned along the cycle in the pattern of a Möbius strip
*The Möbius resistor, a strip of conductive material covering the single side of a dielectric Möbius strip, in a way that cancels its own self-inductance
*Resonators with a compact design and a resonant frequency that is half that of identically constructed linear coils
*Polarization patterns in light emerging from a &quot;q&quot;-plate
*A proof of the impossibility of continuous, anonymous, and unanimous two-party aggregation rules in social choice theory
*Möbius loop roller coasters, a form of dual-tracked roller coaster in which the two tracks spiral around each other an odd number of times, so that the carriages return to the other track than the one they started on
*World maps projected onto a Möbius strip with the convenient properties that there are no east–west boundaries, and that the antipode of any point on the map can be found on the other printed side of the surface at the same point of the Möbius strip

Scientists have also studied the energetics of soap films shaped as Möbius strips, the chemical synthesis of molecules with a Möbius strip shape, and the formation of larger nanoscale Möbius strips using DNA origami.

==In popular culture==

Two-dimensional artworks featuring the Möbius strip include an untitled 1947 painting by Corrado Cagli (memorialized in a poem by Charles Olson), and two prints by M. C. Escher: &quot;Möbius Band I&quot; (1961), depicting three folded flatfish biting each others&#x27; tails; and &quot;Möbius Band II&quot; (1963), depicting ants crawling around a lemniscate-shaped Möbius strip. It is also a popular subject of mathematical sculpture, including works by Max Bill (&quot;Endless Ribbon&quot;, 1953), José de Rivera (&quot;Infinity&quot;, 1967), and Sebastián. A trefoil-knotted Möbius strip was used in John Robinson″s &quot;Immortality&quot; (1982). Charles O. Perry&#x27;s &quot;Continuum&quot; (1976) is one of several pieces by Perry exploring variations of the Möbius strip.

Because of their easily recognized form, Möbius strips are a common element of graphic design. The familiar three-arrow logo for recycling, designed in 1970, is based on the smooth triangular form of the Möbius as was the logo for the environmentally-themed Expo &#x27;74. Some variations of the recycling symbol use a different embedding with three half-twists instead of and the original version of the Google Drive logo used a flat-folded three-twist Möbius strip, as have other similar designs. The Brazilian Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) uses a stylized smooth Möbius strip as their logo, and has a matching large sculpture of a Möbius strip on display in their building. The Möbius strip has also featured in the artwork for postage stamps from countries including Brazil, Belgium, the Netherlands, and 
Möbius strips have been a frequent inspiration for the architectural design of buildings and bridges. However, many of these are projects or conceptual designs rather than constructed objects, or stretch their interpretation of the Möbius strip beyond its recognizability as a mathematical form or a functional part of the architecture. An example is the National Library of Kazakhstan, for which a building was planned in the shape of a thickened Möbius strip but refinished with a different design after the original architects pulled out of the project. One notable building incorporating a Möbius strip is the NASCAR Hall of Fame, which is surrounded by a large twisted ribbon of stainless steel acting as a façade and canopy, and evoking the curved shapes of racing tracks. On a smaller scale, &quot;Moebius Chair&quot; (2006) by Pedro Reyes is a courting bench whose base and sides have the form of a Möbius strip. As a form of mathematics and fiber arts, scarves have been knit into Möbius strips since the work of Elizabeth Zimmermann in the early 1980s. In food styling, Möbius strips have been used for slicing bagels, making loops out of bacon, and creating new shapes for pasta.

Although mathematically the Möbius strip and the fourth dimension are both purely spatial concepts, they have often been invoked in speculative fiction as the basis for a time loop into which unwary victims may become trapped. Examples of this trope include Martin Gardner″s &quot;No-Sided Professor&quot; (1946), Armin Joseph Deutsch″s &quot;A Subway Named Mobius&quot; (1950) and the film &quot;Moebius&quot; (1996) based on it. An entire world shaped like a Möbius strip is the setting of Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The Wall of Darkness&quot; (1946), while conventional Möbius strips are used as clever inventions in multiple stories of William Hazlett Upson from the 1940s. Other works of fiction have been analyzed as having a Möbius strip–like structure, in which elements of the plot repeat with a twist; these include Marcel Proust &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; (1913–1927), Luigi Pirandello &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; (1921), Frank Capra″s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), John Barth &quot;Lost in the Funhouse&quot; (1968), Samuel R. Delany″s &quot;Dhalgren&quot; (1975) and the film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001).

One of the musical canons by J. S. Bach, the fifth of 14 canons (BWV 1087) discovered in 1974 in Bach&#x27;s copy of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, features a glide-reflect symmetry in which each voice in the canon repeats, with inverted notes, the same motif from two measures earlier. Because of this symmetry, this canon can be thought of as having its score written on a Möbius strip. In music theory, tones that differ by an octave are generally considered to be equivalent notes, and the space of possible notes forms a circle, the chromatic circle. Because the Möbius strip is the configuration space of two unordered points on a circle, the space of all two-note chords takes the shape of a Möbius strip. This conception, and generalizations to more points, is a significant application of orbifolds to music theory. Modern musical groups taking their name from the Möbius strip include American electronic rock trio Mobius Band and Norwegian progressive rock band Ring Van Möbius.

Möbius strips and their properties have been used in the design of stage magic. One such trick, known as the Afghan bands, uses the fact that the Möbius strip remains in one piece as a single strip when cut lengthwise. It originated in the 1880s, and was very popular in the first half of the twentieth century. Many versions of this trick exist and have been performed by famous illusionists such as Harry Blackstone Sr. and Thomas Nelson Downs.

<doc id="37830" wikidata="Q280602" url="?curid=37830" title="Solid-propellant rocket">
<text>A solid-propellant rocket or solid rocket is a rocket with a rocket engine that uses solid propellants (fuel/oxidizer). The earliest rockets were solid-fuel rockets powered by gunpowder. The inception of gunpowder rockets in warfare can be credited to the ancient Chinese, and in the 13th century, the Mongols played a pivotal role in facilitating their westward adoption.

All rockets used some form of solid or powdered propellant until the 20th century, when liquid-propellant rockets offered more efficient and controllable alternatives. Because of their simplicity and reliability, solid rockets are still used today in military armaments worldwide, model rockets, solid rocket boosters and on larger applications.

Since solid-fuel rockets can remain in storage for an extended period without much propellant degradation, and since they almost always launch reliably, they have been frequently used in military applications such as missiles. The lower performance of solid propellants (as compared to liquids) does not favor their use as primary propulsion in modern medium-to-large launch vehicles customarily used for commercial satellites and major space probes. Solids are, however, frequently used as strap-on boosters to increase payload capacity or as spin-stabilized add-on upper stages when higher-than-normal velocities are required. Solid rockets are used as light launch vehicles for low Earth orbit (LEO) payloads under 2 tons or escape payloads up to .

==Basic concepts==

A simple solid rocket motor consists of a casing, nozzle, grain (propellant charge), and igniter.

The solid grain mass burns in a predictable fashion to produce exhaust gases, the flow of which is described by Taylor–Culick flow. The nozzle dimensions are calculated to maintain a design chamber pressure, while producing thrust from the exhaust gases.

Once ignited, a simple solid rocket motor cannot be shut off, as it contains all the ingredients necessary for combustion within the chamber in which they are burned. More advanced solid rocket motors can be throttled, or extinguished and re-ignited, by control of the nozzle geometry or through the use of vent ports. Further, pulsed rocket motors that burn in segments, and that can be ignited upon command are available.

Modern designs may also include a steerable nozzle for guidance, avionics, recovery hardware (parachutes), self-destruct mechanisms, APUs, controllable tactical motors, controllable divert and attitude control motors, and thermal management materials.
==History==
The medieval Song dynasty Chinese invented a very primitive form of solid-propellant rocket. Illustrations and descriptions in the 14th century Chinese military treatise &quot;Huolongjing&quot; by the Ming dynasty military writer and philosopher Jiao Yu confirm that the Chinese in 1232 used proto solid propellant rockets then known as &quot;fire arrows&quot; to drive back the Mongols during the Mongol siege of Kaifeng. Each arrow took a primitive form of a simple, solid-propellant rocket tube that was filled with gunpowder. One open end allowed the gas to escape and was attached to a long stick that acted as a guidance system for flight direction control.

The first rockets with tubes of cast iron were used by the Kingdom of Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan in the 1750s. These rockets had a reach of targets up to a mile and a half away. These were extremely effective in the Second Anglo-Mysore War that ended in a humiliating defeat for the British East India Company. Word of the success of the Mysore rockets against the British triggered research in England, France, Ireland and elsewhere. When the British finally conquered the fort of Srirangapatana in 1799, hundreds of rockets were shipped off to the Royal Arsenal near London to be reverse-engineered. This led to the first industrial manufacture of military rockets with the Congreve rocket in 1804.

In 1921 the Soviet research and development laboratory Gas Dynamics Laboratory began developing solid-propellant rockets, which resulted in the first launch in 1928, that flew for approximately 1,300 metres. These rockets were used in 1931 for the world&#x27;s first successful use of rockets to assist take-off of aircraft. The research continued from 1933 by the Reactive Scientific Research Institute (RNII) with the development of the RS-82 and RS-132 rockets, including designing several variations for ground-to-air, ground-to-ground, air-to-ground and air-to-air combat. The earliest known use by the Soviet Air Force of aircraft-launched unguided anti-aircraft rockets in combat against heavier-than-air aircraft took place in August 1939, during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. In June 1938, the RNII began developing a multiple rocket launcher based on the RS-132 rocket. In August 1939, the completed product was the BM-13 / Katyusha rocket launcher. Towards the end of 1938 the first significant large scale testing of the rocket launchers took place, 233 rockets of various types were used. A salvo of rockets could completely straddle a target at a range of . By the end of World War II total production of rocket launchers reached about 10,000. with 12 million rockets of the RS type produced for the Soviet armed forces.

In the United States modern castable composite solid rocket motors were invented by the American aerospace engineer Jack Parsons at Caltech in 1942 when he replaced double base propellant with roofing asphalt and potassium perchlorate. This made possible slow-burning rocket motors of adequate size and with sufficient shelf-life for jet-assisted take off applications. Charles Bartley, employed at JPL (Caltech), substituted curable synthetic rubber for the gooey asphalt, creating a flexible but geometrically stable load-bearing propellant grain that bonded securely to the motor casing. This made possible much larger solid rocket motors. Atlantic Research Corporation significantly boosted composite propellant Isp in 1954 by increasing the amount of powdered aluminium in the propellant to as much as 20%.

Solid-propellant rocket technology got its largest boost in technical innovation, size and capability with the various mid-20th century government initiatives to develop increasingly capable military missiles. After initial designs of ballistic missile military technology designed with liquid-propellant rockets in the 1940s and 1950s, both the Soviet Union and the United States embarked on major initiatives to develop solid-propellant local, regional, and intercontinental ballistic missiles, including solid-propellant missiles that could be launched from air or sea. Many other governments also developed these military technologies over the next 50 years.

By the later 1980s and continuing to 2020, these government-developed highly-capable solid rocket technologies have been applied to orbital spaceflight by many government-directed programs, most often as booster rockets to add extra thrust during the early ascent of their primarily liquid rocket launch vehicles. Some designs have had solid rocket upper stages as well. Examples flying in the 2010s include the European Ariane 5, US Atlas V and Space Shuttle, and Japan&#x27;s H-II.

The largest solid rocket motors ever built were Aerojet&#x27;s three monolithic solid motors cast in Florida. Motors 260 SL-1 and SL-2 were in diameter, long, weighed , and had a maximum thrust of . Burn duration was two minutes. The nozzle throat was large enough to walk through standing up. The motor was capable of serving as a 1-to-1 replacement for the 8-engine Saturn I liquid-propellant first stage but was never used as such. Motor 260 SL-3 was of similar length and weight but had a maximum thrust of and a shorter duration.

==Design==
Design begins with the total impulse required, which determines the fuel and oxidizer mass. Grain geometry and chemistry are then chosen to satisfy the required motor characteristics.

The following are chosen or solved simultaneously. The results are exact dimensions for grain, nozzle, and case geometries:
* The grain burns at a predictable rate, given its surface area and chamber pressure.
* The chamber pressure is determined by the nozzle throat diameter and grain burn rate.
* Allowable chamber pressure is a function of casing design.
* The length of burn time is determined by the grain &quot;web thickness&quot;.

The grain may or may not be bonded to the casing. Case-bonded motors are more difficult to design, since the deformation of the case and the grain under flight must be compatible.

Common modes of failure in solid rocket motors include fracture of the grain, failure of case bonding, and air pockets in the grain. All of these produce an instantaneous increase in burn surface area and a corresponding increase in exhaust gas production rate and pressure, which may rupture the casing.

Another failure mode is casing seal failure. Seals are required in casings that have to be opened to load the grain. Once a seal fails, hot gas will erode the escape path and result in failure. This was the cause of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

==Grain geometry==
Solid rocket fuel deflagrates from the surface of exposed propellant in the combustion chamber. In this fashion, the geometry of the propellant inside the rocket motor plays an important role in the overall motor performance. As the surface of the propellant burns, the shape evolves (a subject of study in internal ballistics), most often changing the propellant surface area exposed to the combustion gases. Since,the propellant volume is equal to the cross sectional area formula_1 times the fuel length, the volumetric propellant consumption rate is the cross section area times the linear burn rate formula_2, and the instantaneous mass flow rate of combustion gases generated is equal to the volumetric rate times the fuel density formula_3:

:formula_4

Several geometric configurations are often used depending on the application and desired thrust curve:

* Circular bore: if in BATES configuration, produces progressive-regressive thrust curve.
* End burner: propellant burns from one axial end to other producing steady long burn, though has thermal difficulties, center of gravity (CG) shift.
* C-slot: propellant with large wedge cut out of side (along axial direction), producing fairly long regressive thrust, though has thermal difficulties and asymmetric CG characteristics.
* Moon burner: off-center circular bore produces progressive-regressive long burn, though has slight asymmetric CG characteristics
* Finocyl: usually a 5- or 6-legged star-like shape that can produce very level thrust, with a bit quicker burn than circular bore due to increased surface area.

==Casing==
The casing may be constructed from a range of materials. Cardboard is used for small black powder model motors, whereas aluminium is used for larger composite-fuel hobby motors. Steel was used for the space shuttle boosters. Filament-wound graphite epoxy casings are used for high-performance motors.

The casing must be designed to withstand the pressure and resulting stresses of the rocket motor, possibly at elevated temperature. For design, the casing is considered a pressure vessel.

To protect the casing from corrosive hot gases, a sacrificial thermal liner on the inside of the casing is often implemented, which ablates to prolong the life of the motor casing.

==Nozzle==

A convergent-divergent design accelerates the exhaust gas out of the nozzle to produce thrust. The nozzle must be constructed from a material that can withstand the heat of the combustion gas flow. Often, heat-resistant carbon-based materials are used, such as amorphous graphite or reinforced carbon–carbon.

Some designs include directional control of the exhaust. This can be accomplished by gimballing the nozzle, as in the Space Shuttle SRBs, by the use of jet vanes in the exhaust as in the V-2 rocket, or by liquid injection thrust vectoring (LITV).

LITV consists of injecting a liquid into the exhaust stream after the nozzle throat. The liquid then vaporizes, and in most cases chemically reacts, adding mass flow to one side of the exhaust stream and thus providing a control moment. For example, the Titan IIIC solid boosters injected nitrogen tetroxide for LITV; the tanks can be seen on the sides of the rocket between the main center stage and the boosters.

An early Minuteman first stage used a single motor with four gimballed nozzles to provide pitch, yaw, and roll control.

==Performance==

A typical, well-designed ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP) first-stage motor may have a vacuum specific impulse (&quot;I&quot;) as high as (Titan IVB SRMU). This compares to for RP1/LOX (RD-180) and for LH2/LOX (Block II RS-25) bipropellant engines. Upper stage specific impulses are somewhat greater: as much as for APCP (Orbus 6E), for RP1/LOX (RD-0124) and for LH2/LOX (RL10B-2). 

Propellant fractions are usually somewhat higher for (non-segmented) solid propellant first stages than for upper stages. The Castor 120 first stage has a propellant mass fraction of 92.23% while the Castor 30 upper stage developed for Orbital Science&#x27;s Taurus II COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) (International Space Station resupply) launch vehicle has a 91.3% propellant fraction with 2.9% graphite epoxy motor casing, 2.4% nozzle, igniter and thrust vector actuator, and 3.4% non-motor hardware including such things as payload mount, interstage adapter, cable raceway, instrumentation, etc. Castor 120 and Castor 30 are in diameter, respectively, and serve as stages on the Athena IC and IIC commercial launch vehicles. A four-stage Athena II using Castor 120s as both first and second stages became the first commercially developed launch vehicle to launch a lunar probe (&quot;Lunar Prospector&quot;) in 1998.

Solid rockets can provide high thrust for relatively low cost. For this reason, solids have been used as initial stages in rockets (for example the Space Shuttle), while reserving high specific impulse engines, especially less massive hydrogen-fueled engines, for higher stages. In addition, solid rockets have a long history as the final boost stage for satellites due to their simplicity, reliability, compactness and reasonably high mass fraction. A spin-stabilized solid rocket motor is sometimes added when extra velocity is required, such as for a mission to a comet or the outer solar system, because a spinner does not require a guidance system (on the newly added stage). Thiokol&#x27;s extensive family of mostly titanium-cased &quot;Star&quot; space motors has been widely used, especially on Delta launch vehicles and as spin-stabilized upper stages to launch satellites from the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle. &quot;Star&quot; motors have propellant fractions as high as 94.6% but add-on structures and equipment reduce the operating mass fraction by 2% or more.

Higher performing solid rocket propellants are used in large strategic missiles (as opposed to commercial launch vehicles). HMX, C4H8N4(NO2)4, a nitramine with greater energy than ammonium perchlorate, was used in the propellant of the Peacekeeper ICBM and is the main ingredient in NEPE-75 propellant used in the Trident II D-5 Fleet Ballistic Missile. It is because of explosive hazard that the higher energy military solid propellants containing HMX are not used in commercial launch vehicles except when the LV is an adapted ballistic missile already containing HMX propellant (Minotaur IV and V based on the retired Peacekeeper ICBMs). The Naval Air Weapons Station at China Lake, California, developed a new compound, C6H6N6(NO2)6, called simply CL-20 (China Lake compound #20). Compared to HMX, CL-20 has 14% more energy per mass, 20% more energy per volume, and a higher oxygen-to-fuel ratio. One of the motivations for development of these very high energy density military solid propellants is to achieve mid-course exo-atmospheric ABM capability from missiles small enough to fit in existing ship-based below-deck vertical launch tubes and air-mobile truck-mounted launch tubes. CL-20 propellant compliant with Congress&#x27; 2004 insensitive munitions (IM) law has been demonstrated and may, as its cost comes down, be suitable for use in commercial launch vehicles, with a very significant increase in performance compared with the currently favored APCP solid propellants. With a specific impulse of 309 s already demonstrated by Peacekeeper&#x27;s second stage using HMX propellant, the higher energy of CL-20 propellant can be expected to increase specific impulse to around 320 s in similar ICBM or launch vehicle upper stage applications, without the explosive hazard of HMX.

An attractive attribute for military use is the ability for solid rocket propellant to remain loaded in the rocket for long durations and then be reliably launched at a moment&#x27;s notice.

==Propellant families==
===Black powder (gunpowder) propellant===
Black powder (gunpowder) is composed of charcoal (fuel), potassium nitrate (oxidizer), and sulfur (fuel and catalyst). It is one of the oldest pyrotechnic compositions with application to rocketry. In modern times, black powder finds use in low-power model rockets (such as Estes and Quest rockets), as it is cheap and fairly easy to produce. The fuel grain is typically a mixture of pressed fine powder (into a solid, hard slug), with a burn rate that is highly dependent upon exact composition and operating conditions. The specific impulse of black powder is low, around . The grain is sensitive to fracture and, therefore, catastrophic failure. Black powder does not typically find use in motors above thrust.

===Zinc–sulfur (ZS) propellants===
Composed of powdered zinc metal and powdered sulfur (oxidizer), ZS or &quot;micrograin&quot; is another pressed propellant that does not find any practical application outside specialized amateur rocketry circles due to its poor performance (as most ZS burns outside the combustion chamber) and fast linear burn rates on the order of 2 m/s. ZS is most often employed as a novelty propellant as the rocket accelerates extremely quickly leaving a spectacular large orange fireball behind it.

===&quot;Candy&quot; propellants===
In general, rocket candy propellants are an oxidizer (typically potassium nitrate) and a sugar fuel (typically dextrose, sorbitol, or sucrose) that are cast into shape by gently melting the propellant constituents together and pouring or packing the amorphous colloid into a mold. Candy propellants generate a low-medium specific impulse of roughly and, thus, are used primarily by amateur and experimental rocketeers.

===Double-base (DB) propellants===
DB propellants are composed of two monopropellant fuel components where one typically acts as a high-energy (yet unstable) monopropellant and the other acts as a lower-energy stabilizing (and gelling) monopropellant. In typical circumstances, nitroglycerin is dissolved in a nitrocellulose gel and solidified with additives. DB propellants are implemented in applications where minimal smoke is required yet a medium-high Isp of roughly is required. The addition of metal fuels (such as aluminium) can increase performance to around , though metal oxide nucleation in the exhaust can turn the smoke opaque.

===Composite propellants===
A powdered oxidizer and powdered metal fuel are intimately mixed and immobilized with a rubbery binder (that also acts as a fuel). Composite propellants are often either ammonium-nitrate-based (ANCP) or ammonium-perchlorate-based (APCP). Ammonium nitrate composite propellant often uses magnesium and/or aluminium as fuel and delivers medium performance (Isp of about ) whereas ammonium perchlorate composite propellant often uses aluminium fuel and delivers high performance: vacuum Isp up to with a single-piece nozzle or with a high-area-ratio telescoping nozzle. Aluminium is used as fuel because it has a reasonable specific energy density, a high volumetric energy density, and is difficult to ignite accidentally. Composite propellants are cast, and retain their shape after the rubber binder, such as Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), cross-links (solidifies) with the aid of a curative additive. Because of its high performance, moderate ease of manufacturing, and moderate cost, APCP finds widespread use in space, military, and amateur rockets, whereas cheaper and less efficient ANCP finds use in amateur rocketry and gas generators. Ammonium dinitramide, NH4N(NO2)2, is being considered as a 1-to-1 chlorine-free substitute for ammonium perchlorate in composite propellants. Unlike ammonium nitrate, ADN can be substituted for AP without a loss in motor performance.

Polyurethane-bound aluminium-APCP solid fuel was used in the submarine-launched Polaris missiles. APCP used in the space shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters consisted of ammonium perchlorate (oxidizer, 69.6% by weight), aluminium (fuel, 16%), iron oxide (a catalyst, 0.4%), polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN) polymer (a non-urethane rubber binder that held the mixture together and acted as secondary fuel, 12.04%), and an epoxy curing agent (1.96%). It developed a specific impulse of 242 seconds (2.37 km/s) at sea level or 268 seconds (2.63 km/s) in a vacuum. The 2005-2009 Constellation Program was to use a similar PBAN-bound APCP.

In 2009, a group succeeded in creating a propellant of water and nanoaluminium (ALICE).

===High-energy composite (HEC) propellants===
Typical HEC propellants start with a standard composite propellant mixture (such as APCP) and add a high-energy explosive to the mix. This extra component usually is in the form of small crystals of RDX or HMX, both of which have higher energy than ammonium perchlorate. Despite a modest increase in specific impulse, implementation is limited due to the increased hazards of the high-explosive additives.

===Composite modified double base propellants===
Composite modified double base propellants start with a nitrocellulose/nitroglycerin double base propellant as a binder and add solids (typically ammonium perchlorate (AP) and powdered aluminium) normally used in composite propellants. The ammonium perchlorate makes up the oxygen deficit introduced by using nitrocellulose, improving the overall specific impulse. The aluminium improves specific impulse as well as combustion stability. High performing propellants such as NEPE-75 used to fuel the Trident II D-5 SLBM replace most of the AP with polyethylene glycol-bound HMX, further increasing specific impulse. The mixing of composite and double base propellant ingredients has become so common as to blur the functional definition of double base propellants.

===Minimum-signature (&quot;smokeless&quot;) propellants===
One of the most active areas of solid propellant research is the development of high-energy, minimum-signature propellant using C6H6N6(NO2)6 CL-20 nitroamine (China Lake compound #20), which has 14% higher energy per mass and 20% higher energy density than HMX. The new propellant has been successfully developed and tested in tactical rocket motors. The propellant is non-polluting: acid-free, solid particulates-free, and lead-free. It is also smokeless and has only a faint shock diamond pattern that is visible in the otherwise transparent exhaust. Without the bright flame and dense smoke trail produced by the burning of aluminized propellants, these smokeless propellants all but eliminate the risk of giving away the positions from which the missiles are fired. The new CL-20 propellant is shock-insensitive (hazard class 1.3) as opposed to current HMX smokeless propellants which are highly detonable (hazard class 1.1). CL-20 is considered a major breakthrough in solid rocket propellant technology but has yet to see widespread use because costs remain high.

===Electric solid propellants===
Electric solid propellants (ESPs) are a family of high performance plastisol solid propellants that can be ignited and throttled by the application of electric current. Unlike conventional rocket motor propellants that are difficult to control and extinguish, ESPs can be ignited reliably at precise intervals and durations. It requires no moving parts and the propellant is insensitive to flames or electrical sparks.

==Hobby and amateur rocketry==
Solid propellant rocket motors can be bought for use in model rocketry; they are normally small cylinders of black powder fuel with an integral nozzle and optionally a small charge that is set off when the propellant is exhausted after a time delay. This charge can be used to trigger a camera, or deploy a parachute. Without this charge and delay, the motor may ignite a second stage (black powder only).

In mid- and high-power rocketry, commercially made APCP motors are widely used. They can be designed as either single-use or reloadables. These motors are available in impulse ranges from &quot;A&quot; (1.26 Ns– 2.50 Ns) to &quot;O&quot; (20.48 kNs – 40.96 kNs), from several manufacturers. They are manufactured in standardized diameters and varying lengths depending on required impulse. Standard motor diameters are 13, 18, 24, 29, 38, 54, 75, 98, and 150 millimeters. Different propellant formulations are available to produce different thrust profiles, as well as special effects such as colored flames, smoke trails, or large quantities of sparks (produced by adding titanium sponge to the mix).

==Use==
===Sounding rockets===
Almost all sounding rockets use solid motors.

* Astrobee
* Black Brant
* S-310, S-520
* Skylark (rocket)
* Terrier-Orion, Terrier-Malemute
* VSB-30

===Missiles===
Due to reliability, ease of storage and handling, solid rockets are used on missiles and ICBMs.

* Air-to-air missiles: AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-54 Phoenix, Fakour-90, Meteor, R-33, PL-15
* Ballistic missiles: Jericho, Sejjil, 9K720 Iskander, Fateh-110, ATACMS, DF-21
* ICBMs: LGM-30 Minuteman, UGM-133 Trident II, LGM-118 Peacekeeper, RT-2PM Topol, DF-41, M51 SLBM

===Orbital rockets===
Solid rockets are suitable for launching small payloads to orbital velocities, especially if three or more stages are used. Many of these are based on repurposed ICBMs.

* Scout
* Athena
* Mu
* Pegasus
* Taurus
* Minotaur
* Start-1
* PSLV - alternating solid and liquid stages
* SSLV - all lower 3 stages are solid stages
* SFDR
* Shavit
* Vega
* Long March 11
* OmegA (project was cancelled in 2020, rocket unflown)
* Qaem 100

Larger liquid-fueled orbital rockets often use solid rocket boosters to gain enough initial thrust to launch the fully fueled rocket.
* Delta II
* Titan IV
* Space Shuttle
* Space Launch System
* Ariane 5
* Atlas II
* Atlas V (optionally 1-5 boosters)
* Delta IV (optionally 2 or 4 boosters)
* H-IIA, H-IIB
* PSLV - optional solid boosters to lift heavier payloads
* GSLV Mk III
Solid fuel is also used for some upper stages, particularly the Star 37 (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Burner&quot; upper stage) and the Star 48 (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Payload Assist Module&quot;, or PAM), both manufactured originally by Thiokol, and today by Northrop Grumman. They are used to lift large payloads to intended orbits (such as the Global Positioning System satellites), or smaller payloads to interplanetary—or even interstellar—trajectories. Another solid-fuel upper stage, used by the Space Shuttle and the Titan IV, was the Boeing-manufactured Inertial Upper Stage (IUS).
* &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; were both sent out of the solar system by Star 37E upper stages from Atlas-Centaur rockets.
* &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; were both sent out of the solar system by Star 37E upper stages from Titan IIIE rockets.
* &quot;Magellan&quot; was sent to Venus on an IUS after being deployed from Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-30.
* &quot;Galileo&quot; was sent to Jupiter on an IUS after being deployed from Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-34.
* &quot;Ulysses&quot; was sent to Jupiter on an IUS and a Star 48 PAM after being deployed from Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; on STS-41. It then was placed in a polar orbit around the Sun following a gravity assist around Jupiter.
* &quot;New Horizons&quot; was sent out of the solar system on a Star 48 PAM from an Atlas V rocket.

Some rockets, like the Antares (manufactured by Northrop Grumman), have mandatory solid-fuel upper stages. The Antares rocket uses the Northrop Grumman-manufactured Castor 30 as an upper stage.

<text>A hybrid-propellant rocket is a rocket with a rocket motor that uses rocket propellants in two different phases: one solid and the other either gas or liquid. The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back to the early 1930s.

Hybrid rockets avoid some of the disadvantages of solid rockets like the dangers of propellant handling, while also avoiding some disadvantages of liquid rockets like their mechanical complexity. Because it is difficult for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids. Like liquid rocket engines, hybrid rocket motors can be shut down easily and the thrust is throttleable. The theoretical specific impulse (formula_1) performance of hybrids is generally higher than solid motors and lower than liquid engines. formula_1 as high as 400 s has been measured in a hybrid rocket using metalized fuels. Hybrid systems are more complex than solid ones, but they avoid significant hazards of manufacturing, shipping and handling solid rocket motors by storing the oxidizer and the fuel separately.

==History==
The first work on hybrid rockets was performed in the early 1930s at the Soviet Group for the Study of Reactive Motion. Mikhail Klavdievich Tikhonravov, who would later supervise the design of Sputnik I and the Luna programme, was responsible for the first hybrid propelled rocket launch, the GIRD-9, on 17 August 1933, which reached an altitude of . In the late 1930s at IG Farben in Germany and concurrently at the California Rocket Society in the United States. Leonid Andrussow, working in Germany, theorized hybrid propellant rockets. O. Lutz, W. Noeggerath, and Andrussow tested a hybrid rocket motor using coal and gaseous N2O as the propellants. Oberth also worked on a hybrid rocket motor using LOX as the oxidizer and graphite as the fuel. The high heat of sublimation of carbon prevented these rocket motors from operating efficiently, as it resulted in a negligible burning rate.
In the 1940s, the California Pacific Rocket Society used LOX in combination with several different fuel types, including wood, wax, and rubber. The most successful of these tests was with the rubber fuel, which is still the dominant fuel in use today. In June 1951, a LOX / rubber rocket was flown to an altitude of .

Two major efforts occurred in the 1950s. One of these efforts was by G. Moore and K. Berman at General Electric. The duo used 90% high test peroxide (HTP, or H2O2) and polyethylene (PE) in a rod and tube grain design. They drew several significant conclusions from their work. The fuel grain had uniform burning. Grain cracks did not affect combustion, like it does with solid rocket motors. No hard starts were observed (a hard start is a pressure spike seen close to the time of ignition, typical of liquid rocket engines). The fuel surface acted as a flame holder, which encouraged stable combustion. The oxidizer could be throttled with one valve, and a high oxidizer to fuel ratio helped simplify combustion. The negative observations were low burning rates and that the thermal instability of peroxide was problematic for safety reasons. Another effort that occurred in the 1950s was the development of a reverse hybrid. In a standard hybrid rocket motor, the solid material is the fuel. In a reverse hybrid rocket motor, the oxidizer is solid. William Avery of the Applied Physics Laboratory used jet fuel and ammonium nitrate, selected for their low cost. His O/F ratio was 0.035, which was 200 times smaller than the ratio used by Moore and Berman.

In 1953 Pacific Rocket Society (est. 1943) was developing the XDF-23, a hybrid rocket, designed by Jim Nuding, using LOX and rubber polymer called &quot;Thiokol&quot;. They had already tried other fuels in prior iterations including cotton, paraffin wax and wood. The XDF name itself comes from &quot;experimental Douglas fir&quot; from one of the first units.

In the 1960s, European organizations also began work on hybrid rockets. ONERA, based in France, and Volvo Flygmotor, based in Sweden, developed sounding rockets using hybrid rocket motor technology. The ONERA group focused on a hypergolic rocket motor, using nitric acid and an amine fuel, developing the LEX sounding rocket. The company flew eight rockets: Once in April 1964, three times in June 1965, and four times in 1967. The maximum altitude the flights achieved was over . The Volvo Flygmotor group also used a hypergolic propellant combination. They also used nitric acid for their oxidizer, but used Tagaform (polybutadiene with an aromatic amine) as their fuel. Their flight was in 1969, lofting a payload to .

Meanwhile, in the United States, United Technologies Center (Chemical Systems Division) and Beech Aircraft were working on a supersonic target drone, known as Sandpiper. It used MON-25 (mixed 25% NO, 75% N2O4) as the oxidizer and polymethyl methacrylate (PMM) and Mg for the fuel. The drone flew six times in 1968, for more than 300 seconds and to an altitude greater than . The second iteration of the rocket, known as the HAST, had IRFNA-PB/PMM for its propellants and was throttleable over a 10/1 range. HAST could carry a heavier payload than the Sandpiper. Another iteration, which used the same propellant combination as the HAST, was developed by Chemical Systems Division and Teledyne Aircraft. Development for this program ended in the mid-1980s. Chemical Systems Division also worked on a propellant combination of lithium and FLOx (mixed F2 and O2). This was an efficient hypergolic rocket that was throttleable. The vacuum specific impulse was 380 seconds at 93% combustion efficiency.

American Rocket Company (AMROC) developed the largest hybrid rockets ever created in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The first version of their engine, fired at the Air Force Phillips Laboratory, produced of thrust for 70 seconds with a propellant combination of LOX and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) rubber. The second version of the motor, known as the H-250F, produced more than of thrust.

Korey Kline of Environmental Aeroscience Corporation (eAc) first fired a gaseous oxygen and rubber hybrid in 1982 at Lucerne Dry Lake, CA, after discussions on the technology with Bill Wood, formerly with Westinghouse. The first SpaceShipOne hybrid tests were successfully conducted by Kline and eAc at Mojave, CA.

In 1994, the U.S. Air Force Academy flew a hybrid sounding rocket to an altitude of . The rocket used HTPB and LOX for its propellant, and reached a peak thrust of and had a thrust duration of 16 seconds.

==Basic concepts==
In its simplest form, a hybrid rocket consists of a pressure vessel (tank) containing the liquid oxidizer, the combustion chamber containing the solid propellant, and a mechanical device separating the two. When thrust is desired, a suitable ignition source is introduced in the combustion chamber and the valve is opened. The liquid oxidiser (or gas) flows into the combustion chamber where it is vaporized and then reacted with the solid propellant. Combustion occurs in a boundary layer diffusion flame adjacent to the surface of the solid propellant.

Generally, the liquid propellant is the oxidizer and the solid propellant is the fuel because solid oxidizers are extremely dangerous and lower performing than liquid oxidizers. Furthermore, using a solid fuel such as Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) or paraffin wax allows for the incorporation of high-energy fuel additives such as aluminium, lithium, or metal hydrides.

== Combustion==
The governing equation for hybrid rocket combustion shows that the regression rate is dependent on the oxidizer mass flux rate, which means the rate that the fuel will burn is proportional to the amount of oxidizer flowing through the port. This differs from a solid rocket motor, in which the regression rate is proportional to the chamber pressure of the motor.

:formula_3

:where formula_4 is the regression rate, is the regression rate coefficient (incorporating the grain length), is the oxidizer mass flux rate, and is the regression rate exponent.

As the motor burns, the increase in diameter of the fuel port results in an increased fuel mass flow rate. This phenomenon makes the oxidizer to fuel ratio (O/F) shift during the burn. The increased fuel mass flow rate can be compensated for by also increasing the oxidizer mass flow rate. In addition to the O/F varying as a function of time, it also varies based on the position down the fuel grain. The closer the position is to the top of the fuel grain, the higher the O/F ratio. Since the O/F varies down the port, a point called the stoichiometric point may exist at some point down the grain.

==Properties==
Hybrid rocket motors exhibit some obvious as well as some subtle advantages over liquid-fuel rockets and solid-fuel rockets. A brief summary of some of these is given below:

===Advantages compared with liquid rockets===
* Mechanically simpler – requires only a single liquid propellant resulting in less plumbing, fewer valves, and simpler operations.
* Denser fuel – fuels in the solid phase generally have higher density than those in the liquid phase, reducing overall system volume.
* Metal additives – reactive metals such as aluminium, magnesium, lithium or beryllium can be easily included in the fuel grain increasing specific impulse (formula_1), density, or both.
* Combustion instabilities – Hybrid rockets do not typically exhibit high frequency combustion instabilities that plague liquid rockets due to the solid fuel grain breaking up acoustic waves that would otherwise reflect in an open liquid engine combustion chamber.
* Propellant pressurization – One of the most difficult to design portions of a liquid rocket system are the turbopumps. Turbopump design is complex as it has to precisely and efficiently pump and keep separated two fluids of different properties in precise ratios at very high volumetric flow rates, often cryogenic temperatures, and highly volatile chemicals while combusting those same fluids in order to power itself. Hybrids have far less fluid to move and can often be pressurized by a blow-down system (which would be prohibitively heavy in a liquid rocket) or self-pressurized oxidizers (such as N2O).
* Cooling – Liquid rockets often depend on one of the propellants, typically the fuel, to cool the combustion chamber and nozzle due to the very high heat fluxes and vulnerability of the metal walls to oxidation and stress cracking. Hybrid rockets have combustion chambers that are lined with the solid propellant which shields it from the product gases. Their nozzles are often graphite or coated in ablative materials similarly to solid rocket motors. The design, construction, and testing of liquid cooling flows is complex, making the system more prone to failure.

===Advantages compared with solid rockets===
* Higher theoretical formula_1 – Possible due to limits of known solid oxidizers compared to often used liquid oxidizers.
* Less explosion hazard – Propellant grain is more tolerant of processing errors such as cracks since the burn rate is dependent on oxidizer mass flux rate. Propellant grain cannot be ignited by stray electrical charge and is very insensitive to auto-igniting due to heat. Hybrid rocket motors can be transported to the launch site with the oxidizer and fuel stored separately, improving safety.
* Fewer handling and storage issues – Ingredients in solid rockets are often incompatible chemically and thermally. Repeated changes in temperature can cause distortion of the grain. Antioxidants and coatings are used to keep the grain from breaking down or decomposing.
* More controllable – Stop/restart and throttling are all easily incorporated into most designs. Solid rockets rarely can be shut down easily and almost never have throttling or restart capabilities.

===Disadvantages of hybrid rockets===
Hybrid rockets also exhibit some disadvantages when compared with liquid and solid rockets. These include:

* Oxidizer-to-fuel ratio shift (&quot;O/F shift&quot;) – with a constant oxidizer flow-rate, the ratio of fuel production rate to oxidizer flow rate will change as a grain regresses. This leads to off-peak operation from a chemical performance point of view. However, for a well-designed hybrid, O/F shift has a very small impact on performance because formula_1 is insensitive to O/F shift near the peak.
* Poor regression characteristics often drive multi-port fuel grains. Multi-port fuel grains have poor volumetric efficiency and, often, structural deficiencies. High regression rate liquefying fuels developed in the late 1990s offer a potential solution to this problem.
* Compared with liquid-based propulsion, re-fueling a partially or totally depleted hybrid rocket would present significant challenges, as the solid propellant cannot simply be pumped into a fuel tank. This may or may not be an issue, depending upon how the rocket is planned to be used.

In general, much less development work has been completed with hybrids than liquids or solids and it is likely that some of these disadvantages could be rectified through further investment in research and development.

One problem in designing large hybrid orbital rockets is that turbopumps become necessary to achieve high flow rates and pressurization of the oxidizer. This turbopump must be powered by something. In a traditional liquid-propellant rocket, the turbopump uses the same fuel and oxidizer as the rocket, since they are both liquid and can be fed to the pre-burner. But in a hybrid, the fuel is solid and cannot be fed to a turbopump&#x27;s engine. Some hybrids use an oxidizer that can also be used as a monopropellant, such as hydrogen peroxide, and so a turbopump can run on it alone. However, hydrogen peroxide is significantly less efficient than liquid oxygen, which cannot be used alone to run a turbopump. Another fuel would be needed, requiring its own tank and decreasing rocket performance.

==Fuel==
===Common fuel choices===
A reverse-hybrid rocket, which is not very common, is one where the engine uses a solid oxidizer and a liquid fuel. Some liquid fuel options are kerosene, hydrazine, and LH2. Common fuels for a typical hybrid rocket engine include polymers such as acrylics, polyethylene (PE), cross-linked rubber, such as HTPB, or liquefying fuels such as paraffin wax. Plexiglass was a common fuel, since the combustion could be visible through the transparent combustion chamber. Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) synthetic rubber is currently the most popular fuel for hybrid rocket engines, due to its energy, and due to how safe it is to handle. Tests have been performed in which HTPB was soaked in liquid oxygen, and it still did not become explosive. These fuels are generally not as dense as solid rocket motors, so they are often doped with aluminum to increase the density and therefore the rocket performance.

===Grain manufacturing methods===
====Cast====
Hybrid rocket fuel grains can be manufactured via casting techniques, since they are typically a plastic or a rubber. Complex geometries, which are driven by the need for higher fuel mass flow rates, makes casting fuel grains for hybrid rockets expensive and time-consuming due in part to equipment costs. On a larger scale, cast grains must be supported by internal webbing, so that large chunks of fuel do not impact or even potentially block the nozzle. Grain defects are also an issue in larger grains. Traditional fuels that are cast are hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and paraffin waxes.

====Additive manufacturing====

Additive manufacturing is currently being used to create grain structures that were otherwise not possible to manufacture. Helical ports have been shown to increase fuel regression rates while also increasing volumetric efficiency. An example of material used for a hybrid rocket fuel is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The printed material is also typically enhanced with additives to improve rocket performance. Recent work at the University of Tennessee Knoxville has shown that, due to the increased surface area, the use of powdered fuels (i.e. graphite, coal, aluminum) encased in a 3D printed, ABS matrix can significantly increase the fuel burn rate and thrust level as compared to traditional polymer grains.

==Oxidizer==
===Common oxidizer choices===
Common oxidizers include gaseous or liquid oxygen, nitrous oxide, and hydrogen peroxide. For a reverse hybrid, oxidizers such as frozen oxygen and ammonium perchlorate are used.

Proper oxidizer vaporization is important for the rocket to perform efficiently. Improper vaporization can lead to very large regression rate differences at the head end of the motor when compared to the aft end. One method is to use a hot gas generator to heat the oxidizer in a pre-combustion chamber. Another method is to use an oxidizer that can also be used as a monopropellant. A good example is hydrogen peroxide, which can be catalytically decomposed over a silver bed into hot oxygen and steam. A third method is to inject a propellant that is hypergolic with the oxidizer into the flow. Some of the oxidizer will decompose, heating up the rest of the oxidizer in the flow.

==Hybrid safety==
Generally, well designed and carefully constructed hybrids are very safe. The primary hazards associated with hybrids are:

* Pressure vessel failures – Chamber insulation failure may allow hot combustion gases near the chamber walls leading to a &quot;burn-through&quot; in which the vessel ruptures.
* Blow back – For oxidizers that decompose exothermically such as nitrous oxide or hydrogen peroxide, flame or hot gasses from the combustion chamber can propagate back through the injector, vaporising the oxidizer and mixing it with hot fuel rich gasses leading to a tank explosion. Blow-back requires gases to flow back through the injector due to insufficient pressure drop which can occur during periods of unstable combustion. Blow back is inherent to specific oxidizers and is not possible with oxidizers such as oxygen, or nitrogen tetroxide, unless fuel is present in the oxidizer tank.
* Hard starts – An excess of oxidizer in the combustion chamber prior to ignition, particularly for monopropellants such as nitrous oxide, can result in a temporary over-pressure or &quot;spike&quot; at ignition.

Because the fuel in a hybrid does not contain an oxidizer, it will not combust explosively on its own. For this reason, hybrids are classified as having no TNT equivalent explosive power. In contrast, solid rockets often have TNT equivalencies similar in magnitude to the mass of the propellant grain. Liquid-fuel rockets typically have a TNT equivalence calculated based on the amount of fuel and oxidizer which could realistically intimately combine before igniting explosively; this is often taken to be 10–20% of the total propellant mass. For hybrids, even filling the combustion chamber with oxidizer prior to ignition will not generally create an explosion with the solid fuel, the explosive equivalence is often quoted as 0%.

== Organizations working on hybrids ==
===Commercial companies===
In 1998 SpaceDev acquired all of the intellectual property, designs, and test results generated by over 200 hybrid rocket motor firings by the American Rocket Company over its eight-year life. SpaceShipOne, the first private crewed spacecraft, was powered by SpaceDev&#x27;s hybrid rocket motor burning HTPB with nitrous oxide. However, nitrous oxide was the prime substance responsible for the explosion that killed three in the development of the successor of SpaceShipOne at Scaled Composites in 2007. The Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo follow-on commercial suborbital spaceplane uses a scaled-up hybrid motor.

SpaceDev was developing the SpaceDev Streaker, an expendable small launch vehicle, and SpaceDev Dream Chaser, capable of both suborbital and orbital human space flight. Both Streaker and Dream Chaser use hybrid rocket motors that burn nitrous oxide and the synthetic HTPB rubber. SpaceDev was acquired by Sierra Nevada Corporation in 2009, becoming its Space Systems division, which continues to develop Dream Chaser for NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Development contract. Sierra Nevada also developed RocketMotorTwo, the hybrid engine for SpaceShipTwo. On October 31, 2014, when SpaceShipTwo was lost, initial speculation had suggested that its hybrid engine had in fact exploded and killed one test pilot and seriously injured the other. However, investigation data now indicates an early deployment of the SpaceShip-Two feather system was the cause for aerodynamic breakup of the vehicle.

U.S. Rockets manufactured and deployed hybrids using self-pressurizing nitrous oxide (N2O) and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) as well as mixed High-test peroxide (HTP) and HTPB. The High-test peroxide (H2O2) 86% and (HTPB) and aluminum hybrids developed by U.S. Rockets produced a sea level delivered specific impulse (Isp) of 240, well above the typical 180 of N2O-HTPB hybrids. In addition to that, they were self-starting, restartable, had considerably lower combustion instability making them suitable for fragile or crewed missions such as Bloodhound SSC, SpaceShipTwo or SpaceShipThree. The company had successfully tested and deployed both pressure fed and pump fed versions of the latter HTP-HTPB style. Deliverables to date have ranged from diameter, and developed units up to diameter. The vendor claimed scalability to over diameter with regression rates approaching solids, according to literature distributed at the November 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) meeting for XS-1. U.S. Rockets is no longer manufacturing large-scale rockets.

===High power rocketry===
There are a number of hybrid rocket motor systems available for amateur/hobbyist use in high-powered model rocketry. These include the popular HyperTek systems and a number of &#x27;Urbanski-Colburn Valved&#x27; (U/C) systems such as RATTWorks, Contrail Rockets, and Propulsion Polymers.
All of these systems use nitrous oxide as the oxidizer and a plastic fuel (such as Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Polypropylene), or a polymer-based fuel such as HTPB. This reduces the cost per flight compared to solid rocket motors, although there is generally more ground support equipment required with hybrids.

==In popular culture==

An October 26, 2005 episode of the television show &quot;MythBusters&quot; entitled &quot;Confederate Rocket&quot; featured a hybrid rocket motor using liquid nitrous oxide and paraffin wax. The myth purported that during the American Civil War, the Confederate Army was able to construct a rocket of this type. The myth was revisited in a later episode entitled &quot;Salami Rocket&quot;, using hollowed out dry salami as the solid fuel.

In the February 18, 2007, episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, a Reliant Robin was used by Richard Hammond and James May in an attempt to modify a normal K-reg Robin into a reusable Space Shuttle. Steve Holland, a professional radio-controlled aircraft pilot, helped Hammond to work out how to land a Robin safely. The craft was built by senior members of the United Kingdom Rocketry Association (UKRA) and achieved a successful launch, flew for several seconds into the air and managed to successfully jettison the solid-fuel rocket boosters on time. This was the largest rocket launched by a non-government organisation in Europe. It used motors by Contrail Rockets giving a maximum thrust of 8 tonnes. However, the car failed to separate from the large external fuel tank due to faulty explosive bolts between the Robin and the external tank, and the Robin subsequently crashed into the ground and seemed to have exploded soon after. This explosion was added for dramatic effect as neither Reliant Robins nor hybrid rocket motors explode in the way depicted.

<text>A [[monopropellant]] rocket (or &quot;monochemical rocket&quot;) is a rocket that uses a single chemical as its propellant. Monopropellant rockets are commonly used as small attitude and trajectory control rockets in satellites, rocket upper stages, crewed spacecraft, and spaceplanes.

==Chemical-reaction based monopropellant rockets==
The simplest monopropellant rockets depend on the chemical decomposition of a storable propellant after passing it over a catalyst bed. The power for the thruster comes from the high pressure gas created during the decomposition reaction that allows a rocket nozzle to speed up the gas to create thrust.

The most commonly used monopropellant is hydrazine (), a compound unstable in the presence of a catalyst and which is also a strong reducing agent. The most common catalyst is granular alumina (aluminum oxide, ) coated with iridium. These coated granules are usually under the commercial labels Aerojet S-405 (previously made by Shell) or W.C. Heraeus H-KC 12 GA (previously made by Kali Chemie). There is no igniter with hydrazine. Aerojet S-405 is a spontaneous catalyst, that is, hydrazine decomposes on contact with the catalyst. The decomposition is highly exothermic and produces a gas that is a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen and ammonia. The main limiting factor of the monopropellant rocket is its life, which mainly depends on the life of the catalyst. The catalyst may be subject to catalytic poisoning and catalytic attrition which results in the catalyst failure. Another monopropellant is hydrogen peroxide, which, when purified to 90% or higher concentration, is self-decomposing at high temperatures or when a catalyst is present.

Most chemical-reaction monopropellant rocket systems consist of a fuel tank, usually a titanium or aluminium sphere, with an ethylene-propylene rubber container or a surface tension propellant management device filled with the fuel. The tank is then pressurized with helium or nitrogen, which pushes the fuel out to the motors. A pipe leads from the tank to a poppet valve, and then to the decomposition chamber of the rocket motor. Typically, a satellite will have not just one motor, but two to twelve, each with its own valve.

The attitude control rocket motors for satellites and space probes are often very small, or so in diameter, and mounted in groups that point in four directions (within a plane).

The rocket is fired when the computer sends direct current through a small electromagnet that opens the poppet valve. The firing is often very brief, a few milliseconds, and — if operated in air — would sound like a pebble thrown against a metal trash can; if on for long, it would make a piercing hiss.

Chemical-reaction monopropellants are not as efficient as some other propulsion technologies. Engineers choose monopropellant systems when the need for simplicity and reliability outweigh the need for high delivered impulse. If the propulsion system must produce large amounts of thrust, or have a high specific impulse, as on the main motor of an interplanetary spacecraft, other technologies are used.

==Solar-thermal based monopropellant thrusters==
A concept to provide low Earth orbit (LEO) propellant depots that could be used as way-stations for other spacecraft to stop and refuel on the way to beyond-LEO missions has proposed that waste gaseous hydrogen—an inevitable byproduct of long-term liquid hydrogen storage in the radiative heat environment of space—would be usable as a monopropellant in a solar-thermal propulsion system. The waste hydrogen would be productively utilized for both orbital station-keeping and attitude control, as well as providing limited propellant and thrust to use for orbital maneuvers to better rendezvous with other spacecraft that would be inbound to receive fuel from the depot.

Solar-thermal monopropellant thrusters are also integral to the design of a next-generation cryogenic upper stage rocket proposed by U.S. company United Launch Alliance (ULA). The Advanced Common Evolved Stage (ACES) is intended as a lower-cost, more-capable and more-flexible upper stage that would supplement, and perhaps replace, the existing ULA Centaur and ULA Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) upper stage vehicles. The ACES Integrated Vehicle Fluids option eliminates all hydrazine and helium from the space vehicle—normally used for attitude control and station keeping—and depends instead on solar-thermal monopropellant thrusters using waste hydrogen.

== History ==

Soviet designers had begun experimenting with monopropellant rockets as early as 1933. They believed their monopropellant mixes of nitrogen tetroxide with gasoline, or toluene, and kerosene would lead to an overall simpler system; however, they ran into problems with violent explosions with pre-mixed fuel and oxidizer serving as a monopropellant that led the designers to abandon this approach.

Helmuth Walter was a German engineer an early pioneer of monopropellant rockets using hydrogen peroxide as fuel. Although his initial work was on submarine propulsion the same jets of oxygen produced by for combustion in gas turbines could be directed through a nozzle to generate thrust. The rocket Walter developed was used in the German ME-163 fighter aircraft in 1944, the first aircraft to break the 1000 km/h (635 mph).  

After World War Two the British would continue to experiment with hydrogen peroxide monopropellants. They would develop the de Havilland Sprite a hydrogen peroxide rocket that could produce 5000lbf of thrust over 16 seconds. Not intended for space flight the rocket would provide hot and high takeoff capability to the de Havilland Comet 1 the first commercial jet airliner. 

In the United States, when NASA began studying monopropellants at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) the properties of the existing propellants demanded that the thrusters be impractically large. The addition of a catalyst and pre-heating propellant made them more efficient, but raised concerns over safety and handling of hazardous propellants like anhydrous hydrazine. However the simplicity of the thrusters designed around early monopropellants offered many simplicities and were first tested in 1959 on the Able-4 mission. This test allowed for the Ranger and Mariner missions to use a similar thruster for correction maneuvers and in the orbital insertion of Telstar, considered by the National Air and Space Museum to be the most significant communications satellite in the beginning of the space race.

In 1964, NASA began use of the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle to train Apollo astronauts in piloting the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) using an attitude control system consisting of 16 hydrogen peroxide monopropellant thrusters to steer the LEM to the lunar surface.

Upper stage vehicles began using monopropellant thrusters as a convenient control device in the early 1960s when General Dynamics proposed the Centaur upper stage to the United States Airforce of which versions are still in use in United Launch Alliance&#x27;s Atlas and Vulcan rockets.

==New developments==
NASA is developing a new monopropellant propulsion system for small, cost-driven spacecraft with delta-v requirements in the range of 10–150 m/s. This system is based on a hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN)/water/fuel monopropellant blend which is extremely dense, environmentally benign, and promises good performance and simplicity.

The EURENCO Bofors company produced LMP-103S as a 1-to-1 substitute for hydrazine by dissolving 65% ammonium dinitramide, NH4N(NO2)2, in 35% water solution of methanol and ammonia. LMP-103S has 6% higher specific impulse and 30% higher impulse density than hydrazine monopropellant. Additionally, hydrazine is highly toxic and carcinogenic, while LMP-103S is only moderately toxic. LMP-103S is UN Class 1.4S allowing for transport on commercial aircraft, and was demonstrated on the Prisma satellite in 2010. Special handling is not required. LMP-103S could replace hydrazine as the most commonly used monopropellant.

<text>Dual mode [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] systems combine the high efficiency of bipropellant rockets with the reliability and simplicity of monopropellant rockets.

Dual mode systems are either hydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide, or monomethylhydrazine/hydrogen peroxide (the former is much more common). Typically, this system works as follows: During the initial high-impulse orbit-raising maneuvers, the system operates in a bipropellant fashion, providing high thrust at higher specific impulse; when it arrives on orbit, it closes off either the fuel or oxidizer, and conducts the remainder of its mission in a simple, predictable monopropellant fashion.

<text>A resistojet is a method of spacecraft propulsion (electric propulsion) that provides thrust by heating a typically non-reactive fluid. Heating is usually achieved by sending electricity through a resistor consisting of a hot incandescent filament, with the expanded gas expelled through a conventional nozzle.

Resistojets have been flown in space since 1965 on board military Vela satellites. However, they only became used in commercial applications in 1980 with the launch of the first satellites in the Intelsat-V program. Many GEO spacecraft, and all 95 Iridium, used Aerojet MR-501/MR-502 series resistojet engines. Nowadays resistojet propulsion is used for orbit insertion, attitude control, and deorbit of LEO satellites, and do well in situations where energy is much more plentiful than mass, and where propulsion efficiency needs to be reasonably high but low thrust is acceptable.

Resistojets have also been proposed as means of using biowaste as reaction mass, particularly in conjunction with hydrazine. Studies focus on the characteristics of steam and carbon dioxide as major constituents of a biowaste stream, and typically use cubic zirconia as a heating element.

== Advantages ==
Many satellite missions necessitate an ability for minor alterations in trajectory even after the craft has been inserted into orbit. Most satellites use monopropellant rocket motors or cold gas thrusters for such orbital adjustments. Both methods, however, suffer from some limiting drawbacks: Hydrazine, the most commonly used monopropellant, is highly expensive and due to its volatile nature unsuitable for smaller satellites that are sent to space as secondary cargo. Cold gas thrusters, while utilizing relatively cheap, inert and therefore &quot;safe&quot; gasses like nitrogen, suffer from low specific impulse in comparison to monopropellant motors. Resistojets are designed to bridge the gap between these two methods of propulsion, offering the safety of an inert propellant coupled with specific impulse nearing that of hydrazine.

== Disadvantages ==
The main disadvantage of a resistojet design in comparison to simpler cold gas thrusters is the need for a power supply, which takes up space and is therefore sometimes a prohibitive factor for Microsat missions. In addition, the increased technical complexity of a resistojet relative to simpler solutions results in a greater risk of technical failure.

Since they do not take advantage of chemical combustion, resistojets (and similar designs) have a lower thrust that is orders of magnitude lower than those of more conventional solid fuel and liquid-propellant rockets. As a result, they are unsuitable for orbital maneuvers that require high delta V over shorter periods.

== Physical Principles ==
Resistojets can be considered an evolution of traditional cold gas thrusters, which are the simplest form of rocket engine available. Their fuel tank holds the propellant, which is then led into the nozzle where it decompresses, propelling the craft forward. In a resistojet, a resistor is used to heat the fluid before it enters the nozzle, making it expand more forcefully, resulting in higher specific impulse.

A resistor is an electrical component which converts electrical energy into heat. Therefore, the thrust of a resistojet engine can be regulated by simply altering the wattage flowing through the resistor.

Heating a fluid by 300 °C in such a way results in a 41% increase in specific impulse. If heated by 900 °C, specific impulse could be doubled in comparison to a cold gas thruster using the same propellant.

<text>An arcjet rocket or arcjet thruster is a form of electrically powered spacecraft propulsion, in which an electrical discharge (arc) is created in a flow of propellant (typically hydrazine or ammonia). This imparts additional energy to the propellant, so that one can extract more work out of each kilogram of propellant, at the expense of increased power consumption and (usually) higher cost. Also, the thrust levels available from typically used arcjet engines are very low compared with chemical engines.

When the energy is available, arcjets are well suited to keeping stations in orbit and can replace monopropellant rockets.

Aerojet MR-510 series arcjet engines are currently used on Lockheed Martin A2100 satellites using hydrazine as a propellant, providing over 585 s average specific impulse at 2 kW.

In Germany, researchers at the University of Stuttgart&#x27;s Institute of Space Aviation Systems have been working with arcjets for years and have developed various hydrogen-powered arcjet engines capable of power outputs from 1 to 100 kW. The heated hydrogen reaches exit speeds of . An arcjet-propelled test satellite by the name of Baden-Württemberg 1 (BW1) was scheduled to go to the Moon by 2010. No such launch has yet occurred. Baden-Württemberg 1 would have used polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) propellant.

<doc id="37838" wikidata="Q1193128" url="?curid=37838" title="Hall-effect thruster">
<text>In spacecraft propulsion, a Hall-effect thruster (HET) is a type of ion thruster in which the propellant is accelerated by an electric field. Hall-effect thrusters (based on the discovery by Edwin Hall) are sometimes referred to as Hall thrusters or Hall-current thrusters. Hall-effect thrusters use a magnetic field to limit the electrons&#x27; axial motion and then use them to ionize propellant, efficiently accelerate the ions to produce thrust, and neutralize the ions in the plume. The Hall-effect thruster is classed as a moderate specific impulse (1,600s) space propulsion technology and has benefited from considerable theoretical and experimental research since the 1960s.

Hall thrusters operate on a variety of propellants, the most common being xenon and krypton. Other propellants of interest include argon, bismuth, iodine, magnesium, zinc and adamantane.

Hall thrusters are able to accelerate their exhaust to speeds between 10 and 80 km/s (1,000–8,000 s specific impulse), with most models operating between 15 and 30 km/s. The thrust produced depends on the power level. Devices operating at 1.35 kW produce about 83 mN of thrust. High-power models have demonstrated up to 5.4 N in the laboratory. Power levels up to 100 kW have been demonstrated for xenon Hall thrusters.

, Hall-effect thrusters ranged in input power levels from 1.35 to 10 kilowatts and had exhaust velocities of 10–50 kilometers per second, with thrust of 40–600 millinewtons and efficiency in the range of 45–60 percent.
The applications of Hall-effect thrusters include control of the orientation and position of orbiting satellites and use as a main propulsion engine for medium-size robotic space vehicles.

== History ==
Hall thrusters were studied independently in the United States and the Soviet Union. They were first described publicly in the US in the early 1960s. However, the Hall thruster was first developed into an efficient propulsion device in the Soviet Union. In the US, scientists focused on developing gridded ion thrusters.

=== Soviet designs ===

Two types of Hall thrusters were developed in the Soviet Union:
*thrusters with wide acceleration zone, SPT (; , Stationary Plasma Thruster) at Design Bureau Fakel
*thrusters with narrow acceleration zone, DAS (; , Thruster with Anode Layer), at the Central Research Institute for Machine Building (TsNIIMASH).
The SPT design was largely the work of A. I. Morozov. The first SPT to operate in space, an SPT-50 aboard a Soviet Meteor spacecraft, was launched December 1971. They were mainly used for satellite stabilization in north–south and in east–west directions. Since then until the late 1990s 118 SPT engines completed their mission and some 50 continued to be operated. Thrust of the first generation of SPT engines, SPT-50 and SPT-60 was 20 and 30 mN respectively. In 1982, the SPT-70 and SPT-100 were introduced, their thrusts being 40 and 83 mN, respectively. In the post-Soviet Russia high-power (a few kilowatts) SPT-140, SPT-160, SPT-200, T-160, and low-power (less than 500 W) SPT-35 were introduced.

Soviet and Russian TAL-type thrusters include the D-38, D-55, D-80, and D-100.

Over 200 Hall thrusters have been flown on Soviet/Russian satellites since the 1980s. No failures have ever occurred in orbit.

=== Non-Soviet designs ===

Soviet-built thrusters were introduced to the West in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists from NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Glenn Research Center, and the Air Force Research Laboratory, under the support of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, visited Russian laboratories and experimentally evaluated the SPT-100 (i.e., a 100 mm diameter SPT thruster). Hall thrusters continue to be used on Russian spacecraft and have also flown on European and American spacecraft. Space Systems/Loral, an American commercial satellite manufacturer, now flies Fakel SPT-100&#x27;s on their GEO communications spacecraft.

Since in the early 1990s, Hall thrusters have been the subject of a large number of research efforts throughout the United States, India, France, Italy, Japan, and Russia (with many smaller efforts scattered in various countries across the globe). Hall thruster research in the US is conducted at several government laboratories, universities and private companies. Government and government funded centers include NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA&#x27;s Glenn Research Center, the Air Force Research Laboratory (Edwards AFB, California), and The Aerospace Corporation. Universities include the US Air Force Institute of Technology, University of Michigan, Stanford University, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Michigan Technological University, and Georgia Tech. In 2023, students at the Olin College of Engineering demonstrated the first undergraduate designed steady-state hall thruster. A considerable amount of development is being conducted in industry, such as IHI Corporation in Japan, Aerojet and Busek in the US, SNECMA in France, LAJP in Ukraine, SITAEL in Italy, and Satrec Initiative in South Korea.

The first use of Hall thrusters on lunar orbit was the European Space Agency (ESA) lunar mission SMART-1 in 2003.

Hall thrusters were first demonstrated on a western satellite on the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) STEX spacecraft, which flew the Russian D-55. The first American Hall thruster to fly in space was the Busek BHT-200 on TacSat-2 technology demonstration spacecraft. The first flight of an American Hall thruster on an operational mission, was the Aerojet BPT-4000, which launched August 2010 on the military Advanced Extremely High Frequency GEO communications satellite. At 4.5 kW, the BPT-4000 is also the highest power Hall thruster ever flown in space. Besides the usual stationkeeping tasks, the BPT-4000 is also providing orbit-raising capability to the spacecraft. The X-37B has been used as a testbed for the Hall thruster for the AEHF satellite series. Several countries worldwide continue efforts to qualify Hall thruster technology for commercial uses. The SpaceX Starlink constellation, the largest satellite constellation in the world, uses Hall-effect thrusters. Starlink initially used krypton gas, but with its V2 satellites swapped to argon due to its cheaper price and widespread availability.

The first deployment of Hall thrusters beyond Earth&#x27;s sphere of influence was the &quot;Psyche&quot; spacecraft, launched in 2023 towards the asteroid belt to explore 16 Psyche.

=== Indian designs ===

Research in India is carried out by both public and private research institutes and companies.

In 2010, ISRO used Hall-effect ion propulsion thrusters in GSAT-4 carried by GSLV-D3. It had four xenon powered thrusters for north-south station keeping. Two of them were Russian and the other two were Indian. The Indian thrusters were rated at 13mN. However, GSLV-D3 did not make it to orbit.

In 2013, ISRO funded development of another class of electric thruster, the magnetoplasmadynamic thruster. The project subsequently developed a technology demonstrator prototype using argon propellant with a specific impulse of 2500s at a thrust of 25 mN.

The following year in 2014, ISRO was pursuing development of 75 mN &amp; 250 mN SPT thrusters to be used in its future high power communication satellites. The 75 mN thrusters were put to use aboard the GSAT-9 communication satellite.

By 2021 development of a 300 mN thruster was complete. Alongside it, RF-powered 10 kW plasma engines and krypton based low power electric propulsion were being pursued.

With private firms entering the space domain, Bellatrix Aerospace became the first commercial firm to bring out commercial Hall-effect thrusters. The current model of the thruster uses xenon as fuel. Tests were carried out at the spacecraft propulsion research laboratory in the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Heaterless cathode technology was used to increase the system&#x27;s lifespan and redundancy. Bellatrix Aerospace had previously developed the first commercially available microwave electrothermal thruster, for which the company received an order from ISRO. The ARKA-series of HET was launched on PSLV-C55 mission. It was successfully tested on POEM-2.

== Principle of operation ==
The essential working principle of the Hall thruster is that it uses an electrostatic potential to accelerate ions up to high speeds. In a Hall thruster, the attractive negative charge is provided by an electron plasma at the open end of the thruster instead of a grid. A radial magnetic field of about is used to confine the electrons, where the combination of the radial magnetic field and axial electric field cause the electrons to drift in azimuth thus forming the Hall current from which the device gets its name.
A schematic of a Hall thruster is shown in the adjacent image. An electric potential of between 150 and 800 volts is applied between the anode and cathode.

The central spike forms one pole of an electromagnet and is surrounded by an annular space, and around that is the other pole of the electromagnet, with a radial magnetic field in between.

The propellant, such as xenon gas, is fed through the anode, which has numerous small holes in it to act as a gas distributor. As the neutral xenon atoms diffuse into the channel of the thruster, they are ionized by collisions with circulating high-energy electrons (typically 10–40 eV, or about 10% of the discharge voltage). Most of the xenon atoms are ionized to a net charge of +1, but a noticeable fraction (c. 20%) have +2 net charge.

The xenon ions are then accelerated by the electric field between the anode and the cathode. For discharge voltages of 300 V, the ions reach speeds of around for a specific impulse of 1,500 s (15 kN·s/kg). Upon exiting, however, the ions pull an equal number of electrons with them, creating a plasma plume with no net charge.

The radial magnetic field is designed to be strong enough to substantially deflect the low-mass electrons, but not the high-mass ions, which have a much larger gyroradius and are hardly impeded. The majority of electrons are thus stuck orbiting in the region of high radial magnetic field near the thruster exit plane, trapped in &quot;E&quot;×&quot;B&quot; (axial electric field and radial magnetic field). This orbital rotation of the electrons is a circulating Hall current, and it is from this that the Hall thruster gets its name. Collisions with other particles and walls, as well as plasma instabilities, allow some of the electrons to be freed from the magnetic field, and they drift towards the anode.

About 20–30% of the discharge current is an electron current, which does not produce thrust, thus limiting the energetic efficiency of the thruster; the other 70–80% of the current is in the ions. Because the majority of electrons are trapped in the Hall current, they have a long residence time inside the thruster and are able to ionize almost all of the xenon propellant, allowing mass use of 90–99%. The mass use efficiency of the thruster is thus around 90%, while the discharge current efficiency is around 70%, for a combined thruster efficiency of around 63% (= 90% × 70%). Modern Hall thrusters have achieved efficiencies as high as 75% through advanced designs.

Compared to chemical rockets, the thrust is very small, on the order of 83 mN for a typical thruster operating at 300 V and 1.5 kW. For comparison, the weight of a coin like the U.S. quarter or a 20-cent euro coin is approximately 60 mN. As with all forms of electrically powered spacecraft propulsion, thrust is limited by available power, efficiency, and specific impulse.

However, Hall thrusters operate at the high specific impulses that are typical for electric propulsion. One particular advantage of Hall thrusters, as compared to a gridded ion thruster, is that the generation and acceleration of the ions takes place in a quasi-neutral plasma, so there is no Child-Langmuir charge (space charge) saturated current limitation on the thrust density. This allows much smaller thrusters compared to gridded ion thrusters.

Another advantage is that these thrusters can use a wider variety of propellants supplied to the anode, even oxygen, although something easily ionized is needed at the cathode.

=== Propellants ===

==== Xenon ====
Xenon has been the typical choice of propellant for many electric propulsion systems, including Hall thrusters. Xenon propellant is used because of its high atomic weight and low ionization potential. Xenon is relatively easy to store, and as a gas at spacecraft operating temperatures does not need to be vaporized before usage, unlike metallic propellants such as bismuth. Xenon&#x27;s high atomic weight means that the ratio of energy expended for ionization per mass unit is low, leading to a more efficient thruster.

==== Krypton ====
Krypton is another choice of propellant for Hall thrusters. Xenon has an ionization potential of 12.1298 eV, while krypton has an ionization potential of 13.996 eV. This means that thrusters utilizing krypton need to expend a slightly higher energy per mole to ionize, which reduces efficiency. Additionally, krypton is a lighter ion, so the unit mass per ionization energy is further reduced compared to xenon. However, xenon can be more than ten times as expensive as krypton per kilogram, making krypton a more economical choice for building out satellite constellations like that of SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink V1, whose original Hall thrusters were fueled with krypton.

==== Argon ====
SpaceX developed a new thruster that used argon as propellant for their Starlink V2 mini. The new thruster had 2.4 times the thrust and 1.5 times the specific impulse as SpaceX&#x27;s previous thruster that used krypton. Argon is approximately 100 times less expensive than Krypton and 1000 times less expensive than Xenon.

==== Comparison of noble gasses ====

=== Variants ===

As well as the Soviet SPT and TAL types mentioned above, there are: 

====Cylindrical Hall thrusters====

Although conventional (annular) Hall thrusters are efficient in the kilowatt power regime, they become inefficient when scaled to small sizes. This is due to the difficulties associated with holding the performance scaling parameters constant while decreasing the channel size and increasing the applied magnetic field strength. This led to the design of the cylindrical Hall thruster. The cylindrical Hall thruster can be more readily scaled to smaller sizes due to its nonconventional discharge-chamber geometry and associated magnetic field profile. The cylindrical Hall thruster more readily lends itself to miniaturization and low-power operation than a conventional (annular) Hall thruster. The primary reason for cylindrical Hall thrusters is that it is difficult to achieve a regular Hall thruster that operates over a broad envelope from c.1 kW down to c. 100 W while maintaining an efficiency of 45–55%.

====External discharge Hall thruster====
Sputtering erosion of discharge channel walls and pole pieces that protect the magnetic circuit causes failure of thruster operation. Therefore, annular and cylindrical Hall thrusters have limited lifetime. Although magnetic shielding has been shown to dramatically reduce discharge channel wall erosion, pole piece erosion is still a concern. As an alternative, an unconventional Hall thruster design called external discharge Hall thruster or external discharge plasma thruster (XPT) has been introduced. The external discharge Hall thruster does not possess any discharge channel walls or pole pieces. Plasma discharge is produced and sustained completely in the open space outside the thruster structure, and thus erosion-free operation is achieved.

Hall thrusters have been flying in space since December 1971, when the Soviet Union launched an SPT-50 on a Meteor satellite. Over 240 thrusters have flown in space since that time, with a 100% success rate. Hall thrusters are now routinely flown on commercial LEO and GEO communications satellites, where they are used for orbital insertion and stationkeeping.

The first Hall thruster to fly on a western satellite was a Russian D-55 built by TsNIIMASH, on the NRO&#x27;s STEX spacecraft, launched on October 3, 1998.

The solar electric propulsion system of the European Space Agency&#x27;s SMART-1 spacecraft used a Snecma PPS-1350-G Hall thruster. SMART-1 was a technology demonstration mission that orbited the Moon. This use of the PPS-1350-G, starting on September 28, 2003, was the first use of a Hall thruster outside geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). Like most Hall thruster propulsion systems used in commercial applications, the Hall thruster on SMART-1 could be throttled over a range of power, specific impulse, and thrust. It has a discharge power range of 0.46–1.19 kW, a specific impulse of 1,100–1,600 s and thrust of 30–70 mN.

Early small satellites of the SpaceX Starlink constellation used krypton-fueled Hall thrusters for position-keeping and deorbiting, while later Starlink satellites used argon-fueled Hall thrusters.

Tiangong space station is fitted with Hall-effect thrusters. Tianhe core module is propelled by both chemical thrusters and four ion thrusters, which are used to adjust and maintain the station&#x27;s orbit. Hall-effect thrusters are created with crewed mission safety in mind with effort to prevent erosion and damage caused by the accelerated ion particles. A magnetic field and specially designed ceramic shield was created to repel damaging particles and maintain integrity of the thrusters. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the ion drive used on Tiangong has burned continuously for 8,240 hours without a glitch, indicating their suitability for the Chinese space station&#x27;s designated 15-year lifespan. This is the world&#x27;s first Hall thruster on a human-rated mission.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) granted exclusive commercial licensing to Apollo Fusion, led by Mike Cassidy, for its Magnetically Shielded Miniature (MaSMi) Hall thruster technology. In January 2021, Apollo Fusion announced they had secured a contract with York Space Systems for an order of its latest iteration named the &quot;Apollo Constellation Engine&quot;.

The NASA mission to the asteroid Psyche utilizes xenon gas Hall thrusters. The electricity comes from the craft&#x27;s 75 square meter solar panels.

NASA&#x27;s first Hall thrusters on a human-rated mission will be a combination of 6 kW Hall thrusters provided by Busek and NASA Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) Hall thrusters. They will serve as the primary propulsion on Maxar&#x27;s Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) for the Lunar Gateway under NASA&#x27;s Artemis program. The high specific impulse of Hall thrusters will allow for efficient orbit raising and station keep for the Lunar Gateway&#x27;s polar near-rectilinear halo orbit.

==In development==
The highest power Hall-effect thruster in development (as of 2021) is the University of Michigan&#x27;s 100 kW X3 Nested Channel Hall Thruster. The thruster is approximately 80 cm in diameter and weighs 230 kg, and has demonstrated a thrust of 5.4 N.

Other high power thrusters include NASA&#x27;s 40 kW Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS), meant to propel large-scale science missions and cargo transportation in deep space.

<text>An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. An ion thruster creates a cloud of positive ions from a neutral gas by ionizing it to extract some electrons from its atoms. The ions are then accelerated using electricity to create thrust. Ion thrusters are categorized as either electrostatic or electromagnetic.

Electrostatic thruster ions are accelerated by the Coulomb force along the electric field direction. Temporarily stored electrons are reinjected by a &quot;neutralizer&quot; in the cloud of ions after it has passed through the electrostatic grid, so the gas becomes neutral again and can freely disperse in space without any further electrical interaction with the thruster. 

By contrast, electromagnetic thruster ions are accelerated by the Lorentz force to accelerate all species (free electrons as well as positive and negative ions) in the same direction whatever their electric charge, and are specifically referred to as plasma propulsion engines, where the electric field is not in the direction of the acceleration.

Ion thrusters in operation typically consume 1–7 kW of power, have exhaust velocities around 20–50 km/s (&quot;I&quot;sp 2000–5000s), and possess thrusts of 25–250 mN and a propulsive efficiency 65–80% though experimental versions have achieved , .

The &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; spacecraft, powered by an ion thruster, changed velocity by while consuming less than of xenon. The &quot;Dawn&quot; spacecraft broke the record, with a velocity change of , though it was only half as efficient, requiring of xenon.

Applications include control of the orientation and position of orbiting satellites (some satellites have dozens of low-power ion thrusters), use as a main propulsion engine for low-mass robotic space vehicles (such as &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; and &quot;Dawn&quot;), and serving as propulsion thrusters for crewed spacecraft and space stations (e.g. Tiangong).

Ion thrust engines are generally practical only in the vacuum of space as the engine&#x27;s minuscule thrust cannot overcome any significant air resistance without radical design changes, as may be found in the &#x27;Atmosphere Breathing Electric Propulsion&#x27; concept. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has created designs that are able to fly for short distances and at low speeds at ground level, using ultra-light materials and low drag aerofoils. An ion engine cannot usually generate sufficient thrust to achieve initial liftoff from any celestial body with significant surface gravity. For these reasons, spacecraft must rely on other methods such as conventional chemical rockets or non-rocket launch technologies to reach their initial orbit.

== Origins ==
The first person who wrote a paper introducing the idea publicly was Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1911. The technique was recommended for near-vacuum conditions at high altitude, but thrust was demonstrated with ionized air streams at atmospheric pressure. The idea appeared again in Hermann Oberth&#x27;s &quot;Wege zur Raumschiffahrt&quot; (1929; &quot;Ways to Spaceflight&quot;), where he explained his thoughts on the mass savings of electric propulsion, predicted its use in spacecraft propulsion and attitude control, and advocated electrostatic acceleration of charged gasses.

A working ion thruster was built by Harold R. Kaufman in 1959 at the NASA Glenn Research Center facilities. It was similar to a gridded electrostatic ion thruster and used mercury for propellant. Suborbital tests were conducted during the 1960s and in 1964, and the engine was sent into a suborbital flight aboard the Space Electric Rocket Test-1 (SERT-1). It successfully operated for the planned 31 minutes before falling to Earth. This test was followed by an orbital test, SERT-2, in 1970.

On the 12 October 1964 Voskhod 1 carried out tests with ion thrusters that had been attached to the exterior of the spacecraft. 

An alternate form of electric propulsion, the Hall-effect thruster, was studied independently in the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s. Hall-effect thrusters operated on Soviet satellites from 1972 until the late 1990s, mainly used for satellite stabilization in north–south and in east–west directions. Some 100–200 engines completed missions on Soviet and Russian satellites. Soviet thruster design was introduced to the West in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists, under the support of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, visited Soviet laboratories.

== General working principle ==
Ion thrusters use beams of ions (electrically charged atoms or molecules) to create thrust in accordance with momentum conservation. The method of accelerating the ions varies, but all designs take advantage of the charge/mass ratio of the ions. This ratio means that relatively small potential differences can create high exhaust velocities. This reduces the amount of reaction mass or propellant required, but increases the amount of specific power required compared to chemical rockets. Ion thrusters are therefore able to achieve high specific impulses. The drawback of the low thrust is low acceleration because the mass of the electric power unit directly correlates with the amount of power. This low thrust makes ion thrusters unsuited for launching spacecraft into orbit, but effective for in-space propulsion over longer periods of time.

Ion thrusters are categorized as either electrostatic or electromagnetic. The main difference is the method for accelerating the ions.
* Electrostatic ion thrusters use the Coulomb force and accelerate the ions in the direction of the electric field.
* Electromagnetic ion thrusters use the Lorentz force to accelerate the ions in the direction perpendicular to the electric field.

Electric power for ion thrusters is usually provided by solar panels. However, for sufficiently large distances from the sun, nuclear power may be used. In each case, the power supply mass is proportional to the peak power that can be supplied, and both provide, for this application, almost no limit to the energy.

Electric thrusters tend to produce low thrust, which results in low acceleration. Defining formula_1, the standard gravitational acceleration of Earth, and noting that formula_2, this can be analyzed. An NSTAR thruster producing a thrust force of 92 mN will accelerate a satellite with a mass of 1ton by 0.092N / 1000 kg = 9.2m/s (or 9.38&quot;g&quot;). However, this acceleration can be sustained for months or years at a time, in contrast to the very short burns of chemical rockets.

formula_3
Where:
* &quot;F&quot; is the thrust force in N,
* &quot;η&quot; is the efficiency
* &quot;P&quot; is the electrical power used by the thruster in W, and
* &quot;I&quot;sp is the specific impulse in seconds.

The ion thruster is not the most promising type of electrically powered spacecraft propulsion, but it is the most successful in practice to date. An ion drive would require two days to accelerate a car to highway speed in vacuum. The technical characteristics, especially thrust, are considerably inferior to the prototypes described in literature, technical capabilities are limited by the space charge created by ions. This limits the thrust density (force per cross-sectional area of the engine). Ion thrusters create small thrust levels (the thrust of &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; is approximately equal to the weight of one sheet of paper) compared to conventional chemical rockets, but achieve high specific impulse, or propellant mass efficiency, by accelerating the exhaust to high speed. The power imparted to the exhaust increases with the square of exhaust velocity while thrust increase is linear. Conversely, chemical rockets provide high thrust, but are limited in total impulse by the small amount of energy that can be stored chemically in the propellants. Given the practical weight of suitable power sources, the acceleration from an ion thruster is frequently less than one-thousandth of standard gravity. However, since they operate as electric (or electrostatic) motors, they convert a greater fraction of input power into kinetic exhaust power. Chemical rockets operate as heat engines, and Carnot&#x27;s theorem limits the exhaust velocity.

== Electrostatic thrusters ==
=== Gridded electrostatic ion thrusters ===

Gridded electrostatic ion thrusters development started in the 1960s and, since then, they have been used for commercial satellite propulsion and scientific missions. Their main feature is that the propellant ionization process is physically separated from the ion acceleration process.

The ionization process takes place in the discharge chamber, where by bombarding the propellant with energetic electrons, as the energy transferred ejects valence electrons from the propellant gas&#x27;s atoms. These electrons can be provided by a hot cathode filament and accelerated through the potential difference towards an anode. Alternatively, the electrons can be accelerated by an oscillating induced electric field created by an alternating electromagnet, which results in a self-sustaining discharge without a cathode (radio frequency ion thruster).

The positively charged ions are extracted by a system consisting of 2 or 3 multi-aperture grids. After entering the grid system near the plasma sheath, the ions are accelerated by the potential difference between the first grid and second grid (called the screen grid and the accelerator grid, respectively) to the final ion energy of (typically) 1–2 keV, which generates thrust.

Ion thrusters emit a beam of positively charged ions. To keep the spacecraft from accumulating a charge, another cathode is placed near the engine to emit electrons into the ion beam, leaving the propellant electrically neutral. This prevents the beam of ions from being attracted (and returning) to the spacecraft, which would cancel the thrust.

Gridded electrostatic ion thruster research (past/present):
* NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR), 2.3 kW, used on two successful missions
* NASA&#x27;s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT), 6.9 kW, flight qualification hardware built; used on DART mission
* Nuclear Electric Xenon Ion System (NEXIS)
* High Power Electric Propulsion (HiPEP), 25 kW, test example built and run briefly on the ground
* EADS Radio-frequency Ion Thruster (RIT)
* Dual-Stage 4-Grid (DS4G)

=== Hall-effect thrusters ===

Hall-effect thrusters accelerate ions by means of an electric potential between a cylindrical anode and a negatively charged plasma that forms the cathode. The bulk of the propellant (typically xenon) is introduced near the anode, where it ionizes and flows toward the cathode; ions accelerate towards and through it, picking up electrons as they leave to neutralize the beam and leave the thruster at high velocity.

The anode is at one end of a cylindrical tube. In the center is a spike that is wound to produce a radial magnetic field between it and the surrounding tube. The ions are largely unaffected by the magnetic field, since they are too massive. However, the electrons produced near the end of the spike to create the cathode are trapped by the magnetic field and held in place by their attraction to the anode. Some of the electrons spiral down towards the anode, circulating around the spike in a Hall current. When they reach the anode they impact the uncharged propellant and cause it to be ionized, before finally reaching the anode and completing the circuit.

=== Field-emission electric propulsion ===
Field-emission electric propulsion (FEEP) thrusters may use caesium or indium propellants. The design comprises a small propellant reservoir that stores the liquid metal, a narrow tube or a system of parallel plates that the liquid flows through and an accelerator (a ring or an elongated aperture in a metallic plate) about a millimeter past the tube end. Caesium and indium are used due to their high atomic weights, low ionization potentials and low melting points. Once the liquid metal reaches the end of the tube, an electric field applied between the emitter and the accelerator causes the liquid surface to deform into a series of protruding cusps, or &quot;Taylor cones&quot;. At a sufficiently high applied voltage, positive ions are extracted from the tips of the cones. The electric field created by the emitter and the accelerator then accelerates the ions. An external source of electrons neutralizes the positively charged ion stream to prevent charging of the spacecraft.

== Electromagnetic thrusters ==

=== Pulsed inductive thrusters ===
Pulsed inductive thrusters (PITs) use pulses instead of continuous thrust and have the ability to run on power levels on the order of megawatts (MW). PITs consist of a large coil encircling a cone shaped tube that emits the propellant gas. Ammonia is the gas most commonly used. For each pulse, a large charge builds up in a group of capacitors behind the coil and is then released. This creates a current that moves circularly in the direction of jθ. The current then creates a magnetic field in the outward radial direction (Br), which then creates a current in the gas that has just been released in the opposite direction of the original current. This opposite current ionizes the ammonia. The positively charged ions are accelerated away from the engine due to the electric field jθ crossing the magnetic field Br, due to the Lorentz force.

=== Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster ===
Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters and lithium Lorentz force accelerator (LiLFA) thrusters use roughly the same idea. The LiLFA thruster builds on the MPD thruster. Hydrogen, argon, ammonia and nitrogen can be used as propellant. In a certain configuration, the ambient gas in low Earth orbit (LEO) can be used as a propellant. The gas enters the main chamber where it is ionized into plasma by the electric field between the anode and the cathode. This plasma then conducts electricity between the anode and the cathode, closing the circuit. This new current creates a magnetic field around the cathode, which crosses with the electric field, thereby accelerating the plasma due to the Lorentz force.

The LiLFA thruster uses the same general idea as the MPD thruster, though with two main differences. First, the LiLFA uses lithium vapor, which can be stored as a solid. The other difference is that the single cathode is replaced by multiple, smaller cathode rods packed into a hollow cathode tube. MPD cathodes are easily corroded due to constant contact with the plasma. In the LiLFA thruster, the lithium vapor is injected into the hollow cathode and is not ionized to its plasma form/corrode the cathode rods until it exits the tube. The plasma is then accelerated using the same Lorentz force.

In 2013, Russian company the Chemical Automatics Design Bureau successfully conducted a bench test of their MPD engine for long-distance space travel.

=== Electrodeless plasma thrusters ===
Electrodeless plasma thrusters have two unique features: the removal of the anode and cathode electrodes and the ability to throttle the engine. The removal of the electrodes eliminates erosion, which limits lifetime on other ion engines. Neutral gas is first ionized by electromagnetic waves and then transferred to another chamber where it is accelerated by an oscillating electric and magnetic field, also known as the ponderomotive force. This separation of the ionization and acceleration stages allows throttling of propellant flow, which then changes the thrust magnitude and specific impulse values.

=== Helicon double layer thrusters ===
A helicon double layer thruster is a type of plasma thruster that ejects high velocity ionized gas to provide thrust. In this design, gas is injected into a tubular chamber (the &quot;source tube&quot;) with one open end. Radio frequency AC power (at 13.56 MHz in the prototype design) is coupled into a specially shaped antenna wrapped around the chamber. The electromagnetic wave emitted by the antenna causes the gas to break down and form a plasma. The antenna then excites a helicon wave in the plasma, which further heats it. The device has a roughly constant magnetic field in the source tube (supplied by solenoids in the prototype), but the magnetic field diverges and rapidly decreases in magnitude away from the source region and might be thought of as a kind of magnetic nozzle. In operation, a sharp boundary separates the high density plasma inside the source region and the low density plasma in the exhaust, which is associated with a sharp change in electrical potential. Plasma properties change rapidly across this boundary, which is known as a &quot;current-free electric double layer&quot;. The electrical potential is much higher inside the source region than in the exhaust and this serves both to confine most of the electrons and to accelerate the ions away from the source region. Enough electrons escape the source region to ensure that the plasma in the exhaust is neutral overall.

=== Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) ===
The proposed Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) functions by using radio waves to ionize a propellant into a plasma, and then using a magnetic field to accelerate the plasma out of the back of the rocket engine to generate thrust. The VASIMR is currently being developed by Ad Astra Rocket Company, headquartered in Houston, Texas, with help from Canada-based Nautel, producing the 200 kW RF generators for ionizing propellant. Some of the components and &quot;plasma shoots&quot; experiments are tested in a laboratory settled in Liberia, Costa Rica. This project is led by former NASA astronaut Franklin Chang-Díaz (CRC-USA). A 200 kW VASIMR test engine was in discussion to be fitted in the exterior of the International Space Station, as part of the plan to test the VASIMR in space; however, plans for this test onboard ISS were canceled in 2015 by NASA, with a free flying VASIMR test being discussed by Ad Astra instead. An envisioned 200 MW engine could reduce the duration of flight from Earth to Jupiter or Saturn from six years to fourteen months, and Mars from 7 months to 39 days.

=== Microwave electrothermal thrusters ===
Under a research grant from the NASA Lewis Research Center during the 1980s and 1990s, Martin C. Hawley and Jes Asmussen led a team of engineers in developing a microwave electrothermal thruster (MET).

In the discharge chamber, microwave (MW) energy flows into the center containing a high level of ions (I), causing neutral species in the gaseous propellant to ionize. Excited species flow out (FES) through the low ion region (II) to a neutral region (III) where the ions complete their recombination, replaced with the flow of neutral species (FNS) towards the center. Meanwhile, energy is lost to the chamber walls through heat conduction and convection (HCC), along with radiation (Rad). The remaining energy absorbed into the gaseous propellant is converted into thrust.

== Radioisotope thruster ==
A theoretical propulsion system has been proposed, based on alpha particles ( or indicating a helium ion with a +2 charge) emitted from a radioisotope uni-directionally through a hole in its chamber. A neutralising electron gun would produce a tiny amount of thrust with high specific impulse in the order of millions of seconds due to the high relativistic speed of alpha particles.

A variant of this uses a graphite-based grid with a static DC high voltage to increase thrust as graphite has high transparency to alpha particles if it is also irradiated with short wave UV light at the correct wavelength from a solid-state emitter. It also permits lower energy and longer half-life sources which would be advantageous for a space application. Helium backfill has also been suggested as a way to increase electron mean free path.

== Comparisons ==


== Lifetime ==
Ion thrusters&#x27; low thrust requires continuous operation for a long time to achieve the necessary change in velocity (delta-v) for a particular mission. Ion thrusters are designed to provide continuous operation for intervals of weeks to years.

The lifetime of electrostatic ion thrusters is limited by several processes.

=== Gridded thruster life===
In electrostatic gridded designs, charge-exchange ions produced by the beam ions with the neutral gas flow can be accelerated towards the negatively biased accelerator grid and cause grid erosion. End-of-life is reached when either the grid structure fails or the holes in the grid become large enough that ion extraction is substantially affected – e.g., by the occurrence of electron backstreaming. Grid erosion cannot be avoided and is the major lifetime-limiting factor. Thorough grid design and material selection enable lifetimes of 20,000 hours or more.

A test of the NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) electrostatic ion thruster resulted in 30,472 hours (roughly 3.5 years) of continuous thrust at maximum power. Post-test examination indicated the engine was not approaching failure. NSTAR operated for years on &quot;Dawn&quot;.

The NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) project operated continuously for more than 48,000 hours. The test was conducted in a high-vacuum test chamber. Over the course of the test, which lasted more than five and a half years, the engine consumed approximately 870 kilograms of xenon propellant. The total impulse generated would require over 10,000 kilograms of conventional rocket propellant for a similar application.

===Hall-effect thruster life===
Hall-effect thrusters suffer from strong erosion of the ceramic discharge chamber by impact of energetic ions: a test reported in 2010 showed erosion of around 1 mm per hundred hours of operation, though this is inconsistent with observed on-orbit lifetimes of a few thousand hours.

The Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) is expected to accumulate about 5,000 hours and the design aims to achieve a flight model that offers a half-life of at least 23,000 hours and a full life of about 50,000 hours.

== Propellants ==
Ionization energy represents a large percentage of the energy needed to run ion drives. The ideal propellant is thus easy to ionize and has a high mass/ionization energy ratio. In addition, the propellant should not erode the thruster to any great degree, so as to permit long life, and should not contaminate the vehicle.

Many current designs use xenon gas, as it is easy to ionize, has a reasonably high atomic number, is inert and causes low erosion. However, xenon is globally in short supply and expensive (approximately $3,000 per kg in 2021).

Some older ion thruster designs used mercury propellant. However, mercury is toxic, tended to contaminate spacecraft, and was difficult to feed accurately. A modern commercial prototype may be using mercury successfully however, mercury was formally banned as a propellant in 2022 by the Minamata Convention on Mercury.

From 2018–2023, krypton was used to fuel the Hall-effect thrusters aboard Starlink internet satellites, in part due to its lower cost than conventional xenon propellant. Starlink V2-mini satellites have since switched to argon Hall-effect thrusters, providing higher specific impulse.

Other propellants, such as bismuth and iodine, show promise both for gridless designs such as Hall-effect thrusters, and gridded ion thrusters.

Iodine was used as a propellant for the first time in space, in the NPT30-I2 gridded ion thruster by ThrustMe, on board the Beihangkongshi-1 mission launched in November 2020, with an extensive report published a year later in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;. The CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster (CAT) used on the Mars Array of Ionospheric Research Satellites Using the CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster (MARS-CAT) mission also proposes to use solid iodine as the propellant to minimize storage volume.

VASIMR design (and other plasma-based engines) are theoretically able to use practically any material for propellant. However, in current tests the most practical propellant is argon, which is relatively abundant and inexpensive.

== Energy efficiency ==
Ion thruster efficiency is the kinetic energy of the exhaust jet emitted per second divided by the electrical power into the device.

Overall system energy efficiency is determined by the propulsive efficiency, which depends on vehicle speed and exhaust speed. Some thrusters can vary exhaust speed in operation, but all can be designed with different exhaust speeds. At the lower end of specific impulse, &quot;I&quot;sp, the overall efficiency drops because ionization takes up a larger percentage energy and at the high end propulsive efficiency is reduced.

Optimal efficiencies and exhaust velocities for any given mission can be calculated to give minimum overall cost.

== Missions ==
Ion thrusters have many in-space propulsion applications. The best applications make use of the long mission interval when significant thrust is not needed. Examples of this include orbit transfers, attitude adjustments, drag compensation for low Earth orbits, fine adjustments for scientific missions and cargo transport between propellant depots, e.g., for chemical fuels. Ion thrusters can also be used for interplanetary and deep-space missions where acceleration rates are not crucial. Ion thrusters are seen as the best solution for these missions, as they require high change in velocity but do not require rapid acceleration. Continuous thrust over long durations can reach high velocities while consuming far less propellant than traditional chemical rockets.

=== Demonstration vehicles ===
==== SERT ====
Ion propulsion systems were first demonstrated in space by the NASA Lewis (now Glenn Research Center) missions Space Electric Rocket Test (SERT)-1 and SERT-2A. A SERT-1 suborbital flight was launched on 20 July 1964, and successfully proved that the technology operated as predicted in space. These were electrostatic ion thrusters using mercury and caesium as the reaction mass. SERT-2A, launched on 4 February 1970, verified the operation of two mercury ion engines for thousands of running hours.

=== Operational missions ===
Ion thrusters are routinely used for station-keeping on commercial and military communication satellites in geosynchronous orbit. The Soviet Union pioneered this field, using stationary plasma thrusters (SPTs) on satellites starting in the early 1970s.

Two geostationary satellites (ESA&#x27;s Artemis in 2001–2003 and the United States military&#x27;s AEHF-1 in 2010–2012) used the ion thruster to change orbit after the chemical-propellant engine failed. Boeing began using ion thrusters for station-keeping in 1997 and planned in 2013–2014 to offer a variant on their 702 platform, with no chemical engine and ion thrusters for orbit raising; this permits a significantly lower launch mass for a given satellite capability. AEHF-2 used a chemical engine to raise perigee to and proceeded to geosynchronous orbit using electric propulsion.

==== In Earth orbit ====
===== Tiangong space station =====
China&#x27;s Tiangong space station is fitted with ion thrusters. Its Tianhe core module is propelled by both chemical thrusters and four Hall-effect thrusters, which are used to adjust and maintain the station&#x27;s orbit. The development of the Hall-effect thrusters is considered a sensitive topic in China, with scientists &quot;working to improve the technology without attracting attention&quot;. Hall-effect thrusters are created with crewed mission safety in mind with effort to prevent erosion and damage caused by the accelerated ion particles. A magnetic field and specially designed ceramic shield was created to repel damaging particles and maintain integrity of the thrusters. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the ion drive used on Tiangong has burned continuously for 8,240 hours without a glitch, indicating their suitability for the Chinese space station&#x27;s designated 15-year lifespan. This is the world&#x27;s first Hall thruster on a human-rated mission.

===== Starlink =====
SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink satellite constellation uses Hall-effect thrusters powered by krypton or argon to raise orbit, perform maneuvers, and de-orbit at the end of their use.

===== GOCE =====
ESA&#x27;s Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) was launched on 16 March 2009. It used ion propulsion throughout its twenty-month mission to combat the air-drag it experienced in its low orbit (altitude of 255 kilometres) before intentionally deorbiting on 11 November 2013.

==== In deep space ====
===== Deep Space 1 =====
NASA developed the NSTAR ion engine for use in interplanetary science missions beginning in the late 1990s. It was space-tested in the space probe &quot;Deep Space 1&quot;, launched in 1998. This was the first use of electric propulsion as the interplanetary propulsion system on a science mission. Based on the NASA design criteria, Hughes Research Labs developed the Xenon Ion Propulsion System (XIPS) for performing station keeping on geosynchronous satellites. Hughes (EDD) manufactured the NSTAR thruster used on the spacecraft.

===== Hayabusa and Hayabusa2 =====
The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency&#x27;s &quot;Hayabusa&quot; space probe was launched in 2003 and rendezvoused with the asteroid 25143 Itokawa. It was powered by four xenon ion engines, which used microwave electron cyclotron resonance to ionize the propellant and an erosion-resistant carbon/carbon-composite material for its acceleration grid. Although the ion engines on &quot;Hayabusa&quot; experienced technical difficulties, in-flight reconfiguration allowed one of the four engines to be repaired and allowed the mission to successfully return to Earth.

Hayabusa2, launched in 2014, was based on Hayabusa. It also used ion thrusters.

===== Smart 1 =====
The European Space Agency&#x27;s satellite &quot;SMART-1&quot; launched in 2003 using a Snecma PPS-1350-G Hall thruster to get from GTO to lunar orbit. This satellite completed its mission on 3 September 2006, in a controlled collision on the Moon&#x27;s surface, after a trajectory deviation so scientists could see the 3-meter crater the impact created on the visible side of the Moon.

===== Dawn =====
&quot;Dawn&quot; launched on 27 September 2007, to explore the asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres. It used three &quot;Deep Space 1&quot; heritage xenon ion thrusters (firing one at a time). &quot;Dawn&quot; ion drive is capable of accelerating from 0 to in 4 days of continuous firing. The mission ended on 1 November 2018, when the spacecraft ran out of hydrazine chemical propellant for its attitude thrusters.

==== LISA Pathfinder ====
LISA Pathfinder is an ESA spacecraft launched in 2015 to orbit the Sun-Earth L1 point. It does not use ion thrusters as its primary propulsion system, but uses both colloid thrusters and FEEP for precise attitude control – the low thrusts of these propulsion devices make it possible to move the spacecraft incremental distances accurately. It is a test for the LISA mission. The mission ended on 30 December 2017.

==== BepiColombo ====
ESA&#x27;s BepiColombo mission was launched to Mercury on 20 October 2018. It uses ion thrusters in combination with swing-bys to get to Mercury, where a chemical rocket will complete orbit insertion.

==== Double Asteroid Redirection Test ====
NASA&#x27;s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) was launched in 2021 and operated its NEXT-C xenon ion thruster for about 1,000 hours to reach the target asteroid on 28 September 2022.

==== Psyche ====
NASA&#x27;s Psyche spacecraft was launched in 2023 and is operating its SPT-140 xenon ion thruster in order to reach asteroid 16 Psyche in August 2029.

=== Proposed missions ===
==== International Space Station ====
, a future launch of an Ad Astra VF-200 VASIMR electromagnetic thruster was under consideration for testing on the International Space Station (ISS). However, in 2015, NASA ended plans for flying the VF-200 to the ISS. A NASA spokesperson stated that the ISS &quot;was not an ideal demonstration platform for the desired performance level of the engines&quot;. Ad Astra stated that tests of a VASIMR thruster on the ISS would remain an option after a future in-space demonstration.

The VF-200 would have been a flight version of the VX-200. Since the available power from the ISS is less than 200 kW, the ISS VASIMR would have included a trickle-charged battery system allowing for 15 minutes pulses of thrust. The ISS orbits at a relatively low altitude and experiences fairly high levels of atmospheric drag, requiring periodic altitude boosts – a high-efficiency engine (high specific impulse) for station-keeping would be valuable; theoretically VASIMR reboosting could cut fuel cost from the current US$210 million annually to one-twentieth. VASIMR could in theory use as little as 300 kg of argon gas for ISS station-keeping instead of 7500 kg of chemical fuel – the high exhaust velocity (high specific impulse) would achieve the same acceleration with a smaller amount of propellant, compared to chemical propulsion with its lower exhaust velocity needing more fuel. Hydrogen is generated by the ISS as a by-product and is vented into space.

NASA previously worked on a 50 kW Hall-effect thruster for the ISS, but work was stopped in 2005.

==== Lunar Gateway ====
The Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) is a module on the Lunar Gateway that provides power generation and propulsion capabilities. It is targeting launch on a commercial vehicle in January 2024. It would probably use the 50 kW Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) under development at NASA Glenn Research Center and Aerojet Rocketdyne.

==== MARS-CAT ====
The MARS-CAT (Mars Array of ionospheric Research Satellites using the CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster) mission is a two 6U CubeSat concept mission to study Mars&#x27; ionosphere. The mission would investigate its plasma and magnetic structure, including transient plasma structures, magnetic field structure, magnetic activity and correlation with solar wind drivers. The CAT thruster is now called the RF thruster and manufactured by Phase Four.

==== Interstellar missions ====
Geoffrey A. Landis proposed using an ion thruster powered by a space-based laser, in conjunction with a lightsail, to propel an interstellar probe.

<doc id="37840" wikidata="Q17190065" url="?curid=37840" title="Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster">
<text>A magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thruster (MPDT) is a form of electrically powered spacecraft propulsion which uses the Lorentz force (the force on a charged particle by an electromagnetic field) to generate thrust. It is sometimes referred to as a Lorentz Force Accelerator (LFA) or (mostly in Japan) MPD arcjet.

Generally, a gaseous material is ionized and fed into an acceleration chamber, where the magnetic and electric fields are created using a power source. The particles are then propelled by the Lorentz force resulting from the interaction between the current flowing through the plasma and the magnetic field (which is either externally applied or induced by the current) out through the exhaust chamber. Unlike chemical propulsion, there is no combustion of fuel. As with other electric propulsion variations, both specific impulse and thrust increase with power input, while thrust per watt drops.

There are two main types of MPD thrusters, applied-field and self-field. Applied-field thrusters have magnetic rings surrounding the exhaust chamber to produce the magnetic field, while self-field thrusters have a cathode extending through the middle of the chamber. Applied fields are necessary at lower power levels, where self-field configurations are too weak. Various propellants such as xenon, neon, argon, hydrogen, hydrazine, and lithium have been used, with lithium generally being the best performer.

According to Edgar Choueiri magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters have input power 100–500 kilowatts, exhaust velocity 15–60 kilometers per second, thrust 2.5–25 newtons and efficiency 40–60 percent. However, additional research has shown that exhaust velocities can exceed 100 kilometers per second.

One potential application of magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters is the main propulsion engine for heavy cargo and piloted space vehicles (example engine formula_1 for human missions to Mars).

== Advantages ==
In theory, MPD thrusters could produce extremely high specific impulses (Isp) with an exhaust velocity of up to and beyond , triple the value of current xenon-based ion thrusters, and about 25 times better than liquid rockets. MPD technology also has the potential for thrust levels of up to 200 newtons (N) (), by far the highest for any form of electric propulsion, and nearly as high as many interplanetary chemical rockets. This would allow use of electric propulsion on missions which require quick delta-v maneuvers (such as capturing into orbit around another planet), but with many times greater fuel efficiency.

== Development ==
MPD thruster technology has been explored academically, but commercial interest has been low due to several remaining problems. One small problem is that power requirements on the order of hundreds of kilowatts are required for optimum performance. Current interplanetary spacecraft power systems (such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators and solar arrays) are incapable of producing that much power. NASA&#x27;s Project Prometheus reactor was expected to generate power in the hundreds of kilowatts range but was discontinued in 2005.

A project to produce a space-going nuclear reactor designed to generate 600 kilowatts of electrical power began in 1963 and ran for most of the 1960s in the USSR. It was to power a communication satellite which was in the end not approved. Nuclear reactors supplying kilowatts of electrical power (of the order of ten times more than current RTG power supplies) have been orbited by the USSR: RORSAT; and TOPAZ.

Plans to develop a megawatt-scale nuclear reactor for the use aboard a crewed spaceship were announced in 2009 by Russian nuclear Kurchatov Institute, national space agency Roskosmos, and confirmed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in his November 2009 address to the Federal Assembly.

Another plan, proposed by Bradley C. Edwards, is to beam power from the ground. This plan utilizes 5 200 kW free electron lasers at 0.84 micrometres with adaptive optics on the ground to beam power to the MPD-powered spacecraft, where it is converted to electricity by GaAs photovoltaic panels. The tuning of the laser wavelength of 0.840 micrometres ( per photon) and the photovoltaic panel bandgap of to each other produces an estimated conversion efficiency of 59% and a predicted power density of up to . This would be sufficient to power a MPD upper stage, perhaps to lift satellites from LEO to GEO.

Another problem with MPD technology has been the degradation of cathodes due to evaporation driven by high current densities (in excess of ). The use of lithium and barium propellant mixtures and multi-channel hollow cathodes has been shown in the laboratory to be a promising solution for the cathode erosion problem.

== Research ==
Research on MPD thrusters has been carried out in the US, the former Soviet Union, Japan, Germany, and Italy. Experimental prototypes were first flown on Soviet spacecraft and, most recently, in 1996, on the Japanese Space Flyer Unit, which demonstrated the successful operation of a quasi-steady pulsed MPD thruster in space. Research at Moscow Aviation Institute, RKK Energiya, National Aerospace University, Kharkiv Aviation Institute, Institute of Space Systems of the University of Stuttgart, ISAS, Centrospazio, Alta S.p.A., Osaka University, University of Southern California, Princeton University&#x27;s Electric Propulsion and Plasma Dynamics Lab (EPPDyL) (where MPD thruster research has continued uninterrupted since 1967), and NASA centers (Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Glenn Research Center), has resolved many problems related to the performance, stability and lifetime of MPD thrusters.

An MPD thruster was tested on board the Japanese Space Flyer Unit as part of EPEX (Electric Propulsion Experiment) that was launched March 18, 1995 and retrieved by space shuttle mission STS-72 January 20, 1996. To date, it is the only operational MPD thruster to have flown in space as a propulsion system. Experimental prototypes were first flown on Soviet spacecraft.

The applied-field MPD thruster in development at the Institute of Space Systems of the University of Stuttgart reached a thruster efficiency of 61.99% in 2019, corresponding to a specific impulse of Isp = 4665 s and 2.75 N of thrust.

<text>A pulsed plasma thruster (PPT), also known as a Pulsed Plasma Rocket (PPR), or as a plasma jet engine (PJE), is a form of electric spacecraft propulsion. PPTs are generally considered the simplest form of electric spacecraft propulsion and were the first form of electric propulsion to be flown in space, having flown on two Soviet probes (Zond 2 and Zond 3) starting in 1964. PPTs are generally flown on spacecraft with a surplus of electricity from abundantly available solar energy.

== Operation ==

Most PPTs use a solid material (normally PTFE, more commonly known as Teflon) for propellant, although very few use liquid or gaseous propellants. The first stage in PPT operation involves an arc of electricity passing through the fuel, causing ablation and sublimation of the fuel. The heat generated by this arc causes the resultant gas to turn into plasma, thereby creating a charged gas cloud. Due to the force of the ablation, the plasma is propelled at low speed between two charged plates (an anode and cathode). Since the plasma is charged, the fuel effectively completes the circuit between the two plates, allowing a current to flow through the plasma. This flow of electrons generates a strong electromagnetic field which then exerts a Lorentz force on the plasma, accelerating the plasma out of the PPT exhaust at high velocity. Its mode of operation is similar to a railgun. The pulsing occurs due to the time needed to recharge the plates following each burst of fuel, and the time between each arc. The frequency of pulsing is normally very high and so it generates an almost continuous and smooth thrust. While the thrust is very low, a PPT can operate continuously for extended periods of time, yielding a large final speed.

The energy used in each pulse is stored in a capacitor. By varying the time between each capacitor discharge, the thrust and power draw of the PPT can be varied allowing versatile use of the system.

== Comparison to chemical propulsion ==
The equation for the change in velocity of a spacecraft is given by the rocket equation as follows:
:formula_1

where:
:formula_2 is delta-v - the maximum change of speed of the vehicle (with no external forces acting),
:formula_3 is the effective exhaust velocity (formula_4 where formula_5 is the specific impulse expressed as a time period and formula_6 is standard gravity),
:formula_7 refers to the natural logarithm function,
:formula_8 is the initial total mass, including propellant,
:formula_9 is the final total mass.

PPTs have much higher exhaust velocities than chemical propulsion engines, but have a much smaller fuel flow rate. From the Tsiolkovsky equation stated above, this results in a proportionally higher final velocity of the propelled craft. The exhaust velocity of a PPT is of the order of tens of km/s while conventional chemical propulsion generates thermal velocities in the range of 2–4.5 km/s. Due to this lower thermal velocity, chemical propulsion units become exponentially less effective at higher vehicle velocities, necessitating the use of electric spacecraft propulsion such as PPTs. It is therefore advantageous to use an electric propulsion system such as a PPT to generate high interplanetary speeds in the range 20–70 km/s.

NASA&#x27;s research PPT (flown in 2000) achieved an exhaust velocity of 13,700 m/s, generated a thrust of 860 μN, and consumed 70W of electrical power.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
PPTs are very robust due to their inherently simple design (relative to other electric spacecraft propulsion techniques). As an electric propulsion system, PPTs benefit from reduced fuel consumption compared to traditional chemical rockets, reducing launch mass and therefore launch costs, as well as high specific impulse improving performance.

However, due to energy losses caused by late time ablation and rapid conductive heat transfer from the propellant to the rest of the spacecraft, propulsive efficiency (kinetic energy of exhaust / total energy used) is very low compared to other forms of electric propulsion, at around just 10%.

== Uses ==
PPTs are well-suited to uses on relatively small spacecraft with a mass of less than 100 kg (particularly CubeSats) for roles such as attitude control, station keeping, de-orbiting manoeuvres and deep space exploration. Using PPTs could double the life-span of these small satellite missions without significantly increasing complexity or cost due to the inherent simplicity and relatively low cost nature of PPTs.

The first use of PPTs was on the Soviet Zond 2 space probe which carried six PPTs that served as actuators of the attitude control system. The PPT propulsion system was tested for 70 minutes on the 14 December 1964 when the spacecraft was 4.2 million kilometers from Earth.

A PPT was flown by NASA in November, 2000, as a flight experiment on the Earth Observing-1 spacecraft. The thrusters successfully demonstrated the ability to perform roll control on the spacecraft and demonstrated that the electromagnetic interference from the pulsed plasma did not affect other spacecraft systems. Pulsed plasma thrusters are also an avenue of research used by universities for starting experiments with electric propulsion due to the relative simplicity and lower costs involved with PPTs as opposed to other forms of electric propulsion such as Hall-effect ion thrusters.

== Ongoing NASA research ==

On July 11, 2024 Howe Industries announced that it had contracted with NASA via a $725,000.00 grant to continue research on PPT/PPR propulsion technology. Howe Industries claimed that should PPT/PPR propulsion technology succeed in becoming a fully functional means of propelling space ships to Mars, then PPT/PPR technology should be capable of shortening travel time to Mars, down from the current requirement of approximately 1 year, to a much shorter travel time of only 2 months. Howe Industries further stated that at the current rate of their PPT/PPR research and development program, the technology may not be fully ready to propel a crewed space ship to Mars for approximately another 20 years (as of 2024).

<text>A nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) is a type of thermal rocket where the heat from a nuclear reaction replaces the chemical energy of the propellants in a chemical rocket. In an NTR, a working fluid, usually liquid hydrogen, is heated to a high temperature in a nuclear reactor and then expands through a rocket nozzle to create thrust. The external nuclear heat source theoretically allows a higher effective exhaust velocity and is expected to double or triple payload capacity compared to chemical propellants that store energy internally.

NTRs have been proposed as a spacecraft propulsion technology, with the earliest ground tests occurring in 1955. The United States maintained an NTR development program through 1973 when it was shut down for various reasons, including to focus on Space Shuttle development. Although more than ten reactors of varying power output have been built and tested, , no nuclear thermal rocket has flown.

Whereas all early applications for nuclear thermal rocket propulsion used fission processes, research in the 2010s has moved to fusion approaches. The Direct Fusion Drive project at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory is one such example, although &quot;energy-positive fusion has remained elusive&quot;. In 2019, the U.S. Congress approved US$125 million in development funding for nuclear thermal propulsion rockets.

In May 2022 DARPA issued an RFP for the next phase of their Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) nuclear thermal engine program. This follows on their selection, in 2021, of an early engine design by General Atomics and two spacecraft concepts from Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin. The next phases of the program will focus on the design, development, fabrication, and assembly of a nuclear thermal rocket engine.
In July 2023, Lockheed Martin was awarded the contract to build the spacecraft and BWX Technologies (BWXT) will develop the nuclear reactor. A launch is expected in 2027.

== Principle of operation ==
Nuclear-powered thermal rockets are more effective than chemical thermal rockets, primarily because they can use low-molecular-mass propellants such as hydrogen.

As thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rockets work almost exactly like chemical rockets: a heat source releases thermal energy into a gaseous propellant inside the body of the engine, and a nozzle at one end acts as a very simple heat engine: it allows the propellant to expand away from the vehicle, carrying momentum with it and converting thermal energy to coherent kinetic energy. The specific impulse (Isp) of the engine is set by the speed of the exhaust stream. That, in turn, varies as the square root of the kinetic energy loaded on each unit mass of propellant. The kinetic energy per molecule of propellant is determined by the temperature of the heat source (whether it be a nuclear reactor or a chemical reaction). At any particular temperature, lightweight propellant molecules carry just as much kinetic energy as heavier propellant molecules and therefore have more kinetic energy per unit mass. This makes low-molecular-mass propellants more effective than high-molecular-mass propellants.

Because chemical rockets and nuclear rockets are made from refractory solid materials, they are both limited to operate below , by the strength characteristics of high-temperature metals. Chemical rockets use the most readily available propellant, which is waste products from the chemical reactions producing their heat energy. Most liquid-fueled chemical rockets use either hydrogen or hydrocarbon combustion, and the propellant is therefore mainly water (molecular mass 18) and carbon dioxide (molecular mass 44). Nuclear thermal rockets using gaseous hydrogen propellant (molecular mass 2) therefore have a theoretical maximum specific impulse that is 3 to 4.5 times greater than those of chemical rockets.

== Early history ==
In 1944, Stanisław Ulam and Frederic de Hoffmann contemplated the idea of controlling the power of nuclear explosions to launch space vehicles. After World War II, the U.S. military started the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) based on the German V-2 rocket designs. Some large rockets were designed to carry nuclear warheads with nuclear-powered propulsion engines. As early as 1946, secret reports were prepared for the U.S. Air Force, as part of the NEPA project, by North American Aviation and Douglas Aircraft Company&#x27;s Project Rand. These groundbreaking reports identified a reactor engine in which a working fluid of low molecular weight is heated using a nuclear reactor as the most promising form of nuclear propulsion but identified many technical issues that needed to be resolved.

In January 1947, not aware of this classified research, engineers of the Applied Physics Laboratory published their research on nuclear power propulsion and their report was eventually classified. In May 1947, American-educated Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen presented his research on &quot;thermal jets&quot; powered by a porous graphite-moderated nuclear reactor at the Nuclear Science and Engineering Seminars LIV organized by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In 1948 and 1949, physicist Leslie Shepherd and rocket scientist Val Cleaver produced a series of groundbreaking scientific papers that considered how nuclear technology might be applied to interplanetary travel. The papers examined both nuclear-thermal and nuclear-electric propulsion.

== Early NASA engine development ==
Through Project Rover, Los Alamos National Laboratory began developing nuclear thermal engines as soon as 1955 and tested the world&#x27;s first experimental nuclear rocket engine, KIWI-A, in 1959. This work at Los Alamos was then continued through the NASA&#x27;s NERVA program (1961–1973). NERVA achieved many successes and improved upon the early prototypes to create powerful engines that were several times more efficient than chemical counterparts. However, the program was cancelled in 1973 due to budget constraints. To date no nuclear thermal propulsion system has ever been implemented in space.

== Nuclear fuel types ==
A nuclear thermal rocket can be categorized by the type of reactor, ranging from a relatively simple solid reactor up to the much more difficult to construct but theoretically more efficient gas core reactor. As with all thermal rocket designs, the specific impulse produced is proportional to the square root of the temperature to which the working fluid (reaction mass) is heated. To extract maximum efficiency, the temperature must be as high as possible. For a given design, the temperature that can be attained is typically determined by the materials chosen for reactor structures, the nuclear fuel, and the fuel cladding. Erosion is also a concern, especially the loss of fuel and associated releases of radioactivity.

=== Solid core ===
Solid core nuclear reactors have been fueled by compounds of uranium that exist in solid phase under the conditions encountered and undergo nuclear fission to release energy. Flight reactors must be lightweight and capable of tolerating extremely high temperatures, as the only coolant available is the working fluid/propellant. A nuclear solid core engine is the simplest design to construct and is the concept used on all tested NTRs.

Using hydrogen as a propellant, a solid core design would typically deliver specific impulses (Isp) on the order of 850 to 1000 seconds, which is about twice that of liquid hydrogen-oxygen designs such as the Space Shuttle main engine. Other propellants have also been proposed, such as ammonia, water, or LOX, but these propellants would provide reduced exhaust velocity and performance at a marginally reduced fuel cost. Yet another mark in favor of hydrogen is that at low pressures it begins to dissociate at about 1500 K, and at high pressures around 3000 K. This lowers the mass of the exhaust species, increasing Isp.

Early publications were doubtful of space applications for nuclear engines. In 1947, a complete nuclear reactor was so heavy that solid core nuclear thermal engines would be entirely unable to achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1:1, which is needed to overcome the gravity of the Earth at launch. Over the next twenty-five years, U.S. nuclear thermal rocket designs eventually reached thrust-to-weight ratios of approximately 7:1. This is still a much lower thrust-to-weight ratio than what is achievable with chemical rockets, which have thrust-to-weight ratios on the order of 70:1. Combined with the large tanks necessary for liquid hydrogen storage, this means that solid core nuclear thermal engines are best suited for use in orbit outside Earth&#x27;s gravity well, not to mention avoiding the radioactive contamination that would result from atmospheric use (if an &quot;open-cycle&quot; design was used, as opposed to a lower-performance &quot;closed cycle&quot; design where no radioactive material was allowed to escape with the rocket propellant.)

One way to increase the working temperature of the reactor is to change the nuclear fuel elements. This is the basis of the particle-bed reactor, which is fueled by several (typically spherical) elements that &quot;float&quot; inside the hydrogen working fluid. Spinning the entire engine could prevent the fuel element from being ejected out the nozzle. This design is thought to be capable of increasing the specific impulse to about 1000 seconds (9.8 kN·s/kg) at the cost of increased complexity. Such a design could share design elements with a pebble-bed reactor, several of which are currently generating electricity. From 1987 through 1991, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) Office funded Project Timberwind, a non-rotating nuclear thermal rocket based on particle bed technology. The project was canceled before testing.

=== Pulsed nuclear thermal rocket ===


In a conventional solid core design, the maximum exhaust temperature of the working mass is that of the reactor, and in practice, lower than that. That temperature represents an energy far below that of the individual neutrons released by the fission reactions. Their energy is spread out through the reactor mass, causing it to thermalize. In power plant designs, the core is then cooled, typically using water. In the case of a nuclear engine, the water is replaced by hydrogen, but the concept is otherwise similar.

Pulsed reactors attempt to transfer the energy directly from the neutrons to the working mass, allowing the exhaust to reach temperatures far beyond the melting point of the reactor core. As specific impulse varies directly with temperature, capturing the energy of the relativistic neutrons allows for a dramatic increase in performance.

To do this, pulsed reactors operate in a series of brief pulses rather than the continual chain reaction of a conventional reactor. The reactor is normally off, allowing it to cool. It is then turned on, along with the cooling system or fuel flow, operating at a very high power level. At this level the core rapidly begins to heat up, so once a set temperature is reached, the reactor is quickly turned off again. During these pulses, the power being produced is far greater than the same sized reactor could produce continually. The key to this approach is that while the total amount of fuel that can be pumped through the reactor during these brief pulses is small, the resulting efficiency of these pulses is much higher.

Generally, the designs would not be operated solely in the pulsed mode but could vary their duty cycle depending on the need. For instance, during a high-thrust phase of flight, like exiting a low earth orbit, the engine could operate continually and provide an Isp similar to that of traditional solid-core design. But during a long-duration cruise, the engine would switch to pulsed mode to make better use of its fuel.

=== Liquid core ===
Liquid core nuclear engines are fueled by compounds of fissionable elements in liquid phase. A liquid-core engine is proposed to operate at temperatures above the melting point of solid nuclear fuel and cladding, with the maximum operating temperature of the engine instead of being determined by the reactor pressure vessel and neutron reflector material. The higher operating temperatures would be expected to deliver specific impulse performance on the order of 1300 to 1500 seconds (12.8-14.8 kN·s/kg).

A liquid-core reactor would be extremely difficult to build with current technology. One major issue is that the reaction time of the nuclear fuel is much longer than the heating time of the working fluid. If the nuclear fuel and working fluid are not physically separated, this means that the fuel must be trapped inside the engine while the working fluid is allowed to easily exit through the nozzle. One possible solution is to rotate the fuel/fluid mixture at very high speeds to force the higher-density fuel to the outside, but this would expose the reactor pressure vessel to the maximum operating temperature while adding mass, complexity, and moving parts.

An alternative liquid-core design is the nuclear salt-water rocket. In this design, water is the working fluid and also serves as the neutron moderator. Nuclear fuel is not retained, which drastically simplifies the design. However, the rocket would discharge massive quantities of extremely radioactive waste and could only be safely operated well outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and perhaps even magnetosphere.

=== Gas core ===

The final fission classification is the gas-core engine. This is a modification to the liquid-core design which uses rapid circulation of the fluid to create a toroidal pocket of gaseous uranium fuel in the middle of the reactor, surrounded by hydrogen. In this case, the fuel does not touch the reactor wall at all, so temperatures could reach several tens of thousands of degrees, which would allow specific impulses of 3000 to 5000 seconds (30 to 50 kN·s/kg). In this basic design, the &quot;open cycle&quot;, the losses of nuclear fuel would be difficult to control, which has led to studies of the &quot;closed cycle&quot; or nuclear lightbulb engine, where the gaseous nuclear fuel is contained in a super-high-temperature quartz container, over which the hydrogen flows. The closed-cycle engine has much more in common with the solid-core design, but this time is limited by the critical temperature of quartz instead of the fuel and cladding. Although less efficient than the open-cycle design, the closed-cycle design is expected to deliver a specific impulse of about 1500 to 2000 seconds (15 to 20 kN·s/kg).

== Solid core fission designs in practice ==
=== Soviet Union and Russia ===
The Soviet RD-0410 went through a series of tests at the nuclear test site near Semipalatinsk Test Site.

In October 2018, Russia&#x27;s Keldysh Research Center confirmed a successful ground test of waste heat radiators for a nuclear space engine, as well as previous tests of fuel rods and ion engines.

=== United States ===
Development of solid core NTRs started in 1955 under the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as Project Rover and ran to 1973. Work on a suitable reactor was conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Area 25 (Nevada National Security Site) in the Nevada Test Site. Four basic designs came from this project: KIWI, Phoebus, Pewee, and the Nuclear Furnace. Twenty individual engines were tested, with a total of over 17 hours of engine run time.

When NASA was formed in 1958, it was given authority over all non-nuclear aspects of the Rover program. To enable cooperation with the AEC and keep classified information compartmentalized, the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (SNPO) was formed at the same time. The 1961 NERVA program was intended to lead to the entry of nuclear thermal rocket engines into space exploration. Unlike the AEC work, which was intended to study the reactor design itself, NERVA&#x27;s goal was to produce a real engine that could be deployed on space missions. The thrust baseline NERVA design was based on the KIWI B4 series.

Tested engines included Kiwi, Phoebus, NRX/EST, NRX/XE, Pewee, Pewee 2, and the Nuclear Furnace. Progressively higher power densities culminated in the Pewee. Tests of the improved Pewee 2 design were canceled in 1970 in favor of the lower-cost Nuclear Furnace (NF-1), and the U.S. nuclear rocket program officially ended in the spring of 1973. During this program, the NERVA accumulated over 2 hours of run time, including 28 minutes at full power. The SNPO considered NERVA to be the last technology development reactor required to proceed to flight prototypes.

Several other solid-core engines have also been studied to some degree. The Small Nuclear Rocket Engine, or SNRE, was designed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for upper stage use, both on uncrewed launchers and the Space Shuttle. It featured a split-nozzle that could be rotated to the side, allowing it to take up less room in the Shuttle cargo bay. The design provided 73 kN of thrust and operated at a specific impulse of 875 seconds (8.58 kN·s/kg), and it was planned to increase this to 975 seconds, achieving a mass fraction of about 0.74, compared with 0.86 for the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME).

A related design that saw some work, but never made it to the prototype stage, was Dumbo. Dumbo was similar to KIWI/NERVA in concept, but used more advanced construction techniques to lower the weight of the reactor. The Dumbo reactor consisted of several large barrel-like tubes, which were in turn constructed of stacked plates of corrugated material. The corrugations were lined up so that the resulting stack had channels running from the inside to the outside. Some of these channels were filled with uranium fuel, others with a moderator, and some were left open as a gas channel. Hydrogen was pumped into the middle of the tube and would be heated by the fuel as it traveled through the channels as it worked its way to the outside. The resulting system was lighter than a conventional design for any particular amount of fuel.

Between 1987 and 1991, an advanced engine design was studied under Project Timberwind, under the Strategic Defense Initiative, which was later expanded into a larger design in the Space Thermal Nuclear Propulsion (STNP) program. Advances in high-temperature metals, computer modeling, and nuclear engineering, in general, resulted in dramatically improved performance. While the NERVA engine was projected to weigh about , the final STNP offered just over 1/3 the thrust from an engine of only by improving the Isp to between 930 and 1000 seconds.

==== Test firings ====
KIWI was the first to be fired, starting in July 1959 with KIWI 1. The reactor was not intended for flight and was named after the flightless bird, Kiwi. The core was simply a stack of uncoated uranium oxide plates onto which the hydrogen was dumped. The thermal output of 70 MW at an exhaust temperature of 2683 K was generated. Two additional tests of the basic concept, A1 and A3, added coatings to the plates to test fuel rod concepts.

The KIWI B series was fueled by tiny uranium dioxide (UO2) spheres embedded in a low-boron graphite matrix and coated with niobium carbide. Nineteen holes ran the length of the bundles, through which the liquid hydrogen flowed. On the initial firings, immense heat and vibration cracked the fuel bundles. The graphite materials used in the reactor&#x27;s construction were resistant to high temperatures but eroded under the stream of superheated hydrogen, a reducing agent. The fuel species was later switched to uranium carbide, with the last engine run in 1964. The fuel bundle erosion and cracking problems were improved but never completely solved, despite promising materials work at the Argonne National Laboratory.

NERVA NRX (Nuclear Rocket Experimental), started testing in September 1964. The final engine in this series was the XE, designed with flight representative hardware and fired into a low-pressure chamber to simulate a vacuum. SNPO fired NERVA NRX/XE twenty-eight times in March 1968. The series all generated 1100 MW, and many of the tests concluded only when the test-stand ran out of hydrogen propellant. NERVA NRX/XE produced the baseline thrust that Marshall Space Flight Center required in Mars mission plans. The last NRX firing lost of nuclear fuel in 2 hours of testing, which was judged sufficient for space missions by SNPO.

Building on the KIWI series, the Phoebus series were much larger reactors. The first 1A test in June 1965 ran for over 10 minutes at 1090 MW and an exhaust temperature of 2370 K. The B run in February 1967 improved this to 1500 MW for 30 minutes. The final 2A test in June 1968 ran for over 12 minutes at 4000 MW, at the time the most powerful nuclear reactor ever built.

A smaller version of KIWI, the Pewee was also built. It was fired several times at 500 MW to test coatings made of zirconium carbide (instead of niobium carbide) but Pewee also increased the power density of the system. A water-cooled system is known as NF-1 (for &quot;Nuclear Furnace&quot;) used Pewee 2&#x27;s fuel elements for future materials testing, showing a factor of 3 reductions in fuel corrosion still further. Pewee 2 was never tested on the stand and became the basis for current NTR designs being researched at NASA&#x27;s Glenn Research Center and Marshall Space flight Center.

The NERVA/Rover project was eventually canceled in 1972 with the general wind-down of NASA in the post-Apollo era. Without a human mission to Mars, the need for a nuclear thermal rocket is unclear. Another problem would be public concerns about safety and radioactive contamination.

==== Kiwi-TNT destructive test ====
In January 1965, the U.S. Rover program intentionally modified a Kiwi reactor (KIWI-TNT) to go prompt critical, resulting in immediate destruction of the reactor pressure vessel, nozzle, and fuel assemblies. Intended to simulate a worst-case scenario of a fall from altitude into the ocean, such as might occur in a booster failure after launch, the resulting release of radiation would have caused fatalities out to and injuries out to . The reactor was positioned on a railroad car in the Jackass Flats area of the Nevada Test Site.

=== United Kingdom ===
As of January 2012, the propulsion group for Project Icarus was studying an NTR propulsion system, but has seen little activity since 2019.

=== Israel ===
In 1987, Ronen &amp; Leibson published a study on applications of 242mAm (one of the isotopes of americium) as nuclear fuel to space nuclear reactors, noting its extremely high thermal cross section and energy density. Nuclear systems powered by 242mAm require less fuel by a factor of 2 to 100 compared to conventional nuclear fuels.

Fission-fragment rocket using 242mAm was proposed by George Chapline at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1988, who suggested propulsion based on the direct heating of a propellant gas by fission fragments generated by a fissile material. Ronen et al. demonstrate that 242mAm can maintain sustained nuclear fission as an extremely thin metallic film, less than 1/1000 of a millimeter thick. 242mAm requires only 1% of the mass of 235U or 239Pu to reach its critical state. Ronen&#x27;s group at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev further showed that nuclear fuel based on 242mAm could speed space vehicles from Earth to Mars in as little as two weeks.

The 242mAm as a nuclear fuel is derived from the fact that it has the highest thermal fission cross section (thousands of barns), about 10x the next highest cross section across all known isotopes. The 242mAm is fissile (because it has an odd number of neutrons) and has a low critical mass, comparable to that of 239Pu.

It has a very high cross section for fission, and if in a nuclear reactor is destroyed relatively quickly. Another report claims that 242mAm can sustain a chain reaction even as a thin film, and could be used for a novel type of nuclear rocket.

Since the thermal absorption cross section of 242mAm is very high, the best way to obtain 242mAm is by the capture of fast or epithermal neutrons in Americium-241 irradiated in a fast reactor. However, fast spectrum reactors are not readily available. Detailed analysis of 242mAm breeding in existing pressurized water reactors (PWRs) was provided. Proliferation resistance of 242mAm was reported by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology 2008 study.

=== Italy ===
In 2000, Carlo Rubbia at CERN further extended the work by Ronen and Chapline on a Fission-fragment rocket using 242mAm as a fuel. Project 242 based on Rubbia design studied a concept of 242mAm based Thin-Film Fission Fragment Heated NTR by using a direct conversion of the kinetic energy of fission fragments into increasing of enthalpy of a propellant gas. Project 242 studied the application of this propulsion system to a crewed mission to Mars. Preliminary results were very satisfactory, and it has been observed that a propulsion system with these characteristics could make the mission feasible. Another study focused on the production of 242mAm in conventional thermal nuclear reactors.

In 2022, the European Space Agency launched an initiative called &quot;Preliminary European Reckon on Nuclear Electric Propulsion for Space Applications&quot; (RocketRoll) and commissioned a consortium of companies to conduct a study on electric thrusters powered by nuclear energy, known as Nuclear Electric Propulsion. The study outlines the roadmap for the launch of a nuclear propulsion demonstrator in 2035.

=== Current research in the US since 2000 ===

Current solid-core nuclear thermal rocket designs are intended to greatly limit the dispersion and break-up of radioactive fuel elements in the event of a catastrophic failure.

As of 2013, an NTR for interplanetary travel from Earth orbit to Mars orbit is being studied at Marshall Space Flight Center with Glenn Research Center. In historical ground testing, NTRs proved to be at least twice as efficient as the most advanced chemical engines, which would allow for quicker transfer time and increased cargo capacity. The shorter flight duration, estimated at 3–4 months with NTR engines, compared to 6–9 months using chemical engines, would reduce crew exposure to potentially harmful and difficult to shield cosmic rays. NTR engines, such as the Pewee of Project Rover, were selected in the Mars Design Reference Architecture (DRA).

In 2017, NASA continued research and development on NTRs, designing for space applications with civilian approved materials, with a three-year, US$18.8 million contract.

In 2019, an appropriation bill passed by the U.S. Congress included US$125 million in funding for nuclear thermal propulsion research, including planning for a flight demonstration mission by 2024.

As of 2021, there has been much interest in nuclear thermal rockets by the United States Space Force and DARPA for orbital and cis-lunar uses. In addition to the U.S. military, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine has also expressed interest in the project and its potential applications for a future mission to Mars. DARPA has awarded 2 contracts for their Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program, which aims to demonstrate a nuclear thermal propulsion system in orbit: one award in September 2020 to Gryphon Technologies for US$14 million, and another award in April 2021 to General Atomics for US$22 million, both for preliminary designs for the reactor. Two conceptual spacecraft designs by Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin were selected. Proposals for a flight demonstration of nuclear thermal propulsion in FY2026 were due on 5 August 2022.

In January 2023, NASA and DARPA announced a partnership on DRACO to demonstrate an NTR engine in space, an enabling capability for NASA crewed missions to Mars. In July 2023, U.S. agencies announced that Lockheed Martin had been awarded a $499 million contract to assemble the experimental nuclear thermal reactor vehicle (X-NTRV) and its engine.
== Risks ==
An atmospheric or orbital rocket failure could result in the dispersal of radioactive material into the environment. A collision with orbital debris, material failure due to uncontrolled fission, material imperfections or fatigue, or human design flaws could cause a containment breach of the fissile material. Such a catastrophic failure while in flight could release radioactive material over the Earth in a wide and unpredictable area. The amount of contamination would depend on the size of the nuclear thermal rocket engine, while the zone of contamination and its concentration would be dependent on prevailing weather and orbital parameters at the time of re-entry.

It is considered unlikely that a reactor&#x27;s fuel elements would be spread over a wide area, as they are composed of materials such as carbon composites or carbides and are normally coated with zirconium hydride. Before criticality occurs, solid core NTR fuel is not particularly hazardous. Once the reactor has been started for the first time, extremely radioactive short-life fission products are produced, as well as less radioactive but extremely long-lived fission products. The amount of fission products is zero at fresh-fueled startup, and roughly proportional to (actually: limited by) the total amount of fission heat produced since fresh-fueled startup. Additionally, all engine structures are exposed to direct neutron bombardment, resulting in their radioactive activation.

<text>A nuclear electric rocket (more properly nuclear electric propulsion) is a type of spacecraft propulsion system where thermal energy from a nuclear reactor is converted to electrical energy, which is used to drive an ion thruster or other electrical spacecraft propulsion technology. The nuclear electric rocket terminology is slightly inconsistent, as technically the &quot;rocket&quot; part of the propulsion system is non-nuclear and could also be driven by solar panels. This is in contrast with a nuclear thermal rocket, which directly uses reactor heat to add energy to a working fluid, which is then expelled out of a rocket nozzle.

==Conceptual overview==
The key elements to NEP are:
# A compact reactor core
# An electric generator
# A compact waste heat rejection system such as heat pipes
# An electric power conditioning and distribution system
# Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion

==History==
===United States===
A 1963 paper by Myron Levoy proposed a hybrid nuclear-electric engine design, which would have been able to work both in open-cycle mode as a nuclear thermal engine during mission phases requiring high thrust, as well as in closed-cycle mode as a nuclear-electric engine with low thrust, but high efficiency during remaining mission phases. The proposed application of this engine design was for a fast human-crewed round-trip mission to Mars.

In 2001, the Safe affordable fission engine was under development, with a tested 30 kW nuclear heat source intended to lead to the development of a 400 kW thermal reactor with Brayton cycle gas turbines to produce electric power. Waste heat rejection was intended to be accomplished using low-mass heat pipe technology. Safety was intended to be assured by a rugged design.

Project Prometheus was an early 2000s NASA study on nuclear electric spacecraft.

Kilopower is the latest NASA reactor development program, but is intended for surface use only.

===Russia===

The TEM project started in 2009 with the goal of powering a Mars engine.

==Concepts==
===Pebble bed reactor combined with gas turbine===
A pebble bed reactor using high mass-flow gaseous nitrogen coolant near normal atmospheric pressures is a possible heat source. Power generation could be accomplished with gas turbine technology, which is well developed. Nuclear fuel would be highly enriched uranium encapsulated in low-boron graphite balls probably 5–10 cm in diameter. The graphite would also moderate the neutrons of the nuclear reaction.

This style of reactor can be designed to be inherently safe. As it heats, the graphite expands, separating the fuel and reducing the reactor&#x27;s criticality. This property can simplify the operating controls to a single valve throttling the turbine. When closed, the reactor heats, but produces less power. When open, the reactor cools, but becomes more critical and produces more power.

The graphite encapsulation simplifies refueling and waste handling. Graphite is mechanically strong, and resists high temperatures. This reduces the risk of an unplanned release of radioactive elements, including fission products. Since this style of reactor produces high power without heavy castings to contain high pressures, it is well suited to power spacecraft.

===Novel electric propulsion concepts===
A variety of electric propulsion technologies have been proposed for use with high power nuclear electrical generation systems, including VASIMR, DS4G, and pulsed inductive thruster (PIT). PIT and VASIMR are unique in their ability to trade between power usage, specific impulse (a measure of efficiency, see specific impulse) and thrust in-flight. PIT has the additional advantage of not needing conditioned power.

===Electrical generation===
A number of heat-to-electricity schemes have been proposed. In the near term, Rankine cycle, Brayton cycle, and Stirling cycle generators go through an intermediate mechanical phase, with attendant energy losses. More exotic technologies have also been proposed: thermoelectric (including graphene-based thermal power conversion), pyroelectric, thermophotovoltaic, thermionic and magnetohydrodynamic type thermoelectric materials.

==Other types of nuclear power concepts in space==

Radioisotope thermoelectric generators, radioisotope heater units, radioisotope piezoelectric generators, and the radioisotope rocket all use the heat from a static radioactive source (usually Plutonium-238) for a low level of electric or direct propulsion power. Other concepts include the nuclear thermal rocket, the fission fragment rocket, nuclear pulse propulsion, and the possibility of a fusion rocket, assuming that nuclear fusion technology is developed at some point in the near future.

<doc id="37844" wikidata="Q868705" url="?curid=37844" title="Mass driver">
<text>A mass driver or electromagnetic catapult is a proposed method of non-rocket spacelaunch which would use a linear motor to accelerate and catapult payloads up to high speeds. Existing and proposed mass drivers use coils of wire energized by electricity to make electromagnets, though a rotary mass driver has also been proposed. Sequential firing of a row of electromagnets accelerates the payload along a path. After leaving the path, the payload continues to move due to momentum.

Although any device used to propel a ballistic payload is technically a mass driver, in this context a mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload. Once the payload has been accelerated, the two separate, and the holder is slowed and recycled for another payload.

Mass drivers can be used to propel spacecraft in three different ways: A large, ground-based mass driver could launch spacecraft away from Earth, the Moon, or another body. A small mass driver could act as a rocket engine on board a spacecraft, flinging pieces of material into space to propel itself. Another variation would have a massive facility on a moon or asteroid send projectiles to assist a distant craft.

Miniaturized mass drivers can also be used as weapons in a similar manner as classic firearms or cannon using chemical combustion. Hybrids between coilguns and railguns such as helical railguns are also possible.

==Fixed mass drivers==

Mass drivers need no physical contact between moving parts because they guide their projectiles by dynamic magnetic levitation, allowing extreme reusability in the case of solid-state power switching, and a functional life of – theoretically – up to millions of launches. While marginal costs tend to be accordingly low, initial development and construction costs are highly dependent on performance, especially the intended mass, acceleration, and velocity of projectiles. For instance, while Gerard O&#x27;Neill built his first mass driver in 1976–1977 with a $2000 budget, a short test model firing a projectile at 40 m/s and 33 g,
his next model had an order-of-magnitude greater acceleration
after a comparable increase in funding, and, a few years later, researchers at the University of Texas estimated that a mass driver firing a 10 kilogram projectile at 6000 m/s would cost $47 million.

For a given amount of energy involved, heavier objects go proportionally slower. Lightweight objects may be projected at 20 km/s or more. The limits are generally the expense of energy storage able to be discharged quickly enough and the cost of power switching, which may be by semiconductors or by gas-phase switches (which still often have a niche in extreme pulse power applications). However, energy can be stored inductively in superconducting coils. A 1 km long mass driver made of superconducting coils can accelerate a 20 kg vehicle to 10.5 km/s at a conversion efficiency of 80%, and average acceleration of 5,600 g.

Earth-based mass drivers for propelling vehicles to orbit, such as the StarTram concept, would require considerable capital investment. The Earth&#x27;s relatively strong gravity and relatively thick atmosphere make the implementation of a practical solution difficult. Also, most if not all plausible launch sites would propel spacecraft through heavily-traversed air routes. Due to the massive turbulence such launches would cause, significant air traffic control measures would be needed to ensure the safety of other aircraft operating in the area.

With the proliferation of reusable rockets to launch from Earth (especially first stages) whatever potential might have once existed for any economic advantage in using mass drivers as an alternative to chemical rockets to launch from Earth is becoming increasingly doubtful. For these reasons many proposals feature installing mass drivers on the Moon where the lower gravity and lack of atmosphere greatly reduce the required velocity to reach lunar orbit; also, lunar launches from a fixed position are much less likely to generate issues with respect to matters such as traffic control.

Most serious mass-driver designs use superconducting coils to achieve reasonable energetic efficiency (often 50% to 90+%, depending on design). Equipment may include a superconducting bucket or aluminum coil as the payload. The coils of a mass driver can induce eddy currents in a payload&#x27;s aluminum coil, and then act on the resulting magnetic field. There are two sections of a mass driver. The maximum acceleration part spaces the coils at constant distances, and synchronizes the coil currents to the bucket. In this section, the acceleration increases as the velocity increases, up to the maximum that the bucket can take. After that, the constant acceleration region begins. This region spaces the coils at increasing distances to give a fixed amount of velocity increase per unit of time.

Based on this mode, a major proposal for the use of mass drivers involved transporting lunar-surface material to space habitats for processing using solar energy. The Space Studies Institute showed that this application was reasonably practical.

In some designs, the payload would be held in a bucket and then released, so that the bucket can be decelerated and reused. A disposable bucket, on the other hand, would avail acceleration along the whole track. Alternatively, if a track were constructed along the entire circumference of the Moon (or any other celestial body without a significant atmosphere) then a reusable bucket&#x27;s acceleration would not be limited by the length of the track – however, such a system would need to be engineered to withstand substantial centrifugal forces if it were intended to accelerate passengers and/or cargo to very high velocities. 

===On Earth===
In contrast to cargo-only chemical space-gun concepts, a mass driver could be any length, affordable, and with relatively smooth acceleration throughout, optionally even lengthy enough to reach target velocity without excessive g forces for passengers. It can be constructed as a very long and mainly horizontally aligned launch track for spacelaunch, targeted upwards at the end, partly by bending of the track upwards and partly by Earth&#x27;s curvature in the other direction.

Natural elevations, such as mountains, may facilitate the construction of the distant, upwardly targeted part. The higher up the track terminates, the less resistance from the atmosphere the launched object will encounter.

The 40 megajoules per kilogram or less kinetic energy of projectiles launched at up to 9000 m/s velocity (if including extra for drag losses) towards low Earth orbit is a few kilowatt-hours per kilogram if efficiencies are relatively high, which accordingly has been hypothesized to be under $1 of electrical energy cost per kilogram shipped to LEO, though total costs would be far more than electricity alone. By being mainly located slightly above, on or beneath the ground, a mass driver may be easier to maintain compared with many other structures of non-rocket spacelaunch. Whether or not underground, it needs to be housed in a pipe that is vacuum pumped in order to prevent internal air drag, such as with a mechanical shutter kept closed most of the time but a plasma window used during the moments of firing to prevent loss of vacuum.

A mass driver on Earth would usually be a compromise system. A mass driver would accelerate a payload up to some high speed which would not be enough for orbit. It would then release the payload, which would complete the launch with rockets. This would drastically reduce the amount of velocity needed to be provided by rockets to reach orbit. Well under a tenth of orbital velocity from a small rocket thruster is enough to raise perigee if a design prioritizes minimizing such, but hybrid proposals optionally reduce requirements for the mass driver itself by having a greater portion of delta-v by a rocket burn (or orbital momentum exchange tether). On Earth, a mass-driver design could possibly use well-tested maglev components.

To launch a space vehicle with humans on board, a mass driver&#x27;s track would need to be almost 1000 kilometres long if providing almost all the velocity to Low Earth Orbit, though a lesser length could still provide major launch assist. Required length, if accelerating mainly at near a constant maximum acceptable g-force for passengers, is proportional to velocity squared. For instance, half of the velocity goal could correspond to a tunnel a quarter as long needing to be constructed, for the same acceleration. For rugged objects, much higher accelerations may suffice, allowing a far shorter track, potentially circular or helical (spiral). Another concept involves a large ring design whereby a space vehicle would circle the ring numerous times, gradually gaining speed, before being released into a launch corridor leading skyward.

Mass drivers have been proposed for the disposal of nuclear waste in space: a projectile launched at much above Earth&#x27;s escape velocity would escape the Solar System, with atmospheric passage at such speed calculated as survivable through an elongated projectile and a very substantial heatshield.

==Spacecraft-based mass drivers==
A spacecraft could carry a mass driver as its primary engine. With a suitable source of electrical power (probably a nuclear reactor) the spaceship could then use the mass driver to accelerate pieces of matter of almost any sort, boosting itself in the opposite direction. At the smallest scale of reaction mass, this type of drive is called an ion drive.

No absolute theoretical limit is known for the size, acceleration or muzzle energy of linear motors. However, practical engineering constraints apply for such as the power-to-mass ratio, waste heat dissipation, and the energy intake able to be supplied and handled. Exhaust velocity is best neither too low nor too high.

There is a mission-dependent limited optimal exhaust velocity and specific impulse for any thruster constrained by a limited amount of onboard spacecraft power. Thrust and momentum from exhaust, per unit mass expelled, scales up linearly with its velocity (momentum = mv), yet kinetic energy and energy input requirements scale up faster with velocity squared (kinetic energy = mv2). Too low an exhaust velocity would excessively increase propellant mass needed under the rocket equation, with too high a fraction of energy going into accelerating propellant not used yet. Higher exhaust velocity has both benefit and tradeoff, increasing propellant usage efficiency (more momentum per unit mass of propellant expelled) but decreasing thrust and the current rate of spacecraft acceleration if available input power is constant (less momentum per unit of energy given to propellant).

Electric propulsion methods like mass drivers are systems where energy does not come from the propellant itself. (This contrasts with chemical rockets where propulsive efficiency varies with the ratio of exhaust velocity to vehicle velocity at the time, but near maximum obtainable specific impulse tends to be a design goal when corresponding to the most energy released from reacting propellants). Although the specific impulse of an electric thruster itself optionally could range up to where mass drivers merge into particle accelerators with fractional-lightspeed exhaust velocity for tiny particles, trying to use extreme exhaust velocity to accelerate a far slower spacecraft could be suboptimally low thrust when the energy available from a spacecraft&#x27;s reactor or power source is limited (a lesser analogue of feeding onboard power to a row of spotlights, photons being an example of an extremely low momentum to energy ratio).

For instance, if limited onboard power fed to its engine was the dominant limitation on how much payload a hypothetical spacecraft could shuttle (such as if intrinsic propellant economic cost was minor from usage of extraterrestrial soil or ice), ideal exhaust velocity would rather be around 62.75% of total mission delta v if operating at constant specific impulse, except greater optimization could come from varying exhaust velocity during the mission profile (as possible with some thruster types, including mass drivers and variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rockets).

Since a mass driver could use any type of mass for reaction mass to move the spacecraft, a mass driver or some variation seems ideal for deep-space vehicles that scavenge reaction mass from found resources.

One possible drawback of the mass driver is that it has the potential to send solid reaction mass travelling at dangerously high relative speeds into useful orbits and traffic lanes. To overcome this problem, most schemes plan to throw finely-divided dust. Alternatively, liquid oxygen could be used as reaction mass, which upon release would boil down to its molecular state. Propelling the reaction mass to solar escape velocity is another way to ensure that it will not remain a hazard.

==Hybrid mass drivers==

A mass driver on a spacecraft could be used to &quot;reflect&quot; masses from a stationary mass driver. Each deceleration and acceleration of the mass contributes to the momentum of the spacecraft. The lightweight, fast spacecraft need not carry reaction mass, and does not need much electricity beyond the amount needed to replace losses in the electronics, while the immobile support facility can run off power plants able to be much larger than the spacecraft if needed. This could be considered a form of beam-powered propulsion (a macroscopic-scale analogue of a particle beam propelled magsail). A similar system could also deliver pellets of fuel to a spacecraft to power another propulsion system.

Another theoretical use for this concept of propulsion can be found in space fountains, a system in which a continuous stream of pellets in a circular track holds up a tall structure.

==Mass drivers as weapons==

Small to moderate size high-acceleration electromagnetic projectile launchers are currently undergoing active research by the US Navy for use as ground-based or ship-based weapons (most often railguns but coilguns in some cases). On larger scale than weapons currently near deployment but sometimes suggested in long-range future projections, a sufficiently high velocity linear motor, a mass driver, could in theory be used as intercontinental artillery (or, if built on the Moon or in orbit, used to attack a location on Earth&#x27;s surface). As the mass driver would be located further up the gravity well than the theoretical targets, it would enjoy a significant energy imbalance in terms of counter-attack.

==Practical attempts==
One of the first engineering descriptions of an &quot;Electric Gun&quot; appears in the technical supplement of the 1937 science fiction novel &quot;Zero to Eighty&quot; by &quot;Akkad Pseudoman&quot;, a pen name for the Princeton physicist and electrical entrepreneur Edwin Fitch Northrup. Dr. Northrup built prototype coil guns powered by kHz-frequency three-phase electrical generators, and the book contains photographs of some of these prototypes. The book describes a fictional circumnavigation of the moon by a two-person vehicle launched by a Northrup electric gun.

Later prototype mass drivers have been built since 1976 (Mass Driver 1), some constructed by the U.S. Space Studies Institute in order to prove their properties and practicality. Military R&amp;D on coilguns is related, as are maglev trains.

SpinLaunch, a company founded in 2014, conducted the initial test of their test accelerator in October 2021.

<text>A magnetic sail is a proposed method of spacecraft propulsion where an onboard magnetic field source interacts with a plasma wind (e.g., the solar wind) to form an artificial magnetosphere (similar to Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere) that acts as a sail, transferring force from the wind to the spacecraft requiring little to no propellant as detailed for each proposed magnetic sail design in this article.

The animation and the following text summarize the magnetic sail physical principles involved. The spacecraft&#x27;s magnetic field source, represented by the purple dot, generates a magnetic field, shown as expanding black circles. Under conditions summarized in the overview section, this field creates a magnetosphere whose leading edge is a magnetopause and a bow shock composed of charged particles captured from the wind by the magnetic field, as shown in blue, which deflects subsequent charged particles from the plasma wind coming from the left.

Specific attributes of the artificial magnetosphere around the spacecraft for a specific design significantly affect performance as summarized in the overview section. A magnetohydrodynamic model (verified by computer simulations and laboratory experiments) predicts that the interaction of the artificial magnetosphere with the oncoming plasma wind creates an effective sail blocking area that transfers force as shown by a sequence of labeled arrows from the plasma wind, to the spacecraft&#x27;s magnetic field, to the spacecraft&#x27;s field source, which accelerates the spacecraft in the same direction as the plasma wind.

These concepts apply to all proposed magnetic sail system designs, with the difference how the design generates the magnetic field and how efficiently the field source creates the artificial magnetosphere described above. The History of concept section summarizes key aspects of the proposed designs and relationships between them as background. The cited references are technical with many equations and in order to make the information more accessible, this article first describes in text (and illustrations where available) beginning in the overview section and prior to each design, section or groups of equations and plots intended for the technically oriented reader. The beginning of each proposed design section also contains a summary of the important aspects so that a reader can skip the equations for that design. The differences in the designs determine performance measures, such as the mass of the field source and necessary power, which in turn determine force, mass and hence acceleration and velocity that enable a performance comparison between magnetic sail designs at the end of this article. A comparison with other spacecraft propulsion methods includes some magnetic sail designs where the reader can click on the column headers to compare magnetic sail performance with other propulsion methods. The following observations result from this comparison: magnetic sail designs have insufficient thrust to launch from Earth, thrust (drag) for deceleration for the magsail in the interstellar medium is relatively large, and both the magsail and magnetoplasma sail both have significant thrust for travel away from Earth using the force from the solar wind.

== History of concept ==
An overview of many of the magnetic sail proposed designs with illustrations from the references was published in 2018 by Djojodihardjo. The earliest method proposed by Andrews and Zubrin in 1988, dubbed the magsail, has the significant advantage of requiring no propellant and is thus a form of field propulsion that can operate indefinitely. A drawback of the magsail design was that it required a large (50–100 km radius) superconducting loop carrying large currents with a mass on the order of . The magsail design also described modes of operation for interplanetary transfers, thrusting against a planetary ionosphere or magnetosphere, escape from low Earth orbit as well as deceleration of an interstellar craft over decades after being initially accelerated by other means, for example. a fusion rocket, to a significant fraction of light speed, with a more detailed design published in 2000. In 2015, Freeland validated most of the initial magsail analysis, but determined that thrust predictions were optimistic by a factor of 3.1 due to a numerical integration error.

Subsequent designs proposed and analyzed means to significantly reduce mass. These designs require little to modest amounts of exhausted propellant and can thrust for years. All proposed designs describe thrust from solar wind outwards from the Sun. In 2000, Winglee and Slough proposed a Mini-Magnetospheric Plasma Propulsion (M2P2) design that injected low energy plasma into a much smaller coil with much lower mass that required low power. Simulations predicted impressive performance relative to mass and required power; however, a number of critiques raised issues: that the assumed magnetic field falloff rate was optimistic and that thrust was dramatically overestimated.

Starting in 2003, Funaki and others published a series of theoretical, simulation and experimental investigations at JAXA in collaboration with Japanese universities addressing some of the issues from criticisms of M2P2 and named their approach the MagnetoPlasma Sail (MPS). In 2011, Funaki and Yamakawa authored a chapter in a book that is a good reference for magnetic sail theory and concepts. MPS research resulted in many published papers that advanced the understanding of physical principles for magnetic sails. Best performance occurred when the injected plasma had a lower density and velocity than considered in M2P2. Thrust gain was computed as compared with performance with a magnetic field only in 2013 and 2014. Investigations and experiments continued reporting increased thrust experimentally and numerically considering use of a Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (aka MPD Arc jet in Japan)in 2015, multiple antenna coils in 2019, and a multi-pole MPD thruster in 2020.

Slough published in 2004 and 2006 a method to generate the static magnetic dipole for a magnetic sail in a design called the Plasma magnet (PM) that was described as an AC induction motor turned inside out. A pair of small perpendicularly oriented coils acted as the stator powered by an alternating current to generate a rotating magnetic field (RMF) that analysis predicted and laboratory experiments demonstrated that a current disc formed as the rotor outside the stator. The current disk formed from electrons captured from the plasma wind, therefore requiring little to no plasma injection. Predictions of substantial improvements in terms of reduced coil size (and hence mass) and markedly lower power requirements for significant thrust hypothesized the same optimistic magnetic field falloff rate as assumed for M2P2. In 2022, a spaceflight trial dubbed Jupiter Observing Velocity Experiment (JOVE) proposed using a plasma magnet based sail for a spacecraft named Wind Rider using the solar wind to accelerate away from a point near Earth and decelerate against the magnetosphere of Jupiter.

A 2012, study by Kirtley and Slough investigated using the plasma magnet technology to use plasma in a planetary ionosphere as a braking mechanism and was called the Plasma Magnetoshell. This paper restated the magnetic field falloff rate to the value suggested in the critiques of M2P2 that dramatically reduces analytical predicted performance. Initial missions targeted deceleration in the ionosphere of Mars. Kelly and Little in 2019 published simulation results using a multi-turn coil and not the plasma magnet showed that the magnetoshell was viable for orbital insertion asy Mars, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus and in 2021 showed that it was more efficient than aerocapture for Neptune.

In 2021, Zhenyu Yang and others published an analysis, numerical calculations and experimental verification for a propulsion system that was a combination of the magnetic sail and the electric sail called an electromagnetic sail. A superconducting magsail coil augmented by an electron gun at the coil&#x27;s center generates an electric field as in an electric sail that deflects positive ions in the plasma wind thereby providing additional thrust, which could reduce overall system mass.

== Overview ==

The Modes of operation section describes the important parameters of plasma particle density and wind velocity in conjunction with a use case for:

* Operation in a stellar (e.g., Sun) wind.
* Deceleration in the interstellar medium (ISM).
* Operation in a planetary ionosphere or planetary magnetosphere.

The Physical principles section details aspects of how charged particles in a plasma wind interact with a magnetic field and conditions that determine how much thrust force results on the spacecraft in terms of particle&#x27;s behavior in a plasma wind, as well as the form and magnitude of the magnetic field related to conditions within the magnetosphere that differ for the proposed designs.

Charged particles such as electrons, protons and ions travel in straight lines in a vacuum in the absence of a magnetic field. As shown in the illustration in the presence of a magnetic field shown in green, charged particles gyrate in circular arcs with blue indicating positively charged particles (e.g., protons) and red indicating electrons. The particle&#x27;s gyroradius is proportional to the ratio of the particle&#x27;s momentum (product of mass and velocity) over the magnetic field. At 1 Astronomical Unit (AU), the distance from the Sun to the Earth, the gyroradius of a proton is ~72 km and since a proton is ~1,836 times the mass of an electron, the gyroradius of an electron is ~40 m with the illustration not drawn to scale. For the magsail deceleration in the interstellar medium (ISM) mode of operation the velocity is a significant fraction of light speed, for example 5% c, the gyroradius is ~ 500 km for protons and ~280 m for electrons. When the magsail magnetopause radius is much less than the proton gyroradius the magsail kinematic model by Gros in 2017, which considered only protons, predicts a marked reduction in thrust force for initial ship velocity greater than 10% c prior to deceleration.
When the magnetosphere radius is much greater than the spacecraft&#x27;s magnetic field source radius, all proposed designs, except for the magsail, use a magnetic dipole approximation for an Amperian loop shown in the center of the illustration with the X indicating current flowing into the page and the dot indicating current flowing out of the page. The illustration shows the resulting magnetic field lines and their direction, where the closer spacing of lines indicates a stronger field. Since the magsail uses a large superconducting coil that has a radius on the same order as the magnetosphere the details of that design use the magsail MHD model employing the Biot–Savart law that predicts stronger magnetic fields near and inside the coil than the dipole model. A Lorentz force occurs only for the portion of a charged particle&#x27;s velocity at a right angle to the magnetic field lines and this constitutes the magnetic force depicted in the summary animation. Electrically neutral particles, such as neutrons, atoms and molecules are unaffected by a magnetic field.

A condition for applicability of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory, which models charged particles as fluid flows, is that to achieve maximum force the radius of the artificial magnetosphere be on the same order as the ion gyroradius for the plasma environment for a particular mode of operation. Another important condition is how the proposed design affects the magnetic field falloff rate inside the magnetosphere, which impacts the field source mass and power requirements. For a radial distance r from the spacecraft&#x27;s magnetic field source in a vacuum the magnetic field falls off as formula_1, where formula_2 is the falloff rate. Classic magnetic dipole theory covers the case of formula_2=3 as used in the magsail design. When plasma is injected and/or captured near the field source, the magnetic field falls off at a rate of formula_4, a topic that has been a subject of much research, criticism and differs between designs and has changed over time for the plasma magnet. The M2P2 and plasma magnet designs initially assumed formula_2=1 that as shown in numerical examples summarized at the end of the corresponding design sections predicted a very large performance gain. Several researchers independently created a magnetic field model where formula_6 and asserted that an formula_2=2 falloff rate was the best achievable. In 2011 the plasma magnet author changed the falloff rate formula_2 from 1 to 2 and that is the value used for the plasma magnet for performance comparison in this article. The magnetoplasma sail (MPS) design is an evolution of the M2P2 concept that has been extensively documented, numerically analyzed and simulated and reported a falloff rate formula_2 between 1.5 and 2.

The falloff rate formula_2 has a significant impact on performance or the mode of operation accelerating away from the Sun where the mass density of ions in the plasma decreases according to an Inverse-square law with distance from the Sun (e.g., AU) increases. The illustration shows in a semi-log plot the impact of falloff rate formula_2 on relative force F from Equation versus distance from the Sun ranging from 1 to 20 AU, the approximate distance of Neptune. The distance to Jupiter is approximately 5 AU. Constant force independent of distance from the Sun for formula_2=1 is stated in several plasma magnet references, for example Slough and Freeze and results from the effective increase in sail blocking area to exactly offset reduced plasma mass density as a magnetic sail spacecraft accelerates in response to the plasma wind force away from the Sun. As seen from the illustration the impact of falloff rate formula_2 on force, and therefore acceleration, becomes grerater as distance from the Sun increases.

At scales where the artificial magnetospheric object radius is much less than the ion gyroradius but greater than the electron gyroradius, the realized force is markedly reduced and electrons create force in proportion much greater than their relative mass with respect to ions as detailed in the General kinematic model section where researchers report results from a compute intensive method that simulates individual particle interactions with the magnetic field source.

== Modes of operation ==
Magnetic sail modes of operation cover the mission profile and plasma environment (&quot;pe&quot;), such as the solar wind, (&quot;sw&quot;) a planetary ionosphere (&quot;pi&quot;) or magnetosphere (&quot;pm&quot;), or the interstellar medium (&quot;ism&quot;). Symbolically equations in this article use the &quot;pe&quot; acronym as a subscript to generic variables, for example as described in this section the plasma mass density formula_14 and from the spacecraft point of view the apparent wind velocity formula_15.

=== Plasma mass density and velocity terminology and units ===
A plasma consists exclusively of charged particles that can interact with a magnetic or electric field. It does not include neutral particles, such as neutrons. atoms or molecules.The plasma mass density ρ used in magnetohydrodynamic models only require a weighted average mass density of charged particles that includes neutrons in the ion, while kinematic models use the values for each specific ion type and in some cases the parameters for electrons as well as detailed in the Magnetohydrodynamic model section.

The velocity distribution of ions and electrons is another important parameter but often analyses use only the average velocity for the aggregate of particles in a plasma wind for a particular plasma environment (pe) is formula_16. The apparent wind velocity formula_17 as seen by a spacecraft traveling at velocity formula_18 (positive meaning acceleration in the same direction as the wind and negative meaning deceleration opposite the wind direction) for a particular plasma environment (&quot;pe&quot;) is formula_19.

=== Acceleration/deceleration in a stellar plasma wind ===
Many designs, analyses, simulations and experiments focus on using a magnetic sail in the solar wind plasma to accelerate a spacecraft away from the Sun. Near the Earth&#x27;s orbit at 1 AU the plasma flows at velocity formula_20 dynamically ranges from 250 to 750 km/s (typically 500), with a density ranging from 3 to 10 particles per cubic centimeter (typically 6) as reported by the NOAA real-time solar wind tracking web site Assuming that 8% of the solar wind is helium and the remainder hydrogen, the average solar wind plasma mass density at 1 AU is formula_21 kg/m3 (typically 10−20 kg/m3).

The average plasma mass density of ions formula_22 decreases according to an Inverse-square law with the distance from the Sun as stated by Andrews/Zubrin and Borgazzi. The velocity for values near the Sun is nearly constant, falling off slowly after 1 AU and then rapidly decreases at heliopause.

=== Deceleration in interstellar medium (ISM) ===
A spacecraft accelerated to very high velocities by other means, such as a fusion rocket or laser pushed lightsail, can decelerate even from relativistic velocities without onboard propellant by using a magnetic sail to create thrust (drag) against the interstellar medium plasma environment. As shown in the section on Magsail kinematic model (MKM), feasible uses of this involve maximum velocities below 10% c, taking decades to decelerate, for total travel times on the order of a century as described in the magsail specific designs section. 
Only the magsail references consider deceleration in the ISM on approach to Alpha (formula_23) Centauri, which as shown in the figure is separated by the local bubble and the G-clouds and the Solar System, which is moving at velocity formula_24 and the local cloud is moving at velocity formula_25. Estimates of the number of protons range between 0.005 and 0.5 cm−3 resulting in a plasma mass density formula_26 kg/m3, which covers the range used by references in the magsail specific designs section. As summarized in the magsail specific design section, Gros cited references indicating that regions of the G-clouds may be colder and have a low ion density. A typical value assumed for approach to Alpha Centauri is a proton number density formula_27 of 0.1 protons per cm3 corresponding to formula_28 kg/m3.

The spacecraft velocity formula_18 is much greater than the ISM velocity at the beginning of a deceleration maneuver so the apparent plasma wind velocity from the spacecraft&#x27;s viewpoint s approximately formula_30.

Radio emissions of cyclotron radiation due to interaction of charged particles in the interstellar medium as they spiral around the magnetic field lines of a magnetic sail would have a frequency of approximately formula_31 kHz. The Earth&#x27;s ionosphere would prevent detection on the surface, but a space-based antenna could detect such emissions up to several thousands of light years away. Detection of such radiation could indicate activity of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations.

=== In a planetary ionosphere ===
A spacecraft approaching a planet with a significant upper atmosphere such as Saturn or Neptune could use a magnetic sail to decelerate by ionizing neutral atoms such that it behaves as a low beta plasma. The plasma mass in a planetary ionosphere (pi) formula_32 is composed of multiple ion types and varies by altitude. The spacecraft velocity formula_18 is much greater than the planetary ionosphere velocity in a deceleration maneuver so the apparent plasma wind velocity is approximately formula_34 at the beginning of a deceleration maneuver.

=== In a planetary magnetosphere ===
Inside or near a planetary magnetosphere, a magnetic sail can thrust against or be attracted to a planet&#x27;s magnetic field created by a dynamo, especially in an orbit that passes over the planet&#x27;s magnetic poles. When the magnetic sail and planet&#x27;s magnetic field are in opposite directions an attractive force occurs and when the fields are in the same direction a repulsive force occurs, which is not stable and means to prevent the sail from flipping over is necessary.

The thrust that a magnetic sail delivers within a magnetosphere decreases with the fourth power of its distance from the planet&#x27;s internal magnetic field. When close to a planet with a strong magnetosphere such as Earth or a gas giant, the magnetic sail could generate more thrust by interacting with the magnetosphere instead of the solar wind. When operating near a planetary or stellar magnetosphere the effect of that magnetic field must be considered if it is on the same order as the gravitational field.

By varying the magnetic sail&#x27;s field strength and orientation a &quot;perigee kick&quot; can be achieved raising the altitude of the orbit&#x27;s apogee higher and higher, until the magnetic sail is able to leave the planetary magnetosphere and catch the solar wind. The same process in reverse can be used to lower or circularize the apogee of a magsail&#x27;s orbit when it arrives at a destination planet with a magnetic field.

In theory, it is possible for a magnetic sail to launch directly from the surface of a planet near one of its magnetic poles, repelling itself from the planet&#x27;s magnetic field. However, this requires the magnetic sail to be maintained in an &quot;unstable&quot; orientation. Furthermore, the magnetic sail must have extraordinarily strong magnetic fields for a launch from Earth, requiring superconductors supporting 80 times the current density of the best known high-temperature superconductors as of 1991.

In 2022 a spaceflight trial dubbed Jupiter Observing Velocity Experiment (JOVE) proposed using a plasma magnet to decelerate against the magnetosphere of Jupiter.

== Physical principles ==

Physical principles involved include: interaction of magnetic fields with moving charged particles; an artificial magnetosphere model analogous to the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, MHD and kinematic mathematical models for interaction of an artificial magnetosphere with a plasma flow characterized by mass and number density and velocity, and performance measures; such as, force achieved, energy requirements and the mass of the magnetic sail system.

=== Magnetic field interaction with charged particles ===
An ion or electron with charge in a plasma moving at velocity in a magnetic field and electric field is treated as an idealized point charge in the Lorentz force formula_35. This means that the force on an ion or electron is proportional to the product of their charge and velocity component formula_36 perpendicular to the magnetic field flux density , in SI units as teslas (T). A magnetic sail design introduces a magnetic field into a plasma flow which under certain conditions deflects the electrons and ions from their original trajectory with the particle&#x27;s momentum transferred to the sail and hence the spacecraft thereby creating thrust. An electric sail uses an electric field that under certain conditions interact with charged particles to create thrust.

=== Artificial magnetospheric model ===

The characteristics of the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere have been widely studied as a basis for magnetic sails. The figure shows streamlines of charged particles from a plasma wind from the Sun (or a star) or an effective wind when decelerating in the ISM flowing from left to right. A source attached to a spacecraft generates a magnetic field. Under certain conditions at the boundary where magnetic pressure equals the plasma wind kinetic pressure an artificial bow shock and magnetopause forms at a characteristic length formula_37 from the field source. The ionized plasma wind particles create a current sheet along the magnetopause, which compresses the magnetic field lines facing the oncoming plasma wind by a factor of 2 at magnetopause as shown in Figure 2a. The magnetopause deflects charged particles, which affects their streamlines and increases the density at magnetopause. A magnetospheric bubble or cavity forms that has very low density downstream from the magnetopause. Upstream from the magnetopause a bow shock develops. Simulation results often show the particle density through use of color with an example shown in the legend in the lower left. This figure uses aspects of the general structure from Zubrin, Toivanen and Funaki and aspects of the plasma density from Khazanov and Cruz.

=== Magnetohydrodynamic model ===
Magnetic sail designs operating in a plasma wind share a theoretical foundation based upon a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, sometimes called a fluid model, from plasma physics for an artificially generated magnetosphere. Under certain conditions, the plasma wind and the magnetic sail are separated by a magnetopause that blocks the charged particles, which creates a drag force that transfers (at least some) momentum to the magnetic sail, which then applies thrust to the attached spacecraft as described in Andrews/Zubrin, Cattell, Funaki, and Toivanen.

A plasma environment has fundamental parameters, and if a cited reference uses cgs units these should be converted to SI units as defined in the NRL plasma formulary, which this article uses as a reference for plasma parameter units not defined in SI units. The major parameters for plasma mass density are: the number of ions of type formula_38 per unit volume formula_39 the mass of each ion type accounting for isotopes formula_40 and the number of electrons formula_41 per unit volume each with electron mass formula_42. An average plasma mass density per unit volume for charged particles in a plasma environment formula_43 (formula_44 for stellar wind, formula_45 for planetary ionosphere, formula_46 for interstellar medium) is expressed in equation form from magnetohydrodynamics asformula_47. Note that this definition includes the mass of neutrons in an ion&#x27;s nucleus. In SI Units per unit volume is cubic metre (m−3), mass is kilogram (kg), and mass density is kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m3).

The figure depicts the MHD model as described in Funaki and Djojodihardjo. Starting from the left a plasma wind in a plasma environment (e.g., stellar, ISM or an ionosphere) of effective velocity formula_48 with density formula_49 encounters a spacecraft with time-varying velocity formula_50 that is positive if accelerating and negative if decelerating. The apparent plasma wind velocity from the spacecraft&#x27;s viewpoint is formula_51. The spacecraft and field source generate a magnetic field that creates a magnetospheric bubble extending out to a magnetopause preceded by a bow shock that deflects electrons and ions from the plasma wind. At the magnetopause the field source magnetic pressure equals the kinetic pressure of the plasma wind at a standoff shown at the bottom of the figure. The characteristic length formula_52 is that of a circular sail of effective blocking area formula_53 where formula_54 is the effective magnetopause radius. Under certain conditions the plasma wind pushing on the artificial magnetosphere bow shock and magnetopause creates a force formula_55 on the magnetic field source that is physically attached to the spacecraft so that at least part of the force formula_55 causes a force formula_57 on the spacecraft, accelerating it when sailing downwind or decelerating when sailing into a headwind. Under certain conditions and in some designs, some of the plasma wind force may be lost as indicated by formula_58 on the right side.

All magnetic sail designs assume a standoff between plasma wind pressure formula_59 and magnetic pressure formula_60 with SI units of Pascal (Pa, or N/m2) differing only in a constant coefficient formula_61 as follows:

where formula_62 is the apparent wind velocity and formula_63 is the plasma mass density for a specific plasma environment, formula_64 the magnetic field flux density at magnetopause, &quot;μ0&quot; is the vacuum permeability (N A−2) and formula_65 is a constant that differs by reference as follows for formula_66 corresponding to formula_67 modeled as dynamic pressure with no magnetic field compression, formula_68 for formula_67 modeled as ram pressure with no magnetic field compression and formula_70 for formula_67 modeled as ram pressure with magnetic field compression by a factor of 2 Equation can be solved to yield the required magnetic field formula_64 that satisfies the pressure balance at magnetopause standoff as:

The force with SI Units of Newtons (N) derived by a magnetic sail for a plasma environment is determined from MHD equations as reported by principal researchers Funaki, Slough, Andrews and Zubrin, and Toivanen as follows: 

where formula_73 is a coefficient of drag determined by numerical analysis and/or simulation, formula_74 is the wind pressure, and formula_75 is the effective blocking area of the magnetic sail with magnetopause radius formula_76. Note that this equation has the same form as the drag equation in fluid dynamics. formula_73 is a function of coil attack angle on thrust and steering angle. The power (W) of the plasma wind is the product of velocity and a constant force

where equation was used to derive the right side.

==== MHD applicability test ====

As summarized in the overview section, an important condition for a magnetic sail to generate maximum force is that the magnetopause radius be on the order of an ion&#x27;s radius of gyration. Through analysis, numerical calculation, simulation and experimentation an important condition for a magnetic sail to generate significant force is the MHD applicability test, which states that the standoff distance formula_37 must be significantly greater than the ion gyroradius, also called the Larmor radius or cyclotron radius: 
where &quot;formula_79&quot; is the ion mass, formula_80 is the velocity of a particle perpendicular to the magnetic field, formula_81 is the elementary charge of the ion, formula_82 is the magnetic field flux density at the point of reference formula_83 and formula_84 is a constant that differs by source with formula_85 and formula_86&quot;.&quot; For example, in the solar wind with 5 ions/cm3 at 1 AU with formula_40 the proton mass (kg), formula_88 = 400 km/s, formula_89 = 36 nT with formula_61=0.5 from equation at magnetopause and formula_84=2 then formula_92 72 km. The MHD applicability test is the ratio formula_93. The figure plots formula_94 on the left vertical axis and lost thrust on the right vertical axis versus the ratio formula_93. When formula_96, formula_97 is maximum, at formula_98, formula_99, a decrease of 25% from the maximum and at formula_100, formula_101, a 45% decrease. As formula_102 increases beyond one, formula_94 decreases meaning less thrust from the plasma wind transfers to the spacecraft and is instead lost to the plasma wind. In 2004, Fujita published numerical analysis using a hybrid PIC simulation using a magnetic dipole model that treated electrons as a fluid and a kinematic model for ions to estimate the coefficient of drag formula_94 for a magnetic sail operating in the radial orientation resulting in the following approximate formula:The lost thrust is formula_105.

==== Coil attack angle effect on thrust and steering angle ====

In 2005 Nishida and others published results from numerical analysis of an MHD model for interaction of the solar wind with a magnetic field of current flowing in a coil that momentum is indeed transferred to the magnetic field produced by field source and hence to the spacecraft. Thrust force derives from the momentum change of the solar wind, pressure by the solar wind on the magnetopause from equation and Lorentz force from currents induced in the magnetosphere interacting with the field source. The results quantified the coefficient of drag, steering (i.e., thrust direction) angle with the solar wind, and torque generated as a function of attack angle (i.e., orientation) The figure illustrates how the attack (or coil tilt) angle formula_106 orientation of the coil creates a steering angle for the thrust vector and also torque imparted to the coil. Also shown is the vector for the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), which at 1 AU varies with waves and other disturbances in the solar wind, known as space weather, and can significantly increase or decrease the thrust of a magnetic sail.

For a coil with radial orientation (like a Frisbee) the attack angle formula_106= 0° and with axial orientation (like a parachute) formula_106=90°. The Nishida 2005 results reported a coefficient of drag formula_94 that increased non-linearly with attack angle from a minimum of 3.6 at formula_106=0 to a maximum of 5 at formula_106=90°. The steering angle of the thrust vector is substantially less than the attack angle deviation from 45° due to the interaction of the magnetic field with the solar wind. Torque increases from formula_106= 0° from zero at to a maximum at formula_106=45° and then decreases to zero at formula_106=90°. A number of magnetic sail design and other papers cite these results. In 2012 Kajimura reported simulation results that covered two cases where MHD applicability occurs with formula_102=1.125 and where a kinematic model is applicable formula_102=0.125 to compute a coefficient of drag formula_94 and steering angle. As shown in Figure 4 of that paper when MHD applicability occurs the results are similar in form to Nishida 2005 where the largest formula_94 occurs with the coil in an axial orientation. However, when the kinematic model applies, the largest formula_94 occurs with the coil in a radial orientation. The steering angle is positive when MHD is applicable and negative when a kinematic model applies. The 2012 Nishida and Funaki published simulation results for a coefficient of drag formula_120, coefficient of lift formula_121 and a coefficient of moment formula_122 for a coil radius of formula_123=100 km and magnetopause radius formula_124=500 km at 1 AU.

=== Magnetic field model ===
In a design, either the magnetic field source strength or the magnetopause radius formula_125 the characteristic length must be chosen. A good approximation from Cattell and Toivanen for a magnetic field falloff rate formula_126 for a distance formula_127 from the field source to magnetopause starts with the equation:
where formula_128 is the magnetic field at a radius formula_129 near the field source that falls off near the source as formula_130 as follows:

where formula_131 is a constant multiplying the magnetic moment (A m2) formula_132 to make formula_133 match a target value at formula_134. When far from the field source, a magnetic dipole is a good approximation and choosing the above value of formula_128 with formula_131 =2 near the field source was used by Andrews and Zubrin.

The Amperian loop model for the magnetic moment is formula_137, where formula_138 is the current in amperes (A) and formula_139 is the surface area for a coil (loop) of radius formula_123. Assuming that formula_141 and substituting the expression for the magnetic moment formula_132 into equation yields the following:

When the magnetic field flux density formula_128 is specified, substituting formula_144 from the pressure balance analysis from equation into the above and solving for formula_145 yields the following:

This is the expression for formula_37 when formula_147 with formula_148 and formula_149 and is the same form as the magnetopause distance of the Earth. Equation shows directly how a decreased falloff rate formula_150 dramatically increases the effective sail area formula_151 for a given field source magnetic moment formula_132 and formula_64 determined from the pressure balance equation . Substituting this into equation yields the plasma wind force as a function of falloff rate formula_150, plasma density formula_63, coil radius formula_156, coil current formula_138 and plasma wind velocity formula_158 as follows:

using equation for formula_128 and equation for formula_64. This is the same expression as equation (10b) when formula_147 and formula_148 and and the right hand side from equation (20) specifically applied to M2P2 with other numerical coefficients grouped into the formula_94 term. Note that force increases as falloff rate decreases. For the solar wind case, substituting into and using the function for the solar wind plasma mass density formula_164, with formula_165 the distance from the sun in Astronomical units (AU) results in the following expression: where formula_166, the effective sail blocking area.

This equation explicitly shows the relationship upon solar wind plasma mass density formula_167 as a function of distance from the Sun formula_165. For the case formula_2=1 the expansion of the magnetopause radius formula_170 exactly matches the decreasing value of formula_167 exactly as the distance from the Sun formula_165 increases, resulting in constant force and hence constant acceleration inside the heliosphere. Note that formula_173 includes the term formula_174, which means that as formula_2 increases that the magnetic field near the field source formula_176 must increase to maintain the same force as compared with a smaller value of formula_2. The example in the overview section set formula_173=1, formula_158=1, formula_129=1, and formula_181=1 so that the force at formula_165=1 was equal to 1 for all values of formula_2 at 1 AU.

=== General kinematic model ===

When the MHD applicability test of formula_93 &lt;1 then a kinematic simulation model more accurately predicts force transferred from the plasma wind to the spacecraft. In this case the effective sail blocking area formula_185 &lt; formula_186.

The left axis of the figure is for plots of magnetic sail force versus characteristic length formula_37. The solid black line plots the MHD model force formula_188 from equation . The green line shows the value of ion gyroradius formula_92 72 km at 1 AU from equation . The dashed blue line plots the hybrid MHD/kinematic model from equation from Fujita04. The red dashed line plots a curve fit to simulation results from Ashida14. Although a good fit for these parameters, the curve fit range of this model does not cover some relevant examples. Additional simulation results from Hajiwara15 are shown for the MHD and kinematic model as single data points as indicated in the legend. These models are all in close agreement. The kinematic models predict less force than predicted by the MHD model. In other words, the fraction formula_190 of thrust force predicted by the MHD model is lost when formula_96 as plotted on the right axis. The solid blue and red lines show formula_190 for Fujita04 and Ashida18 respectively, indicating that operation with formula_37 less than 10% of formula_194 will have significant loss. Other factors in a specific magnetic sail design may offset this loss for values of formula_195.

=== Performance measures ===
Important measures that determine the relative performance of different magnetic sail systems include: mass of the field source generator and its power and energy requirements; thrust achieved; thrust to weight ratio, any limitations and constraints, and propellant system exhausted, if any. Mass of the field source formula_196 in the Magsail design was relatively large and subsequent designs strove to reduce this measure. Total spacecraft mass is formula_197, where formula_198 is the payload mass. Power requirements are significant in some designs and add to field source mass. Thrust is the plasma wind force formula_199 for a particular plasma environment with acceleration formula_200. The thrust to weight ratio formula_201 is also an important performance measure. Other limitations and constraints may be specific to a particular design. The M2P2 and MPS designs, as well as potentially the plasma magnet design, exhaust some plasma as part of inflating the magnetospheric bubble and these cases also have a specific impulse and effective exhaust velocity performance measure.

== Proposed magnetic sail systems ==
This section contains a subsection for each of the proposed magnetic sail designs introduced in the summary. Each subsection begins with a high-level description of that design and an illustration. The cited references are technical and contain many equations, for which this article includes where applicable a common notation described in the Physical principles section, and in other cases the notation from a cited reference. The focus is to include equations used in the Performance comparison section. The subsections include plots of variables with relevant units related to this objective that are preceded by a summary description.

=== Magsail (MS) ===
Andrews was working on use of a magnetic scoop to gather interstellar material as propellant for a nuclear electric ion drive spacecraft, allowing the craft to operate in a similar manner to a Bussard ramjet, whose history goes back to at least 1973. Andrews asked Zubrin to help compute the magnetic scoop drag against the interplanetary medium, which turned out to be much greater than the ion drive thrust. The ion drive component of the system was dropped, and use of the concept of using the magnetic scoop as a magnetic sail or Magsail (MS) was born.
The figure shows the magsail design consisting of a loop of superconducting wire of radius formula_123 on the order of 100 km that carries a direct current formula_138 that generates a magnetic field, which was modeled according to the Biot–Savart law inside the loop and as a magnetic dipole far outside the loop. With respect to the plasma wind direction a magsail may have a radial (or normal) orientation or an axial orientation that can be adjusted to provide torque for steering. In non-axial configurations lift is generated that can change the spacecraft&#x27;s momentum. The loop connects via shroud lines (or tethers) to the spacecraft in the center. Because a loop carrying current is forced outwards towards a circular shape by its magnetic field, the sail could be deployed by unspooling the conductor wire and applying a current through it via the peripheral platforms. The loop must be adequately attached to the spacecraft in order to transfer momentum from the plasma wind and would pull the spacecraft behind it as shown in the axial configuration in the right side of the figure. This design has a significant advantage of requiring no propellant and is thus a form of field propulsion that can operate indefinitely.

==== MHD model ====
Analysis of magsail performance was done using a simulation and a fluid (i.e., MHD) model with similar results observed for one case. The magnetic moment of a current loop (A m2) is formula_204 for a current of formula_205 A and a loop of radius formula_206 m. Close to the loop, the magnetic field at a distance formula_207 along the center-line axis perpendicular to the loop is derived from the Biot-Savart law as follows.

At a distance far from the loop center the magnetic field is approximately that produced by a magnetic dipole. Te pressure at the magnetospheric boundary is doubled due to compression of the magnetic field and stated by the following equation at a point along the center-line axis or the target magnetopause standoff distance formula_208.
Equating this to the dynamic pressure for a plasma environment formula_209, inserting formula_210 from equation and solving for formula_208 yields
Andrews and Zubrin derived the drag (thrust) force of the sail formula_212 that determined the characteristic length formula_208 for a tilt angle, but according to Freeland an error was made in numerical integration in choosing the ellipse downstream from the magnetopause instead of the ellipse upstream that made those results optimistic by a factor of approximately 3.1, which should be used to correct any drag(thrust) force results using Instead, this article uses the approximation for a spherical bubble that corrects this error and is close to the analytical formula for the axial configuration as the force for the Magsail as follows
In 2004 Toivanen and Janhunen did further analysis on the Magsail that they called a Plasma Free MagnetoPause (PFMP) that produced similar results to that of Andrews and Zubrin.

==== Coil mass and current (CMC) ====

The minimum required mass to carry the current in equation or other magnetic sail designs from Andres/Zubrin (9) and Crowl as follows:

where formula_214 is the superconductor critical current density (A/m2) and formula_215 is the coil material density, for example formula_214 = 1x1011 A/m2 and formula_215 = 6,500 kg/m3 for a superconductor in Freeland The physical mass of the coil is

where formula_218 is the radius of the superconductor wire, for example that necessary to handle the tension for a particular use case, such as deceleration in the ISM where formula_218 = 10 mm. The formula_220 factor (e.g., 3) accounts for mass of the tether (or shroud) lines to connect the coil to a spacecraft. Note that formula_221 with formula_220=0 must be no less than formula_223 in order for the coil to carry the superconductor critical current formula_224 amperes for a coil wire of radius formula_225, for example formula_226 = 7,854 kiloampere (kA.)

Setting equation with formula_220=0 equal to equation and solving for formula_225 yields the minimum required coil radius

If operated within the solar system, high temperature superconducting wire (HTS) is necessary to make the magsail practical since required current is large, millions of amperes. Protection from solar heating is necessary closer to the Sun, for example by highly reflective coatings. If operated in interstellar space low temperature superconductors (LTS) could be adequate since the temperature of a vacuum is 2.7Kelvins (K), but radiation and other heat sources from the spacecraft may render LTS impractical. The critical current formula_226 of the HTS YBCO coated superconductor wire increases at lower temperatures with a current density formula_214 of 6x1010 A/m2 at 77K and 9x1011 A/m2 at 5K.

==== Magsail kinematic model (MKM) ====
The MHD applicability test of equation fails in some ISM deceleration cases and a kinematic model is necessary, such as the one documented in 2017 by Claudius Gros summarized here. A spacecraft with an overall mass formula_231 and velocity formula_36 follows of motion as:

where formula_233 N is force predicted by this model, formula_234 m−3 is the proton number density, formula_235 kg is the proton mass, formula_236 kg/m3 the plasma density, and formula_237 m2 the effective reflection area. This equation assumes that the spacecraft encounters formula_238 particles per second and that every particle of mass formula_235 is completed reflected. Note that this equation is of the same form as with formula_94=4, interpreting the formula_94 term as just a number.

Gros numerically determined the effective reflection area formula_242 by integrating the degree of reflection of approaching protons interacting with the superconducting loop magnetic field according to the Biot-Savart law. The reported result was independent of the loop radius formula_123. An accurate curve fit as reported in Figure 4 to the numerical evaluation for the effective reflection area for a magnetic sail in the axial configuration from equation (8) was

where formula_244 is the area enclosed by the current carrying loop, formula_245 the speed of light, and the value formula_246 A determined a good curve fit for formula_247=105 A, the current through the loop. In 2020, Perakis published an analysis that corroborated the above formula with parameters selected for the solar wind and reported a force no more than 9% less than the Gros model for formula_247=105 A and formula_123=100 m with the coil in an axial orientation.. That analysis also reported on the effect of magsail tilt angle on lift and side forces for a use case in maneuvering within the solar system.

For comparison purposes, the effective sail area determined for the magsail by Zubrin from equation with the 3.1 correction factor from Freeland applied and using the same velocity value (resolving the discrepancy noted by Gros) as follows:

The figure shows the normalized effective sail area normalized by the coil area formula_244 for the MKM case from Gros of equation and for Zubrin from equation for formula_251, formula_123=100 km, and formula_234=0.1 cm−3 for the G-cloud on approach to Alpha Centauri corresponding to ISM density formula_254 kg/m3 consistent with that from Freeland plotted versus the spacecraft velocity relative to the speed of light formula_255. A good fit occurs for these parameters, but for different values of formula_123 and formula_247 the fit can vary significantly. Also plotted is the MHD applicability test of ion gyroradius divided by magnetopause radius formula_258 &lt;1 from equation on the secondary axis. Note that MHD applicability occurs at formula_259 &lt; 1%. For comparison, the 2004 Fujita formula_94 as a function of formula_258 from the MHD applicability test section is also plotted. Note that the Gros model predicts a more rapid decrease in effective area than this model at higher velocities. The normalized values of formula_237 and formula_263 track closely until formula_264 10% after which point the Zubrin magsail model of Equation becomes increasingly optimistic and equation is applicable instead. Since the models track closely up to formula_265 10%, with the kinematic model underestimating effective sail area for smaller values of formula_266 (hence underestimating force), equation is an approximation for both the MHD and kinematic region. The Gros model is pessimistic for formula_266 &lt; 0.1%.

Gros used the analytic expression for the effective reflection area formula_237 from equation for explicit solution for the required distance formula_269 m to decelerate to final velocity formula_270 m/s from given an initial velocity formula_271 m/s for a spacecraft mass formula_231 kg as follows: 

where formula_273. When formula_274=0 the above equation is defined in as formula_275, which enabled a closed form solution of the velocity at a distance formula_276 in with numerical integration required to compute the time required to decelerate. Equation (16) The optimal current that minimized formula_277 as formula_278 where formula_279. In 2017 Crowl optimized coil current for the ratio of effective area formula_280 over total mass formula_231 and derived the result formula_282. That paper used results from Gros for the stopping distance formula_277 and time to decelerate.

The figure plots the distance traveled while decelerating formula_284 and time required to decelerate formula_285 given a starting relative velocity formula_286 and a final velocity formula_287 m/s consistent with that from Freeland for the same parameters above. Equation gives the magsail mass formula_288 as 97 tonnes assuming payload mass formula_198 of 100 tonnes using the same values used by Freeland of formula_214 = 1011 A/m2 and formula_291=6,500 kg/m3 for the superconducting coil. Equation gives Force for the magsail multiplied by formula_94=4 for the Andrews/Zubrin model to align with equation definition of force from the Gros model. Acceleration is force divided by mass, velocity is the integral of acceleration over the deceleration time interval formula_285 and deceleration distance traveled formula_284 is the integral of the velocity over formula_285. Numerical integration resulted in the lines plotted in the figure with deceleration distance traveled plotted on the primary vertical axis on the left and time required to decelerate on the secondary vertical axis on the right. Note that the MHD Zubrin model and the Gros kinematic model predict nearly identical values of deceleration distance up to formula_296~ 5% of c, with the Zubrin model predicting less deceleration distance and shorter deceleration time at greater values of formula_296. This is consistent with the Gros model predicting a smaller effective area formula_280 at larger values of formula_296. The value of the closed form solution for deceleration distance formula_300 from for the same parameters closely tracks the numerical integration result.

==== Specific designs and mission profiles ====
Dana Andrews and Robert Zubrin first proposed the magnetic sail concept in 1988 for interstellar travel for acceleration by a fusion rocket, coasting and then deceleration via a magsail at the destination that could reduce flight times by 40–50 years In 1989 details for interplanetary travel were reported In 1990 Andrews and Zubrin reported on an example for solar wind parameters one AU away from the Sun, with formula_301 m−3 with only protons as ions, apparent wind velocity formula_302=500 km/s the field strength required to resist the dynamic pressure of the solar wind is 50 nT from equation . With radius formula_123=100 km and magnetospheric bubble of formula_304= reported a thrust of 1980 newtons and a coil mass of 500 tonnes. For the above parameters with the correction factor of 3.1 applied to equation yields the same thrust and equation yields the same coil mass. Results for another 4 solar wind cases were reported, but the MHD applicability test of equation fails in these cases.

In 2015, Freeland documented a use case with acceleration away from Earth by a fusion drive with a magsail used for interstellar deceleration on approach to Alpha Centaturi as part of a study to update Project Icarus with formula_123=260 km, an initial formula_306 of 1,320 km and ISM density formula_254 kg/m3, almost identical to the n(H I) measurement of 0.098 cm−3 by Gry in 2014. The Freeland study predicted deceleration from 5% of light speed in approximately 19 years. The coil parameters formula_214=1011 A/m2, formula_309= 5 mm, formula_310=6,500 kg/m3, resulted in an estimated coil mass of formula_311=1,232 tonnes. Although the critical current density formula_214 was based upon a 2000 Zubrin NIAC report projecting values through 2020, the assumed value is close to that for commercially produced YBCO coated superconductor wire in 2020. The mass estimate may be optimistic since it assumed that the entire coil carrying mass is superconducting while 2020 manufacturing techniques place a thin film on a non-superconducting substrate. For the interstellar medium plasma density formula_313=1.67x10−22 with an apparent wind velocity 5% of light speed, the ion gyroradius is 570 km and thus the design value for formula_306 meets the MHD applicability test of equation . Equation gives the required coil current as formula_138~7,800 kA and from equation formula_316= 338 tonnes; however, but the corresponding superconducting wire minimum radius from equation is formula_317 =1 mm, which would be insufficient to handle the decelerating thrust force of formula_318 ~ 100,000 N predicted by equation and hence the design specified formula_309= 5 mm to meet structural requirements. In a complete design, the mass of infrastructure, including coil shielding to maintain critical temperature and survive abrasion in outer space, must also be included. Appendix A estimates these as 90 tonnes for wire shielding and 50 tonnes for the spools and other magsail infrastructure. Freeland compared this magsail deceleration design with one where both acceleration and deceleration were performed by a fusion engine and reported that the mass of such a &quot;dirty Icarus&quot; design was over twice that of a magsail used for deceleration. An Icarus design published in 2020 used a Z-pinch fusion drive in an approach called Firefly that dramatically reduced mass of the fusion drive and made fusion only drive performance for acceleration and deceleration comparable to the fusion for acceleration and magsail for deceleration design.

In 2017, Gros reported numerical examples for the Magsail kinematic model that used different parameters and coil mass models than those used by Freeland. That paper assumed hydrogen ion (H I) number densities of 0.05-0.2 cm−3 (9x10−23 - 3x10−22 kg/m3) for the warm local clouds and about 0.005 cm−3 (9x10−23 kg/m3) for voids of the local bubble. Patches of cold interstellar clouds with less than 200 AU may have large densities of neutral hydrogen up to 3000 cm−3, which would not respond to a magnetic field. For a high speed mission to Alpha Centauri with initial velocity before deceleration formula_320 using a coil mass of 1500 tons and a coil radius of formula_321=1600 km, the estimated stopping distance formula_275 was 0.37 light years and the total travel time of 58 years with 1/3 of that being deceleration.

In 2017, Crowl documented a design for a mission starting near the Sun and destined for Planet nine approximately 1,000 AU distant that employed the Magsail kinematic model. The design accounted for the Sun&#x27;s gravity as well as the impact of elevated temperature on the superconducting coil, composed of meta-stable metallic hydrogen, which has a mass density of 3,500 kg/m3 about half that of other superconductors. The mission profile used the Magsail to accelerate away from 0.25 to 1.0 AU from the Sun and then used the Magsail to brake against the Local ISM on approach to Planet nine for a total travel time of 29 years. Parameters and coil mass models differ from those used by Freeland.

Another mission profile uses a magsail oriented at an attack angle to achieve heliocentric transfer between planets moving away from or toward the Sun. In 2013 Quarta and others used Kajimura 2012 simulation results that described the lift (steering angle) and torque to achieve a Venus to Earth transfer orbit of 380 days with a coil radius of formula_123~1 km with characteristic acceleration formula_324=1 mm/s2. In 2019 Bassetto and others used the Quarta &quot;thick&quot; magnetopause model and predicted a Venus to Earth transfer orbit of approximately 8 years for a coil radius of formula_123~1 km. with characteristic acceleration formula_324=0.1 mm/s2. In 2020 Perakis used the Magsail kinematic model with a coil radius of formula_123=350 m, current formula_138=104 A and spacecraft mass of 600 kg that changed attack angle to accelerate away from the Earth orbit and decelerate to Jupiter orbit within 20 years.

=== Mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion (M2P2) ===

In 2000, Winglee, Slough and others proposed a design order to reduce the size and weight of a magnetic sail well below that of the magsail and named it mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion (M2P2) that reported results adapted from a simulation model of the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. The calculates speeds of 50 to 80 km s−1 could enable spacecraft:

* To travel out of the solar system 
* To travel between the planets for low power requirements of ∼1 kW per 100 kg of payload and ∼0.5 kg fuel consumption per day for acceleration periods of several days to a few weeks.

The figure based upon Winglee, Hajiwara, Arita, and Funaki illustrates the M2P2 design, which was the basis of the subsequent Magneto plasma sail (MPS) design. Starting at the center with a solenoid coil of radius formula_329 of formula_330=1,000 turns carrying a radio frequency current that generates a helicon wave that injects plasma fed from a source into a coil of radius formula_206 that carries a current of formula_138, which generates a magnetic field. The excited injected plasma enhances the magnetic field and generates a miniature magnetosphere around the spacecraft, analogous to the heliopause where the Sun injected plasma encounters the interstellar medium, coronal mass ejections or the Earth&#x27;s magnetotail. The injected plasma created an environment that analysis and simulations showed had a magnetic field with a falloff rate of formula_333 as compared with the classical model of a formula_334 falloff rate, making the much smaller coil significantly more effective based upon analysis and simulation. The pressure of the inflated plasma along with the stronger magnetic field pressure at a larger distance due to the lower falloff rate would stretch the magnetic field and more efficiently inflate a magnetospheric bubble around the spacecraft.

Parameters for the coil and solenoid were formula_329=2.5 cm and for the coil formula_206= 0.1 m, 6 orders of magnitude less than the magsail coil with correspondingly much lower mass. An estimate for the weight of the coil was 10 kg and 40 kg for the plasma injection source and other infrastructure. Reported results from Figure 2 were formula_337 T at formula_338 10 km and from Figure 3 an extrapolated result with a plasma injection jet force formula_33910−3 N resulting in a thrust force of formula_340 1 N. The magnetic-only sail force from equation is formula_199=3x10−11 N and thus M2P2 reported a thrust gain of 4x1010 as compared with a magnetic field only design. Since M2P2 injects ionized gas at a formula_342 mass flow rate (kg/s) it is viewed as a propellant and therefore has a &quot;specific impulse (s)&quot; formula_343 where formula_344 is the acceleration of Earth&#x27;s gravity. Winglee stated formula_342=0.5 kg/day and therefore formula_346=17,621. The equivalent exhaust velocity formula_347 is 173 km/s for 1 N of thrust force. Winglee assumed total propellant mass of 30 kg and therefore propellant would run out in 60 days.

In 2003, Khazanov published MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) and kinetic studies that confirmed some aspects of M2P2 but raised issues that the sail size was too small, and that very small thrust would result and also concluded that the hypothesized formula_348 magnetic field falloff rate was closer to formula_349. The plasma density plots from Khazanov indicated a relatively high density inside the magnetospheric bubble as compared with the external solar wind region that differed significantly from those published by Winglee where the density inside the magnetospheric bubble was much less than outside in the external solar wind region.

A detailed analysis by Toivanen and others in 2004 compared a theoretical model of Magsail, dubbed Plasma-free Magnetospheric Propulsion (PFMP) versus M2P2 and concluded that the thrust force predicted by Winglee and others was over ten orders of magnitude optimistic since the majority of the solar wind momentum was delivered to the magnetotail and current leakages through the magnetopause and not to the spacecraft. Their comments also indicated that the magnetic field lines may not close near enough to the coil to achieve significant transfer of force. Their analysis made an analogy to the Heliospheric current sheet as an example in astrophysics where the magnetic field could falloff at a rate of between formula_348 and formula_349. They also analyzed current sheets reported by Winglee from the magnetopause to the spacecraft in the windward direction and a current sheet in the magnetotail. Their analysis indicated that the current sheets needed to pass extremely close to the spacecraft to impart significant force could generate significant heat and render this leverage impractical.

In 2005, Cattell and others published comments regarding M2P2 that included a lack of magnetic flux conservation in the region outside the magnetosphere that was not considered in the Khazanov studies. Their analysis concluded in Table 1 that Winglee had significantly underestimated the required sail size, mass, and required magnetic flux. Their analysis asserted that the hypothesized formula_348 magnetic field falloff rate was not possible.

The expansion of the magnetic field using injected plasma was demonstrated in a large vacuum chamber on Earth, but quantification of thrust was not part of the experiment. The accompanying presentation has some good animations that illustrate physical principles described in the report. A 2004 Winglee paper focused on usage of M2P2 for electromagnetic shielding. Beginning in 2003, the Magneto plasma sail design further investigated the plasma injection augmentation of the magnetic field, used larger coils and reported significantly more modest gains.

=== Magnetoplasma sail (MPS) ===
In 2003 Funaki and others proposed an approach similar to the M2P2 design and called it the MagnetoPlasma Sail (MPS) that started with a coil formula_123=0.2 m and a magnetic field falloff rate of formula_2=1.52 with injected plasma creating an effective sail radius of formula_37=26 km and assumed a conversion efficiency that transferred a fraction of the solar wind momentum to the spacecraft. Simulation results indicated a significant increase in magnetosphere size with plasma injection as compared to the Magsail design, which had no plasma injection. Analysis showed how adjustment of the MPS steering angle created force that could reach the outer planets. A satellite trial was proposed. Preliminary performance results were reported but later modified in subsequent papers.

Many MPS papers have been published on the magnetic sail contributing to the understanding of general physical principles of an artificial magnetosphere, its magnetohydrodynamic model, and the design approach for computing the magnetopause distance for a given magnetic field source are documented in the linked sections of this article.

In 2004 Funaki and others analyzed MPS cases where formula_123=10 m and formula_123=100 m as summarized in Table 2 predicting a characteristic length formula_37 of 50 and 450 km producing significant thrust with mass substantially less than the Magsail and hence significant acceleration. This paper detailed the MHD applicability test of equation that the characteristic length must be greater than the ion gyroradius formula_194 to effectively transfer solar wind momentum to the spacecraft. In 2005 Yamakawa and others further described a potential trial.

An analogy with the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere and magnetopause in determining the penetration of plasma irregularities into the magnetopause defines the key parameter of a local kinetic plasma beta as the ratio of the dynamic pressure formula_360 of the injected plasma over the magnetic pressure formula_360 as followswhere formula_362 kg/m3 is the local plasma density, formula_363 m/s is the local velocity of the plasma and formula_364 T is the local magnetic field flux density. Simulations have shown that the kinetic beta is smallest near the field source, at magnetopause and the bow shock.

The kinetic formula_365 differs from the thermal plasma beta formula_366 which is the ratio of the plasma thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure, with terms: formula_367 is the plasma pressure with formula_368 the number density, formula_369 the Boltzmann constant and formula_370 the ion temperature; and formula_371 the magnetic pressure for magnetic field flux density formula_372 and formula_373 vacuum permeability. In the context of the MPS, formula_374 determines the propensity of the injected plasma flow to stretch the magnetic field while formula_375 specifies the relative energy of the injected plasma.

In 2005 Funaki and others published numerical analysis showing formula_376=1.88 for formula_374=0.1. In 2009 Kajimura published simulation results with formula_374=5 and formula_375 ranging from 6 to 20 that the magnetic field falloff rate formula_376 with argon and xenon plasma injected into the polar region was formula_376=2.1 and with argon plasma injected into the equatorial region was formula_376=1.8.

If formula_383 then the Injection of a high-velocity, high-density plasma into a magnetosphere as proposed in M2P2 freezes the motion of a magnetic field into the plasma flow and was believed to inflate the magnetosphere. However experiments and numerical analysis determined that the solar wind cannot compress the magnetosphere and momentum transfer to the spacecraft is limited since momentum is transferred to injected plasma flowing out of the magnetosphere, similar to another criticism of M2P2. 

An alternative is to reduce the plasma injection velocity and density to result in formula_384 to achieve a plasma in equilibrium with the inflated magnetic field and therefore induce an equatorial diamagnetic current in the same direction as the coil current as shown in the figure, thereby increasing the magnetic moment of the MPS field source and consequently increasing thrust. In 2013 Funaki and others published simulation and theoretical results regarding how characteristics of the injected plasma affected thrust gain through creation of an equatorial ring current. They defined thrust gain for MPS as formula_385: the ratio of the force generated by low beta plasma injection formula_386 divided by that of a pure magnetic sail formula_387 from equation with formula_388 and formula_389 for formula_390 or from equation for formula_391. They reported formula_392 of approximately 40 for magnetospheres less than the MHD applicability test and 3.77 for a larger magnetosphere where MHD applicability occurred, larger than values reported in 2012 of 20 and 3.3, respectively. Simulations revealed that optimum thrust gain occurred for formula_384 and formula_394.

In 2014 Arita, Nishida and Funaki published simulation results indicating that plasma injection created an equatorial ring current and that the plasma injection rate had a significant impact on thrust performance, with the lowest value simulated having the best performance of a thrust gain formula_392 of 3.77 with formula_396. They also reported that MPS increased the height of the magnetosphere by a factor of 2.6, which is important since it increases the effective sail blocking area.

In 2014 Ashida and others documented Particle In Cell (PIC) simulation results for a kinematic model for cases where formula_397 where MHD is not applicable. Equation (12) of their study included the additional force of the injected plasma jet formula_398 consisting of momentum and static pressure of ions and electrons and defined thrust gain as formula_399, which differs from the definition of a term by the same name in other studies. It represents the gain of MPS over that of simply adding the magnetic sail force and the plasma injection jet force. For the values cited in the conclusion, formula_400 is 7.5 in the radial orientation.

Since a number of results were published by different authors at different times, the figure summarizes the reported thrust gain formula_392 versus magnetosphere size (or characteristic length formula_37) with the source indicated in the legend as follows for simulation results Arita14, Ashida14, Funaki13, and Kajimura10. Simulation results require significant compute time, for example it took 1024 CPUs 4 days to simulate the simplest case and 4096 CPUs one week to simulate a more complex case. A thrust gain between 2 and 10 is common with the larger gains with a magnetic nozzle injecting plasma in one direction in opposition to the solar wind. The MHD applicability test of equation for the solar wind is formula_40372 km. Therefore, the estimated force of the MPS is that of equation multiplied by the empirically determined thrust gain formula_392 from the figure multiplied by the percentage thrust loss formula_190 from equation 

For example, using solar wind parameters formula_63=8x10−21 kg/m3 and formula_158=500 km/s then formula_194=72 km and formula_64=4x10−8 T. With formula_37=105 m for formula_2=3 then formula_412 and formula_413 11% from equation . The magnetic field only force with a coil radius of formula_123=6,300 m and coil current formula_138=1.6x106 A yields formula_416=1.6x10−4 T from equation and with formula_94=5 the magnetic force only is 175 N from equation . Determining formula_4184 from the figure at formula_37=105 m as the multiplier for the magnetic-only force then the MPS force formula_420700 N.

Since MPS injects ionized gas at a rate of formula_342 that can be viewed as a propellant it has a &quot;specific impulse&quot; formula_422 where formula_344 is the acceleration of Earth&#x27;s gravity. Funaki and Arita stated formula_342=0.31 kg/day. Therefore formula_346=28,325 s per newton of thrust force. The equivalent exhaust velocity formula_347 is 278 km/s per newton of thrust force.

In 2015 Kajimura and others published simulation results for thrust performance with plasma injected by a magnetic nozzle, a technology used in VASIMR. They reported a thrust gain formula_392 of 24 when the ion gyroradius formula_428 (see equation ) was comparable to the characteristic length formula_429, at the boundary of the MHD applicability test. The optimal result occurred with a thermal formula_430 with some decrease for higher values of thermal beta.

In 2015 Hagiwara and Kajimura published experimental thrust performance test results with plasma injection using a magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (aka MPD thruster or MPD Arcjet) in a single direction opposite the solar wind direction and a coil with the axial orientation. This meant that formula_431 provided additional propulsive force. Density plots explicitly show the increased plasma density upwind of the bow shock originating from the MPD thruster. They reported that formula_432 showing how MPS inflated the magnetic field to create more thrust than the magnetic sail alone plus that of the «text gap here». The conclusion of the experiment was that the thrust gain formula_392 was approximately 12 for a scaled characteristic length of formula_429 = 60 km. In the above figure, note the significant improvement in thrust gain at formula_429 = 60 km.as compared with only plasma injection.

In this example, using solar wind parameters formula_63=8x10−21 kg/m3 and formula_158=500 km/s then formula_194=72 km and formula_64=4x10−8 T. With formula_37=60 km for formula_2=3 then formula_442 and formula_413 28% from equation . The magnetic field only force with a coil radius of formula_123=2,900 m and coil current formula_138=1.6x106 A yields formula_416=3.5x10−4 T from equation and with formula_94=5 the magnetic force only is 51 N from equation . Given formula_392=12 as the multiplier for the magnetic only force then the MPS force formula_420611 N.

In 2017 Ueno published a design proposing use of multiple coils to generate a more complex magnetic field to increase thrust production. In 2020 Murayama and others published additional experimental results for a multi-pole MPD thruster. In 2017 Djojodihardjo published a conceptual design using MPS for a small (~500 kg) Earth observation satellite.

In 2020 Peng and others published MHD simulation results for a magnetic dipole with plasma injection operating in Low Earth orbit at 500 km within the Earth&#x27;s Ionosphere where the ion number density is approximately 1011 m−3. As reported in Figure 3, the magnetic field strength initially falls off as 1/r and then approaches 1/r2 at larger distances from the dipole. The radius of the artificial mini-magnetosphere could extend up to 200 m for this scenario. They reported that the injected plasma reduced magnetic field fall off rate and created of a drift current, similar to earlier reported MPS results for the solar wind.

=== Plasma magnet (PM) ===

The plasma magnet (PM) sail design introduced a different approach to generate a static magnetic dipole as illustrated in the figure. As shown in the detailed view on the right the field source is two relatively small crossed perpendicularly oriented antenna coils each of radius formula_123 (m), each carrying a sinusoidal alternating current (AC) with the total current of &quot;formula_138&quot; (A) generated by an onboard power supply. The AC current applied to each coil is out of phase by 90° and consequently generates a rotating magnetic field (RMF) with rotational frequency (s−1) formula_452 chosen that is fast enough that positive ions do not rotate but the less massive electrons rotate at this speed. The figure illustrates rotation using color coded contours of constant magnetic strength, not magnetic field lines. In order to inflate the magnetospheric bubble the thermal plasma beta formula_453 must be high and initially a plasma injection may be necessary, analogous to inflating a balloon when small and internal tension is high. After initial inflation, protons and rotating electrons are captured from the plasma wind through the leaky magnetopause and as shown in the left create a current disc shown as transparent red in the figure with darker shading indicating greatest density near the coil pair and extending out to the magnetopause radius &quot;Rmp&quot;, which is orders of magnitude larger than the coil radius &quot;Rc&quot; (figure not drawn to scale). See RMDCartoon.avi for an animation of this effect. The induced current disc carries a direct current formula_454 orders of magnitude larger than the input alternating current &quot;formula_138&quot; and forms a static dipole magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the current disc reaching a standoff balance with the plasma wind pressure at distance formula_456 at the magnetopause boundary according to the MHD model of an artificial magnetosphere.

The magnetic field falloff rate was assumed in 2001 and 2006 to be formula_150 =1. However, as described by Khazanov in 2003 and restated by Slough, Kirtley and Pancotti in 2011 and Kirtley and Slough in a 2012 NIAC report that formula_150=2 as demanded by conservation of magnetic flux. Several MPS studies concluded that formula_150 is closer to 2. The falloff rate formula_150 is a critical parameter in the determination of performance.

The RMF-induced rotating disc of electrons has current density (A m−2) formula_461 at distance &quot;r&quot; from the antenna for formula_462 and for formula_463, which states that flux conservation requires this falloff rate, consistent with a criticism of M2P2 by Cattell as follows:

where formula_464 T is the magnetic field flux density at radius formula_465 m near the antenna coils. Note that the current density is highest at formula_466 and falls off at a rate of formula_467. A critical condition for the plasma magnet design provides a lower bound on the RMF frequency formula_468 rad/s as follows so that electrons in the plasma wind are magnetized and rotate but the ions are not magnetized and do not rotate:

where formula_469 is the ion gyrofrequency (s−1) in the RMF near the antenna coils, formula_470 is charge number of the ion, formula_471 is the elementary charge, and formula_472 kg is the (average) mass of the ion(s). Specifying the magnetic field near the coils at radius formula_129 is critical since this is where the current density is greatest. Choosing a magnetic field at magnetopause yields a lower value of formula_468 but ions closer to the coils will rotate. Another condition is that formula_468 be small enough such that collisions are extremely unlikely.

The required power to generate the RMF formula_476 is derived by integrating the product of the square of the current density from equation and the resistivity of the plasma formula_477 from formula_129 to formula_124 with the result as follows:

where formula_477 is the Spitzer resistivity (W m) of the plasma of ~1.2x10−3 formula_481 where &quot;formula_482&quot; is the electron temperature assumed to be 15 eV, the same result for formula_462 and for formula_463.

Starting with the definition of plasma wind force from equation , noting that formula_485 rearranging and recognizing that equation gives the solution for formula_176, which can be substituted and then using equation for formula_64 yields the following expression

which when multiplied by formula_488 with formula_489 is the same as for formula_462 Note that solution for formula_476 and formula_129 must also satisfy equation , to which the comments following regarding a &quot;tremendous leverage of power&quot; do not address.

Note that a number of the examples cited in assume a magnetopause radius formula_124 that do not meet the MHD applicability test of equation . From the definition of power in physics a constant force is power divided by velocity, the force generated by the plasma magnet (PM) sail is as follows from equation Comparing the above with Equation not the dependence on plasma mass density formula_63 is of the same form formula_495. Note from Equation that as the falloff rate formula_2 increases that the force derived from the plasma wind decreases, or to maintain the same force formula_476 and/or formula_129 must increase to maintain the same force formula_499.

Equation gives the mass for each physical coil of radius formula_123 m. Since the RMF requires alternating current and semiconductors are not efficient at higher frequencies, aluminum was specified with mass density formula_501 = 2,700 kg/m3. Estimates of the coil mass are optimistic by a factor of formula_502 since only one coil was sized and the coil circumference was specified as formula_123 instead of formula_504.

The coil resistance is the product of coil material resistivity (Ω m) formula_505 (e.g., ~3x10−8 Ωm for aluminum) and the coil length formula_504 divided by the coil wire cross sectional area where formula_225 is the radius of the coil wire as follows:

Some additional power must compensate for resistive loss but it is orders of magnitude less than formula_476. The peak current carried by a coil is specified by the RMF power and coil resistance from the definition of electrical power in physics as follows:

The current induced in the disc by the RMF formula_509 is the integral of the current density formula_510 from equation on the surface of the disc with inner radius formula_206 and outer radius formula_512 with result:
the same result for formula_2=1.

Laboratory experiments validated that the RMF creates a magnetospheric bubble, electron temperature near the coils increases indicating presence of the rotatting disc of electrons and that thrust was generated. Since the scale of a terrestrial experiment is limited, simulations or a flight trial was recommended. Some of these concepts adapted to an ionospheric plasma environment were carried on in the plasma magnetoshell design.

In 2022 Freeze, Greason and others published a detailed design for a plasma magnet based sail for a spacecraft named Wind Rider that would use solar wind force to accelerate away from near Earth and decelerate against the magnetosphere of Jupiter in a spaceflight trial mission called Jupiter Observing Velocity Experiment (JOVE). This design employed a pair of superconducting coils each with radius formula_123 of 9 m, an alternating current of formula_138 of 112 A with formula_516 and a falloff rate of formula_462. A transit time to Jupiter of 25 days was reported for a 21 kg spacecraft design launched in a 16 U Cubesat format.

Using formula_2=1 creates very optimistic performance numbers, but since Slough changed this to formula_2=2 in 2011 and 2012, the case of formula_462 is not compared in this article. An example for formula_2=2 using solar wind parameters formula_63=8x10−21 kg/m3, formula_158=500 km/s then formula_194=72 km and formula_64=4x10−8 T with formula_124=105 m results in formula_412 where MHD applicability occurs. With a coil radius of formula_123=1,000 m yields formula_416=4x10−4 T from equation . The required RMF power from equation is 13 kW with a required AC coil current formula_138=10 A from equation resulting in an induced current of formula_509=2 kA from equation . With formula_94=5 the plasma magnet force from equation is 197 N. The magnetic force only for the above parameters is 2.8 N from equation and therefore the plasma magnet thrust gain is 71. The performance comparison section gives and optimistic estimate using constant acceleration for formula_2=2 results in a transit time of ~100 days.

=== Plasma magnetoshell (PMS) ===
A 2011 paper by Slough and others and a 2012 NIAC report by Kirtley investigated use of the plasma magnet technology with 1/r2 magnetic field falloff rate for use in the ionosphere of a planet as a braking mechanism in an approach dubbed Plasma magnetoshell (PMS). The magnetoshell creates drag by ionizing neutral atoms in a planet&#x27;s ionosphere then magnetically deflecting them. A tether attaching the plasma magnet coils to the spacecraft transfers momentum such that orbital insertion occurs. Analytical models, laboratory demonstrations and mission profiles to Neptune and Mars were described.

In 2017, Kelly described using a single-coil magnet with 1/r3 magnetic field falloff rate and more experimental results. In 2019 Kelly and Little published simulation results for magnetoshell performance scaling. A magnet with radius formula_123=1 m was tethered to a spacecraft with batteries for 1,000 seconds of operation (longer than aerocapture designs). The simulations assumed a magnet mass formula_535=1,000 kg and total magnetoshell system mass of 1,623 kg, suitable for a Cassini–Huygens or Juno size orbiter. The planet&#x27;s mass and atmosphere atomic composition and density determine a threshold velocity where magnetoshell operation is feasible. Saturn and Neptune have a hydrogen atmosphere and a threshold velocity of approximately 22 km/s. In a Neptune mission a formula_536=6 km is required for a 5,000 kg spacecraft and must average 50 kN for the maneuver duration. The model overestimates performance for N2 (Earth, Titan) and CO2 (Venus, Mars) atmospheres since multiple ion species are created and more complex interactions occur. Furthermore, the relatively lower mass of Venus and Mars reduces the threshold velocity below that of feasible magnetoshell operation. The paper states that aerocapture technologies are mature enough for these mission profiles.

In 2021, Kelly and Little published further details for use of drag-modulated plasma aerocapture (DMPA) that when compared to Adaptable Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) for drag-modulated aerocapture (DMA) to Neptune that could deliver 70% higher orbiter mass and experience 30% lower stagnation heating.

=== Beam powered magsail (BPM) ===
A beam-powered of M2P2 variant, MagBeam was proposed in 2011. In this design a magnetic sail is used with beam-powered propulsion, by using a high-power particle accelerator to fire a beam of charged particles at the spacecraft. The magsail would deflect this beam, transferring momentum to the vehicle, that could provide higher acceleration than a solar sail driven by a laser, but a charged particle beam would disperse in a shorter distance than a laser due to the electrostatic repulsion of its component particles. This dispersion problem could potentially be resolved by accelerating a stream of sails which then in turn transfer their momentum to a magsail vehicle, as proposed by Jordin Kare.

The table below compares performance measures for the magnetic sail designs with the following parameters for the solar wind (sw) at 1 AU: velocity formula_537= 500 km/s, number density formula_39= 5x106 m−3, ion mass formula_40 = 1.67x10−27 kg a proton mass, resulting in mass density formula_540 = 8.4x10−21 kg/m3, and coefficient of drag formula_94=5 where applicable. Equation gives the magnetic field at magnetopause as formula_64≈ 36 nT, equation gives the ion gyroradius formula_428≈ 72 km for formula_544=2. Table entries in boldface are from a cited source as described in the following:

Equation determines force for the Magsail (MS) divided by the Freeland correction factor 3.1, equation defines the force for the plasma magnet (PM) with the assumed magnetic field falloff rate formula_2=2. The force for the magnetic sail alone formula_387 is from equation . Thrust gain formula_547 for the magneto plasma sail (MPS) is the simulation and/or experimentally determined value with force defined equation to account for thrust loss due to operation in a kinematic region. The last column headed MPS+MPD adds a magnetoplasma dynamic thruster (MPD) that has a higher thrust gain as determined by experiment and simulation. Further details are in the section for the specific design. For designs other than MPS and MPS+MPD, the thrust gain formula_547 is the achieved force from the first row divided by the force of a magnetic sail alone in the second row. The magnetopause distance formula_76 and the coil radius formula_206 are design parameters. Equation with formula_551 defines the magnetic field near the coil(s) as formula_552.

The superconducting coil designs used a critical current density formula_553=2x106 A/m to account for warmer temperatures in the solar system. The plasma magnet uses AC power for the rotating magnetic field, PRMF as specified in Equation and cannot use a superconducting coil and assumed an aluminum coil with material density formula_501 = 2,700 kg/m3 and coil wire radius formula_225=5 mm. All other designs assumed a superconducting coil with material density formula_501 =6,500 kg/m3, coil wire radius formula_225=5 mm, and critical current formula_5581.6 x106 A, above which the coil becomes a normal conductor. The magnetopause distance formula_456 and coil radius formula_123 for superconducting-coil based designs were adjusted to meet this critical current constraint. The values for the plasma magnet used a value of formula_123 for formula_2=2 selected to minimize time to velocity and distance. The MPS values for formula_456 and formula_123 were chosen to match the thrust gain from simulation and scaled experimental results and meet the superconducting-coil critical current constraint.

Equation gives the physical coil mass formula_311 assuming a coil wire radius formula_225=5 mm. Equation gives the plasma magnet alternating current formula_567. Equation gives the direct current formula_567 with formula_131=2 for all other designs. The plasma magnet RMF uses the input alternating current formula_138 (kA) to rotate electrons in captured plasma to create an induced direct current disc carrying formula_509 kA as defined in equation .

Superconducting coils do not require continuous power (except possibly for cooling); however, the plasma magnet design does, as specified in equation . An estimate for the plasma magnet power supply mass assumes ~3 kg/W for nuclear power in space. Other mass was assumed to be 10 tonnes for MS and 1 tonne for PM and MPS. Acceleration formula_572 is the thrust force formula_573 from the first row divided by the total mass (coil plus other). An optimistic approximation is constant acceleration formula_572, for which the time to reach a target velocity V of 10% of the solar wind velocity is formula_575 and time to cover a specified distance formula_576 ≈ 7.8x108 km (approximate distance from Earth to Jupiter) is formula_577 . For comparison purposes the time for a Hohmann transfer from Earth orbit to Jupiter orbit is 2.7 years (almost 1,000 days) but that would allow orbital insertion whereas a magnetic sail would do a flyby unless the magnetosphere and gravity of Jupiter could provide deceleration. Another comparison is the New Horizons interplanetary space probe with a 30 kg payload that flew by Jupiter after 405 days on its way to Pluto.

The best time to velocity formula_578 and distance formula_579 performance occurs for the PM and MPS designs due primarily to much reduced coil and other mass. As described in the M2P2 section, several criticisms asserted that the falloff rate formula_2=1 was questionable and hence it was not included in this table. Simulations and experiments as described in the MPS section showed that formula_2=2 is valid with injection of plasma to inflate the magnetic field in a manner similar to M2P2. As described in the PM section, plasma is not injected but instead captured to achieve a falloff rate of formula_2=2, with calculations assuming formula_2=1 being very optimistic. The classic Magsail (MS) design generates the most thrust force and has considerable mass but still has relatively good time performance. Parameters for the other designs were chosen to yield comparable time performance subject to the constraints previously described. As described above and further detailed in the section for the respective design, this article contains the equations and parameters to compute performance estimates for different parameter choices.

== Criticisms ==

In 1994 Vulpetti published a critical review regarding viability of space propulsion based on solar wind momentum flux. The paper highlighted technology challenges in terms of the magnetic field source, energy required and interaction between the solar wind and the spacecraft&#x27;s magnetic field, summarizing that these issues were not insurmountable. The major unresolved issue is spacecraft and mission design that account for the potentially highly variable solar wind velocity and plasma density that could complicate maneuvers by a spacecraft employing magnetic sail technology. Some means of modulating thrust is necessary. If the mission objective is to rapidly escape the solar system then the paper states that this is less of an issue.

In 2006, Bolonkin published a paper that questioned the theoretical viability of a Magsail and described common mistakes. Equation (2) states that the magnetic field of electrons rotating in the large coil was greater than and opposed the magnetic field generated by the current in the coil and hence no thrust would result. In 2014 Vulpetti published a rebuttal that summarized plasma properties, in particular the fact that plasma is quasi-neutral and noted in equation (B1) that the Bolonkin paper equation (2) assumed that the plasma had a large net negative electrical charge. The plasma charge varies statistically over short intervals and the maximum value has negligible impact on Magsail performance. Furthermore, he argued that observations by many spacecraft have observed compression of a magnetic field by dynamic (or ram) pressure that did not depend on particle charges.

In 2017, Gros published results that differed from prior magsail work. A major result was the Magsail kinetic model of equation that is a curve fit to numerical analysis of proton trajectories impacted by a large current carrying superconducting coil. The curve fit scaling relation for the effective sail area formula_280 was logarithmic cubed with argument formula_585 with formula_247 the loop current, formula_587 the curve fit parameter, formula_36 the ship velocity and formula_245 the speed of light. This differed from the power law scaling formula_590 of prior work. The Gros paper could not trace back this difference to underlying physical arguments and noted that the results are inconsistent, stating that the source for these discrepancies was unclear. Appendix B questioned whether a bow shock will form if the initial spacecraft velocity formula_271 is large, for example for deceleration after interstellar travel, since the predicted effective sail area formula_237 is small in this case. One difference is that this analysis used the coil radius formula_123 for computation of the ion gyroradius as compared with prior work use of the magnetopause radius formula_124

== Fictional uses in popular culture ==
&quot;Magnetic sails&quot; have become a popular trope in many works of science fiction although the solar sail is more popular: 
# The ancestor of the magsail, the Bussard magnetic scoop, first appeared in science-fiction in Poul Anderson&#x27;s 1967 short story &quot;To Outlive Eternity&quot;, which was followed by the novel &quot;Tau Zero&quot; in 1970. 
# The magsail appears as a crucial plot device in &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, a &quot;Man-Kzin Wars&quot; novel by Jerry Pournelle and S.M. Stirling (1991). 
# It also features prominently in the science-fiction novels of Michael Flynn, particularly in &quot;The Wreck of the River of Stars&quot; (2003); this book is the tale of the last flight of a magnetic sail ship when fusion rockets based on the Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor have become the preferred technology.
#GURPS Spaceships features both solar sails and magnetic sails as possible methods of spacecraft propulsion.

Although not referred to as a &quot;magnetic sail&quot;, the concept was used in the novel Encounter with Tiber by Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes as a braking mechanism to decelerate starships from relativistic speed.

<text>A gas core reactor, and the very closely related vapor core reactor, is a proposed kind of nuclear reactor in which the nuclear fuel would be in a gaseous state rather than liquid or solid. In this type of reactor, the only temperature-limiting materials would be the reactor walls, and with appropriate cooling of the walls, the reactor can run at much higher temperatures. Conventional reactors have stricter limitations because the core would melt if the fuel temperature were to rise too high.

There are two proposed roles for the concept, for nuclear power electrical generation, and as an advanced rocket engine. In the former, the advantage to the design is that it directly produces a high-velocity stream of partially ionized gas. This can be used to power a magnetohydrodynamic generator (MHD), which can operate with efficiencies roughly double that of the traditional liquid-cooled reactors which use the Rankine cycle and reach about 35% efficiency. The complexity of the design and the failure to design successful cost-effective MHD devices led to this concept being dropped by the early 1980s. For the rocket role, the highly-energetic exhaust is expanded through a nozzle to produce thrust. Because of the very high energy content, a gas core reactor rocket will have much higher performance than even the best possible liquid rocket propellants, or alternative nuclear designs using a solid or liquid core.

Depending on the source, this basic concept may be known as a gas fueled reactor, gas nuclear reactor, gaseous fission reactor, and variations on these names. The related &quot;vapor&quot; design differs only in that the initial fuel is partially or entirely in the form of aerosol droplets rather than gas.

== Theory of operation ==
The vapor core reactor (VCR), also called a gas core reactor (GCR), has been studied for some time. It would have a gas or vapor core composed of uranium tetrafluoride (UF4) with some helium (4He) added to increase the electrical conductivity, the vapor core may also have tiny UF4 droplets in it. It has both terrestrial and space based applications. Since the space concept doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be economical in the traditional sense, it allows the enrichment to exceed what would be acceptable for a terrestrial system. It also allows for a higher ratio of UF4 to helium, which in the terrestrial version would be kept just high enough to ensure criticality in order to increase the efficiency of direct conversion. The terrestrial version is designed for a vapor core inlet temperature of about 1,500 K and exit temperature of 2,500 K and a UF4 to helium ratio of around 20% to 60%. It is thought that the outlet temperature could be raised to that of the 8,000 K to 15,000 K range where the exhaust would be a fission-generated non-equilibrium electron gas, which would be of much more importance for a rocket design. A terrestrial version of the VCR&#x27;s flow schematic can be found in reference 2 and in the summary of non-classical nuclear systems in the second external link. The space based concept would be cut off at the end of the MHD channel.

== Reasoning for He-4 addition ==
4He may be used in increase the ability of the design to extract energy and be controlled. A few sentences from Anghaie et al. sheds light on the reasoning:

:&quot;The power density in the MHD duct is proportional to the product of electrical conductivity, velocity squared and magnetic field squared σv²B². Therefore, the enthalpy extraction is very sensitive to the MHD input-output fluid conditions. The vapor core reactor provides a hotter-than-most fluid with potential for adequate thermal equilibrium conductivity and duct velocities. Considering the product v² × B², it is apparent that a light working fluid should dominate the thermal properties and the UF4 fraction should be small. Additional electrical conductivity enhancement might be needed from thermal ionization of suitable seed materials, and from non-equilibrium ionization by fission fragments and other ionizing radiation produced by the fissioning process.&quot;

==Spacecraft==
The spacecraft variant of the gaseous fission reactor is called the gas core reactor rocket. There are two approaches: the open and closed cycle. In the open cycle, the propellant, most likely hydrogen, is fed to the reactor, heated up by the nuclear reaction in the reactor, and exits out the other end. Unfortunately, the propellant will be contaminated by fuel and fission products, and although the problem can be mitigated by engineering the hydrodynamics within the reactor, it renders the rocket design completely unsuitable for use in atmosphere.

One might attempt to circumvent the problem by confining the fission fuel magnetically, in a manner similar to the fusion fuel in a tokamak. Unfortunately it is not likely that this arrangement will actually work to contain the fuel, since the ratio of ionization to particle momentum is not favourable. Whereas a tokamak would generally work to contain singly ionized deuterium or tritium with a mass of two or three daltons, the uranium vapour would be at most triply ionized with a mass of 235 dalton (unit). Since the force imparted by a magnetic field is proportional to the charge on the particle, and the acceleration is proportional to the force divided by the mass of the particle, the magnets required to contain uranium gas would be impractically large; most such designs have focused on fuel cycles that do not depend upon retaining the fuel in the reactor.

In the closed cycle, the reaction is entirely shielded from the propellant. The reaction is contained in a quartz vessel and the propellant merely flows outside of it, being heated in an indirect fashion. The closed cycle avoids contamination because the propellant can&#x27;t enter the reactor itself, but the solution carries a significant penalty to the rocket&#x27;s Isp.

==Energy production==
For energy production purposes, one might use a container located inside a solenoid. The container is filled with gaseous uranium hexafluoride, where the uranium is enriched, to a level just short of criticality. Afterward, the uranium hexafluoride is compressed by external means, thus initiating a nuclear chain reaction and a great amount of heat, which in turn causes an expansion of the uranium hexafluoride. Since the UF6 is contained within the vessel, it can&#x27;t escape and thus compresses elsewhere. The result is a plasma wave moving in the container, and the solenoid converts some of its energy into electricity at an efficiency level of about 20%. In addition, the container must be cooled, and one can extract energy from the coolant by passing it through a heat exchanger and turbine system as in an ordinary thermal power plant.

However, there are enormous problems with corrosion during this arrangement, as the uranium hexafluoride is chemically very reactive.

<text>The nuclear salt-water rocket (NSWR) is a theoretical type of nuclear thermal rocket designed by Robert Zubrin. In place of traditional chemical propellant, such as that in a chemical rocket, the rocket would be fueled by salts of plutonium or 20-percent-enriched uranium. The solution would be contained in a bundle of pipes coated in boron carbide (for its properties of neutron absorption). Through a combination of the coating and space between the pipes, the contents would not reach critical mass until the solution is pumped into a reaction chamber, thus reaching a critical mass, and being expelled through a nozzle to generate thrust.

==Proposed design==
Chemical rockets use heat energy produced by a chemical reaction to heat the gas products. The hot products exit through a propulsion nozzle at a very high speed, creating thrust. In a nuclear thermal rocket (NTR), thrust is created by heating a fluid by using a nuclear fission reactor. The lower the molecular weight of the exhaust (hydrogen having the lowest possible), the more efficient the motor can be. However, in this engine the propellant can be any of many fluids having suitable properties as it does not participate in generating heat. In a NSWR, the nuclear salt-water would be made to flow through a reaction chamber and out of an exhaust nozzle in such a way and at such speeds that critical mass will begin once the chamber is filled to a certain point; however, the peak neutron flux of the fission reaction would occur outside the vehicle.

==Advantages==
There are several advantages relative to conventional NTR designs. As the peak neutron flux and fission reaction rates would occur outside the vehicle, these activities could be much more vigorous than they could be if it was necessary to house them in a vessel (which would have temperature limits due to materials constraints). Additionally, a contained reactor can allow only a small percentage of its fuel to undergo fission at any given time; otherwise, it would overheat and melt down (or explode in a runaway fission chain reaction). The fission reaction in an NSWR is dynamic, and because the reaction products are exhausted into space, it does not have a limit on the proportion of fission fuel that reacts. In many ways, NSWRs combine the advantages of fission reactors and fission bombs.

Because they can harness the power of what is essentially a continuous nuclear fission explosion, NSWRs would have both very high thrust and very high exhaust velocity, meaning that the rocket would accelerate quickly and be extremely efficient in terms of propellant usage. The combination of high thrust and high specific impulse is a rare trait in the rocket world. One design would generate 13 meganewtons of thrust at 66 km/s exhaust velocity (or 6,730 seconds ISP, compared to ~4.5 km/s (450 s ISP) exhaust velocity for the best chemical rockets as of February 2023).

The design and calculations discussed above are using 20-percent-enriched uranium salts. However, it would be plausible to use another design which could achieve much higher exhaust velocities (4,725 km/s) and use a 30,000-tonne ice comet along with 7,500 tonnes of highly enriched uranium salts to propel a 300-tonne spacecraft up to 7.62% of the speed of light and potentially arrive at Alpha Centauri after a 60-year journey.

&quot;NSWRs share many of the features of Orion propulsion systems, except that NSWRs would generate continuous rather than pulsed thrust and may be workable on much smaller scales than the smallest feasible Orion designs (which are generally large, due to the requirements of the shock-absorber system and the minimum size of efficient nuclear explosives).&quot;

==Limitations==
The propellant used in the initial design would contain a rather large amount of the relatively expensive isotope U, which would not be very cost effective. However, if the use of NSWR began to rise, it would be possible to replace this with the cheaper isotopes U or Pu in either fission breeder reactors or (much better) nuclear fusion–fission hybrid reactors. These other fissiles would have the right characteristics to serve nearly as well, at a relatively low cost.

Another major limitation of the nuclear salt-water rocket design by Robert Zubrin included the lack of a material to be used in the reaction chamber that could actually sustain such a reaction within a spacecraft. Zubrin claimed in his design that the apparatus was created so that the liquid flow rate or velocity was what mattered most in the process, not the material. Therefore, he argued that if the proper velocity was chosen for the liquid traveling through the reaction chamber, the site of maximum fission release could then be located at the end of the chamber, thus allowing the system to remain intact and safe to operate. These claims have still not been proven due to no test of such a device having ever been conducted.

For example, Zubrin argues that if diluted nuclear fuel flows into the chamber at speed similar to diffusion speed of thermal neutrons, then the nuclear reaction is confined in the chamber and does not damage the rest of the system (the nuclear analog of a gas burner). A possible problem in that line of thinking is that neutrons do not all diffuse at the same velocity, but have a broad distribution over several orders of magnitude. It is possible that tails of this velocity distribution would be sufficient to generate enough heat in fuel feeding system (by scattering and fission) to destroy the system. This question can be perhaps answered by detailed Monte Carlo simulations of neutron transport.

The vessel&#x27;s exhaust would contain radioactive isotopes, but in space, these would be rapidly dispersed after travelling only a short distance; the exhaust would also be travelling at high speed (in Zubrin&#x27;s scenario, faster than Solar escape velocity, allowing it to eventually leave the Solar System). However, this is of little use on the surface of a planet, where a NSWR would eject massive quantities of superheated steam, still containing fissioning nuclear salts. Terrestrial testing might be subject to reasonable objections; as one physicist wrote:
: &quot;Writing the environmental impact statement for such tests [...] might present an interesting problem ...&quot;.
It is also not certain that fission in a NSWR could be controlled:
: &quot;Whether fast criticality can be controlled in a rocket engine remains an open question&quot;.

<doc id="37850" wikidata="Q4355073" url="?curid=37850" title="Beam-powered propulsion">
<text>Beam-powered propulsion, also known as directed energy propulsion, is a class of aircraft or spacecraft propulsion that uses energy beamed to the spacecraft from a remote power plant to provide energy. The beam is typically either a microwave or a laser beam, and it is either pulsed or continuous. A continuous beam lends itself to thermal rockets, photonic thrusters, and light sails. In contrast, a pulsed beam lends itself to ablative thrusters and pulse detonation engines.

The rule of thumb that is usually quoted is that it takes a megawatt of power beamed to a vehicle per kg of payload while it is being accelerated to permit it to reach low Earth orbit.

More speculative designs, using mass (&quot;micro-pellet&quot;) beams, would allow for reaching the edge of the solar gravity lens, or even nearby stars, in decades.

Other than launching to orbit, applications for moving around the world quickly have also been proposed.

==Background==

Rockets are momentum machines; they use mass ejected from the rocket to provide momentum to the rocket. Momentum is the product of mass and velocity, so rockets generally attempt to put as much velocity into their working mass as possible, thereby minimizing the needed working mass. To accelerate the working mass, energy is required. In a conventional rocket, the fuel is chemically combined to provide the energy, and the resulting fuel products, the ash or exhaust, are used as the working mass.

There is no particular reason why the same fuel has to be used for both energy and momentum. In the jet engine, for instance, the fuel is used only to produce energy, and the air provides the working mass the jet aircraft flies through. In modern jet engines, the amount of air propelled is much more significant than the amount used for energy. However, this is not a solution for the rockets as they quickly climb to altitudes where the air is too thin to be useful as a source of working mass.

Rockets can carry their working mass and use other energy sources. The problem is finding an energy source with a power-to-weight ratio that competes with chemical fuels. Small nuclear reactors can compete in this regard, and considerable work on nuclear thermal propulsion was carried out in the 1960s, but environmental concerns and rising costs led to the ending of most of these programs.

Further improvement can be made by removing the energy created by the spacecraft. If the nuclear reactor is left on the ground and its energy is transmitted to the spacecraft, its weight is also removed. The issue then is getting the energy into the spacecraft. This is the idea behind beamed power.

With beamed propulsion, one can leave the power source stationary on the ground and directly (or via a heat exchanger) heat propellant on the spacecraft with a maser or a laser beam from a fixed installation. This permits the spacecraft to leave its power source at home, saving significant amounts of mass and greatly improving performance.

==Laser propulsion==

Since a laser can heat propellant to extremely high temperatures, this potentially greatly improves the efficiency of a rocket, as exhaust velocity is proportional to the square root of the temperature. Normal chemical rockets have an exhaust speed limited by the fixed amount of energy in the propellants, but beamed propulsion systems have no particular theoretical limit (although, in practice, there are temperature limits).

==Microwave propulsion==
In microwave thermal propulsion, an external microwave beam is used to heat a refractory heat exchanger to &gt;1,500 K, heating a propellant such as hydrogen, methane, or ammonia. This improves the propulsion system&#x27;s specific impulse and thrust/weight ratio relative to conventional rocket propulsion. For example, hydrogen can provide a specific impulse of 700–900 seconds and a thrust/weight ratio of 50-150.

A variation, developed by brothers James Benford and Gregory Benford, is to use thermal desorption of propellant trapped in the material of a massive microwave sail. This produces a very high acceleration compared to microwave-pushed sails alone.

==Electric propulsion==
Some proposed spacecraft propulsion mechanisms use electrically powered spacecraft propulsion, in which electrical energy is used by an electrically powered rocket engine, such as an ion thruster or plasma propulsion engine. Usually, these schemes assume either solar panels or an onboard reactor. However, both power sources are heavy.

Beamed propulsion in the form of a laser can send power to a photovoltaic panel for &quot;Laser electric propulsion.&quot; In this system, if a high intensity is incident on the solar array, careful design of the panels is necessary to avoid a fall-off in conversion efficiency due to heating effects. John Brophy has analyzed the transmission of laser power to a photovoltaic array powering a high-efficiency electric propulsion system as a means of accomplishing high delta-V missions such as an interstellar precursor mission in a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts project.

A microwave beam could be used to send power to a rectenna for &quot;microwave electric propulsion&quot;. Microwave broadcast power has been practically demonstrated several times (e.g., in Goldstone, California, in 1974). Rectennas are potentially lightweight and can handle high power at high conversion efficiency. However, rectennas must be huge for a significant amount of power to be captured.

==Direct impulse==

A beam could also provide impulse by directly &quot;pushing&quot; on the sail.

One example is using a solar sail to reflect a laser beam. This concept, called a &quot;laser-pushed lightsail,&quot; was initially proposed by G. Marx but first analyzed in detail, and elaborated on, by physicist Robert L. Forward in 1989 as a method of interstellar travel that would avoid extremely high mass ratios by not carrying fuel. Further analysis of the concept was done by Landis, Mallove and Matloff, Andrews Lubin, and others.

Forward proposed pushing a sail with a microwave beam in a later paper. This has the advantage that the sail need not be a continuous surface. Forward tagged his proposal for an ultralight sail &quot;Starwisp&quot;. A later analysis by Landis suggested that the Starwisp concept as initially proposed by Forward would not work, but variations on the proposal might be implemented.

The beam has to have a large diameter so that only a small portion of the beam misses the sail due to diffraction, and the laser or microwave antenna has to have good pointing stability so that the craft can tilt its sails fast enough to follow the center of the beam. This gets more important when going from interplanetary travel to interstellar travel and when going from a fly-by mission to a landing mission to a return mission. The laser or the microwave sender would probably be a large phased array of small devices that get their energy directly from solar radiation. The size of the array negates the need for a lens or mirror.

Another beam-pushed concept would be to use a magnetic sail or MMPP sail to divert a beam of charged particles from a particle accelerator or plasma jet. Landis proposed a particle beam pushed sail in 1989, and analyzed in more detail in a 2004 paper. Jordin Kare has proposed a variant to this whereby a &quot;beam&quot; of small laser accelerated light sails would transfer momentum to a magsail vehicle.

=== Mass beam systems ===
Another beam-pushed concept uses pellets or projectiles of ordinary matter. A stream of pellets from a stationary mass-driver is &quot;reflected&quot; by the spacecraft, cf. mass driver. The spacecraft neither needs energy nor reaction mass for propulsion of its own. For craft at sub-relativistic velocities, mass beams would be more efficient than photon beams. Nordley and Crowl point out, &quot;A photon must travel at the speed of light and until relativistic velocities are reached, a reflected photon carries away almost as much energy as it started with. A massive particle’s velocity, however, can be tuned so that the reflected mass is left almost dead in space relative to the beam generators, having surrendered almost all of its kinetic energy to the starship.&quot;

==Proposed systems==

===Lightcraft===

A lightcraft is a vehicle currently under development that uses an external pulsed source of laser or maser energy to provide power for producing thrust.

The laser shines on a parabolic reflector on the vehicle&#x27;s underside, concentrating the light to produce a region of extremely high temperature. The air in this region is heated and expands violently, producing thrust with each pulse of laser light. A lightcraft must provide this gas from onboard tanks or an ablative solid in space. By leaving the vehicle&#x27;s power source on the ground and using the ambient atmosphere as reaction mass for much of its ascent, a lightcraft could deliver a substantial percentage of its launch mass to orbit. It could also potentially be very cheap to manufacture.

====Testing====
Early in the morning of 2 October 2000 at the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility (HELSTF), Lightcraft Technologies, Inc. (LTI) with the help of Franklin B. Mead of the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and Leik Myrabo set a new world&#x27;s altitude record of 233 feet (71 m) for its 4.8 inch (12.2 cm) diameter, , laser-boosted rocket in a flight lasting 12.7 seconds. Although much of the 8:35 am flight was spent hovering at 230+ feet, the Lightcraft earned a world record for the longest ever laser-powered free flight and the greatest &quot;air time&quot; (i.e., launch-to-landing/recovery) from a light-propelled object. This is comparable to Robert Goddard&#x27;s first test flight of his rocket design. Increasing the laser power to 100 kilowatts will enable flights up to a 30-kilometer altitude. They aim to accelerate a one-kilogram microsatellite into low Earth orbit using a custom-built, one-megawatt ground-based laser. Such a system would use just about 20 dollars worth of electricity, placing launch costs per kilogram to many times less than current launch costs (which are measured in thousands of dollars).

Myrabo&#x27;s &quot;lightcraft&quot; design is a reflective funnel-shaped craft that channels heat from the laser toward the center, using a reflective parabolic surface, causing the laser to explode the air underneath it, generating lift. Reflective surfaces in the craft focus the beam into a ring, where it heats air to a temperature nearly five times hotter than the surface of the Sun, causing the air to expand explosively for thrust.

===Laser thermal rocket===

A laser thermal rocket is a thermal rocket in which the propellant is heated by energy provided by an external laser beam. 
In 1992, the late Jordin Kare proposed a simpler, nearer-term concept with a rocket containing liquid hydrogen. The propellant is heated in a heat exchanger that the laser beam shines on before leaving the vehicle via a conventional nozzle. This concept can use continuous beam lasers, and the semiconductor lasers are now cost-effective for this application.

=== Microwave thermal rocket ===

In 2002, Kevin L.G. Parkin proposed a similar system using microwaves. In May 2012, the DARPA/NASA Millimeter-wave Thermal Launch System (MTLS) Project began the first steps toward implementing this idea. The MTLS Project was the first to demonstrate a millimeter-wave absorbent refractory heat exchanger, subsequently integrating it into the propulsion system of a small rocket to produce the first millimeter-wave thermal rocket. Simultaneously, it developed the first high-power cooperative target millimeter-wave beam director and used it to attempt the first millimeter-wave thermal rocket launch. Several launches were attempted, but problems with the beam director could not be resolved before funding ran out in March 2014.

=== Mass Beam Systems ===
Aerospace and mechanical engineer Artur Davoyan has been funded by NASA to study a pellet-beam system that would propel one ton payloads to 500 AU in under 20 years.

Nordley and Crowl propose vast solar arrays built by self-replicating robots placed at the Sun-Venus equilateral Lagrange points, capable of generating beams in the hundreds of petawatt range. With such technologies, craft could be driven to relativistic speeds, capable of reaching nearby stars in decades.

== Economics ==
The motivation to develop beam-powered propulsion systems comes from the economic advantages gained due to improved propulsion performance. In the case of beam-powered launch vehicles, better propulsion performance enables some combination of increased payload fraction, increased structural margins, and fewer stages. JASON&#x27;s 1977 study of laser propulsion, authored by Freeman Dyson, succinctly articulates the promise of beam-powered launch: &quot;Laser propulsion as an idea that may produce a revolution in space technology. A single laser facility on the ground can in theory launch single-stage vehicles into low or high earth orbit. The payload can be 20% or 30% of the vehicle take-off weight. It is far more economical in the use of mass and energy than chemical propulsion, and it is far more flexible in putting identical vehicles into a variety of orbits.&quot;This promise was quantified in a 1978 Lockheed Study conducted for NASA:&quot;The results of the study showed that, with advanced technology, laser rocket system with either a space- or ground-based laser transmitter could reduce the national budget allocated to space transportation by 10 to 345 billion dollars over a 10-year life cycle when compared to advanced chemical propulsion systems (LO2-LH2) of equal capability.&quot;

=== Beam director cost ===
The 1970s-era studies and others since have cited beam director cost as a possible impediment to beam-powered launch systems. A recent cost-benefit analysis estimates that microwave (or laser) thermal rockets would be economical once beam director cost falls below 20 $/Watt. The current cost of suitable lasers is &lt;100 $/Watt and the cost of suitable microwave sources is &lt;$5/Watt. Mass production has lowered the production cost of microwave oven magnetrons to &lt;0.01 $/Watt and some medical lasers to &lt;10 $/Watt, though these are considered unsuitable for beam directors.

==Non-spacecraft applications==

In 1964 William C. Brown demonstrated a miniature helicopter equipped with a combination antenna and rectifier device called a rectenna. The rectenna converted microwave power into electricity, allowing the helicopter to fly.

In 2002 a Japanese group propelled a tiny aluminium airplane by using a laser to vaporize a water droplet clinging to it, and in 2003 NASA researchers flew an 11-ounce (312 g) model airplane with a propeller powered with solar panels illuminated by a laser. It is possible that such beam-powered propulsion could be useful for long-duration high altitude uncrewed aircraft or balloons, perhaps designed to serve – like satellites do today – as communication relays, science platforms, or surveillance platforms.

A &quot;laser broom&quot; has been proposed to sweep space debris from Earth orbit. This is another proposed use of beam-powered propulsion, used on objects not designed to be propelled by it, for example, small pieces of scrap knocked off (&quot;spalled&quot;) satellites. The technique works since the laser power ablates one side of the object, giving an impulse that changes the eccentricity of the object&#x27;s orbit. The orbit would then intersect the atmosphere and burn up.

<doc id="37851" wikidata="Q4492226" url="?curid=37851" title="Nuclear photonic rocket">
<text>In a traditional nuclear photonic rocket, an onboard nuclear reactor would generate such high temperatures that the blackbody radiation from the reactor would provide significant thrust. The disadvantage is that it takes much power to generate a small amount of thrust this way, so acceleration is very low. The photon radiators would most likely be constructed using graphite or tungsten. Photonic rockets are technologically feasible, but rather impractical with current technology based on an onboard nuclear power source.

==Energy requirements and comparisons==
The power per thrust required for a perfectly collimated output beam is 300 MW/N (half this if it can be reflected off the craft); very high energy density power sources would be required to provide reasonable thrust without unreasonable weight. The specific impulse of a photonic rocket is harder to define, since the output has no (rest) mass and is not expended fuel; if we take the momentum per inertia of the photons, the specific impulse is just &quot;c&quot;, which is impressive. However, considering the mass of the source of the photons, e.g., atoms undergoing nuclear fission, brings the specific impulse down to 300 km/s (&quot;c&quot;/1000) or less; considering the infrastructure for a reactor (some of which also scales with the amount of fuel) reduces the value further. Finally, any energy loss not through radiation that is redirected precisely to aft but is instead conducted away by engine supports, radiated in some other direction, or lost via neutrinos or so will further degrade the efficiency. If we were to set 80% of the mass of the photon rocket = fissionable fuel, and recognizing that nuclear fission converts about 0.10% of the mass into energy: then if the photon rocket masses 300,000 kg then 240,000 kg of that is atomic fuel. Therefore, the fissioning of all of the fuel will result in the loss of just 240 kg of mass. Then 300,000/299,760 kg = an &quot;m&quot;i/&quot;m&quot;f of 1.0008. Using the rocket equation, we find &quot;v&quot;f = ln 1.0008 × &quot;c&quot; where &quot;c&quot; = 299,792,458 m/s.
&quot;v&quot;f then may be 239,930 m/s which is about 240 km/s. The nuclear fission powered photon rocket may accelerate at a maximum of perhaps 1/10,000 m/s² (0.1 mm/s²) which is 10−5&quot;g&quot;. The velocity change would be at the rate of 3,000 m/s per year of thrusting by the photon rocket.

If a photon rocket begins its journey in low Earth orbit, then one year of thrusting may be required to achieve an Earth escape velocity of 11.2 km/s if the vehicle is already in orbit at a velocity of 9,100 m/s. Upon escaping the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field the rocket will have a heliocentric velocity of 30 km/s in interplanetary space. Eighty years of steady photonic thrusting would be then required to obtain a final velocity of 240 km/s in this hypothetical case.

It is possible to obtain even higher specific impulse; that of some other photonic propulsion devices (e.g., solar sails) is effectively infinite because no carried fuel is required. Alternatively, such devices as ion thrusters, while having a notably lower specific impulse, give a much better thrust-to-power ratio; for photons, that ratio is formula_1, whereas for slow particles (that is, nonrelativistic; even the output from typical ion thrusters counts) the ratio is formula_2, which is much larger (since formula_3). (This is in a sense an unfair comparison, since the photons must be &quot;created&quot; and other particles are merely &quot;accelerated&quot;, but nonetheless the impulses per carried mass and per applied energy—the practical quantities—are as given.) The photonic rocket is thus wasteful when power and not mass is at a premium, or when enough mass can be saved through the use of a weaker power source that reaction mass can be included without penalty.

A laser could be used as a photon rocket engine, and would solve the reflection/collimation problem, but lasers are absolutely less efficient at converting energy into light than blackbody radiation is—though one should also note the benefits of lasers vs blackbody source, including unidirectional controllable beam and the mass and durability of the radiation source. The limitations posed by the rocket equation can be overcome, as long as the reaction mass is not carried by the spacecraft. In the Beamed Laser Propulsion (BLP) concept, the photons are beamed from the photon source to the spacecraft as coherent light. Robert L. Forward pioneered interstellar propulsion concepts including photon propulsion and antimatter rocket propulsion. However, BLP is limited because of the extremely low thrust generation efficiency of photon reflection. One of the best ways to overcome the inherent inefficiency in producing thrust of the photon thruster by amplifying the momentum transfer of photons by recycling photons between two high reflectance mirrors.

==Power sources==
Feasible current, or near-term fission reactor designs can generate up to 2.2 kW per kilogram of reactor mass. Without any payload, such a reactor could drive a photon rocket at nearly 10−5 m/s² (10−6&quot;g&quot;; see &quot;g&quot;-force). This could perhaps provide interplanetary spaceflight capability from Earth orbit. Nuclear fusion reactors could also be used, perhaps providing somewhat higher power.

A design proposed in the 1950s by Eugen Sänger used positron-electron annihilation to produce gamma rays. Sänger was unable to solve the problem of how to reflect, and collimate the gamma rays created by positron-electron annihilation; however, by shielding the reactions (or other annihilations) and absorbing their energy, a similar blackbody propulsion system could be created. An antimatter-matter powered photon rocket would (disregarding the shielding) obtain the maximum &quot;c&quot; specific impulse; for this reason, an antimatter-matter annihilation powered photon rocket could potentially be used for interstellar spaceflight.

Theoretically, other designs such as spacecraft using a Kugelblitz micro black hole could also be used for interstellar travel given the efficiency of black holes in converting matter into energy.

<text>A fusion rocket is a theoretical design for a rocket driven by fusion propulsion that could provide efficient and sustained acceleration in space without the need to carry a large fuel supply. The design requires fusion power technology beyond current capabilities, and much larger and more complex rockets.

Fusion nuclear pulse propulsion is one approach to using nuclear fusion energy to provide propulsion.

Fusion&#x27;s main advantage is its very high specific impulse, while its main disadvantage is the (likely) large mass of the reactor. A fusion rocket may produce less radiation than a fission rocket, reducing the shielding mass needed. The simplest way of building a fusion rocket is to use hydrogen bombs as proposed in Project Orion, but such a spacecraft would be massive and the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty prohibits the use of such bombs. For that reason bomb-based rockets would likely be limited to operating only in space. An alternate approach uses electrical (e.g. ion) propulsion with electric power generated by fusion instead of direct thrust.

== Electricity generation vs. direct thrust ==

Spacecraft propulsion methods such as ion thrusters require electric power to run, but are highly efficient. In some cases their thrust is limited by the amount of power that can be generated (for example, a mass driver). An electric generator running on fusion power could drive such a ship. One disadvantage is that conventional electricity production requires a low-temperature energy sink, which is difficult (i.e. heavy) in a spacecraft. Direct conversion of the kinetic energy of fusion products into electricity mitigates this problem.

One attractive possibility is to direct the fusion exhaust out the back of the rocket to provide thrust without the intermediate production of electricity. This would be easier with some confinement schemes (e.g. magnetic mirrors) than with others (e.g. tokamaks). It is also more attractive for &quot;advanced fuels&quot; (see aneutronic fusion). Helium-3 propulsion would use the fusion of helium-3 atoms as a power source. Helium-3, an isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron, could be fused with deuterium in a reactor. The resulting energy release could expel propellant out the back of the spacecraft. Helium-3 is proposed as a power source for spacecraft mainly because of its lunar abundance. Scientists estimate that 1 million tons of accessible helium-3 are present on the moon. Only 20% of the power produced by the D-T reaction could be used this way; while the other 80% is released as neutrons which, because they cannot be directed by magnetic fields or solid walls, would be difficult to direct towards thrust, and may in turn require shielding. Helium-3 is produced via beta decay of tritium, which can be produced from deuterium, lithium, or boron.

Even if a self-sustaining fusion reaction cannot be produced, it might be possible to use fusion to boost the efficiency of another propulsion system, such as a VASIMR engine.

== Confinement alternatives ==

=== Magnetic ===
To sustain a fusion reaction, the plasma must be confined. The most widely studied configuration for terrestrial fusion is the tokamak, a form of magnetic confinement fusion. Currently tokamaks weigh a great deal, so the thrust to weight ratio would seem unacceptable. NASA&#x27;s Glenn Research Center proposed in 2001 a small aspect ratio spherical torus reactor for its &quot;Discovery II&quot; conceptual vehicle design. &quot;Discovery II&quot; could deliver a crewed 172 metric tons payload to Jupiter in 118 days (or 212 days to Saturn) using 861 metric tons of hydrogen propellant, plus 11 metric tons of Helium-3-Deuterium (D-He3) fusion fuel. The hydrogen is heated by the fusion plasma debris to increase thrust, at a cost of reduced exhaust velocity (348–463 km/s) and hence increased propellant mass.

=== Inertial ===
The main alternative to magnetic confinement is inertial confinement fusion (ICF), such as that proposed by Project Daedalus. A small pellet of fusion fuel (with a diameter of a couple of millimeters) would be ignited by an electron beam or a laser. To produce direct thrust, a magnetic field forms the pusher plate. In principle, the Helium-3-Deuterium reaction or an aneutronic fusion reaction could be used to maximize the energy in charged particles and to minimize radiation, but it is highly questionable whether using these reactions is technically feasible. Both the detailed design studies in the 1970s, the Orion drive and Project Daedalus, used inertial confinement. In the 1980s, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA studied an ICF-powered &quot;Vehicle for Interplanetary Transport Applications&quot; (VISTA). The conical VISTA spacecraft could deliver a 100-tonne payload to Mars orbit and return to Earth in 130 days, or to Jupiter orbit and back in 403 days. 41 tonnes of deuterium/tritium (D-T) fusion fuel would be required, plus 4,124 tonnes of hydrogen expellant. The exhaust velocity would be 157 km/s.

The very large necessary mass and the challenge of managing the heat produced in space may make an ICF reactor unworkable in space travel.

=== Magnetized target ===
Magnetized target fusion (MTF) is a relatively new approach that combines the best features of the more widely studied magnetic confinement fusion (i.e. good energy confinement) and inertial confinement fusion (i.e. efficient compression heating and wall free containment of the fusing plasma) approaches. Like the magnetic approach, the fusion fuel is confined at low density by magnetic fields while it is heated into a plasma, but like the inertial confinement approach, fusion is initiated by rapidly squeezing the target to dramatically increase fuel density, and thus temperature. MTF uses &quot;plasma guns&quot; (i.e. electromagnetic acceleration techniques) instead of powerful lasers, leading to low cost and low weight compact reactors. The NASA/MSFC Human Outer Planets Exploration (HOPE) group has investigated a crewed MTF propulsion spacecraft capable of delivering a 164-tonne payload to Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto using 106-165 metric tons of propellant (hydrogen plus either D-T or D-He3 fusion fuel) in 249–330 days. This design would thus be considerably smaller and more fuel efficient due to its higher exhaust velocity (700 km/s) than the previously mentioned &quot;Discovery II&quot;, &quot;VISTA&quot; concepts.

=== Inertial electrostatic ===
Another popular confinement concept for fusion rockets is inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC), such as in the Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor or the Polywell variation under development by Energy-Matter Conversion Corporation (EMC2). The University of Illinois has defined a 500-tonne &quot;Fusion Ship II&quot; concept capable of delivering a 100,000 kg crewed payload to Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa in 210 days. Fusion Ship II utilizes ion rocket thrusters (343 km/s exhaust velocity) powered by ten D-He3 IEC fusion reactors. The concept would need 300 tonnes of argon propellant for a 1-year round trip to the Jupiter system. Robert Bussard published a series of technical articles discussing its application to spaceflight throughout the 1990s. His work was popularised by an article in the Analog Science Fiction and Fact publication, where Tom Ligon described how the fusor would make for a highly effective fusion rocket.

=== Antimatter ===
A still more speculative concept is antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion, which would use antimatter to catalyze a fission and fusion reaction, allowing much smaller fusion explosions to be created. During the 1990s an abortive design effort was conducted at Penn State University under the name AIMStar. The project would require more antimatter than can currently be produced. In addition, some technical hurdles need to be surpassed before it would be feasible.

<doc id="37853" wikidata="Q1760905" url="?curid=37853" title="Bussard ramjet">
<text>The Bussard ramjet is a theoretical method of spacecraft propulsion for interstellar travel. A fast moving spacecraft scoops up hydrogen from the interstellar medium using an enormous funnel-shaped magnetic field (ranging from kilometers to many thousands of kilometers in diameter); the hydrogen is compressed until thermonuclear fusion occurs, which provides thrust to counter the drag created by the funnel and energy to power the magnetic field. The Bussard ramjet can thus be seen as a ramjet variant of a fusion rocket.

The Bussard ramjet was proposed in 1960 by the physicist Robert W. Bussard.

The concept was popularized by Poul Anderson in his novel &quot;Tau Zero&quot;, Larry Niven in his &quot;Known Space&quot; series of books, Vernor Vinge in his &quot;Zones of Thought&quot; series, and Carl Sagan, as referenced in the television series and book &quot;&quot;.

==Feasibility==
Since the time of Bussard&#x27;s original proposal, it has been discovered that the region surrounding the Solar System has a much lower density of hydrogen than was believed at that time (see Local Interstellar Cloud). In 1969, John Ford Fishback made an important contribution, describing the details of the required magnetic field. 

In 1978, T. A. Heppenheimer analyzed Bussard&#x27;s original suggestion of fusing protons, but found the Bremsstrahlung losses from compressing protons to fusion densities was greater than the power that could be produced by a factor of about 1 billion, thus indicating that the proposed version of the Bussard ramjet was infeasible. However, Daniel P. Whitmire&#x27;s 1975 analysis indicates that a ramjet may achieve net power via the CNO cycle, which produces fusion at a much higher rate (~1016 times higher) than the proton–proton chain.

Robert Zubrin and Dana Andrews analyzed one hypothetical version of the Bussard ramjet design in 1988. They determined that their version of the ramjet would be unable to accelerate into the solar wind.

A 2021 study found that, while feasible in principle, the practical construction of a useful Bussard ramjet would be beyond even a civilization of Kardashev type II.

===Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket (RAIR)===
The problem of using the interstellar medium as the sole fuel source led to study of the Ram Augmented Interstellar Rocket (RAIR). The RAIR carries its nuclear fuel supply and exhausts the reaction products to produce some of its thrust. However it greatly enhances its performance by scooping the interstellar medium and using this as extra reaction mass to augment the rocket. The propulsion system of the RAIR consists of three subsystems: a fusion reactor, a scoop field, and a plasma accelerator. Fuel is launched ahead of the ship with the accelerator. The scoop field funnels the fuel into another accelerator (this could for example be a heat exchange system transferring thermal energy from the reactor directly to the interstellar gas) which is supplied power from a reactor. One of the best ways to understand this concept is to consider that the hydrogen nuclear fuel carried on board acts as a fuel (energy source) whereas the interstellar gas collected by the scoop and then exhausted at great speed from the back acts as a propellant (the reaction mass), the vehicle therefore has a limited fuel supply but an unlimited propellant supply. A normal Bussard ramjet would have an infinite supply of both. However, theory suggests that where a Bussard ramjet would suffer drag from having to pre-accelerate interstellar gas to its own speed before intake, a RAIR system would be able to transfer energy via the &quot;accelerator&quot; mechanism to the interstellar medium despite velocity differences, and so would suffer far less drag.

===Laser Powered Interstellar Ramjet===
Beamed energy coupled with a vehicle scooping hydrogen from the interstellar medium is another variant. A laser array in the solar system beams to a collector on a vehicle which uses something like a linear accelerator to produce thrust. This solves the fusion reactor problem for the ramjet. There are limitations because of the attenuation of beamed energy with distance.

===Magnetic sail===
The calculations (by Robert Zubrin and Dana Andrews) inspired the idea of a magnetic parachute or sail. This could be important for interstellar travel because it means that deceleration at the destination can be performed with a magnetic parachute rather than a rocket.

===Dyson swarm-based stellar engine (Caplan thruster)===

Astrophysicist Matthew E. Caplan of Illinois State University has proposed a type of stellar engine that uses a Dyson swarm of mirrors to concentrate stellar energy onto certain regions of a Sun-like star, producing beams of solar wind to be collected by a multi-ramjet assembly which in turn produces directed jets of plasma to stabilize its orbit and oxygen-14 to push the star. Using rudimentary calculations that assume maximum efficiency, Caplan estimates the Bussard engine would use 1015 grams per second of solar material to produce a maximum acceleration of 10−9 m/s2, yielding a velocity of 200 km/s after 5 million years, and a distance of 10 parsecs over 1 million years. The Bussard engine would theoretically work for 100 million years given the mass loss rate of the Sun, but Caplan deems 10 million years to be sufficient for a stellar collision avoidance.

===Pre-seeded trajectory===
Several of the obvious technical difficulties with the Bussard ramjet can be overcome by setting out solid pellets of fuel along the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory in advance. This could be done using a different &quot;tanker&quot; spacecraft dropping fuel pellets or using laser propulsion. The method has been referred to as the &quot;fusion runway&quot;, ramjet runway or &quot;forward resupply runway&quot;.

While most proposals use fusion power, as with conventional Bussard ramjets, fission has also been suggested.

The advantages of this system include:

* Fusion can be achieved by slamming two fuel pellets together at a speed of at least 200 km/s - this is known as impact fusion. Compared to inertial confinement fusion, impact fusion would not require spherically symmetrical pellets or application of force from all directions.
* The fuel pellets could use isotopes such as deuterium (hydrogen-2) or tritium (hydrogen-3). A conventional Bussard ramjet will mostly collect protium (hydrogen-1), as this is the most abundant isotope of hydrogen in nature.
* Launching only ionized fusion fuel so that either magnetic or electrostatic scoops can more easily funnel the fuel into the engine. The drawback is this will cause the fuel to disperse due to electrostatic repulsion.
* Launching the fuel on a trajectory so that the fuel velocity vector will closely match the expected velocity vector of the spacecraft at that point in its trajectory. This will minimize the &quot;drag&quot; forces generated by the collection of fuel.
* Although the prelaunched fuel for the ramjet negates one advantage of the Bussard design (collection of fuel as it moves through the interstellar medium, saving the cost to launch the fuel mass), it at least retains the advantage of not having to accelerate the mass of the fuel and the mass of the rocket at the same time.
* The prelaunched fuel would provide some visibility into the interstellar medium – thus alerting the trailing spacecraft of unseen hazards (e.g., brown dwarfs).

The major disadvantages of this system include:

* The need to precisely intercept the fusion runway pellets with a spacecraft moving at high speed. Laser pulses could be used to guide the pellets.
* If using impact fusion, the spacecraft must be moving at a minimum speed in order to achieve fusion. One suggestion is for the spacecraft to use a Sun-skimming maneuver to reach 600 km/s.
* The spacecraft could not deviate from the precalculated trajectory unless it was critical to do so. Any such deviation would separate the spacecraft from its fuel supply and leave it with only a minimal ability to return to its original trajectory.
* Prelaunched fuel for deceleration at the destination star would not be available unless launched many decades in advance of the spacecraft launch. However, other systems (such as the magnetic sails) could be used for this purpose.

<doc id="37854" wikidata="Q4774928" url="?curid=37854" title="Antimatter rocket">
<text>An antimatter rocket is a proposed class of rockets that use antimatter as their power source. There are several designs that attempt to accomplish this goal. The advantage to this class of rocket is that a large fraction of the rest mass of a matter/antimatter mixture may be converted to energy, allowing antimatter rockets to have a far higher energy density and specific impulse than any other proposed class of rocket.

==Methods==
Antimatter rockets can be divided into three types of application: those that directly use the products of antimatter annihilation for propulsion, those that heat a working fluid or an intermediate material which is then used for propulsion, and those that heat a working fluid or an intermediate material to generate electricity for some form of electric spacecraft propulsion system.
The propulsion concepts that employ these mechanisms generally fall into four categories: solid core, gaseous core, plasma core, and beamed core configurations. The alternatives to direct antimatter annihilation propulsion offer the possibility of feasible vehicles with, in some cases, vastly smaller amounts of antimatter but require a lot more matter propellant.
Then there are hybrid solutions using antimatter to catalyze fission/fusion reactions for propulsion.

===Pure antimatter rocket: direct use of reaction products===

Antiproton annihilation reactions produce charged and uncharged pions, in addition to neutrinos and gamma rays. The charged pions can be channelled by a magnetic nozzle, producing thrust. This type of antimatter rocket is a pion rocket or beamed core configuration. It is not perfectly efficient; energy is lost as the rest mass of the charged (22.3%) and uncharged pions (14.38%), lost as the kinetic energy of the uncharged pions (which can&#x27;t be deflected for thrust); and lost as neutrinos and gamma rays (see antimatter as fuel).

Positron annihilation has also been proposed for rocketry. Annihilation of positrons produces only gamma rays. Early proposals for this type of rocket, such as those developed by Eugen Sänger, assumed the use of some material that could reflect gamma rays, used as a light sail or parabolic shield to derive thrust from the annihilation reaction, but no known form of matter (consisting of atoms or ions) interacts with gamma rays in a manner that would enable specular reflection. The momentum of gamma rays can, however, be partially transferred to matter by Compton scattering.

One method to reach relativistic velocities uses a matter-antimatter GeV gamma ray laser photon rocket made possible by a relativistic proton-antiproton pinch discharge, where the recoil from the laser beam is transmitted by the Mössbauer effect to the spacecraft.

A new annihilation process has purportedly been developed by researchers from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Several annihilation reactors have been constructed in the past years which attempted to convert hydrogen or deuterium into relativistic particles through laser annihilation. The technology was explored by research groups led by Prof. Leif Holmlid and Sindre Zeiner-Gundersen, and a third relativistic particle reactor is currently being built at the University of Iceland. In theory, emitted particles from hydrogen annihilation processes could reach 0.94c and can be used in space propulsion. However the veracity of Holmlid&#x27;s research is under dispute and no successful implementations have been peer reviewed or replicated.

===Thermal antimatter rocket: heating of a propellant===

This type of antimatter rocket is termed a thermal antimatter rocket as the energy or heat from the annihilation is harnessed to create an exhaust from non-exotic material or propellant.

The solid core concept uses antiprotons to heat a solid, high-atomic weight (Z), refractory metal core. Propellant is pumped into the hot core and expanded through a nozzle to generate thrust. The performance of this concept is roughly equivalent to that of the nuclear thermal rocket (formula_1 ~ 103 sec) due to temperature limitations of the solid. However, the antimatter energy conversion and heating efficiencies are typically high due to the short mean path between collisions with core atoms (efficiency formula_2 ~ 85%).
Several methods for the liquid-propellant thermal antimatter engine using the gamma rays produced by antiproton or positron annihilation have been proposed. These methods resemble those proposed for nuclear thermal rockets. One proposed method is to use positron annihilation gamma rays to heat a solid engine core. Hydrogen gas is ducted through this core, heated, and expelled from a rocket nozzle. A second proposed engine type uses positron annihilation within a solid lead pellet or within compressed xenon gas to produce a cloud of hot gas, which heats a surrounding layer of gaseous hydrogen. Direct heating of the hydrogen by gamma rays was considered impractical, due to the difficulty of compressing enough of it within an engine of reasonable size to absorb the gamma rays. A third proposed engine type uses annihilation gamma rays to heat an ablative sail, with the ablated material providing thrust. As with nuclear thermal rockets, the specific impulse achievable by these methods is limited by materials considerations, typically being in the range of 1000–2000 seconds.

The gaseous core system substitutes the low-melting point solid with a high temperature gas (i.e. tungsten gas/plasma), thus permitting higher operational temperatures and performance (formula_1 ~ 2 × 103 sec). However, the longer mean free path for thermalization and absorption results in much lower energy conversion efficiencies (formula_2 ~ 35%).

The plasma core allows the gas to ionize and operate at even higher effective temperatures. Heat loss is suppressed by magnetic confinement in the reaction chamber and nozzle. Although performance is extremely high (formula_1 ~ 104-105 sec), the long mean free path results in very low energy utilization (formula_2 ~ 10%)

===Antimatter power generation===

The idea of using antimatter to power an electric space drive has also been proposed. These proposed designs are typically similar to those suggested for nuclear electric rockets. Antimatter annihilations are used to directly or indirectly heat a working fluid, as in a nuclear thermal rocket, but the fluid is used to generate electricity, which is then used to power some form of electric space propulsion system. The resulting system shares many of the characteristics of other charged particle/electric propulsion proposals, that typically being high specific impulse and low thrust (see also antimatter power generation).

===Catalyzed fission/fusion or spiked fusion===

This is a hybrid approach in which antiprotons are used to catalyze a fission/fusion reaction or to &quot;spike&quot; the propulsion of a fusion rocket or any similar applications.

The antiproton-driven Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) Rocket concept uses pellets for the D-T reaction. The pellet consists of a hemisphere of fissionable material such as U235 with a hole through which a pulse of antiprotons and positrons is injected. It is surrounded by a hemisphere of fusion fuel, for example deuterium-tritium, or lithium deuteride. Antiproton annihilation occurs at the surface of the hemisphere, which ionizes the fuel. These ions heat the core of the pellet to fusion temperatures.

The antiproton-driven Magnetically Insulated Inertial Confinement Fusion Propulsion (MICF) concept relies on self-generated magnetic field which insulates the plasma from the metallic shell that contains it during the burn. The lifetime of the plasma was estimated to be two orders of magnitude greater than implosion inertial fusion, which corresponds to a longer burn time, and hence, greater gain.

The antimatter-driven P-B11 concept uses antiprotons to ignite the P-B11 reactions in an MICF scheme. Excessive radiation losses are a major obstacle to ignition and require modifying the particle density, and plasma temperature to increase the gain. It was concluded that it is entirely feasible that this system could achieve Isp~105s.

A different approach was envisioned for AIMStar in which small fusion fuel droplets would be injected into a cloud of antiprotons confined in a very small volume within a reaction Penning trap. Annihilation takes place on the surface of the antiproton cloud, peeling back 0.5% of the cloud. The power density released is roughly comparable to a 1 kJ, 1 ns laser depositing its energy over a 200 μm ICF target.

The ICAN-II project employs the antiproton catalyzed microfission (ACMF) concept which uses pellets with a molar ratio of 9:1 of D-T:U235 for nuclear pulse propulsion.

==Difficulties with antimatter rockets==
The chief practical difficulties with antimatter rockets are the problems of creating antimatter and storing it. Creating antimatter requires input of vast amounts of energy, at least equivalent to the rest energy of the created particle/antiparticle pairs, and typically (for antiproton production) tens of thousands to millions of times more. Most storage schemes proposed for interstellar craft require the production of frozen pellets of antihydrogen. This requires cooling of antiprotons, binding to positrons, and capture of the resulting antihydrogen atoms - tasks which have, , been performed only for small numbers of individual atoms. Storage of antimatter is typically done by trapping electrically charged frozen antihydrogen pellets in Penning or Paul traps. There is no theoretical barrier to these tasks being performed on the scale required to fuel an antimatter rocket. However, they are expected to be extremely (and perhaps prohibitively) expensive due to current production abilities being only able to produce small numbers of atoms, a scale approximately 1023 times smaller than needed for a 10-gram trip to Mars.

Generally, the energy from antiproton annihilation is deposited over such a large region that it cannot efficiently drive nuclear capsules. Antiproton-induced fission and self-generated magnetic fields may greatly enhance energy localization and efficient use of annihilation energy.

A secondary problem is the extraction of useful energy or momentum from the products of antimatter annihilation, which are primarily in the form of extremely energetic ionizing radiation. The antimatter mechanisms proposed to date have for the most part provided plausible mechanisms for harnessing energy from these annihilation products. The classic rocket equation with its &quot;wet&quot; mass (formula_7)(with propellant mass fraction) to &quot;dry&quot; mass (formula_8)(with payload) fraction (formula_9), the velocity change (formula_10) and specific impulse (formula_1) no longer holds due to the mass losses occurring in antimatter annihilation.

Another general problem with high powered propulsion is excess heat or waste heat, and as with antimatter-matter annihilation also includes extreme radiation. A proton-antiproton annihilation propulsion system transforms 39% of the propellant mass into an intense high-energy flux of gamma radiation. The gamma rays and the high-energy charged pions will cause heating and radiation damage if they are not shielded against. Unlike neutrons, they will not cause the exposed material to become radioactive by transmutation of the nuclei. The components needing shielding are the crew, the electronics, the cryogenic tankage, and the magnetic coils for magnetically assisted rockets. Two types of shielding are needed: radiation protection and thermal protection (different from Heat shield or thermal insulation).

Finally, relativistic considerations have to be taken into account. As the by products of annihilation move at relativistic velocities the rest mass changes according to relativistic mass–energy. For example, the total mass–energy content of the neutral pion is converted into gammas, not just its rest mass. It is necessary to use a relativistic rocket equation that takes into account the relativistic effects of both the vehicle and propellant exhaust (charged pions) moving near the speed of light. These two modifications to the two rocket equations result in a mass ratio (formula_9) for a given (formula_10) and (formula_1) that is much higher for a relativistic antimatter rocket than for either a classical or relativistic &quot;conventional&quot; rocket.

===Modified relativistic rocket equation===
The loss of mass specific to antimatter annihilation requires a modification of the relativistic rocket equation given as

{1- \frac{\Delta v}{c}}\right)^{\frac{c}{2 I_{\text{sp}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_15 is the speed of light, and formula_1 is the specific impulse (i.e. formula_1=0.69formula_15).

The derivative form of the equation is

}{M_{\text{ship}}}=
\frac {-dv ( 1 - I_{\text{sp}} \frac {v}{c^2})}
{(1 - \frac {v^2}{c^2})(-\frac {I_{\text{sp}} v^2}{c^2} + (1 - a) v + a I_{\text{sp}})}
&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_19 is the non-relativistic (rest) mass of the rocket ship, and formula_20 is the fraction of the original (on board) propellant mass (non-relativistic) remaining after annihilation (i.e., formula_20=0.22 for the charged pions).

 is difficult to integrate analytically. If it is assumed that formula_22, such that formula_23 then the resulting equation is

}{M_{\text{ship}}}=
\frac {-dv}{(-\frac {I_{\text{sp}} v^2}{c^2} + (1 - a) v + a I_{\text{sp}})}
&lt;/math&gt;|}}

 can be integrated and the integral evaluated for formula_7 and formula_8, and initial and final velocities (formula_26 and formula_27).
The resulting relativistic rocket equation with loss of propellant is

\Delta v/c^2+1-a-\sqrt{(1-a)^2+4aI_{\text{sp}}^2/c^2})(1-a+\sqrt{(1-a)^2+4aI_{\text{sp}}^2/c^2})}{(-2I_{\text{sp}}\Delta v/c^2+1-a+\sqrt{(1-a)^2+4aI_{\text{sp}}^2/c^2})(1-a-\sqrt{(1-a)^2+4aI_{\text{sp}}^2/c^2})}\right)^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-a)^2+4aI_{\text{sp}}^2/c^2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;|}}

===Other general issues===

The cosmic background hard radiation will ionize the rocket&#x27;s hull over time and poses a health threat. Also, gas plasma interactions may cause space charge. The major interaction of concern is differential charging of various parts of a spacecraft, leading to high electric fields and arcing between spacecraft components. This can be resolved with well placed plasma contactor. However, there is no solution yet for when plasma contactors are turned off to allow maintenance work on the hull. Long term space flight at interstellar velocities causes erosion of the rocket&#x27;s hull due to collision with particles, gas, dust and micrometeorites. At 0.2formula_15 for a 6 light year distance, erosion is estimated to be in the order of about 30 kg/m2 or about 1 cm of aluminum shielding.

<doc id="37856" wikidata="Q169890" url="?curid=37856" title="Alcubierre drive">
<text>The Alcubierre drive () is a speculative warp drive idea according to which a spacecraft could achieve apparent faster-than-light travel by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it, under the assumption that a configurable energy-density field lower than that of vacuum (that is, negative mass) could be created. Proposed by theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994, the Alcubierre drive is based on a solution of Einstein&#x27;s field equations. Since those solutions are metric tensors, the Alcubierre drive is also referred to as Alcubierre metric.

Objects cannot accelerate to the speed of light within normal spacetime; instead, the Alcubierre drive shifts space around an object so that the object would arrive at its destination more quickly than light would in normal space without breaking any physical laws.

Although the metric proposed by Alcubierre is consistent with the Einstein field equations, construction of such a drive is not necessarily possible. The proposed mechanism of the Alcubierre drive implies a negative energy density and therefore requires exotic matter or manipulation of dark energy. If exotic matter with the correct properties does not exist, then the drive cannot be constructed. At the close of his original article, however, Alcubierre argued (following an argument developed by physicists analyzing traversable wormholes) that the Casimir vacuum between parallel plates could fulfill the negative-energy requirement for the Alcubierre drive.

Another possible issue is that, although the Alcubierre metric is consistent with Einstein&#x27;s equations, general relativity does not incorporate quantum mechanics. Some physicists have presented arguments to suggest that a theory of quantum gravity (which would incorporate both theories) would eliminate those solutions in general relativity that allow for backward time travel (see the chronology protection conjecture) and thus make the Alcubierre drive invalid.

==History==
In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed a method for changing the geometry of space by creating a wave that would cause the fabric of space ahead of a spacecraft to contract and the space behind it to expand. The ship would then ride this wave inside a region of flat space, known as a &quot;warp bubble&quot;, and would not move within this bubble but instead be carried along as the region itself moves due to the actions of the drive. The local velocity relative to the deformed spacetime would be subluminal, but the speed at which a spacecraft could move would be superluminal, thereby rendering possible interstellar flight, such as a visit to &quot;Proxima Centauri&quot; within a few days.

==Alcubierre metric==
The Alcubierre metric defines the warp-drive spacetime. It is a Lorentzian manifold that, if interpreted in the context of general relativity, allows a warp bubble to appear in previously flat spacetime and move away at effectively faster-than-light speed. The interior of the bubble is an inertial reference frame and inhabitants experience no proper acceleration. This method of transport does not involve objects in motion at faster-than-light speeds with respect to the contents of the warp bubble; that is, a light beam within the warp bubble would still always move more quickly than the ship. Because objects within the bubble are not moving (locally) more quickly than light, the mathematical formulation of the Alcubierre metric is consistent with the conventional claims of the laws of relativity (namely, that an object with mass cannot attain or exceed the speed of light) and conventional relativistic effects such as time dilation would not apply as they would with conventional motion at near-light speeds.

An extension of the Alcubierre metric that eliminates the expansion of the volume elements and instead relies on the change in distances along the direction of travel is that of mathematician José Natário. In his metric, spacetime contracts towards the prow of the ship and expands in the direction perpendicular to the motion, meaning that the bubble actually &quot;slides&quot; through space, roughly speaking by &quot;pushing space aside&quot;.

The Alcubierre drive remains a hypothetical concept with seemingly difficult problems, although the amount of energy required is no longer thought to be unobtainably large. However, Alexey Bobrick and Gianni Martire claim that, in principle, a class of subluminal, spherically symmetric warp drive spacetimes can be constructed based on physical principles presently known to humanity, such as positive energy. Furthermore, a study by Remo Garattini and Kirill Zatrimaylov shows that the amount of negative energy density required to sustain a warp bubble can in principle be reduced if the bubble is moving in an external gravitational field, such as that of a black hole.

==Mathematics==
Using the ADM formalism of general relativity, the spacetime is described by a foliation of space-like hypersurfaces of constant coordinate time , with the metric taking the following general form:

:formula_1

where
* is the lapse function that gives the interval of proper time between nearby hypersurfaces,
* is the shift vector that relates the spatial coordinate systems on different hypersurfaces,
* is a positive-definite metric on each of the hypersurfaces.

The particular form that Alcubierre studied is defined by:

:formula_2

where

:formula_3

with arbitrary parameters and . Alcubierre&#x27;s specific form of the metric can thus be written:

:formula_4

With this particular form of the metric, it can be shown that the energy density measured by observers whose 4-velocity is normal to the hypersurfaces is given by:

:formula_5

where is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Thus, because the energy density is negative, one needs exotic matter to travel more quickly than the speed of light. The existence of exotic matter is not theoretically ruled out; however, generating and sustaining enough exotic matter to perform feats such as faster-than-light travel (and to keep open the &quot;throat&quot; of a wormhole) is thought to be impractical. According to writer Robert Low, within the context of general relativity it is impossible to construct a warp drive in the absence of exotic matter.

== Connection to dark energy and dark matter ==
Astrophysicist Jamie Farnes from the University of Oxford has proposed a theory, published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal &quot;Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics&quot;, that unifies dark energy and dark matter into a single dark fluid, and which is expected to be testable by the Square Kilometre Array around 2030. Farnes found that Albert Einstein had explored the idea of gravitationally repulsive negative masses while developing the equations of general relativity, an idea which leads to a &quot;beautiful&quot; hypothesis where the cosmos has equal amounts of positive and negative qualities. Farnes&#x27; theory relies on negative masses that behave identically to the physics of the Alcubierre drive, providing a natural solution for the current &quot;crisis in cosmology&quot; due to a time-variable Hubble parameter.

As Farnes&#x27; theory allows a positive mass (i.e. a ship) to reach a speed equal to the speed of light, it has been dubbed &quot;controversial&quot;. If the theory is correct, which has been highly debated in the scientific literature, it would explain dark energy, dark matter, allow closed timelike curves (see time travel), and suggest that an Alcubierre drive is physically possible with exotic matter.

==Physics==
With regard to certain specific effects of special relativity, such as Lorentz contraction and time dilation, the Alcubierre metric has some apparently peculiar aspects. In particular, Alcubierre has shown that a ship using an Alcubierre drive travels on a free-fall geodesic even while the warp bubble is accelerating: its crew would be in free fall while accelerating without experiencing accelerational g-forces. Enormous tidal forces, however, would be present near the edges of the flat-space volume because of the large space curvature there, but a suitable specification of the metric would keep the tidal forces very small within the volume occupied by the ship.

The original warp-drive metric and simple variants of it happen to have the ADM form, which is often used in discussing the initial-value formulation of general relativity. This might explain the widespread misconception that this spacetime is a &quot;solution&quot; of the field equation of general relativity. Metrics in ADM form are &quot;adapted&quot; to a certain family of inertial observers, but these observers are not really physically distinguished from other such families. Alcubierre interpreted his &quot;warp bubble&quot; in terms of a contraction of space ahead of the bubble and an expansion behind, but this interpretation could be misleading, since the contraction and expansion actually refer to the relative motion of nearby members of the family of ADM observers.

In general relativity, one often first specifies a plausible distribution of matter and energy, and then finds the geometry of the spacetime associated with it; but it is also possible to run the Einstein field equations in the other direction, first specifying a metric and then finding the energy–momentum tensor associated with it, and this is what Alcubierre did in building his metric. This practice means that the solution can violate various energy conditions and require exotic matter. The need for exotic matter raises questions about whether one can distribute the matter in an initial spacetime that lacks a warp bubble in such a way that the bubble is created at a later time, although some physicists have proposed models of dynamical warp-drive spacetimes in which a warp bubble is formed in a previously flat space. Moreover, according to Serguei Krasnikov, generating a bubble in a previously flat space for a &quot;one-way&quot; faster-than-light trip requires forcing the exotic matter to move at local faster-than-light speeds, something that would require the existence of tachyons, although Krasnikov also notes that when the spacetime is not flat from the outset, a similar result could be achieved without tachyons by placing in advance some devices along the travel path and programming them to come into operation at preassigned moments and to operate in a preassigned manner. Some suggested methods avoid the problem of tachyonic motion, but would probably generate a naked singularity at the front of the bubble. Allen Everett and Thomas Roman comment on Krasnikov&#x27;s finding (Krasnikov tube):

[The finding] does not mean that Alcubierre bubbles, if it were possible to create them, could not be used as a means of superluminal travel. It only means that the actions required to change the metric and create the bubble must be taken beforehand by some observer whose forward light cone contains the entire trajectory of the bubble.

For example, if one wanted to travel to Deneb (2,600 light-years away) and arrive less than 2,600 years in the future according to external clocks, it would be required that someone had already begun work on warping the space from Earth to Deneb at least 2,600 years ago:

A spaceship appropriately located with respect to the bubble trajectory could then choose to enter the bubble, rather like a passenger catching a passing trolley car, and thus make the superluminal journey ... as Krasnikov points out, causality considerations do not prevent the crew of a spaceship from arranging, by their own actions, to complete a &quot;round trip&quot; from Earth to a distant star and back in an arbitrarily short time, as measured by clocks on Earth, by altering the metric along the path of their outbound trip.

==Difficulties==
===Mass–energy requirement===
The metric of this form has significant difficulties because all known warp-drive spacetime theories violate various energy conditions. Nevertheless, an Alcubierre-type warp drive might be realized by exploiting certain experimentally verified quantum phenomena, such as the Casimir effect, that lead to stress–energy tensors that also violate the energy conditions, such as negative mass–energy, when described in the context of the quantum field theories.

If certain quantum inequalities conjectured by Ford and Roman hold, the energy requirements for some warp drives may be unfeasibly large as well as negative. For example, the energy equivalent of −1064 kg might be required to transport a small spaceship across the Milky Way—an amount orders of magnitude greater than the estimated mass of the observable universe. Counterarguments to these apparent problems have also been offered, although the energy requirements still generally require a Type III civilization on the Kardashev scale.

Chris Van Den Broeck of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, in 1999, tried to address the potential issues. By contracting the 3+1-dimensional surface area of the bubble being transported by the drive, while at the same time expanding the three-dimensional volume contained inside, Van Den Broeck was able to reduce the total energy needed to transport small atoms to less than three solar masses. Later in 2003, by slightly modifying the Van den Broeck metric, Serguei Krasnikov reduced the necessary total amount of negative mass to a few milligrams. Van Den Broeck detailed this by saying that the total energy can be reduced dramatically by keeping the surface area of the warp bubble itself microscopically small, while at the same time expanding the spatial volume inside the bubble. However, Van Den Broeck concludes that the energy densities required are still unachievable, as are the small size (a few orders of magnitude above the Planck scale) of the spacetime structures needed.

In 2012, physicist Harold White and collaborators announced that modifying the geometry of exotic matter could reduce the mass–energy requirements for a macroscopic space ship from the equivalent of the planet Jupiter to that of the Voyager 1 spacecraft (c. 700 kg) or less, and stated their intent to perform small-scale experiments in constructing warp fields. White proposed to thicken the extremely thin wall of the warp bubble, so the energy is focused in a larger volume, but the overall peak energy density is actually smaller. In a flat 2D representation, the ring of positive and negative energy, initially very thin, becomes a larger, fuzzy torus (donut shape). However, as this less energetic warp bubble also thickens toward the interior region, it leaves less flat space to house the spacecraft, which has to be smaller. Furthermore, if the intensity of the space warp can be oscillated over time, the energy required is reduced even more. According to White, a modified Michelson–Morley interferometer could test the idea: one of the legs of the interferometer would appear to have a slightly different length when the test devices were energised. Alcubierre has expressed skepticism about the experiment, saying: &quot;from my understanding there is no way it can be done, probably not for centuries if at all&quot;.

In 2021, physicist Erik Lentz described a way warp drives sourced from known and familiar purely positive energy could exist—warp bubbles based on superluminal self-reinforcing &quot;soliton&quot; waves. The claim is controversial, with other physicists arguing that all physically reasonable warp drives violate the weak energy condition, as well as both the strong and dominant energy conditions.

===Placement of matter===
Krasnikov proposed that if tachyonic matter cannot be found or used, then a solution might be to arrange for masses along the path of the vessel to be set in motion in such a way that the required field was produced. But in this case, the Alcubierre drive vessel can only travel routes that, like a railroad, have first been equipped with the necessary infrastructure. The pilot inside the bubble is causally disconnected from its walls and cannot carry out any action outside the bubble: the bubble cannot be used for the first trip to a distant star because the pilot cannot place infrastructure ahead of the bubble while &quot;in transit&quot;. For example, traveling to Vega (which is 25 light-years from Earth) requires arranging everything so that the bubble moving toward Vega with a superluminal velocity would appear; such arrangements will always take more than 25 years.

Coule has argued that schemes, such as the one proposed by Alcubierre, are infeasible because matter placed &quot;en route&quot; of the intended path of a craft must be placed at superluminal speed—that constructing an Alcubierre drive requires an Alcubierre drive even if the metric that allows it is physically meaningful. Coule further argues that an analogous objection will apply to &quot;any&quot; proposed method of constructing an Alcubierre drive.

===Survivability inside the bubble===
An article by José Natário (2002) argues that crew members could not control, steer or stop the ship in its warp bubble because the ship could not send signals to the front of the bubble.

A 2009 article by Carlos Barceló, Stefano Finazzi, and Stefano Liberati uses quantum theory to argue that the Alcubierre drive at faster-than-light velocities is impossible mostly because extremely high temperatures caused by Hawking radiation would destroy anything inside the bubble at superluminal velocities and destabilize the bubble itself; the article also argues that these problems are absent if the bubble velocity is subluminal, although the drive still requires exotic matter.

===Damaging effect on destination===
Brendan McMonigal, Geraint F. Lewis, and Philip O&#x27;Byrne have argued that were an Alcubierre-driven ship to decelerate from superluminal speed, the particles that its bubble had gathered in transit would be released in energetic outbursts akin to the infinitely-blueshifted radiation hypothesized to occur at the inner event horizon of a Kerr black hole; forward-facing particles would thereby be energetic enough to destroy anything at the destination directly in front of the ship.

===Wall thickness===
The amount of negative energy required for such a propulsion is not yet known. Pfenning and Allen Everett of Tufts hold that a warp bubble traveling at 10-times the speed of light must have a wall thickness of no more than 10−32 meters—close to the limiting Planck length, 1.6 × 10−35 meters. In Alcubierre&#x27;s original calculations, a bubble macroscopically large enough to enclose a ship of 200 meters would require a total amount of exotic matter greater than the mass of the observable universe, and straining the exotic matter to an extremely thin band of 10−32 meters is considered impractical. Similar constraints apply to Krasnikov&#x27;s superluminal subway. Chris Van den Broeck constructed a modification of Alcubierre&#x27;s model that requires much less exotic matter but places the ship in a curved spacetime &quot;bottle&quot; whose neck is about 10−32 meters.

===Causality violation and semiclassical instability===
Calculations by physicist Allen Everett show that warp bubbles could be used to create closed timelike curves in general relativity, meaning that the theory predicts that they could be used for backwards time travel. While it is possible that the fundamental laws of physics might allow closed timelike curves, the chronology protection conjecture hypothesizes that in all cases where the classical theory of general relativity allows them, quantum effects would intervene to eliminate the possibility, making these spacetimes impossible to realize. A possible type of effect that would accomplish this is a buildup of vacuum fluctuations on the border of the region of spacetime where time travel would first become possible, causing the energy density to become high enough to destroy the system that would otherwise become a time machine. Some results in semiclassical gravity appear to support the conjecture, including a calculation dealing specifically with quantum effects in warp-drive spacetimes that suggested that warp bubbles would be semiclassically unstable, but ultimately the conjecture can only be decided by a full theory of quantum gravity.

Alcubierre briefly discusses some of these issues in a series of lecture slides posted online, where he writes: &quot;beware: in relativity, any method to travel faster than light can in principle be used to travel back in time (a time machine)&quot;. In the next slide, he brings up the chronology protection conjecture and writes: &quot;The conjecture has not been proven (it wouldn&#x27;t be a conjecture if it had), but there are good arguments in its favor based on quantum field theory. The conjecture does not prohibit faster-than-light travel. It just states that if a method to travel faster than light exists, and one tries to use it to build a time machine, something will go wrong: the energy accumulated will explode, or it will create a black hole.&quot;

==Relation to &quot;Star Trek&quot; warp drive==
The &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series and films use the term &quot;warp drive&quot; to describe their method of faster-than-light travel. Neither the Alcubierre theory, nor anything similar, existed when the series was conceived—the term &quot;warp drive&quot; and general concept originated with John W. Campbell&#x27;s 1931 science fiction novel &quot;Islands of Space&quot;. Alcubierre stated in an email to William Shatner that his theory was directly inspired by the term used in the show and cites the &quot;&#x27;warp drive&#x27; of science fiction&quot; in his 1994 article. A USS &quot;Alcubierre&quot; appears in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; tabletop RPG &quot;Star Trek Adventures&quot;. Since the release of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, more recent &quot;Star Trek&quot; spin-off series have made closer use of the theory behind the Alcubierre Drive incorporating warp bubbles/fields into the in-universe science.
