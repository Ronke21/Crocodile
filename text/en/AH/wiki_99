<text>The &quot;Viking&quot; program consisted of a pair of identical American space probes, &quot;Viking 1&quot; and &quot;Viking 2&quot;, which landed on Mars in 1976. The mission effort began in 1968 and was managed by the NASA Langley Research Center. Each spacecraft was composed of two main parts: an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of Mars from orbit, and a lander designed to study the planet from the surface. The orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once they touched down.

The Viking program grew from NASA&#x27;s earlier, even more ambitious, Voyager Mars program, which was not related to the successful Voyager deep space probes of the late 1970s. &quot;Viking 1&quot; was launched on August 20, 1975, and the second craft, &quot;Viking 2&quot;, was launched on September 9, 1975, both riding atop Titan IIIE rockets with Centaur upper stages. &quot;Viking 1&quot; entered Mars orbit on June 19, 1976, with &quot;Viking 2&quot; following on August 7.

After orbiting Mars for more than a month and returning images used for landing site selection, the orbiters and landers detached; the landers then entered the Martian atmosphere and soft-landed at the sites that had been chosen. The &quot;Viking 1&quot; lander touched down on the surface of Mars on July 20, 1976, more than two weeks before &quot;Viking 2&quot;″s arrival in orbit. &quot;Viking 2&quot; then successfully soft-landed on September 3. The orbiters continued imaging and performing other scientific operations from orbit while the landers deployed instruments on the surface.

The project cost was roughly US$1 billion at the time of launch, equivalent to about $ billion in dollars. The mission was considered successful and is credited with helping to form most of the body of knowledge about Mars through the late 1990s and early 2000s.

==Science objectives==
*Obtain high-resolution images of the Martian surface
*Characterize the structure and composition of the atmosphere and surface
*Search for evidence of life on Mars

==Viking orbiters==
The primary objectives of the two Viking orbiters were to transport the landers to Mars, perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites, act as communications relays for the landers, and to perform their own scientific investigations. Each orbiter, based on the earlier Mariner 9 spacecraft, was an octagon approximately across. The fully fueled orbiter-lander pair had a mass of . After separation and landing, the lander had a mass of about and the orbiter . The total launch mass was , of which were propellant and attitude control gas. The eight faces of the ring-like structure were high and were alternately wide. The overall height was from the lander attachment points on the bottom to the launch vehicle attachment points on top. There were 16 modular compartments, 3 on each of the 4 long faces and one on each short face. Four solar panel wings extended from the axis of the orbiter, the distance from tip to tip of two oppositely extended solar panels was .

===Propulsion===
The main propulsion unit was mounted above the orbiter bus. Propulsion was furnished by a bipropellant (monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide) liquid-fueled rocket engine which could be gimballed up to 9 degrees. The engine was capable of thrust, providing a change in velocity of . Attitude control was achieved by 12 small compressed-nitrogen jets.

===Navigation and communication===
An acquisition Sun sensor, a cruise Sun sensor, a Canopus star tracker and an inertial reference unit consisting of six gyroscopes allowed three-axis stabilization. Two accelerometers were also on board.

Communications were accomplished through a S-band (2.3 GHz) transmitter and two TWTAs. An X band downlink was also added specifically for radio science and to conduct communications experiments. Uplink was via S band A two-axis steerable parabolic dish antenna with a diameter of approximately 1.5 m was attached at one edge of the orbiter base, and a fixed low-gain antenna extended from the top of the bus. Two tape recorders were each capable of storing 1280 megabits. A 381-MHz relay radio was also available.

===Power===
The power to the two orbiter craft was provided by eight solar panels, two on each wing. The solar panels comprised a total of 34,800 solar cells and produced 620 W of power at Mars. Power was also stored in two nickel-cadmium 30-A·h batteries.

The combined area of the four panels was , and they provided both regulated and unregulated direct current power; unregulated power was provided to the radio transmitter and the lander.

Two 30-amp·hour, nickel-cadmium, rechargeable batteries provided power when the spacecraft was not facing the Sun, during launch, while performing correction maneuvers and also during Mars occultation.

===Main findings===

By discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water, the images from the orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars. Huge river valleys were found in many areas. They showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and travelled thousands of kilometers. Large areas in the southern hemisphere contained branched stream networks, suggesting that rain once fell. The flanks of some volcanoes are believed to have been exposed to rainfall because they resemble those caused on Hawaiian volcanoes. Many craters look as if the impactor fell into mud. When they were formed, ice in the soil may have melted, turned the ground into mud, then flowed across the surface. Normally, material from an impact goes up, then down. It does not flow across the surface, going around obstacles, as it does on some Martian craters. Regions, called &quot;Chaotic Terrain,&quot; seemed to have quickly lost great volumes of water, causing large channels to be formed. The amount of water involved was estimated to ten thousand times the flow of the Mississippi River. Underground volcanism may have melted frozen ice; the water then flowed away and the ground collapsed to leave chaotic terrain.


==Viking landers==
Each lander comprised a six-sided aluminium base with alternate long sides, supported on three extended legs attached to the shorter sides. The leg footpads formed the vertices of an equilateral triangle with sides when viewed from above, with the long sides of the base forming a straight line with the two adjoining footpads. Instrumentation was attached inside and on top of the base, elevated above the surface by the extended legs.

Each lander was enclosed in an aeroshell heat shield designed to slow the lander down during the entry phase. To prevent contamination of Mars by Earth organisms, each lander, upon assembly and enclosure within the aeroshell, was enclosed in a pressurized &quot;bioshield&quot; and then sterilized at a temperature of for 40 hours. For thermal reasons, the cap of the bioshield was jettisoned after the Centaur upper stage powered the Viking orbiter/lander combination out of Earth orbit.

Astronomer Carl Sagan helped to choose landing sites for both &quot;Viking&quot; probes.

===Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL)===
Each lander arrived at Mars attached to the orbiter. The assembly orbited Mars many times before the lander was released and separated from the orbiter for descent to the surface. Descent comprised four distinct phases, starting with a deorbit burn. The lander then experienced atmospheric entry with peak heating occurring a few seconds after the start of frictional heating with the Martian atmosphere. At an altitude of about and traveling at a velocity of 900 kilometers per hour (600 mph), the parachute deployed, the aeroshell released and the lander&#x27;s legs unfolded. At an altitude of about 1.5 kilometers (5,000 feet), the lander activated its three retro-engines and was released from the parachute. The lander then immediately used retrorockets to slow and control its descent, with a soft landing on the surface of Mars.
 At landing (after using rocket propellant) the landers had a mass of about 600 kg.

===Propulsion===

Propulsion for deorbit was provided by the monopropellant hydrazine (N2H4), through a rocket with 12 nozzles arranged in four clusters of three that provided thrust, translating to a change in velocity of . These nozzles also acted as the control thrusters for translation and rotation of the lander.

Terminal descent (after use of a parachute) and landing used three (one affixed on each long side of the base, separated by 120 degrees) monopropellant hydrazine engines. The engines had 18 nozzles to disperse the exhaust and minimize effects on the ground, and were throttleable from . The hydrazine was purified in order to prevent contamination of the Martian surface with Earth microbes. The lander carried of propellant at launch, contained in two spherical titanium tanks mounted on opposite sides of the lander beneath the RTG windscreens, giving a total launch mass of . Control was achieved through the use of an inertial reference unit, four gyros, a radar altimeter, a terminal descent and landing radar, and the control thrusters.

===Power===
Power was provided by two radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) units containing plutonium-238 affixed to opposite sides of the lander base and covered by wind screens. Each Viking RTG was tall, in diameter, had a mass of and provided 30 watts of continuous power at 4.4 volts. Four wet cell sealed nickel-cadmium 8 Ah (28,800 coulombs), 28 volt rechargeable batteries were also on board to handle peak power loads.

===Payload===
==== Communications ====
Communications were accomplished through a 20-watt S-band transmitter using two traveling-wave tubes. A two-axis steerable high-gain parabolic antenna was mounted on a boom near one edge of the lander base. An omnidirectional low-gain S-band antenna also extended from the base. Both these antennae allowed for communication directly with the Earth, permitting Viking 1 to continue to work long after both orbiters had failed. A UHF antenna provided a one-way relay to the orbiter using a 30 watt relay radio. Data storage was on a 40-Mbit tape recorder, and the lander computer had a 6000-word memory for command instructions.

==== Instruments ====
The lander carried instruments to achieve the primary scientific objectives of the lander mission: to study the biology, chemical composition (organic and inorganic), meteorology, seismology, magnetic properties, appearance, and physical properties of the Martian surface and atmosphere. Two 360-degree cylindrical scan cameras were mounted near one long side of the base. From the center of this side extended the sampler arm, with a collector head, temperature sensor, and magnet on the end. A meteorology boom, holding temperature, wind direction, and wind velocity sensors extended out and up from the top of one of the lander legs. A seismometer, magnet and camera test targets, and magnifying mirror are mounted opposite the cameras, near the high-gain antenna. An interior environmentally controlled compartment held the biology experiment and the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. The X-ray fluorescence spectrometer was also mounted within the structure. A pressure sensor was attached under the lander body. The scientific payload had a total mass of approximately .

===Biological experiments===

The Viking landers conducted biological experiments designed to detect life in the Martian soil (if it existed) with experiments designed by three separate teams, under the direction of chief scientist Gerald Soffen of NASA. One experiment turned positive for the detection of metabolism (current life), but based on the results of the other two experiments that failed to reveal any organic molecules in the soil, most scientists became convinced that the positive results were likely caused by non-biological chemical reactions from highly oxidizing soil conditions.

Although there was a pronouncement by NASA during the mission saying that the Viking lander results did not demonstrate conclusive biosignatures in soils at the two landing sites, the test results and their limitations are still under assessment. The validity of the positive &#x27;Labeled Release&#x27; (LR) results hinged entirely on the absence of an oxidative agent in the Martian soil, but one was later discovered by the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander in the form of perchlorate salts. It has been proposed that organic compounds could have been present in the soil analyzed by both &quot;Viking 1&quot; and &quot;Viking 2&quot;, but remained unnoticed due to the presence of perchlorate, as detected by Phoenix in 2008. Researchers found that perchlorate will destroy organics when heated and will produce chloromethane and dichloromethane, the identical chlorine compounds discovered by both Viking landers when they performed the same tests on Mars.

The question of microbial life on Mars remains unresolved. Nonetheless, on April 12, 2012, an international team of scientists reported studies, based on mathematical speculation through complexity analysis of the Labeled Release experiments of the 1976 Viking Mission, that may suggest the detection of &quot;extant microbial life on Mars.&quot; In addition, new findings from re-examination of the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) results were published in 2018.

===Camera/imaging system===

The leader of the imaging team was Thomas A. Mutch, a geologist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. The camera uses a movable mirror to illuminate 12 photodiodes. Each of the 12 silicon diodes are designed to be sensitive to different frequencies of light.

Several broad band diodes (designated BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4) are placed to focus accurately at distances between six and 43 feet away from the lander. A low resolution broad band diode was named SURVEY.  There are also three narrow band low resolution diodes (named BLUE, GREEN and RED) for obtaining color images, and another three (IR1, IR2, and IR3) for infrared imagery.

The cameras scanned at a rate of five vertical scan lines per second, each composed of 512 pixels. The 300 degree panorama images were composed of 9150 lines. The cameras&#x27; scan was slow enough that in a crew shot taken during development of the imaging system several members show up several times in the shot as they moved themselves as the camera scanned.

=== Mass Breakdown of Viking Landers === 


==Control systems==
The Viking landers used a Guidance, Control and Sequencing Computer (GCSC) consisting of two Honeywell HDC 402 24-bit computers with 18K of plated-wire memory, while the Viking orbiters used a Command Computer Subsystem (CCS) using two custom-designed 18-bit serial processors.

==Financial cost of the Viking program==
The two orbiters cost US$217 million at the time, which is about $ billion in dollars. The most expensive single part of the program was the lander&#x27;s life-detection unit, which cost about $60 million then or $ million in dollars. Development of the Viking lander design cost $357 million. This was decades before NASA&#x27;s &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot; approach, and Viking needed to pioneer unprecedented technologies under national pressure brought on by the Cold War and the aftermath of the Space Race, all under the prospect of possibly discovering extraterrestrial life for the first time. The experiments had to adhere to a special 1971 directive that mandated that no single failure shall stop the return of more than one experimenta difficult and expensive task for a device with over 40,000 parts.

The Viking camera system cost $27.3 million to develop, or about $ million in dollars. When the Imaging system design was completed, it was difficult to find anyone who could manufacture its advanced design. The program managers were later praised for fending off pressure to go with a simpler, less advanced imaging system, especially when the views rolled in. The program did however save some money by cutting out a third lander and reducing the number of experiments on the lander.

Overall NASA says that $1 billion in 1970s dollars was spent on the program, which when inflation-adjusted to dollars is about $ billion.

==Mission end==
The craft all eventually failed, one by one, as follows:

The Viking program ended on May 21, 1983. To prevent an imminent impact with Mars the orbit of &quot;Viking 1&quot; orbiter was raised on August 7, 1980, before it was shut down 10 days later. Impact and potential contamination on the planet&#x27;s surface is possible from 2019 onwards.

The &quot;Viking 1&quot; lander was found to be about 6 kilometers from its planned landing site by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in December 2006.

== Message artifact ==
Each &quot;Viking&quot; lander carried a tiny dot of microfilm containing the names of several thousand people who had worked on the mission. Several earlier space probes had carried message artifacts, such as the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record. Later probes also carried memorials or lists of names, such as the &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover which recognizes the almost 11 million people who signed up to include their names on the mission.

<doc id="38088" wikidata="Q541727" url="?curid=38088" title="Powaqqatsi">
<text>Powaqqatsi is a 1988 American non-narrative film directed by Godfrey Reggio and the sequel to Reggio&#x27;s experimental 1982 film, &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;. It is the second film in &quot;Qatsi&quot; trilogy, which was followed by &quot;Naqoyqatsi&quot; (2002).

The film&#x27;s title is a Hopi neologism coined by Reggio meaning &quot;parasitic way of life&quot; or &quot;life in transition&quot;. While &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; focused on modern life in industrial countries, &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot;, which similarly has no dialogue, focuses more on the conflict in Third World countries between traditional ways of life and the new ways of life introduced with industrialization. As with &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; and the third and final part of the &quot;Qatsi&quot; trilogy, &quot;Naqoyqatsi&quot;, the film is strongly related to its soundtrack, written by Philip Glass.

==Synopsis==
In the beginning chapter, &quot;Serra Pelada&quot;, men from Serra Pelada (a gold mine in Brazil) are seen carrying bags of dirt up to a destination. In the middle of the chapter, various shots outside of Serra Pelada are shown. Near the end of the chapter, a few men are carrying another man who was struck by a falling rock (mentioned in the &quot;Impact of Progress&quot; feature on the DVD/Blu-ray) uphill along a procession of workers who are carrying dirt-filled sacks. After that, several discordant layered exposures of the dirt carriers are shown. The scene cross fades to show the image of a head, with multiple exposures of the same head rapidly rotating and layered upon to give a manifold appearance. This is an apparent allusion to Janus, the god of beginnings, endings and transitions, keeping with the film&#x27;s central themes of progress and change.

In &quot;Anthem: Part 1&quot;, the sun rises up above an African village. Later, a man raises a sail for a boat. The next chapter, &quot;That Place&quot;, starts zooming out from a waterfall. Children can be heard laughing. Villages are shown as well as children and upside down water reflections. &quot;Anthem: Part 2&quot; has various shots of villages and islands shown.

&quot;Mosque and Temple&quot; shows various natural shots as well as religious scenes. Some of these scenes are a transparent inside a church with someone walking by, a man praying, a monk sitting while a bird flies off his stick, the same monk walking by the river, a bird flying by a sunset, more children, crows flying above a river, two men rowing their boat in that river, a woman praying in the Ganges river, two men practicing yoga, another monk, and a temple in Nepal.

&quot;Anthem: Part 3&quot; shows masses of people in motion, working together and celebrating traditional rituals, in Africa and South America, all in slow-motion.

&quot;Video Dream&quot; blends together colorful television advertisements and news programs from the US, Western Europe, the Soviet Union and Japan.

&quot;New Cities In Ancient Lands&quot; has views of people on the move, and traffic in three parts: China, Africa and India.

&quot;The Unutterable/Caught!&quot; People in large groups in the developing world, moving together, at work; views of traffic from above.

&quot;Mr. Suso / From Egypt&quot; Sometimes-unfocused people in motion, to the muezzin&#x27;s call, ghostly double-images of traffic, close-ups of faces, reflections in water.

== Music ==
A soundtrack was produced in 1988 that was composed by Philip Glass.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes reported that 56% out of 9 reviews were positive with the average score of 6.5 out of 10 and said it &quot;wasn&#x27;t as eagerly embraced by viewers and critics as its popular predecessor.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;There are two kinds of dirt to be found in &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot;: good dirt and bad. ... [the director] magnifies this distinction until it achieves mountainous proportions, yet still he manages to see it in starkly one-dimensional terms.&quot; Roger Ebert said &quot;There are images of astonishing beauty in Godfrey Reggio&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Powaqqatsi&quot;,&quot; sequences when we marvel at the sights of the Earth, and yet when the film is over there is the feeling that we are still waiting for it to begin. ... Reggio seemed to think that man himself is some kind of virus infecting the planet - that we would enjoy Earth more, in other words, if we weren&#x27;t here.&quot; On &quot;Siskel and Ebert at the Movies&quot; with he and Gene Siskel each agreed to give the film a thumbs down, he also called it a &quot;New Age music video&quot;.

&quot;Time Out&quot; said that it is &quot;visually stunning, but undermined by a fairly serious flaw. ... At best the message is a fairly obvious criticism of First World domination of the Third, and at worst a hippy celebration of the Dignity of Labour.&quot; Greg Klymkiw said &quot;... the trilogy, [of which &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot; is the second part] while a stoner experience of the first order, can be equally appreciated by those who remain straight. Much of it is mind-blowingly mind-fucking without mind-altering substances.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==
* The music from &quot;Anthem: Part 2&quot; was used in and is now best associated with the 1998 film &quot;The Truman Show&quot;. it was also used in several film trailers, including that of &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;.
* The Criterion Collection released it as part of the Qatsi trilogy set.
* Footage from the film — the same that was used for its poster — was used in the 1990 television special &quot;The Earth Day Special&quot; during a sequence in which Dr. Emmett Brown from the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; shows Doogie Howser, M.D. what the Earth&#x27;s future looks like unless something is done about pollution.

<text>A gender changer is a hardware device placed between two cable connectors of the same type and gender.
An example is a cable connector shell with either two female or two male connectors on it (male-to-male or female-to-female), used to correct the mismatches that result when interconnecting two devices or cables with the same gender of connector.

Gender changers are used for RS-232C ports in either the original DB-25 or the IBM AT DE-9 format. They are also used when extending any sort of cable that normally has plugs on both ends (rather than a socket on one and plug on the other), however in this case it is usually called just an &quot;extender&quot;, such as with F connectors, BNC connectors, and various RJ connectors used in telephony and computer networking.

Gender changers are used in professional audio to adapt XLR connectors, RCA connectors, Speakon connectors and TRS phone connectors.

The null modem is a computer communications adapter which may appear to be a gender changer, but it reroutes the wiring. The &quot;transmit&quot; pair from each side is routed into the &quot;receive&quot; pair of the other side, in the manner of a crossover cable.

Many different types of small hardware can be considered gender changers. For instance, there are a variety of small adapters sold for quarter-inch audiovisual cables that serve the role of connecting gendered cables. Other kinds of gender changers are available for coaxial cable, Ethernet cabling or any other type of modern data or audiovisual cables.

<doc id="38090" wikidata="Q207410" url="?curid=38090" title="Così fan tutte">
<text> (&quot;Women are like that, or The School for Lovers&quot;), K. 588, is an opera buffa in two acts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It was first performed on 26 January 1790 at the Burgtheater in Vienna, Austria. The libretto was written by Lorenzo Da Ponte who also wrote &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

Although it is commonly held that was written and composed at the suggestion of the Emperor Joseph II, recent research does not support this idea. There is evidence that Mozart&#x27;s contemporary Antonio Salieri tried to set the libretto but left it unfinished. In 1994, John Rice uncovered two terzetti by Salieri in the Austrian National Library.

The short title, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, literally means &quot;So do they all&quot;, using the feminine plural (&quot;&quot;) to indicate women. It is usually translated into English as &quot;Women are like that&quot;. The words are sung by the three men in act 2, scene 3, just before the finale; this melodic phrase is also quoted in the overture to the opera. Da Ponte had used the line &quot;Così fan tutte le belle&quot; earlier in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (in act 1, scene 7).

==Performance history==
The first performance of Mozart&#x27;s setting took place at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 26 January 1790. It was given only five times before the run was stopped by the death of the Emperor Joseph II and the resulting period of court mourning. It was performed twice in June 1790 with the composer conducting the second performance, and again in July (twice) and August (once). After that it was not performed in Vienna during Mozart&#x27;s lifetime. The first British performance was in May 1811 at the King&#x27;s Theatre, London. &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; was not performed in the United States until 1922, when it was given at the Metropolitan Opera.

According to William Mann, Mozart disliked prima donna Adriana Ferrarese del Bene, da Ponte&#x27;s arrogant mistress for whom the role of Fiordiligi had been created. Knowing her idiosyncratic tendency to drop her chin on low notes and throw back her head on high ones, Mozart filled her showpiece aria &quot;Come scoglio&quot; with constant leaps from low to high and high to low in order to make Ferrarese&#x27;s head &quot;bob like a chicken&quot; onstage.

The subject matter (see synopsis below) did not offend Viennese sensibilities of the time, but in the 19th and early 20th centuries was considered risqué, vulgar, and even immoral. The opera was rarely performed, and when it did appear it was presented in one of several bowdlerised versions.

After World War II it regained a place in the standard operatic repertoire and is now frequently performed.

A comedic adaptation, &quot;Covid fan tutte&quot;, (also using other music by Mozart) depicting life during the first several months of the COVID-19 pandemic was produced by the Finnish National Opera in 2020.

==Roles==
While the use of modern fach titles and voice categories for these roles has become customary, Mozart was far more general in his own descriptions of the voice types, as shown above. Occasionally these voice types are varied in performance practice. Don Alfonso is sometimes performed by baritones such as Thomas Allen and Bo Skovhus and Dorabella is almost always performed by a mezzo-soprano. Despina is occasionally performed by a mezzo-soprano, such as Cecilia Bartoli, Frederica von Stade, Agnes Baltsa, Ann Murray and Ginger Costa-Jackson. Ferrando and Fiordiligi, however, can only be sung by a tenor and a soprano because of the high tessitura of their roles.

==Instrumentation==
The instrumentation is as follows:

* Woodwinds: 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons. Fiordiligi&#x27;s aria &quot;Per pietà, ben mio, perdona&quot;, act 2, contains a rare instance of clarinets in B-natural (key of the aria is E major which transposes to F major for the clarinet part, explaining the use of B clarinets). In most modern editions this is made into a part for A clarinets. The &quot;NMA&quot; keeps the notation for the B clarinet. There is evidence that some of the clarinet writing was intended for basset clarinet due to its low range.
* Brass: 2 horns, 2 trumpets.
* Percussion: 2 timpani – an additional military drum is used on stage.
* Strings: first violins, second violins, violas, violoncellos, double basses.
* Basso continuo in secco recitatives of harpsichord and violoncello (period performance practice often uses a fortepiano only).

==Synopsis==
Mozart and Da Ponte use the theme of &quot;fiancée swapping&quot;, which dates back to the 13th century; notable earlier versions are found in Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. Elements from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; are also present. Furthermore, it incorporates elements of the myth of Procris as found in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, vii.
:Place: Naples
:Time: the 18th century

===Act 1===
====Scene 1: A coffeehouse====

In a cafe, Ferrando and Guglielmo (two officers) express certainty that their fiancées (Dorabella and Fiordiligi, respectively) will be eternally faithful. Don Alfonso expresses skepticism and claims that there is no such thing as a faithful woman. He lays a wager with the two officers, claiming he can prove in a day&#x27;s time that those two, like all women, are fickle. The wager is accepted: the two officers will pretend to have been called off to war; soon thereafter they will return in disguise and each attempt to seduce the other&#x27;s lover. The scene shifts to the two women, who are praising their men (duet: &quot;Ah guarda sorella&quot;—&quot;Ah look sister&quot;). Alfonso arrives to announce the bad news: the officers have been called off to war. Ferrando and Guglielmo arrive, brokenhearted, and bid farewell (quintet: &quot;Sento, o Dio, che questo piede è restio&quot;—&quot;I feel, oh God, that my foot is reluctant&quot;). As the boat with the men sails off to sea, Alfonso and the sisters wish them safe travel (trio: &quot;Soave sia il vento&quot;—&quot;May the wind be gentle&quot;). Alfonso, left alone, gloatingly predicts that the women (like all women) will prove unfaithful (arioso: &quot;Oh, poverini, per femmina giocare cento zecchini?&quot;—&quot;Oh, poor little ones, to wager 100 sequins on a woman&quot;).

====Scene 2: A room in the sisters&#x27; home====

Despina, the maid, arrives and asks what is wrong. Dorabella bemoans the torment of having been left alone (aria: &quot;Smanie implacabili&quot;—&quot;Torments implacable&quot;). Despina mocks the sisters, advising them to take new lovers while their betrotheds are away (aria: &quot;In uomini, in soldati, sperare fedeltà?&quot;—&quot;In men, in soldiers, you hope for faithfulness?&quot;). After they leave, Alfonso arrives. He fears Despina will recognize the men through their disguises, so he bribes her into helping him to win the bet. The two men then arrive, dressed as mustachioed Albanians (sextet: &quot;Alla bella Despinetta&quot;—&quot;Meet the pretty Despinetta&quot;). The sisters enter and are alarmed by the presence of strange men in their home. The &quot;Albanians&quot; tell the sisters that they were led by love to them (the sisters). However, the sisters refuse to give in. Fiordiligi asks the &quot;Albanians&quot; to leave and pledges to remain faithful (aria: &quot;Come scoglio&quot;—&quot;Like a rock&quot;). The &quot;Albanians&quot; continue the attempt to win over the sisters&#x27; hearts, Guglielmo going so far as to point out all of his manly attributes (aria: &quot;Non siate ritrosi&quot;—&quot;Don&#x27;t be shy&quot;), but to no avail. Ferrando, left alone and sensing victory, praises his love (aria: &quot;Un&#x27;aura amorosa&quot;—&quot;A loving breath&quot;).

====Scene 3: A garden====

The sisters are still pining. Despina has asked Don Alfonso to let her take over the seduction plan. Suddenly, the &quot;Albanians&quot; burst in the scene and threaten to poison themselves if they are not allowed the chance to woo the sisters. As Alfonso tries to calm them, they drink the &quot;poison&quot; and pretend to pass out. Soon thereafter, a &quot;doctor&quot; (Despina in disguise) arrives on the scene and, using magnet therapy, is able to revive the &quot;Albanians&quot;. The men, pretending to hallucinate, demand a kiss from Dorabella and Fiordiligi (whom the &quot;Albanians&quot; call goddesses) who stand before them. The sisters refuse, even as Alfonso and the doctor (Despina) urge them to acquiesce.

===Act 2===
====Scene 1: The sisters&#x27; bedroom====

Despina urges them to succumb to the &quot;Albanians overtures (aria: &quot;Una donna a quindici anni&quot;—&quot;A fifteen year old woman&quot;). After she leaves, Dorabella confesses to Fiordiligi that she is tempted, and the two agree that a mere flirtation will do no harm and will help them pass the time while they wait for their lovers to return (duet: &quot;Prenderò quel brunettino&quot;—&quot;I will take the dark haired one&quot;).

====Scene 2: The garden====

Dorabella and the disguised Guglielmo pair off, as do Ferrando and Fiordiligi. The conversation is halting and uncomfortable, and Ferrando departs with Fiordiligi. Now alone with Dorabella, Guglielmo attempts to woo her. She puts up a token resistance, and soon she has given him a medallion (with Ferrando&#x27;s portrait inside) in exchange for a heart-shaped locket (duet: &quot;Il core vi dono&quot;—&quot;I give you my heart&quot;). Ferrando is less successful with Fiordiligi (Ferrando&#x27;s aria: &quot;Ah, lo veggio&quot;—&quot;Ah, I see it&quot; and Fiordiligi&#x27;s aria: &quot;Per pietà, ben mio, perdona&quot;—&quot;Please, my beloved, forgive&quot;), so he is enraged when he later finds out from Guglielmo that the medallion with his portrait has been so quickly given away to a new lover. Guglielmo at first sympathises with Ferrando (aria: &quot;Donne mie, la fate a tanti&quot;—&quot;My ladies, you do it to so many&quot;), but then gloats, because his betrothed is faithful.

====Scene 3: The sisters&#x27; room====

Dorabella admits her indiscretion to Fiordiligi (&quot;È amore un ladroncello&quot;—&quot;Love is a little thief&quot;). Fiordiligi, upset by this development, decides to go to the army and find her betrothed. Before she can leave, though, Ferrando arrives and continues his attempted seduction. Fiordiligi finally succumbs and falls into his arms (duet: &quot;Fra gli amplessi&quot;—&quot;In the embraces&quot;). Guglielmo is distraught while Ferrando turns Guglielmo&#x27;s earlier gloating back on him. Alfonso, winner of the wager, tells the men to forgive their fiancées. After all: &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;—&quot;All women are like that&quot;.

====Scene 4====

The scene begins as a double wedding for the sisters and their &quot;Albanian&quot; grooms. Despina, in disguise as a notary, presents the marriage contract, which only the ladies sign. (The men, of course, realise that this wedding is a sham, and are only playing along with it in order to teach their unfaithful lovers a lesson.) Directly thereafter, military music is heard in the distance, indicating the return of the officers. Alfonso confirms the sisters&#x27; fears: Ferrando and Guglielmo are on their way to the house. The &quot;Albanians&quot; hurry off to hide (actually, to change out of their disguises). They return as the officers, professing their love. Alfonso drops the marriage contract in front of the officers, and, when they read it, they become enraged. They then depart and return moments later, half in Albanian disguise, half as officers. Despina has been revealed to be the notary, and the sisters realize they have been duped. All is ultimately forgiven, as the entire group praises the ability to accept life&#x27;s unavoidable good times and bad times.

<text>Charles University (CUNI; , &quot;UK&quot;; ; ), or historically as the University of Prague (), is the largest university in the Czech Republic. It is one of the oldest universities in the world in continuous operation, the oldest university north of the Alps and east of Paris. Today, the university consists of 17 faculties located in Prague, Hradec Králové, and Plzeň.

== History ==
===Medieval university (1349–1419)===
The establishment of a medieval university in Prague was inspired by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. He requested his friend and ally, Pope Clement VI, to create the university. On 26 January 1347, the pope issued the bull establishing a university in Prague, modeled on the University of Paris, with all four faculties, including theology. On 7 April 1348 Charles, the king of Bohemia, gave to the established university privileges and immunities from the secular power in a Golden Bull and on 14 January 1349 he repeated that as the King of the Romans. Most Czech sources since the 19th century—encyclopedias, general histories, materials of the university itself—prefer to give 1348 as the year of the founding of the university, rather than 1347 or 1349. That was caused by an anticlerical shift in the 19th century, shared by both Czechs and Germans.
The university was opened in 1349. The university was sectioned into parts called &quot;nations&quot;: the Bohemian, Bavarian, Polish and Saxon. The Bohemian &quot;natio&quot; included Bohemians, Moravians, southern Slavs, and Hungarians; the Bavarian included Austrians, Swabians, natives of Franconia and of the Rhine provinces; the Polish included Silesians, Poles, Ruthenians; the Saxon included inhabitants of the Margravate of Meissen, Thuringia, Upper and Lower Saxony, Denmark, and Sweden. Ethnically Czech students made 16–20% of all students. Archbishop Arnošt of Pardubice took an active part in the foundation by obliging the clergy to contribute and became a chancellor of the university (i.e., director or manager).

The first graduate was promoted in 1359. The lectures were held in the colleges, of which the oldest was named for the king the &quot;Carolinum&quot;, established in 1366. In 1372 the Faculty of Law became an independent university.

In 1402 Jerome of Prague in Oxford copied out the &quot;Dialogus&quot; and &quot;Trialogus&quot; of John Wycliffe. The dean of the philosophical faculty, Jan Hus, translated &quot;Trialogus&quot; into the Czech language. In 1403 the university forbade its members to follow the teachings of Wycliffe, but his doctrine continued to gain in popularity.

In the Western Schism, the Bohemian &quot;nation&quot; took the side of king Wenceslaus and supported the Council of Pisa (1409). The other &quot;nations&quot; of the university declared their support for the side of Pope Gregory XII, thus the vote was 1:3 against the Bohemians. Hus and other Bohemians, though, took advantage of Wenceslaus&#x27; opposition to Gregory. By the Decree of Kutná Hora () on 18 January 1409, the king subverted the university constitution by granting the Bohemian masters three votes. Only a single vote was left for all other three &quot;nations&quot; combined, compared to one vote per each &quot;nation&quot; before. The result of this &quot;coup&quot; was the emigration of foreign (mostly German) professors and students, founding the University of Leipzig in May 1409. Before that, in 1408, the university had about 200 doctors and Masters, 500 bachelors, and 30,000 students ; it now lost a large part of this number, accounts of the loss varying from 5000 to 20,000 including 46 professors.

In the autumn of 1409, Hus was elected rector of the now Czech-dominated rump university. The university became a bastion of the Hussite movement and mostly a regional institution. Soon, in 1419, the faculties of theology and law disappeared, and only the faculty of arts remained in existence.

===Protestant academy (1419–1622)===
The faculty of arts became a centre of the Hussite movement, and the chief doctrinal authority of the Utraquists. No degrees were given in the years 1417–30; at times there were only eight or nine professors. Emperor Sigismund, son of Charles IV, took what was left into his personal property and some progress was made. The emperor Ferdinand I called the Jesuits to Prague and in 1562 they opened an academy—the &quot;Clementinum&quot;. From 1541 till 1558 the Czech humanist (1516–1566) was a professor of Greek language. Some progress was made again when the emperor Rudolph II took up residence in Prague. In 1609 the obligatory celibacy of the professors was abolished. In 1616 the Jesuit Academy became a university. (It could award academic degrees.)

Jesuits were expelled 1618–1621 during the early stages of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, which was started in Prague by anti-Catholic and anti-Imperial Bohemians. By 1622, the Jesuits had a predominant influence over the emperor. An Imperial decree of 19 September 1622 gave the Jesuits supreme control over the entire school system of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. The last four professors at the Carolinum resigned, and all of the Carolinum and nine colleges went to the Jesuits. The right of handing out degrees, of holding chancellorships, and of appointing the secular professors was also granted to the Jesuits.

===Charles-Ferdinand University (1622–1882)===
Cardinal Ernst Adalbert of Harrach actively opposed the union of the university with another institution, the withdrawal of the archiepiscopal right to the chancellorship, and prevented the drawing up of the Golden Bull for the confirmation of the grant to Jesuits. Cardinal Ernst funded the &quot;Collegium Adalbertinum&quot;, and in 1638, Emperor Ferdinand III limited the teaching monopoly enjoyed by the Jesuits. He took from them the rights, properties and archives of the Carolinum making the university once more independent under an imperial protector. During the last years of the Thirty Years&#x27; War the Charles Bridge in Prague was courageously defended by students of the Carolinum and Clementinum. Since 1650, those who received any degrees took an oath to maintain the &quot;Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin&quot;, which has been renewed annually.
On 23 February 1654, emperor Ferdinand III merged &quot;Carolinum&quot; and &quot;Clementinum&quot; and created a single university with four faculties:Charles-Ferdinand University (). &quot;Carolinum&quot; had at that time only the faculty of arts, as the only faculty surviving the period of the Hussite Wars. The dilapidated Carolinum was rebuilt in 1718 at the expense of the state.

The rebuilding and the bureaucratic reforms of universities in the Habsburg monarchy in 1752 and 1754 deprived the university of many of its former privileges. In 1757 a Dominican and an Augustinian were appointed to give theological instruction. However, there was a gradual introduction of enlightened reforms, and this process culminated at the end of the century when even non-Catholics were granted the right to study. On 29 July 1784, German replaced Latin as the language of instruction. For the first time Protestants were allowed, and soon after Jews. The university acknowledged the need for a Czech language and literature chair. Emperor Leopold II established it by a courtly decree on 28 October 1791. On 15 May 1792, scholar and historian was named the professor of the chair. He started his lectures on 13 March 1793.

In the revolution of 1848, German and Czech students fought for the addition of the Czech language at the Charles-Ferdinand University as a language of lectures. Due to the demographic changes of the 19th century, Prague ceased to have a German-language majority around 1860. By 1863, 22 lecture courses were held in Czech, the remainder (out of 187) in German. In 1864, Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected this because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.

===Split into Czech and German universities===
It soon became clear that neither the German-speaking Bohemians nor the Czechs were satisfied with the bilingual arrangement that the university had established after the revolutions of 1848. The Czechs also refused to support the idea of the reinstitution of the 1349 student nations, instead declaring their support for the idea of keeping the university together, but dividing it into separate colleges, one German and one Czech. This would allow both Germans and Czechs to retain the collective traditions of the university. German-speakers, however, quickly vetoed this proposal, preferring a pure German university: they proposed to split Charles-Ferdinand University into two separate institutions.
After long negotiations, Charles-Ferdinand was divided into German Charles-Ferdinand University () and Czech Charles-Ferdinand University () by an act of the Cisleithanian Imperial Council, which Emperor Franz Joseph sanctioned on 28 February 1882. Each section was entirely independent of the other, and enjoyed equal status. The two universities shared medical and scientific institutes, the old insignia, aula, library, and botanical garden, but common facilities were administered by the German University. The first rector of the Czech University became .

In 1890, the Royal and Imperial Czech Charles-Ferdinand University had 112 teachers and 2,191 students and the Royal and Imperial German Charles-Ferdinand University had 146 teachers and 1,483 students. Both universities had three faculties; the Theological Faculty remained the common until 1891, when it was divided as well. In the winter semester of 1909–10 the German Charles-Ferdinand University had 1,778 students; these were divided into: 58 theological students, for both the secular priesthood and religious orders; 755 law students; 376 medical; 589 philosophical. Among the students were about 80 women. The professors were divided as follows: theology, 7 regular professors, 1 assistant professor, 1 docent; law, 12 regular professors, 2 assistant professors, 4 docents; medicine, 15 regular professors, 19 assistant, 30 docents; philosophy, 30 regular professors, 8 assistant, 19 docents, 7 lecturers. The Czech Charles-Ferdinand University in the winter semester of 1909–10 included 4,319 students; of these 131 were theological students belonging both to the secular and regular clergy; 1,962 law students; 687 medical; 1,539 philosophical; 256 students were women. The professors were divided as follows: theological faculty, 8 regular professors, 2 docents; law, 12 regular, 7 assistant professors, 12 docents; medicine, 16 regular professors, 22 assistant, 24 docents; philosophy, 29 regular, 16 assistant, 35 docents, 11 lecturers.

The high point of the German University was the era preceding the First World War, when it was home to world-renowned scientists such as physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach, Moritz Winternitz and Albert Einstein. In addition, the German-language students included prominent individuals such as future writers Max Brod, Franz Kafka, and Johannes Urzidil. The &quot;Lese- und Redehalle der deutschen Studenten in Prag&quot; (&quot;Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students in Prague&quot;), founded in 1848, was an important social and scientific centre. Their library contained in 1885 more than 23,519 books and offered 248 scientific journals, 19 daily newspapers, 49 periodicals and 34 papers of entertainment. Regular lectures were held to scientific and political themes.

Even before the Austro-Hungarian Empire was abolished in late 1918, to be succeeded by Czechoslovakia, Czech politicians demanded that the insignia of 1348 were exclusively to be kept by the Czech university. The &quot;Act No. 197/1919 Sb. z. a n.&quot; established the Protestant Theological Faculty, but not as a part of the Charles University. (That changed on 10 May 1990, when it finally became a faculty of the university.)

In 1920, the so-called &quot;&quot; (No. 135/1920 Sb. z. a n.) was issued, named for its initiator, professor of physiology František Mareš, which determined that the Czech university was to be the successor to the original university. Dropping the Habsburg name &quot;Ferdinand&quot;, it designated itself Charles University, while the German university was not named in the document, and then became officially called the German University in Prague ().

In 1921, the German-speaking Bohemians considered moving their university to Liberec (), in northern Bohemia. In 1930, about 42,000 inhabitants of Prague spoke German as their native language, while millions lived in northern, southern and western Bohemia, in Czech Silesia and parts of Moravia near the borders with Austria and Germany.
In October 1932, after Naegle&#x27;s death, the Czechs started again a controversy over the insignia. Ethnic tensions intensified, although some professors of the German University were members of the Czechoslovak government. Any agreement to use the insignia for both the universities was rejected. On 21 November 1934, the German University had to hand over the &quot;insigniae&quot; to the Czechs. The German University senate sent a delegation to Minister of Education Krčmář to protest the writ. At noon on 24 November 1934, several thousand students of the Czech University protested in front of the German university building. The Czech rector Karel Domin gave a speech urging the crowd to attack, while the outnumbered German students tried to resist. Under the threat of violence, on 25 November 1934 rector (1873–1951) handed over the &quot;insigniae&quot;. These troubles of 1934 harmed relations between the two universities and nationalities.

The tide turned in 1938 when, following the Munich Agreement, German troops entered the border areas of Czechoslovakia (the so-called Sudetenland), as did Polish and Hungarian troops elsewhere. On 15 March 1939 Germans forced Czecho-Slovakia to split apart and the Czech lands were occupied by Nazis as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. &quot;Reichsprotektor&quot; Konstantin von Neurath handed the historical &quot;insigniae&quot; to the German University, which was officially renamed &quot;Deutsche Karls-Universität in Prag&quot;. On 1 September 1939 the German University was subordinated to the Reich Ministry of Education in Berlin and on 4 November 1939 it was proclaimed to be &quot;Reichsuniversität&quot;.

On 28 October 1939, during a demonstration, Jan Opletal was shot. His burial on 15 November 1939 became another demonstration. On 17 November 1939 (now marked as International Students&#x27; Day) the Czech University and all other Czech institutions of higher learning were closed, remaining closed until the end of the War. Nine student leaders were executed and about 1,200 Czech students were interned in Sachsenhausen and not released until 1943. About 20 or 35 interned students died in the camp. On 8 May 1940 the Czech University was officially renamed Czech Charles University () by government regulation 188/1940 Coll.

World War II marks the end of the coexistence of the two universities in Prague.

In 1945 the insignia of the university (the rector&#x27;s chain, the scepters of the individual faculties, the university seal and also the founding documents and other historical documents) were stolen by the Nazis. None of these historical objects have been found to this day.

===Present-day university (since 1945)===

Although the university began to recover rapidly after 1945, it did not enjoy academic freedom for long. After the communist coup in 1948, the new regime started to arrange purges and repress all forms of disagreement with the official ideology, and continued to do so for the next four decades, with the second wave of purges during the normalization period in the beginning of the 1970s. 

Only in the late 1980s did the situation start to improve; students organized various activities and several peaceful demonstrations in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989 abroad. This initiated the Velvet Revolution in 1989, in which both students and faculty of the university played a large role. Václav Havel, a writer, dramatist and philosopher, was recruited from the independent academic community and appointed president of the republic in December 1989.

Since 26 January 2022, Prof. Milena Králíčková is the first woman rector of the Charles University.

====December 2023 shooting====

On 21 December 2023, a mass shooting occurred at the university. 14 people were killed, and 25 others were wounded. The 24-year-old perpetrator then killed himself. Before the shooting at the university, the perpetrator killed his father at their home in Hostouň. He was also identified as the person responsible for the murders of a man and his two-month-old daughter in Klánovice Forest six days earlier on 15 December.

==Location==

Charles University does not have one joint campus. The University&#x27;s faculties are located in Prague, Hradec Králové, Plzeň and Brandýs nad Labem. The Institute for Language and Preparatory Studies has teaching centres in Dobruška, Mariánské Lázně, Poděbrady and Zahrádky (near Česká Lípa). The Charles University Archive and Depository are located in Lešetice.

University buildings and compounds are scattered throughout Prague – in the Old Town (Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Humanities), the New Town (First Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics), Břevnov (halls of residence), Veleslavín (Faculty of Physical Education and Sport), Libeň (Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, halls of residence), and Hostivař (halls of residence, sports centre).

The oldest building at Charles University &quot;Karolinum&quot; is situated in the Old Town of Prague and constitutes the university&#x27;s center. It is the seat of the rector and of the Academic Senate of Charles university. Carolinum is also the venue for official academic ceremonies such as matriculations or graduations. It was dedicated to the University by the Czech King Wenceslas IV in 1386 and has been serving the University ever since.

Its academic publishing house is Karolinum Press and the university also operates several museums. The Botanical Garden of Charles University, maintained by its Faculty of Science, is located in the New Town.

<text>Don Giovanni (; K. 527; Vienna (1788) title: , literally &quot;The Rake Punished, or Don Giovanni&quot;) is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to an Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. Its subject is a centuries-old Spanish legend about a libertine as told by playwright Tirso de Molina in his 1630 play &quot;El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra&quot;. It is a &quot;dramma giocoso&quot; blending comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements (although the composer entered it into his catalogue simply as &quot;opera buffa&quot;). It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theatre (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on 29 October 1787. &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; is regarded as one of the greatest operas of all time, and has proved a fruitful subject for commentary in its own right; critic Fiona Maddocks has described it as one of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;trio of masterpieces with librettos by Da Ponte&quot;.

== Composition and premiere ==

The opera was commissioned after the success of Mozart&#x27;s trip to Prague in January and February 1787. The subject may have been chosen because the sub-genre of Don Juan opera had originated in that city. Lorenzo Da Ponte&#x27;s libretto is based on Giovanni Bertati&#x27;s for the opera &quot;Don Giovanni Tenorio&quot;, which premiered in Venice early in 1787. In two aspects he copied Bertati: by opening with the Commendatore&#x27;s murder and by avoiding mention of Seville (for Bertati the setting was Villena, Spain; Da Ponte simply writes &quot;city in Spain&quot;).

The opera was supposed to premiere on 14 October 1787 for Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria’s visit, but it was not ready in time and &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; was substituted. Mozart recorded its completion, finally, on 28 October, the night before the premiere (29 October).

The opera was rapturously received, as was often true of Mozart&#x27;s work in Prague. The &quot;Prager Oberpostamtzeitung&quot; reported, &quot;Connoisseurs and musicians say that Prague has never heard the like&quot;, and &quot;the opera ... is extremely difficult to perform.&quot; The &quot;Provincialnachrichten&quot; of Vienna reported, &quot;Herr Mozart conducted in person and was welcomed joyously and jubilantly by the numerous gathering.&quot;

===Scoring===
The score calls for double woodwinds, two horns, two trumpets, three trombones (alto, tenor, bass), timpani, basso continuo for the recitatives, and the usual string section. The composer also specified occasional special musical effects. For the ballroom scene at the end of the first act, Mozart calls for two onstage ensembles to play separate dance music in synchronization with the pit orchestra, each of the three groups playing in its own metre (a 3/4 minuet, a 2/4 contradanse and a fast 3/8 peasant dance), accompanying the dancing of the principal characters. In act 2, Giovanni is seen to play the mandolin, accompanied by pizzicato strings. In the same act, two of the Commendatore&#x27;s interventions (&quot; and &quot;) are accompanied by a wind chorale of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and trombones (with cellos and basses playing from the string section).

===Revision for Vienna===

Mozart also supervised the Vienna premiere of the work, which took place on 7 May 1788. For this production, he wrote two new arias with corresponding recitatives – Don Ottavio&#x27;s aria &quot; (K. 540a, composed on 24 April for the tenor Francesco Morella), Elvira&#x27;s aria &quot; (K. 540c, composed on 30 April for the soprano Caterina Cavalieri) – and the duet between Leporello and Zerlina &quot; (K. 540b, composed on 28 April). He also made some cuts in the Finale in order to make it shorter and more incisive, the most important of which is the section where Anna and Ottavio, Elvira, Zerlina and Masetto, Leporello reveal their plans for the future (&quot;). In order to connect &quot;&quot; (&quot;It must have been the ghost she met&quot;) directly to the moral of the story &quot;&quot; (&quot;This is the end which befalls to evildoers&quot;), Mozart composed a different version of &quot;&quot; (&quot;So the wretch can stay down there with Proserpina and Pluto!&quot;). These cuts are very seldom performed in theatres or recordings.

=== Later performance traditions ===
The opera&#x27;s final ensemble was generally omitted until the early 20th century, a tradition that apparently began very early on. According to the 19th-century Bohemian memoirist Wilhelm Kuhe, the final ensemble was only presented at the first performance in Prague, then never heard again during the original run. It does not appear in the Viennese libretto of 1788; thus the ending of the first performance in Vienna without the ensemble as depicted in the film &quot;Amadeus&quot; may be an accurate portrayal. Nonetheless, the final ensemble is almost invariably performed in full today.

Modern productions sometimes include both the original aria for Don Ottavio, &quot;, and its replacement from the first production in Vienna that was crafted to suit the capabilities of the tenor Francesco Morella, &quot;. Elvira&#x27;s &quot; is usually retained as well. The duet &quot; and the whole accompanying scene involving Zerlina and Leporello from the Viennese version is almost never included.

Although the same singer played both Masetto and the Commendatore roles in both the Prague and Vienna premieres, in modern-day productions, the roles are typically taken by different singers (unless limited by such things as finance or rehearsal time and space). The final scene&#x27;s chorus of demons after the Commendatore&#x27;s exit gives the singer time for a costume change before entering as Masetto for the sextet, though not much time.

== Roles ==
== Instrumentation ==
The instrumentation is:
* Woodwinds: two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets and two bassoons
* Brass: two horns, two trumpets, three trombones
* Percussion: timpani
* Strings: first violins, second violins, violas, cellos and double basses
* Basso continuo (harpsichord and violoncello)
* Mandolin

== Synopsis ==

Don Giovanni, a young, arrogant, and sexually promiscuous nobleman, abuses and outrages everyone else in the cast until he encounters something he cannot kill, beat up, dodge, or outwit.

=== Act 1 ===

The overture begins with a thundering D minor cadence, followed by a short sequence which leads into a light-hearted D major allegro.

:&quot;The garden of the Commendatore&quot;
Leporello, Don Giovanni&#x27;s servant, grumbles about his demanding master and daydreams about being free of him (&quot;&quot; – &quot;Night and day I slave away&quot;). He is keeping watch while Don Giovanni is in the Commendatore&#x27;s house attempting to seduce the Commendatore&#x27;s daughter, Donna Anna. Don Giovanni enters the garden from inside the house, pursued by Donna Anna. Don Giovanni is masked and Donna Anna tries to hold him and to unmask him, shouting for help. (Trio: &quot;&quot; – &quot;Do not hope, unless you kill me, that I shall ever let you run away!&quot;). He breaks free and she runs off as the Commendatore enters the garden. The Commendatore blocks Don Giovanni&#x27;s path and forces him to fight a duel. Don Giovanni kills the Commendatore with his sword and escapes with Leporello. Donna Anna, returning with her fiancé, Don Ottavio, is horrified to see her father lying dead in a pool of his own blood. She makes Don Ottavio swear vengeance against the unknown murderer. (Duet: &quot;&quot; – &quot;Ah, swear to avenge that blood if you can!&quot;)

:&quot;A public square outside Don Giovanni&#x27;s palace&quot;
Leporello tells Don Giovanni that he (Giovanni) is leading a rotten life; Don Giovanni reacts angrily. They hear a woman (Donna Elvira) singing of having been abandoned by her lover, on whom she is seeking revenge (&quot;&quot; – &quot;Ah, who could ever tell me&quot;). Don Giovanni starts to flirt with her, but it turns out he is the former lover she is seeking. The two recognise each other and she reproaches him bitterly. He shoves Leporello forward, ordering him to tell Donna Elvira the truth about him, and then hurries away.

Leporello tells Donna Elvira that Don Giovanni is not worth her feelings for him. He is unfaithful to everyone; his conquests include 640 women and girls in Italy, 231 in Germany, 100 in France, 91 in Turkey, but in Spain, 1,003 (&quot;Madamina, il catalogo è questo&quot; – &quot;My dear lady, this is the catalogue&quot;). In a frequently cut recitative, Donna Elvira vows vengeance.

:&quot;The open country&quot;

A marriage procession with Masetto and Zerlina enters. Don Giovanni and Leporello arrive soon after. Don Giovanni is immediately attracted to Zerlina, and he attempts to remove the jealous Masetto by offering to host a wedding celebration at his castle. On realising that Don Giovanni means to remain behind with Zerlina, Masetto becomes angry (&quot;&quot; – &quot;I understand! Yes, my lord!&quot;) but is forced to leave. Don Giovanni and Zerlina are soon alone and he immediately begins his seductive arts (Duet: &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot; – &quot;There we will entwine our hands&quot;).
Donna Elvira arrives and thwarts the seduction (&quot;&quot; – &quot;Flee from the traitor!&quot;). She leaves with Zerlina. Don Ottavio and Donna Anna enter, plotting vengeance on the still unknown murderer of Donna Anna&#x27;s father. Donna Anna, unaware that she is speaking to her attacker, pleads for Don Giovanni&#x27;s help. Don Giovanni, relieved that he is unrecognised, readily promises it, and asks who has disturbed her peace. Before she can answer, Donna Elvira returns and tells Donna Anna and Don Ottavio that Don Giovanni is a false-hearted seducer. Don Giovanni tries to convince Don Ottavio and Donna Anna that Donna Elvira is insane (Quartet: &quot;&quot; – &quot;Don&#x27;t trust him, oh sad one&quot;). As Don Giovanni leaves, Donna Anna suddenly recognises him as her father&#x27;s murderer and tells Don Ottavio the story of his intrusion, claiming that she was deceived at first because she was expecting a night visit from Don Ottavio himself, but managed to fight Don Giovanni off after discovering the impostor (long recitative exchange between Donna Anna and Don Ottavio). She repeats her demand that he avenge her and points out that he will be avenging himself as well (aria: &quot;Or sai chi l&#x27;onore Rapire a me volse&quot; – &quot;Now you know who wanted to rob me of my honour&quot;). In the Vienna version, Don Ottavio, not yet convinced (Donna Anna having only recognised Don Giovanni&#x27;s voice, not seen his face), resolves to keep an eye on his friend (&quot;&quot; – &quot;On her peace my peace depends&quot;).

Leporello informs Don Giovanni that all the guests of the peasant wedding are in Don Giovanni&#x27;s house and that he distracted Masetto from his jealousy, but that Zerlina, returning with Donna Elvira, made a scene and spoiled everything. However, Don Giovanni remains cheerful and tells Leporello to organise a party and invite every girl he can find. (Don Giovanni&#x27;s &quot;Champagne Aria&quot;: &quot;&quot; – &quot;Till they are tipsy&quot;). They hasten to his palace.

:&quot;A garden outside Don Giovanni&#x27;s palace&quot;
Zerlina follows the jealous Masetto and tries to pacify him (&quot;&quot; – &quot;Beat, O beat me, handsome Masetto&quot;), but just as she manages to persuade him of her innocence, Don Giovanni&#x27;s voice from offstage startles and frightens her. Masetto hides, resolving to see for himself what Zerlina will do when Don Giovanni arrives. Zerlina tries to hide from Don Giovanni, but he finds her and attempts to continue the seduction, until he stumbles upon Masetto&#x27;s hiding place. Confused but quickly recovering, Don Giovanni reproaches Masetto for leaving Zerlina alone, and returns her temporarily to him. Don Giovanni then leads both offstage to his ballroom. Three masked guests – the disguised Don Ottavio, Donna Anna, and Donna Elvira – enter the garden. From a balcony, Leporello invites them to his master&#x27;s party. They accept the invitation and Leporello leaves the balcony. Alone, Don Ottavio and Donna Anna pray for protection, Donna Elvira for vengeance (Trio: &quot;&quot; – &quot;May the just heavens protect us&quot;).
:&quot;Don Giovanni&#x27;s ballroom&quot;

As the merriment, featuring three separate chamber orchestras on stage, proceeds, Leporello distracts Masetto by dancing with him, while Don Giovanni leads Zerlina offstage to a private room and tries to assault her. When Zerlina screams for help, Don Giovanni drags Leporello onstage from the room, accuses Leporello of assaulting Zerlina himself, and threatens to kill him. The others are not fooled. Don Ottavio produces a pistol and points it at Don Giovanni, and the three guests unmask and declare that they know all. But despite being denounced and menaced from all sides, Don Giovanni remains calm and escapes – for the moment.

=== Act 2 ===
:&quot;Outside Donna Elvira&#x27;s house&quot;

Leporello threatens to leave Don Giovanni, but his master calms him with a peace offering of money (Duet: &quot;Eh via buffone&quot; – &quot;Go on, fool&quot;). Wanting to seduce Donna Elvira&#x27;s maid, and believing that she will trust him better if he appears in lower-class clothes, Don Giovanni orders Leporello to exchange cloak and hat with him. Donna Elvira comes to her window (Trio: &quot;Ah taci, ingiusto core&quot; – &quot;Ah, be quiet unjust heart&quot;). Seeing an opportunity for a game, Don Giovanni hides and sends Leporello out in the open wearing Don Giovanni&#x27;s cloak and hat. From his hiding place Don Giovanni sings a promise of repentance, expressing a desire to return to her and threatening to kill himself if she does not take him back, while Leporello poses as Don Giovanni and tries to keep from laughing. Donna Elvira, convinced, descends to the street. Leporello, continuing to pose as Don Giovanni, leads her away to keep her occupied while Don Giovanni serenades her maid with his mandolin. (&quot;Deh, vieni alla finestra&quot; – &quot;Ah, come to the window&quot;).

Before Don Giovanni can complete his seduction of the maid, Masetto and his friends arrive, looking for Don Giovanni in order to kill him. Don Giovanni poses as Leporello (whose clothes he is still wearing) and joins the posse, pretending that he also hates Don Giovanni. After cunningly dispersing Masetto&#x27;s friends (Don Giovanni aria: &quot;Metà di voi qua vadano&quot; – &quot;Half of you go this way. the others, go that way&quot;), Don Giovanni takes Masetto&#x27;s weapons away, beats him up, and runs off, laughing. Zerlina arrives and consoles the bruised and battered Masetto (&quot;Vedrai carino&quot; – &quot;You&#x27;ll see, dear one&quot;).

:&quot;A dark courtyard&quot;

Leporello abandons Donna Elvira. (Sextet: &quot;Sola, sola in buio loco&quot; – &quot;All alone in this dark place&quot;). As he tries to escape, he bumps into Don Ottavio and Donna Anna. Zerlina and Masetto also enter the scene. Everyone mistakes Leporello for Don Giovanni, whose clothes he is still wearing. They surround Leporello and threaten to kill him. Donna Elvira tries to protect the man who she thinks is Don Giovanni, claiming him as her husband and begging the others to spare him. Leporello takes off Don Giovanni&#x27;s cloak and reveals his true identity. He begs for mercy and, seeing an opportunity, runs off (Leporello aria: &quot;Ah pietà signori miei&quot; – &quot;Ah, have mercy, my lords&quot;). Don Ottavio is now convinced that Don Giovanni murdered Donna Anna&#x27;s father (the deceased Commendatore). He swears vengeance (&quot;Il mio tesoro&quot; – &quot;My treasure&quot; – though in the Vienna version this was cut).

In the Vienna production of the opera, Zerlina follows Leporello and recaptures him. Threatening him with a razor, she ties him to a stool. He attempts to sweet-talk her out of hurting him. (Duet: &quot;Per queste tue manine&quot; – &quot;For these hands of yours&quot;). Zerlina goes to find Masetto and the others; Leporello escapes again before she returns. This scene, marked by low comedy, is rarely performed today. Also in the Vienna production, Donna Elvira is still furious at Don Giovanni for betraying her, but she also feels sorry for him. (&quot;Mi tradì quell&#x27;alma ingrata&quot; – &quot;That ungrateful wretch betrayed me&quot;).
:&quot;A graveyard with the statue of the Commendatore&quot;
Don Giovanni wanders into a graveyard. Leporello arrives and the two reunite. Leporello tells Don Giovanni of his brush with danger, and Don Giovanni laughingly taunts him, saying that he took advantage of his disguise as Leporello by trying to seduce one of Leporello&#x27;s girlfriends. The voice of the statue interrupts and warns Don Giovanni that his laughter will not last beyond sunrise. At the command of his master, Leporello reads the inscription upon the statue&#x27;s base: &quot;Here am I waiting for revenge against the scoundrel who killed me&quot; (&quot;Dell&#x27;empio che mi trasse al passo estremo qui attendo la vendetta&quot;). The servant trembles, but Don Giovanni scornfully orders him to invite the statue to dinner, and threatens to kill him if he does not. Leporello makes several attempts to invite the statue to dinner, but is too frightened to complete the invitation (Duet: &quot;O, statua gentilissima&quot; – &quot;Oh most noble statue&quot;). Don Giovanni invites the statue to dinner himself. Much to his surprise, the statue nods its head and responds affirmatively.

:&quot;Donna Anna&#x27;s room&quot;
Don Ottavio pressures Donna Anna to marry him, but she thinks it is inappropriate so soon after her father&#x27;s death. He accuses her of being cruel, and she assures him that she loves him, and is faithful (&quot;Non mi dir&quot; – &quot;Tell me not&quot;).


:&quot;Don Giovanni&#x27;s chambers&quot;

Don Giovanni revels in the luxury of a great meal, served by Leporello, and musical entertainment during which the orchestra plays music from popular (at the time) late-18th-century operas: &quot;O quanto un sì bel giubilo&quot; from Vicente Martín y Soler&#x27;s &quot;Una cosa rara&quot; (1786), &quot;Come un agnello&quot; from Giuseppe Sarti&#x27;s &quot;Fra i due litiganti il terzo gode&quot; (1782), and finally &quot;Non più andrai&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s own &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1786). Leporello comments that he is all too familiar with the final tune () – likely a joke understandable for the original audience, as Felice Ponziani, who sang Leporello&#x27;s part at the premiere, also sang Figaro&#x27;s part (including &quot;Non più andrai&quot;) earlier in Prague. (Finale &quot;Già la mensa è preparata&quot; – &quot;Already the table is prepared&quot;). Donna Elvira enters, saying that she no longer feels resentment against Don Giovanni, only pity for him. (&quot;L&#x27;ultima prova dell&#x27;amor mio&quot; – &quot;The final proof of my love&quot;). Don Giovanni, surprised, asks what she wants, and she begs him to change his life. Don Giovanni taunts her and then turns away, praising wine and women as the &quot;support and glory of humankind&quot; (). Hurt and angry, Donna Elvira gives up and leaves. Offstage, she screams in sudden terror. Don Giovanni orders Leporello to see what has upset her; when he does, he also cries out, and runs back into the room, stammering that the statue has appeared as promised. An ominous knocking sounds at the door. Leporello, paralyzed by fear, cannot answer it, so Don Giovanni opens it himself, revealing the statue of the Commendatore. With the rhythmic chords of the overture, now reharmonized with diabolic diminished sevenths accompanying the Commendatore (&quot;Don Giovanni! A cenar teco m&#x27;invitasti&quot; – &quot;Don Giovanni! You invited me to dine with you&quot;), the statue asks if Don Giovanni will now accept invitation to dinner. Don Giovanni brazenly accepts, and shakes the statue&#x27;s proffered hand, only to collapse as he is overcome by sudden chills. The statue offers him a final chance to repent as death draws near, but Don Giovanni adamantly refuses. The statue disappears and Don Giovanni cries out in pain and terror as he is surrounded by a chorus of demons, who carry him down to Hell. Leporello, watching from under the table, also cries out in fear.

Donna Anna, Don Ottavio, Donna Elvira, Zerlina, and Masetto arrive, searching for the villain. They find instead Leporello hiding under the table, shaken by the supernatural horror he has witnessed. He assures them that no one will ever see Don Giovanni again. The remaining characters announce their plans for the future: Donna Anna and Don Ottavio will marry when Donna Anna&#x27;s year of mourning is over; Donna Elvira will withdraw from society for the rest of her life; Zerlina and Masetto will finally go home for dinner; and Leporello will go to the tavern to find a better master.

The concluding ensemble delivers the moral of the opera – &quot;Such is the end of the evildoer: the death of a sinner always reflects his life&quot; (&quot;Questo è il fin di chi fa mal, e de&#x27; perfidi la morte alla vita è sempre ugual&quot;). As mentioned above, productions for over a century – beginning with the original run in Prague – customarily omitted the final ensemble, but it frequently reappeared in the 20th century and productions of the opera now usually include it. The return to D major and the innocent simplicity of the last few bars conclude the opera.

== Cultural influence ==

The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard wrote a long essay in his book &quot;Enten – Eller&quot; in which he argues, writing under the pseudonym of his character &quot;A&quot;, that &quot;among all classic works &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; stands highest.&quot; Charles Gounod wrote that Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; is &quot;a work without blemish, of uninterrupted perfection.&quot; The finale, in which Don Giovanni refuses to repent, has been a captivating philosophical and artistic topic for many writers including George Bernard Shaw, who in &quot;Man and Superman&quot; parodied the opera (with explicit mention of the Mozart score for the finale scene between the Commendatore and Don Giovanni). Gustave Flaubert called &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, along with &quot;Hamlet&quot; and the sea, &quot;the three finest things God ever made.&quot; E. T. A. Hoffmann also wrote a short story derived from the opera, &quot;Don Juan&quot;, in which the narrator meets Donna Anna and describes Don Juan as an aesthetic hero rebelling against God and society.

In some Germanic and other languages, Leporello&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue Aria&quot; provided the name &quot; list&quot; for concertina-folded printed matter, as used for brochures, photo albums, computer printouts and other continuous stationery.

Playwright Peter Shaffer used &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; for a pivotal plot point in his play &quot;Amadeus&quot;, a fictional biography of its composer. In it, Antonio Salieri notices how Mozart composed the opera while tortured by the memory of his imposing, deceased father Leopold, and uses the information to psychologically torture Mozart even further.

=== &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and other composers ===
The sustained popularity of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; has resulted in extensive borrowings and arrangements of the original. The most famous and probably the most musically substantial is the operatic fantasy, &quot;Réminiscences de Don Juan&quot; by Franz Liszt. The minuet from the finale of act 1 (&quot;Signor, guardate un poco&quot;), transcribed by Moritz Moszkowski, also makes an incongruous appearance in the manuscript of Liszt&#x27;s Fantasy on Themes from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Figaro&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and Sigismond Thalberg uses the same minuet, along with &quot;&quot;, in his , Op. 42. Thalberg also included a piano arrangement of &quot;Il mio tesoro&quot; in his &quot;, Op. 70.
This minuet was also used for sets of variations for piano by Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (Op. 2), Fanny Hünerwadel and János Fusz (Op. 10, the latter for four hands).
&quot;&quot; also makes an appearance in the Klavierübung of Ferruccio Busoni, under the title (Variation study after Mozart). Schumann included a piano arrangement of &quot;Vedrai carino&quot; in his , which was originally intended for his &quot;Album for the Young&quot;, whereas Muzio Clementi wrote piano variations on Zerlina&#x27;s other aria, &quot;Batti, batti&quot;. Johann Wilhelm Wilms took a theme from the duet &quot;O, statua gentilissima&quot; for his set of piano variations. Chopin wrote Variations on &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot; (the duet between Don Giovanni and Zerlina) for piano and orchestra. Beethoven and Danzi also wrote variations on the same theme. And Beethoven, in his &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;, cites the beginning of the opera &quot;&quot; in variation 22. 
Cipriani Potter wrote piano variations on &quot;Fin ch&#x27;han dal vino&quot;, Op. 2 (1816). The turkeys in Chabrier&#x27;s &quot;Ballade des gros dindons&quot; (1889) finish each verse imitating the mandolin accompaniment of the Serenade.

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky always regarded &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; – and its composer – with awe. In 1855, Mozart&#x27;s original manuscript had been purchased in London by the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, who was the teacher of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s one-time unofficial fiancée Désirée Artôt (whom Viardot may have persuaded not to go through with her plan to marry the composer). Viardot kept the manuscript in a shrine in her Paris home, where it was visited by many people. Tchaikovsky visited her when he was in Paris in June 1886, and said that when looking at the manuscript, he was &quot;in the presence of divinity&quot;. So it is not surprising that the centenary of the opera in 1887 would inspire him to write something honouring Mozart. Instead of taking any themes from &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, however, he took four lesser known works by Mozart and arranged them into his fourth orchestral suite, which he called &quot;Mozartiana&quot;. The baritone who sang the title role in the centenary performance of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in Prague that year was Mariano Padilla y Ramos, the man Désirée Artôt married instead of Tchaikovsky.

Michael Nyman&#x27;s popular, short band piece &quot;In Re Don Giovanni&quot; (1981, with later adaptations and revisions) is constructed on a prominent 15-bar phrase in the accompaniment to Leporello&#x27;s catalogue aria.

In addition to instrumental works, allusions to &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; also appear in a number of operas: Nicklausse of Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; sings a snatch of Leporello&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and Rossini quotes from the same aria in the duettino between Selim and Fiorilla following the former&#x27;s &quot;cavatina&quot; in act 1 of &quot;Il turco in Italia&quot;.

Ramón Carnicer&#x27;s opera &quot;&quot; (1822) is a peculiar reworking of Mozart&#x27;s opera to adapt it to Rossinian fashion. It comprises new music by Carnicer on a new text (e.g. the first half of act 1), new music on Da Ponte&#x27;s text (e.g. Leporello&#x27;s aria) or on a mixture of both (e.g. the new trio for the scene in the cemetery); the whole collated with extensive quotations or entire sections borrowed directly from Mozart (e.g. Finale 1 and Finale 2, and even some music from &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;), though usually slightly reworked and re-orchestrated.

<text>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas () is a science fiction adventure novel by the French writer Jules Verne. It is often considered a classic within both its genres and world literature. The novel was originally serialised from March 1869 to June 1870 in Pierre-Jules Hetzel&#x27;s French fortnightly periodical, the . A deluxe octavo edition, published by Hetzel in November 1871, included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou. 

The book was widely acclaimed on its release, and remains so; it is regarded as one of the premier adventure novels and one of Verne&#x27;s greatest works, along with &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; and &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;. Its depiction of Captain Nemo&#x27;s submarine, the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, is regarded as ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of modern submarines, which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.

Jules Verne saw a model of the French submarine &quot;Plongeur&quot; at the in 1867, which inspired him while writing the novel.

==Title==
The title refers to the distance travelled under the various seas: 20,000 metric leagues (80,000 km, over 40,000 nautical miles), nearly twice the circumference of the Earth.

==Principal characters==
*Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French natural scientist and the narrator of the story.
*Conseil, Aronnax&#x27;s Flemish servant who is highly devoted to him and knowledgeable in biological classification.
*Ned Land, a Canadian harpooner, described as having &quot;no equal in his dangerous trade&quot;.
*Captain Nemo, the designer and captain of the &quot;Nautilus.&quot;

==Plot==

In 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious sea monster, which is speculated to be a gigantic narwhal. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in New York City to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French marine biologist and the story&#x27;s narrator, is in town at the time and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition. Canadian whaler and master harpooner Ned Land and Aronnax&#x27;s faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.

The expedition leaves Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, then travels south around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship&#x27;s rudder. Aronnax and Land are hurled into the sea, and Conseil jumps into the water after them. They survive by climbing onto the &quot;monster&quot;, which, they are startled to find, is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they are captured and introduced to the submarine&#x27;s mysterious constructor and commander, Captain Nemo.

The rest of the novel describes the protagonists&#x27; adventures aboard the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation — a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to escape terrestrial civilization. Nemo explains that his submarine is electrically powered and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he cannot let them leave — they must remain on board permanently.

They visit many oceanic regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view coral formations, sunken vessels from the Battle of Vigo Bay, the Antarctic ice barrier, the transatlantic telegraph cable, and the legendary underwater realm of Atlantis. They even travel to the South Pole and are trapped in an upheaval of an iceberg on the way back, caught in a narrow gallery of ice from which they are forced to dig themselves out. The passengers also put on diving suits, hunt sharks and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the &quot;Nautilus&quot;. When the submarine returns to the Atlantic Ocean, a school of giant squid (&quot;devilfish&quot;) attacks the vessel and kills another crewman.

The novel&#x27;s later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the &quot;Nautilus&quot; is attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo — whom Aronnax dubs an &quot;archangel of hatred&quot; — rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor&#x27;s horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression.

Circumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner&#x27;s life. One morning, he announces that they are in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him, yet he is still drawn to the man. Fearing that Nemo&#x27;s very presence could weaken his resolve, he avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, &quot;O almighty God! Enough! Enough!&quot;. Aronnax immediately joins his companions as they carry out their escape plans, but as they board the submarine&#x27;s skiff they realize that the &quot;Nautilus&quot; has seemingly blundered into the ocean&#x27;s deadliest whirlpool, the Moskenstraumen (more commonly known as the &quot;Maelstrom&quot;). They escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine&#x27;s ultimate fate remained unknown until the events of &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;.

==Themes and subtext==
Captain Nemo&#x27;s assumed name recalls Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, when Odysseus encounters the monstrous Cyclops Polyphemus in the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it is Outis () &#x27;no one&#x27;, translated into Latin as &quot;Nemo&quot;. Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for ten years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.

The novel repeatedly mentions the U.S. Naval Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury, an oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the depths, and charted the world&#x27;s oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.

The novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including Lapérouse, the celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; Dumont d&#x27;Urville, a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lapérouse&#x27;s ships; and Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal and nephew of the sole survivor of Lapérouse&#x27;s ill-fated expedition. The &quot;Nautilus&quot; follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lapérouse&#x27;s vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d&#x27;Urville&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Astrolabe&quot;; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.

In possibly the novel&#x27;s most famous episode, the above-described battle with a school of giant squid, one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: &quot;To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of &quot;The Toilers of the Sea&quot;.&quot; A bestselling novel in Verne&#x27;s day, &quot;The Toilers of the Sea&quot; also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by critics to be symbolic of the Industrial Revolution. Certainly, Verne was influenced by Hugo&#x27;s novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the Revolutions of 1848.

Other symbols and themes pique modern critics. Margaret Drabble, for instance, argues that Verne&#x27;s masterwork also anticipated the ecology movement and influenced French &quot;avant-garde&quot; imagery. As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world&#x27;s persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the Cretan Revolt of 1866–1869, proving to Professor Aronnax that he had not severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an Indian pearl diver from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. When asked why he would help a &quot;representative of that race from which he&#x27;d fled under the seas&quot;, Nemo responds that the diver, as an &quot;East Indian&quot;, &quot;lives in the land of the oppressed&quot;.

Indeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the book&#x27;s final form, Nemo says to professor Aronnax, &quot;That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am still, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!&quot; In the novel&#x27;s initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a Polish nobleman, whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish January Uprising of 1863. These specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne&#x27;s publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, believed responsible by today&#x27;s scholars for many modifications of Verne&#x27;s original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the Russian Empire, hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo&#x27;s enemy war, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo&#x27;s origins.

Even so, a trace remains of the novel&#x27;s initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under a Polish hero, Tadeusz Kościuszko, leader of the uprising against Russian and Prussian control in 1794; Kościuszko mourned his country&#x27;s prior defeat with the Latin exclamation &quot;Finis Poloniae!&quot; (&quot;Poland is no more!&quot;).

Five years later, and again at Hetzel&#x27;s insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel, &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. The novel changes the captain&#x27;s nationality from Polish to Indian; in the book&#x27;s final chapters, Nemo reveals that he is an Indian prince named Dakkar who was a descendant of Tipu Sultan, a prominent ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, and participated in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, an ultimately unsuccessful uprising against Company rule in India. After the rebellion, which led to the death of his family, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel&#x27;s concluding pages.


Verne took the name &quot;Nautilus&quot; from one of the earliest successful submarines, built in 1800 by Robert Fulton, who also invented the first commercially successful steamboat. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered nautilus. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed French Navy submarine &quot;Plongeur&quot; at the 1867 , which guided him in his development of the novel&#x27;s &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

The diving gear used by passengers on the &quot;Nautilus&quot; is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the surface-supplied hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865. Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand regulator. The diver didn&#x27;t swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an &quot;aérophore&quot; (Greek for &quot;air-carrier&quot;). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, but Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: &quot;The &quot;Nautilus&quot;″s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.&quot;

==English translations==
The novel was first translated into English in 1872 by Reverend Lewis Page Mercier. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne&#x27;s French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting Verne&#x27;s original (including uniformly mistranslating the French &quot;scaphandre&quot; — properly &quot;diving suit&quot; — as &quot;cork-jacket&quot;, following a long-obsolete usage as &quot;a type of lifejacket&quot;). Some of these distortions may have been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier&#x27;s omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo&#x27;s stateroom, a collection originally including Daniel O&#x27;Connell among other international figures. Mercier&#x27;s text became the standard English translation, and some later retranslations continued to recycle its mistakes, including mistranslating the title as &quot;... &quot;under the Sea&quot;&quot;, rather than &quot;... &quot;under the Seas&quot;&quot;.

In 1962, Anthony Bonner published a translation of the novel with Bantam Classics. This edition included an introduction by Ray Bradbury, comparing Captain Nemo to Captain Ahab of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

A significant modern revision of Mercier&#x27;s translation appeared in 1966, prepared by Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press. Miller addressed many of Mercier&#x27;s errors in the volume&#x27;s preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text. In 1976, Miller published &quot;The Annotated Jules Verne, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea&quot; at the suggestion of the Thomas Y. Crowel Company editorial staff. The cover declared it &quot;The only completely restored and annotated edition&quot;. In 1993, Miller collaborated with his fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter to produce &quot;The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition&quot;, published in 1993 by the Naval Institute Press. Its text took advantage of Walter&#x27;s unpublished translation, which Project Gutenberg later made available online.

In 1998, William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation with the title &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas&quot;, published by Oxford University Press (). Butcher includes detailed notes, a comprehensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by Hetzel, his publisher.

In 2010, Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater&quot;. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter&#x27;s Verne translations titled &quot;Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics&quot; and published by State University of New York Press ().

In 2017, David Coward issued a new translation published by Penguin Classics () with the title &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, including a new introduction, notes, and a note on the text, using the 1871 Christian Chelebourg edition of the text as the basis for his translation. Coward also included 42 illustrations, which were published for the first time in the &#x27;Collection Hetzel&#x27; in 1901.

==Reception==
The science fiction writer Theodore L. Thomas criticized the novel in 1961, claiming that &quot;there is not a single bit of valid speculation&quot; in the book and that &quot;none of its predictions has come true&quot;. He described its depictions of Nemo&#x27;s diving gear, underwater activities, and the &quot;Nautilus&quot; as &quot;pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.&quot; The notes to the 1993 translation point out that the errors Thomas notes were in Mercier&#x27;s translation, not the original.

Despite his criticisms, Thomas conceded: &quot;Put them all together with the magic of Verne&#x27;s story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it&quot;.

In 2023, Malaurie Guillaume presented Nemo as the first eco-terrorist or first figure of ecologic radicality.

<text>The M551 &quot;Sheridan&quot; AR/AAV (Armored Reconnaissance/Airborne Assault Vehicle) was a light tank developed by the United States and named after General Philip Sheridan, of American Civil War fame. It was designed to be landed by parachute and to swim across rivers. It was armed with the technically advanced but troublesome M81/M81 Modified/M81E1 152 mm gun/launcher, which fired both conventional ammunition and the MGM-51 Shillelagh guided anti-tank missile.

The M551 Sheridan entered service with the United States Army in 1967. At the urging of General Creighton Abrams, the U.S. Commander, Military Assistance Command Vietnam, at the time, the M551 was rushed into combat service to South Vietnam in January 1969. Later that year, M551s were deployed to units in Europe and South Korea. The Sheridan saw extensive combat in the Vietnam War from 1969 to 1973. However, problems with the platform became evident, particularly its poor survivability and reliability.

Based on its experiences in Vietnam, the Army realized the shortcomings of the Sheridan, and after the war in 1975 began to eliminate the vehicle from its units in 1979. A modest fleet of vehicles remained in the 82nd Airborne Division and the National Guard. Various improvement programs were successfully undertaken to improve the Sheridan&#x27;s reliability. Problems persisted with the 152 mm gun/launcher, and various efforts explored to replace it with a more conventional model. The Sheridan went on to serve in the invasion of Panama and the Gulf War. The Army sought to replace the Sheridan with the M8 Armored Gun System, but this was canceled in 1996, late in its development. The Sheridan was retired without a designated replacement in 1996. The Army acquired the M1128 mobile gun system to fulfill a similar requirement, but this was retired in 2022 due to operational issues and rising maintenance costs. The Army&#x27;s current light tank acquisition program is Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) also known as the M10 Booker.

A large number of Sheridans were retained in service at the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California and as Armor Officer Basic training at Armor Training Center, then located at Fort Knox, Kentucky. They worked as simulated Soviet armored opposition force (OPFOR) to train U.S. military units on simulated tank on tank armored combat to test on combat effectiveness in a desert environment. They were retired from the NTC in 2003.

==Development==
In the immediate post-World War II era, the U.S. Army introduced the M41 Walker Bulldog into service to fill the role of a light tank. The lifespan of the M41 was fairly short. At 25 tons it was considered too heavy to be a true light tank, and had a rather short cruising range. Plans were started to build an even lighter replacement mounting the same gun, the T71 and T92. The T92 appeared to be the more promising of the two. As the prototypes were entering testing, information about the new Soviet PT-76 light tank became available. The PT-76 was amphibious, and soon there were demands that any U.S. light tank should be able to swim as well. The T92 could not be easily refitted for this role, so the Army canceled the program in 1958.

In January 1959, the first concept studies were initiated for the armored reconnaissance/airborne assault vehicle that would replace both the M41 and M56 Scorpion self-propelled gun. By October 1959, 12 proposals had been received by the Ordnance Tank Automotive Command. Two proposals were downselected in December: One from Cadillac Motor Car Division of General Motors Corporation, and a joint venture of AAI Corporation and Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. Mockups of both proposals were evaluated in May 1960.

The AAI candidate had three crewmen, and weighed the closest to the 10-ton weight limit specified in the requirements. The Cadillac design was only slightly heavier, with four crew. The three-man turret of the Cadillac proposal was considered more effective than the two-man turret proposed by AAI. The weight limit was reset at 15 tons. In June 1960, Cadillac Motor Car Division signed a contract to develop their concept further, which was designated as the AR/AAV XM551. In August 1961, the Secretary of the Army approved the name &quot;Sheridan,&quot; after Major General Philip Sheridan.


A test bed underwent operations at Cleveland Tank Plant in December 1961. The decision to use the 152 mm caliber XM81 gun-launcher instead of a more conventional gun was driven by the desire to save weight. The XM81 weighed about half as much as the 105 mm caliber M68, and could fire both conventional and missile rounds. Testing of the XM81 began at Erie Army Depot in late 1961.

By 1962, the Army realized that the MGM-51 Shillelagh missile system would not immediately be ready for the Sheridan, and so considered several alternative gun systems. These including conventional 76 mm, 90 mm and 105 mm options, as well as missile systems such as ENTAC and TOW. In March 1967, a 105 mm howitzer XM103E7 and then a 76 mm gun was installed in the turret of an M551 at Rock Island Arsenal. Neither configuration was adopted. The Army ultimately decided to arm the Sheridan with just 152 mm conventional rounds until the Shillelagh was more mature.

The first of 12 pilots was delivered in June 1962. Pilots 1–3 comprised the first generation. With the second-generation pilots 4–6, the band track was replaced with single-pin, link type tracks. An XM551 test bed turret with gun-launcher was mated to an M41 chassis, which began firing tests in August 1962 at Aberdeen Proving Ground. The third generation of pilots, starting with pilot 7, eliminated the water jet propulsion. Pilots 9–11 were delivered in 1964, and pilot 12 was delivered in February 1965.

In the 1960s the Army was also developing the MBT-70 main battle tank with West Germany. The U.S. Army no longer used the heavy, medium, and light tank classifications. In 1960, with the deactivation of its last heavy tank battalion (which used the M103 heavy tank), and the fielding of the new M60 series tank, the U.S. Army had adopted a main battle tank (MBT) doctrine; a single tank filling all combat roles. The U.S. Army still retained the M41 Walker Bulldog light tank in the Army National Guard, but other than the units undergoing the transitional process, the regular army consisted of MBTs. Fearing Congress would balk at funding two developmental tank programs, the Army chose to designate the Sheridan as an armored reconnaissance vehicle rather than a light tank. The Army also believed &quot;tank&quot; too much evoked the main battle tank, a different role altogether, so the new project was instead officially classified as an &quot;Armored Reconnaissance/Airborne Assault Vehicle.&quot;

==Production==

In April 1965 the Army awarded a four-year $114.5 million contract to the Cadillac Gage division of the General Motors (GM) for the production of the M109 howitzer and the XM551 General Sheridan. Limited production was approved in May, and then classified as &quot;Standard A&quot; in May 1966. Production took place at the Cleveland Army Tank Automotive Plant. The first two production units were delivered to the Army in July. During development, the Marine Corps evaluated the Sheridan as a possible replacement for the M50 Ontos. The Corps determined that the Sheridan would be too costly.

The Sheridan entered service in June 1967 with 1st Battalion, 63rd Armor Regiment at Fort Riley. 2,426 Sheridans were planned. In the end, 1,662 Sheridans were built between 1966 and November 1970. The total cost of the M551 program was $1.3 billion. 

The M81 gun had problems with cracks developing near the breech after repeated firing, a problem that was later tracked to the &quot;key&quot; on the missiles that ran in a slot cut into the barrel. Most field units were modified to help address the problem, but later the modified M81E1 was introduced with a shallower slot, along with a matching modification to the missile, that cured the problem. 

In March 1969, after the Army invoked secrecy in declining to disclose program costs, a Government Accounting Office (GAO) official said that development costs had reached $1.3 billion. Congressman Samuel S. Stratton criticized Army officials for the program&#x27;s high costs, and accused officials of concealing cost figures to cover up for their own &quot;bumbling ineptness&quot;. A GAO report leaked in May 1969 revealed the Army had fast-tracked the program to avoid budgetary scrutiny, despite indications by May 1966 that the tank&#x27;s caseless ammunition was prone to cooking off. The problem had since then been resolved by a compressed-air system that forced hot ammunition residue from the breech, the Army told Congress. The Army said the Sheridan had performed well enough that it was planning to send hundreds more. A Congressional report in July 1969 identified $1.2 billion wasted on the M60 and Sheridan. The report attributed several Vietnam War casualties to Sheridan design faults, and said that the tank had been wholly unready for combat there &quot;without extensive and costly retrofits.&quot;

In 1971, Frankford Arsenal awarded Hughes Aircraft Corporation a contract to begin producing the AN/VVG-1 laser rangefinder for the M551A1 upgrade.

==Service history==
===Vietnam War===
The U.S. Army staff in Washington had been recommending since 1966 to the commander of U.S. forces in South Vietnam, General Westmoreland, that the Sheridan should be deployed there. Since the main gun ammunition was not available, he argued that it was simply a $300,000 machine gun platform. By 1968, the new, or soon to be, U.S. commander in South Vietnam, General Creighton Abrams, had been notified that the 152 mm rounds were now available for the Sheridan. However, as General Abrams began to make preparations for the equipping of U.S. cavalry squadrons for the vehicle, the affected squadrons expressed their concerns that the new aluminum tanks were not only highly vulnerable to mines and anti-tank rocket fire, but they would not be as capable of &quot;jungle busting&quot; as the M48A3 medium tanks.

In late 1968, General Abrams met with Colonel George S. Patton IV – the son of World War II General Patton – commander of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (11th ACR), the only full regiment of cavalry in South Vietnam. When Abrams mentioned the cavalry&#x27;s concerns over the new vehicle, Patton recommended that the Sheridans be combat tested by a divisional cavalry squadron as well as a squadron from his own regiment, as the squadrons had completely different missions.

====First deployment====

The first Sheridans arrived in South Vietnam in January 1969 and were accompanied by their factory representatives, instructors and evaluators as the new vehicles were issued to the 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, and the 1st Squadron of the 11th ACR. By the end of 1970, there were more than 200 Sheridans in South Vietnam. They stayed in the field until the last U.S. armored cavalry unit, the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment prepared for re-deployment back to the United States in April 1972. By the end of its combat debut in 1972, the Sheridan had seen extensive action in the Vietnam War, being assigned to nearly all armored cavalry squadrons involved in that conflict.

In 1969, armored cavalry units (minus the 11th ACR, which retained its M48 tank companies) began replacing their M48 Patton tanks, which were normally transferred to the Army of South Vietnam. The opinions of crews on Vietnam-era M551s were mixed at best and assessments from senior commanders were often negative. This was due largely to the high loss rate of Sheridans and casualty rates among crews. Landmines and RPGs that would damage an M48 Patton tank, tended to destroy a Sheridan and either kill or wound most of its crew.

A 1969 evaluation of the vehicles found that the M551 was employed in reconnaissance, night patrol and road clearing, accumulating 39,455 road miles and 520 combat missions, with a ready rate of 81.3 percent. Despite vulnerability to rockets and mines, it was judged worthy of applying modifications and equipping all cavalry squadrons with the Sheridan.

====First combat/first losses====

In addition to the problems presented by aluminum construction, the Sheridan had a defect that no other common armored vehicle possessed: it fired combustible-cased 152 mm main gun rounds. These rounds were &quot;fixed&quot;, meaning that the projectile was firmly attached to the combustible-cased propellant charge, and if the projectile separated from the combustible-case during loading, which was not uncommon, the crewmen were instructed not to load the round. Sometimes, the combustible-cases and their charges remained on the turret floor due to the emergencies at the time, and additionally, all of the remaining serviceable 152 mm rounds were combustible-cased, and sleeved into a re-usable white nine-ply nylon bag, which was form-fitted to hold the combustible-case portion of the round. The white/silver-colored bag had a strap attached to the bottom, which the loader would grab and pull off prior to gently inserting the round into the breech. Once a mine or RPG-type weapon created an ignition source, smoke and fire became imminent, and it became a matter of Standing Operating Procedure to abandon the tank immediately. On 15 February 1969, just one month after the Sheridan&#x27;s arrival in South Vietnam, an M551 from the 3/4th Cavalry detonated a 25-pound pressure-activated land mine, which ruptured its hull and ignited the combustible-case charges of the 152 mm rounds, resulting in a secondary explosion that destroyed the tank. In late 1969, nine Sheridans from the 4th Squadron, 12th Cavalry Regiment were fording a river near the DMZ, when three of the M551s triggered mines, completely destroying them. In March 1971, five Sheridans from the 11th ACR were lost in one day to RPG fire; all five vehicles burst into flames and were totally destroyed.

====Performance====

Over 200 Sheridans were shipped to Vietnam. The Sheridan was unpopular with American soldiers in Vietnam, mainly because of its perceived vulnerability. While the Sheridan brought superior firepower where it was used in lieu of the M113 ACAV, the Sheridan was a poor substitute for the better armored M48 Patton.

The Sheridan had several advantages: it did not get stuck in the mud as often as the 52-ton M48 did, nor did it throw its track off as often. The reliability of the engine system and gun of the tank was, however, not fully up to the task. Of 74 M551 sent to Vietnam in February 1969, by May there were recorded 16 serious mechanical faults, 41 failed shots, 140 defective ammunitions and 25 burned engines; the turret itself had 125 electric faults, several recoil system faults and instances of blown up guns. An additional problem was that much of the carried machine-gun ammunition had to be stored outside the turret as the internal space was extremely limited.

Although an average M48 crew could fire as many as seventeen 90 mm rounds during a &quot;mad minute&quot; (60 seconds with all guns firing on command), the Sheridan was known to put out only two 152 mm rounds during the same time frame. The caseless rounds needed air vents to clear the gun tube and breech prior to loading another round, while the M48 breech block opened as the used case was ejected and closed as the new round was shoved in. The faster the loader, the faster the Patton&#x27;s gun could be fired. For the Sheridan, the loader had to wait for the mechanism. After firing, the loader would have to wait, as the breech slowly opened rearward then turned downward. After another instrument indicated that all turret systems were still operational, the loader would gently push the 152 mm fixed round into the breech and watch the breech block slowly rotate upward, then forward into the breech, then again, wait for the lights.

====Combat field modifications====
A common field modification was to mount a large steel shield, from the M113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle, around the commander&#x27;s 50-cal. (12.7 mm) gun, allowing it to be fired with some level of protection. This evolved into an &quot;armored birdcage&quot;. Anti-mine armor kits composed of spaced aluminum and steel plates were applied to the hull bottom, although only covering from the front to halfway to the end. Later, steel plates were applied to hull sides above the front road wheels. 

Chain-link fencing was applied over the front of the hull in Vietnam to counter rocket-propelled grenades.

===Post–Vietnam War service===
The Army began to phase out the Sheridan in 1978, although at the time there was no real replacement. Nevertheless, the 82d Airborne Division was able to keep them until 1996. The Sheridan was the only &quot;rapidly&quot; air-deployable tank in the inventory. Their units were later upgraded to the M551A1 TTS model, including a thermal sighting system for the commander and gunner.
In the early 1980s, the M551A1 was fitted with a visual modification kit to resemble Warsaw Pact vehicles from Soviet BMP-1, ZSU-23, T-55 to T-80s, at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California. These modified vehicles were used in part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Soviet opposition forces (OPFOR) by providing realistic ground training to U.S. military units about Soviet combat doctrine in a desert environment. The OPFOR Sheridans no longer fulfill that role, having been retired at the end of 2003 and subsequently scrapped or made available as &quot;hard targets&quot; or, in a few cases, as museum pieces. Many were dumped to create artificial reefs.

====Panama====

The Sheridan&#x27;s only air drop in combat occurred during the United States invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause) in 1989, when 14 M551s were deployed with C Company, 3/73rd Armor, 82nd Airborne Division. Four M551s were secretly delivered to Howard Air Force Base in Panama aboard a C-5 Galaxy in November 1989, days before the invasion. They were attached to TF Bayonet (193rd Infantry Brigade), and attached down further to TF Gator. These Sheridans took part in the attack on the Comandancia, initially supported by fire from Quarry Heights, and later displacing forward into the city. As part of Team Armor, these Sheridans later provided support to JSOC elements as they secured high-value targets throughout Panama City. The remaining 10 Sheridans were delivered via C-141 low-velocity airdrop (LVAD) to Torrijos-Tocumen Airport some hours after H-hour. One of these was destroyed after its parachutes failed to deploy, while another was damaged. As of 2009, this marked the first and only combat air-drop of tanks in history.
The Sheridan was praised for its performance in Panama. A U.S. after-action report noted the Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;extreme psychological effect on enemy forces&quot;, who were apparently deterred from firing at U.S. forces reinforced by tanks.

====Gulf War====
In the early days of Desert Shield, Sheridans were airlanded in Saudi Arabia before coalition heavy armor arrived by ship. The first Sheridans sent were the M551A1 model. The Army hastily sent 60 M551A1 TTS models with the thermal sight upgrade to replace the older models. The 3/73rd used the Sheridan as part of a flanking force in Operation Desert Storm, and saw tank-on-tank combat. Their role was limited to reconnaissance due to their age and light armor. It is likely that no more than six Shillelagh missiles were fired at Iraqi anti-tank guns or T-55s; this was the only occasion in which Shillelagh missiles were fired in anger, from the inventory of 88,000 missiles produced. Other than some overheating problems in the summer months of the buildup, the Sheridan suffered no mechanical breakdowns in combat and performed extremely well.

===Australian trials===
During 1967 and 1968 the Australian Army trialed two Sheridans to determine if the type met a requirement for light armored fighting vehicles to serve with the Royal Australian Armoured Corps newly formed cavalry regiments. The main trials took place in the tropical Innisfail area of north Queensland between January and June 1968. In January 1969 the Minister for the Army announced that Australia would not purchase any Sheridans as the tanks did not meet the Army&#x27;s requirements. The main shortcoming revealed in the trials concerned the safety of the combustible case. The two Sheridans were returned to the U.S. Army in early 1969, and the Australian Army met its requirement by fitting turrets from Alvis Saladin armored cars to M113 armored personnel carriers.

== Replacement ==

In 1977, TRADOC commander General Donn A. Starry met with Army Chief of Staff General Edward C. Meyer to convince him that the service should retire the Sheridan. Starry had commanded the 11th ACR in Vietnam, and knew the vehicle&#x27;s shortcomings. Starry&#x27;s arguments prevailed over those of Army Material Command commander General John R. Guthrie, a Sheridan defender, and Meyer agreed the Sheridan would be retired. The Army decided on the M60A1 as the service&#x27;s interim successor until the M3 Bradley was ready. At the time, 567 Sheridans existed in USAREUR, 535 in the continental U.S., and 41 in the Pacific. The Army began converting units in Europe in 1978, and in the rest of the service by 1980. The Army sustained 140 Sheridans in the 82nd Airborne Division and the National Guard. Some Sheridans were kept in pre-positioned reserve.
Several attempts to improve or replace the Sheridan have been made over the years since it was introduced. In 1976, DARPA (followed by TACOM) initiated the High Mobility/Agility (HIMAG) program. Several concepts were pursued, including the High Survivability Test Vehicle (Lightweight) and the Elevated Kinetic Energy (ELKE) gun system. The latter was trialed on a Sheridan hull in 1982. Following the Iran hostage crisis, the Rapid Deployment Force concept was pursued by both the Army and the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps initiated the Mobile Protected Weapon System (MPWS) program. In 1983, the Naval Surface Weapons Research Center Laboratory mounted a 105 mm caliber gun onto a Sheridan chassis. The Army initiated the Mobile Protected Gun program, and announced plans to modify Sheridans with 105 mm or 120 mm caliber guns. Neither program was pursued further; The Army project was canceled in 1985.

From 1978 to 1980, under the joint Army–Marine Corps Advanced Antiarmor Vehicle Evaluation (ARMVAL), TACOM rebuilt 10 Sheridans with the General Motors 8V53T diesel engine and improved suspension. The vehicle&#x27;s armament and some armor was removed. The uprated engine and improved suspension improved the power-to-weight ratio and cross-country mobility. The Army also evaluated a fully stabilized Staget sighting system.

In 1987, the Army tested a version of the LAV-25, classified as the M1047. The Army determined that these were unsuitable for LAPES, and could not match the firepower of the Sheridan. Congress did not favor the M1047, though a few were deployed with the 3/73rd Armor in the Gulf War. The Marine Corps also developed the LAV-105 to meet its requirements, but later canceled that project as well. In 1992, the Army selected FMC Corporation to produce the Armored Gun System (AGS), later type classified as the M8 Armored Gun System. The AGS was canceled in 1996 by the Pentagon before it could enter production. United Defense proposed the AGS as its mobile gun system variant in the Interim Armored Vehicle program. In 2000, the Army instead selected a variant of the General Dynamics LAV III, later type-classified as the M1128 mobile gun system. The Mobile Gun System&#x27;s problematic service history led to the vehicle&#x27;s planned retirement in 2022.

The Army initiated development of a light tank acquisition program called Mobile Protected Firepower, selecting the General Dynamics Land Systems Griffin II in June 2022.. The U.S. Army took delivery of the first production vehicle in February 2024, and the vehicle has been type classified as the M10 Booker.

==Design==
===Armament===
;Primary armament
The 152 mm M81 gun-launcher that came to be used in the Sheridan was developed by Ford-Aeronutronic under a contract awarded by the Army in 1959. The gun&#x27;s primary purpose was to fire the Shillelagh missile, but it could also fire more conventional combustible case ammunition. Two factors contributed to the selection of such a large-caliber gun. The Army desired a gun that would be capable of penetrating 150 mm of armor at 60 degrees, more than the 76 mm guns of the M41 or T92 were capable of. Secondly, the Shillelagh missile housed complicated electronics in addition to its warhead. As a consequence of the pairing of a large caliber gun and relatively lightweight vehicle, only low-velocity rounds would be compatible with the gun.

A number of existing vehicles already mounted only ATGMs, or alternately recoilless rifles like the M50 Ontos, but these typically had limited utility in the infantry support role, or in the case of Ontos could not be reloaded from within the vehicle. The XM551 appeared to offer a superior balance between anti-tank and infantry support. The gun was ideal for infantry support. The large, low velocity gun could fire a large high explosive projectile or canister shot. In comparison, high-velocity anti-tank guns over-penetrated soft targets, while smaller caliber weapons could not carry as great a payload.

The Shillelagh missile system experienced problems with its missile guidance system early in its development. Two problems were identified. First, smoke from the rocket motor disrupted the infrared signal, necessary for guidance, between the tank and missile. A similar issue was identified during conditions where the sun was behind the turret. The first issue was resolved by changing the propellant to a composition that produced less smoke. This and other fixes were successful in resolving the problems with the missile guidance. In a year-long test that concluded in 1964, 58 out of 63 launches were successful.

The M81 fired combustible case conventional ammunition in addition to the Shillelagh missile. This solution was chosen rather than a conventional metal case because the Army desired that the Sheridan use the same ammunition as the MBT-70. In theory the combustible nitrocellulose case would be completely consumed during the firing of the ammunition. In practice, as often as 39 percent of the time, the case could absorb moisture from the air and only be partially consumed. This was dangerous to the crew as the smoldering case could prematurely detonate the next loaded round, as happened three times during five months of testing from November 1966 to March 1967. The cases could also break open, or swell so much with moisture that they could not be chambered. The Army started packaging the rounds in Neoprene bags to reduce the impact of moisture on the combustible case rounds. These were removed by the loader before the round was used. The combustible case was made more durable, and less likely to break, in subsequent generations of ammunition. An open-breach scavenging system using compressed air to blow any debris out of the gun was installed to resolve the issue of smoldering debris in the breach. This created problems of its own as the system could blow smoldering debris into the crew compartment. Recognizing the danger, the Army canceled production of this system. A closed breach system that solved the problem was put into production in 1968. Vehicles without this system, the first 700 off the production line were waylayed in storage pending the installation of this system. The gun with this new system installed was called the M81E1. Sheridans with this system installed carried 29 rounds of ammunition instead of 30 due to space constraints.

The second and even third road wheels could clear off the ground when the main gun fired high-explosive anti-tank rounds. The recoil was so violent that components such as the commander&#x27;s birdcage armor and the searchlight were liable to come off. In the Vietnam War, firing the gun often adversely affected the delicate electronics, which were at the early stages of the transition to solid state devices, so the missile and its guidance system was omitted from vehicles deployed to South Vietnam. The expensive missile was only in the Persian Gulf War&#x27;s Operation Desert Storm, despite a production run of 88,000 units.

;Secondary armament
The commander&#x27;s cupola was armed with a .50 caliber M2HB in a flexible anti-aircraft mount on the turret. Stowage capacity was for 1000 rounds

Early production Sheridans were armed with the 7.62 mm M73 coaxial machine gun. These were soon replaced with the M73E1 model and then the 7.62 mm M219 variant. The M73 and M219 were problematic designs and were replaced by the 7.62 mm M240 machine gun. Stowage capacity was for 3,000 rounds.

Early XM551 pilots had a .50 caliber spotting rifle, and pilot #7 had a 15mm XM122 spotting rifle. Development of spotting rifles was ended when it was decided to eventually install laser rangefinders on the production vehicle.

=== Armor ===
The vehicle had a steel turret and aluminum hull. Although the hull could deflect heavy machine gun fire of up to 12.7 mm AP, it was easily penetrated by rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), which could destroy the vehicle if the spalling contacted the caseless main gun rounds. Like the M113 armored personnel carrier, it was vulnerable to mines.

===Mobility===
====Tactical mobility====
The Sheridan was powered by a large 300-hp (224 kW) Detroit Diesel 6V53T diesel engine, and a &quot;flat track&quot; (no support rollers). The XM551 thus had an excellent power-to-weight ratio and mobility, able to run at speeds up to 72 km/h (45 mph). However, the vehicle proved to be very noisy and early Sheridans were unreliable under combat conditions.
Swimming capability was provided by a flotation screen. The front armor was overlain by folding &quot;surfboard&quot;. This could be opened up into a sloping vertical surface in front of the driver, providing a bow of a boat hull, about level with the top of the turret. Fabric formed the rest of the water barrier, folding up from compartments lining the upper corner where the side met the top of the hull, and held up at the back with poles. The front of the &quot;hull&quot; was provided with a plastic window, but in practice it was found that water splashing onto it made it almost useless, and the driver instead usually had to take steering directions from the vehicle commander. The M2 Bradley adopted a similar solution, but dropped it with upgraded armor. The Sheridan could swim across a river that was about 46 m (50 yards) wide. Tanks in the Patton series (M46, M47, M48), as well as the M60 tank could not perform these operations; they would have to crawl along the river bottoms using snorkels. Not by design, it was found that the swimming hardware acted to reduce the effectiveness of RPG hits. Although it was rarely used in Vietnam, fording was frequently used during Reforger exercises in Europe.

====Strategic mobility====
The Sheridan can be rigged for low-velocity airdrop from C-130 (19,000 kg, 42,000 lb max load), C-141 aircraft (17,460 kg, 38,500 lb max load), and the C-5. Many films exist showing the Sheridan being pulled out of a C-130 Hercules transport by brake chutes and skidding to a stop. The Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES) is a somewhat risky maneuver that allows accurate delivery onto a field when landing is not possible, and the practice was stopped in the late 1990s. The tank is strapped down to a special pallet which absorbs most of the landing impact. The crew does not ride in the tank during extraction, but parachutes from another plane. On landing, they go to their tank, release the lines, and drive it away.

==Variants==
* XM551/M551 - The M551 was the basic production model, beginning production in 1967. The XM551 had been a limited run pre-production model produced in 1965.
** &quot;Two Box&quot; M551 - With the obvious shortcomings of the Shillelagh missile, all but two of the guidance and fire control components of the missile system were removed (the power supply and rate sensor were retained. These were needed for stabilized turret operation.). The resulting additional space was filled with two separate boxes, one for 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition (coaxial machine gun), and one for 12.7×99mm NATO (.50 BMG) ammunition, and the missile stowage was redesigned to accept conventional rounds.
* M551A1 - Upgraded M551 with AN/VVG-1 laser rangefinder.
** M551A1 TTS - Tank Thermal Sight, fitted with the AN/VSG-2B thermal sight unit, similar to the unit used on the M60A3 MBT. This later became standard to all M551A1s.
* M551 NTC - National Training Center. Using M551 hulls, the NTC created a number of mock vehicles for training exercises resembling common Soviet/Warsaw pact types. They were also known as &#x27;vismods&#x27;, short for Visually Modified. They have since been retired in favor of similarly converted M113s and M1 Abrams.
* Armored Tracked Recovery Vehicle (ATRV) - Prototype.

<text>The Ford MGM-51 Shillelagh was an American anti-tank guided missile designed to be launched from a conventional gun (cannon). It was originally intended to be the medium-range portion of a short, medium, and long-range system for armored fighting vehicles in the 1960s and &#x27;70s to defeat future armor without an excessively large gun. Developing a system that could fire both shells and missiles reliably proved complex and largely unworkable for the United States.

It was originally developed for the experimental but never produced MBT-70 tank and served most notably as a primary weapon of the M551 Sheridan light tank, but the missile system was not issued to units serving in South Vietnam and was retired in 1996. It was also used on the M60A2 &quot;Starship&quot;, which was phased out by 1981. Ultimately, very few of the 88,000 rounds produced were ever fired in combat, and the system was largely succeeded by the later BGM-71 TOW wire-guided missile, which was first produced in 1970. Western forces largely gave up on the gun-launched missile concept, although it remains in use on former Soviet Union designs.

The name of the system is that of a traditional wooden club from Ireland.

==Background==
With the rapid increase in armor thickness during World War II, tanks were becoming increasingly able to survive rounds fired from even the largest of World War II-era anti-tank guns. A new generation of guns, notably the British 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7, were able to cope with newer tanks, but it appeared that in another generation the guns needed would be too large to be practical.

To overcome this potential difficulty, the US Army began to favor high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), or shaped charge rounds in the 1950s. A shaped charge&#x27;s penetration is not strongly dependent on the speed of the round, allowing rounds to be fired at much lower velocities, and thus from much lighter guns. They also work better at larger diameters, and a large-diameter low-velocity gun makes for an excellent assault gun that can be mounted on light or medium-weight vehicles. However, the low speed of the round makes it hard to aim over longer distances. The US Army sought to overcome this problem by developing guided missiles that had shaped charge warheads and were accurate beyond a few hundred yards.

==Development==
In 1958, the Army thought that existing knowledge was sufficient to begin work on a guided missile with a HEAT warhead, and in June 1959 Sperry and Ford Aeronutronic were asked for designs to fill the shorter range role. Ford won the contract and started work on the XM13. The first test shots were fired in 1960, and limited production started in 1964. The missile was then known as the MGM-51A.

The basic system was quite advanced for its day. The missile body consisted of a long tube with fold-out fins at the extreme rear, which was propelled from the new M81 gun with a small charge strapped on the rear. Once clear of the gun, the fins popped open and the engine ignited. To keep the missile from spinning while in the gun due to the rifling, a small &quot;key&quot; fitted into a straight groove in the rifled gun. Aiming the missile was simple; the gunner simply kept his gunsight on the target, while electronics in the sighting system tracked the missile optically and sent corrections through an IR link, similarly to a TV remote control. In general the gunners were able to achieve excellent hit rates.

The main problem with the system is firing the main gun with a projectile vs. a missile. The recoil from the gun throws all the missile optics off, limiting the use of the M551 to either anti-tank or bunker buster.

Because the system was so advanced, the development of the Shillelagh was fraught with problems. Ford Aeronutronic underestimated the complexity of the task of designing a missile as advanced as this, and there were major problems with the propellant, igniter, tracker and infrared command link of the missile.

=== Sheridan===
The M81/MGM-51 was first installed on the M551 Sheridan. The Sheridan was a light aluminum-armored AFV designed to be air transportable and provide antitank support for airborne forces. In 1966, the US Army began pressing General Westmoreland to field the tank in South Vietnam, but he declined, stating that with no main gun ammunition, the &quot;Sheridan&quot; was basically nothing more than a $300,000 machine gun platform. In 1968, 152 mm main gun ammo became available, and the Sheridan was deployed to South Vietnam for combat operations in January 1969. Shillelagh missiles did not prove to be a problem in the Vietnam War: they were not used.

The Sheridans&#x27; 152 mm main guns were used in combat operations in Vietnam but proved troublesome. The combustible casings of the 152 mm caseless ammunition rounds did not burn completely, requiring a complicated and slow gas-driven scavenging system. They were also liable to detonate if the vehicle was hit. Firing the gun caused such a large recoil as to result in failures in the delicate missile firing electronics on the tank. These problems, in combination with the lack of suitable targets, resulted in their deployment without the complex missile system.

The Shillelagh was considerably larger than a conventional round, so only a small number could be carried. Typical loads consisted of only nine missiles and twenty M409 HEAT rounds for short-range use. In addition, the missile proved to have a very long &quot;minimum&quot; range. Due to the layout of the vehicle, the missile did not come into the sight of the gun/tracker system until it was from the vehicle, at which point it could start to be guided. Because of its maximum range of about , the system was only effective within a fairly narrow span of combat distances.

While the maximum range of was acceptable, the Army thought that it could and should be improved. Ford received a contract to develop a longer range version in 1963, and returned a slightly larger design the next year. Test firing of the new MGM-51B started the next May, and production began in October 1966. Besides the changes to the missile, the gun was modified. In testing it was found that the key slot in the gun led to cracking after firing only a few shells. After further study, a version with a shallower slot and new barrel was selected, creating the M81E1/MGM-51C.

The new missile was about long, about in diameter, and weighed . It remained in production until 1971, by which time 88,000 had been produced, probably in anticipation of use by main battle tanks (below). Although the U.S. Army denied its usage, it is likely that six Shillelaghs were fired against Iraqi anti-tank guns and targets during Operation Desert Storm, the only usage of the weapon in anger.

===M60A2 &quot;Starship&quot;===

Even with its problems, the system had shown that it could be used by an airborne tank to destroy a main battle tank. The question of whether or not it could fill its original role as the main armament of all tanks was still open. The Army had originally started development of a low-profile turret with a short barrel for their existing M60 tanks in the 1960s, but did not place an order for delivery until 1971, when the main problems with the system had been resolved. The Shillelagh-equipped M60A2s entered service in 1974, but were hampered by reliability problems, and were phased out in 1980. The final revision of the M60A3 used the same 105 mm gun and turret as the M60A1.

===MBT-70===

The most ambitious project based on the Shillelagh was the MBT-70, an advanced US–German tank. Design work on the MBT-70 began in 1963. The tank mounted a huge auto-loader turret on top of a very short chassis, so short that there was no room for a driver in the front hull. Instead of being located in the conventional position, the driver was seated in the turret with the other crew members, in a rotating cupola that kept him facing forward. The gun was a new longer-barreled design, the XM-150, which extended range and performance to the point where it was useful for sabot type rounds as well. However, the project dragged on, and in 1969 the estimated unit cost had risen fivefold. Germany pulled out of the project. The Army proposed a &quot;cut-down&quot; version of the system, the XM-803, but Congress cancelled it in November 1971. It initiated and issued funds to the M1 Abrams project the next month. The M1 design incorporated a conventional gun.

<text>Giovanni Battista Draghi (; 4 January 1710 – 16 or 17 March 1736), usually referred to as Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (), was an Italian Baroque composer, violinist, and organist, leading exponent of the Baroque; he is considered one of the greatest Italian musicians of the first half of the 18th century and one of the most important representatives of the Neapolitan school.

Despite his short life and few years of activity (he died of tuberculosis at the age of 26), he managed to create works of high artistic value and historical importance, among which we remember &quot;La serva padrona&quot; (&quot;The Maid Turned Mistress&quot;), of the highest importance for the development and diffusion of the opera buffa in Europe, &quot;L&#x27;Olimpiade&quot;, considered one of the masterpieces of the opera seria of the first half of the eighteenth century, and the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;, among the most important works of sacred music of all time.

==Biography==
Born in Jesi in what is now the Province of Ancona (but was then part of the Papal States), he was commonly given the nickname &quot;Pergolesi&quot;, a demonym indicating in Italian the residents of Pergola, Marche, the birthplace of his ancestors. He studied music in Jesi under a local musician, Francesco Santi, before going to Naples in 1725, where he studied under Gaetano Greco and Francesco Feo among others. On leaving the conservatory in 1731, he won some renown by performing the oratorio in two parts &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Phoenix on the Pyre, or The Death of Saint Joseph&quot;), and the &quot;dramma sacro&quot; in three acts, &quot;Li prodigi della divina grazia nella conversione e morte di san Guglielmo duca d’Aquitania&quot; (&quot;The Miracles of Divine Grace in the Conversion and Death of Saint William, Duke of Aquitaine&quot;). He spent most of his brief life working for aristocratic patrons such as Ferdinando Colonna, Prince of Stigliano, and Domenico Marzio Carafa, Duke of Maddaloni.

Pergolesi was one of the most important early composers of &quot;opera buffa&quot; (comic opera). His &quot;opera seria&quot;, &quot;Il prigionier superbo&quot;, contained the two-act &quot;buffa&quot; intermezzo, &quot;La serva padrona&quot; (&quot;The Servant Mistress&quot;, 28 August 1733), which became a very popular work in its own right. When it was performed in Paris in 1752, it prompted the so-called Querelle des Bouffons (&quot;quarrel of the comic actors&quot;) between supporters of serious French opera by the likes of Jean-Baptiste Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau and supporters of new Italian comic opera. Pergolesi was held up as a model of the Italian style during this quarrel, which divided Paris&#x27;s musical community for two years.

Among Pergolesi&#x27;s other operatic works are his first opera seria &quot;La Salustia&quot; (1732), &quot;Lo frate &#x27;nnamorato&quot; (&quot;The brother in love&quot;, 1732, to a text in the Neapolitan language), &quot;L&#x27;Olimpiade&quot; (January 1735) and &quot;Il Flaminio&quot; (1735, to a text in the Neapolitan language). All his operas were premiered in Naples, apart from &quot;L&#x27;Olimpiade&quot;, which was first given in Rome.

Pergolesi also wrote sacred music, including a Mass in F and three &quot;Salve Regina&quot; settings. The Lenten Hymn &#x27;God of Mercy and Compassion&#x27; by Redemptorist priest Edmund Vaughan is most commonly set to a tune adapted by Pergolesi. It is his &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; (1736), however, for soprano, alto, string orchestra and basso continuo, which is his best-known sacred work. It was commissioned by the Confraternita dei Cavalieri di San Luigi di Palazzo, which presented an annual Good Friday meditation in honour of the Virgin Mary. Pergolesi&#x27;s work replaced the one composed by Alessandro Scarlatti in 1724, but which was already perceived as &quot;old-fashioned,&quot; so rapidly had public tastes changed. While classical in scope, the opening section of the setting demonstrates Pergolesi&#x27;s mastery of the Italian baroque &quot;durezze e ligature&quot; style, characterized by numerous suspensions over a faster, conjunct bassline. The work remained popular, becoming the most frequently printed musical work of the 18th century, and being arranged by a number of other composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach, who reorchestrated and adapted it for a non-Marian text in his cantata &quot;Tilge, Höchster, meine Sünden&quot; (&quot;Root out my sins, Highest One&quot;), BWV 1083.

Pergolesi wrote a number of secular instrumental works, including a violin sonata and a violin concerto. A considerable number of instrumental and sacred works once attributed to Pergolesi have since been shown to be misattributed. Many colourful anecdotes related by Pergolesi&#x27;s 19th-century biographer Francesco Florimo were later revealed as hoaxes.

Pergolesi died on 16 or 17 March 1736 at the age of 26 in Pozzuoli from tuberculosis and was buried at the Franciscan monastery one day later.

Pergolesi was the subject of a 1932 Italian film biopic &quot;Pergolesi&quot;. It was directed by Guido Brignone with Elio Steiner playing the role of the composer.

== Legend and posthumous fame ==
In life, despite numerous awards, Pergolesi&#x27;s fame was almost exclusively limited to the Neapolitan and Roman musical milieu. Nonetheless, he has influenced poets and artists who, during the 19th century, reinterpreted the composer in a romantic light.

As the historian and traveler Charles Burney wrote: 
Indeed, the myth that was born throughout Europe around his life and work after his death represents an exceptional phenomenon in the history of music. Mozart will experience a similar phenomenon after his death. Thus, more than three hundred works have been attributed to him, of which only about thirty have been recognized by modern critics as true Pergolesi&#x27;s compositions, a phenomenon which testifies the reputation of the composer.

However, already in the middle of the 18th century Pergolesi was immensely better known than he had been in life: as mentioned, the numerous prints of his compositions began to spread throughout Europe. Several years after Pergolesi&#x27;s death, the performance in Paris, in 1752, of &quot;La Serva padrona&quot; by an Italian comic opera troupe, triggered the famous Querelle des Bouffons between the defenders of French music and the supporters of the opera buffa. For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in particular, the freshness and the grace of his music was the dazzling demonstration of the superiority of Italian opera over French lyric tragedy. The French composer André Grétry said: Above all, the scarcity of tangible information about his life and works was fertile ground for the flourishing of imaginative anecdotes of all kinds. The doubt crept in that his tragic end was due not to natural causes but to poisoning by musicians envious of his talent. Apollonian beauty and numerous tragic loves were attributed to him.

Because of this extraordinary posthumous fame, the catalog of his works had an unpredictable destiny: during the 18th century and 19th century spread in Europe the practice of publishing under his name, for the purpose of speculation, any score having the musical style of the Neapolitan school. By the end of the 19th century, this led to over five hundred compositions in the &quot;informal&quot; catalog of his works. Contemporary studies have reduced Pergolesi&#x27;s compositions to less than fifty, and of these only twenty-eight are the works whose paternity is considered sure.

There are still serious doubts about the attribution of various works, even among the best known, such as the &quot;Salve Regina in F minor&quot;. Several music and record editions perpetuate these uncertainties about the authorship of various compositions, publishing in his name compositions certainly produced by other authors, such as the arias &quot;Se tu m&#x27;ami&quot; (certainly composed by the musicologist Alessandro Parisotti in the second half of the 19th century and included in one of his collections of baroque arias under the name of Pergolesi) and &quot;Tre giorni son che Nina&quot; (attributed to Vincenzo Legrenzio Ciampi) or the &quot;Magnificat&quot; in D major, composed by his teacher Francesco Durante.

The situation of extreme uncertainty that distinguishes the catalog of Pergolesi&#x27;s works can be easily described with the case of &quot;Pulcinella&quot; by Igor Stravinsky: composed in 1920 as a tribute to the style of the composer from Jesi, the most recent music critics have established that of the 21 pieces used for this composition, as many as 11 are to be attributed to other authors (mainly Domenico Gallo), two are of dubious attribution and only eight (mostly taken from his operas) can be attributed to Pergolesi.

==Pergolesi&#x27;s works on screen==
Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;Salve Regina&quot; is a highlighted performance in the movie &quot;Farinelli&quot; (1994), in which Farinelli also performs &quot;Stabat Mater Dolorosa&quot; in the only duet. The first and last parts of Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; were used in the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Jesus of Montreal (Jésus de Montréal)&quot; (1989); the fifth part (&quot;Quis est homo&quot;) was used in the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Smilla&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; (1997); the last part was also used in the movie &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984) and in the movie &quot;The Mirror&quot; (1975) by Andrei Tarkovsky. The film &quot;Cactus&quot; (1986) by the Australian director Paul Cox also features Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; on the soundtrack. &quot;Nothing Left Unsaid&quot;, a 2016 documentary on Gloria Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper, used the last movement (&quot;Quando Corpus / Amen&quot;) of Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;.

==Works==
The standard catalogue of Pergolesi&#x27;s works was produced by Marvin Paymer in 1977, ascribing a unique P number to each item so that – for example – the well-known &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; is P.77.

<text>BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross or bike motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general street or off-road recreation.

== History ==
BMX began during the early 1970s in the United States when children began racing their bicycles on dirt tracks in southern California, inspired by the motocross stars of the time. The size and availability of the Schwinn Sting-Ray and other wheelie bikes made them the natural bike of choice for these races, since they were easily customized for better handling and performance. BMX racing was a phenomenon by the mid-1970s. Children were racing standard road bikes off-road around purpose-built tracks in California.

The motorcycle racing documentary &quot;On Any Sunday&quot; (1971) is generally credited with inspiring the movement nationally in the United States; its opening scene shows kids riding their Sting-Rays off-road. By the middle of that decade, the sport achieved critical mass, and manufacturers began creating bicycles designed especially for the sport.

===US timeline===
In 1974, George E. Esser founded the National Bicycle League as a non-profit bicycle motocross sanctioning organization. Before they set up the NBL, Esser and his wife, Mary, sanctioned motorcycle races with the American Motocross Association (AMA). Their two sons, Greg and Brian, raced motorcycles, but also enjoyed riding and racing BMX with their friends. It was their sons&#x27; interest, and the lack of BMX organizations in the East, which prompted Esser to start the NBL in Florida.

By 1977, the American Bicycle Association (ABA) was organized as a national sanctioning body for the growing sport.

Freestyle BMX is now one of the staple events at the annual Summer X Games Extreme Sports competition and the Etnies Backyard Jam, held primarily on the East and West coasts of the United States. The popularity of the sport has increased due to its relative ease and availability of places to ride and do tricks.

===UK BMX explosion===
In the UK, BMX was a craze which took off in the early 1980s, specifically 1982 and 1983, when the BMX bike became the must-have bicycle for children and teenagers. The 1983 cult movie &quot;BMX Bandits&quot; helped establish the sport further worldwide. Previously a small niche area, BMX exploded at this time into the dominant bicycle for the younger rider, with older teenagers and even adults becoming known names through publications like &quot;BMX Bi-Weekly&quot;, featuring big names like Tim March and Andy Ruffell. The shift to freestyle from racing came in 1985 with popular styling moving from chrome frames and contrasting components in black blue or red being the norm, to brightly coloured bikes in one colour only, including their magnesium alloy wheels and even matching tyres. Because BMX exploded into Britain&#x27;s streets so suddenly, it was perhaps inevitable that it would implode with similar speed, when the children who rode the bikes left school and went to work. By 1986–1987, sales in the UK had dropped off dramatically, with the new all-terrain bike or mountain bike (another trend from mid-1970s California) taking off, soon to become the most popular adult bicycle.

In 1980, the first BMX track in the UK was founded in Landseer Park, Ipswich, by the Ipswich BMX Club, which still provides coaching and races on a regular basis.

==International development==

In April 1981, the International BMX Federation was founded, and the first world championships were held in 1982. Since January 1993, BMX has been integrated into the Union Cycliste Internationale.

In 2003, the International Olympic Committee made BMX a medal Olympic sport for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, China, and Māris Štrombergs (male, for Latvia) and Anne-Caroline Chausson (female, for France) became the first Olympic champions.

Many talented BMX riders go on to other cycling sports like downhill, including Australian Olympian Jared Graves, Eric Carter and youth BMX racer Aaron Gwin. Multiple world and Olympic champion track sprinter Chris Hoy also began as a BMX rider.

<doc id="38106" wikidata="Q124425734" url="?curid=38106" title="Actual infinity">
<text>In the philosophy of mathematics, the abstraction of actual infinity, also called completed infinity, involves infinite entities as given, actual and completed objects. 

The concept of actual infinity has been introduced in mathematics near the end of the 19th century by Georg Cantor, with his theory of infinite sets, later formalized into Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. This theory, which is presently commonly accepted as a foundation of mathematics, contains the axiom of infinity, which means that the natural numbers form a set (necessarily infinite). A great discovery of Cantor is that, if one accepts infinite sets, then there are different sizes (cardinalities) of infinite sets, and, in particular, the cardinal of the continuum of the real numbers is strictly larger than the cardinal of the natural numbers.

Actual infinity is to be contrasted with potential infinity, in which an endless process (such as &quot;add 1 to the previous number&quot;) produces a sequence with no last element, and where each individual result is finite and is achieved in a finite number of steps. This type of process occurs in mathematics, for instance, in standard formalizations of the notions of an infinite series, infinite product, or limit.

== Anaximander ==

The ancient Greek term for the potential or improper infinite was &quot;apeiron&quot; (unlimited or indefinite), in contrast to the actual or proper infinite &quot;aphorismenon&quot;. &quot;Apeiron&quot; stands opposed to that which has a &quot;peras&quot; (limit). These notions are today denoted by &quot;potentially infinite&quot; and &quot;actually infinite&quot;, respectively.

Anaximander (610–546 BC) held that the&quot; apeiron&quot; was the principle or main element composing all things. Clearly, the &#x27;apeiron&#x27; was some sort of basic substance. Plato&#x27;s notion of the &quot;apeiron&quot; is more abstract, having to do with indefinite variability. The main dialogues where Plato discusses the &#x27;apeiron&#x27; are the late dialogues &quot;Parmenides&quot; and the &quot;Philebus&quot;.

==Aristotle==
Aristotle sums up the views of his predecessors on infinity as follows:
&quot;Only the Pythagoreans place the infinite among the objects of sense (they do not regard number as separable from these), and assert that what is outside the heaven is infinite. Plato, on the other hand, holds that there is no body outside (the Forms are not outside because they are nowhere), yet that the infinite is present not only in the objects of sense but in the Forms also.&quot; (Aristotle)

The theme was brought forward by Aristotle&#x27;s consideration of the apeiron—in the context of mathematics and physics (the study of nature):

&quot;Infinity turns out to be the opposite of what people say it is. It is not &#x27;that which has nothing beyond itself&#x27; that is infinite, but &#x27;that which always has something beyond itself&#x27;.&quot; (Aristotle)Belief in the existence of the infinite comes mainly from five considerations:
# From the nature of time – for it is infinite.
# From the division of magnitudes – for the mathematicians also use the notion of the infinite.
# If coming to be and passing away do not give out, it is only because that from which things come to be is infinite.
# Because the limited always finds its limit in something, so that there must be no limit, if everything is always limited by something different from itself.
# Most of all, a reason which is peculiarly appropriate and presents the difficulty that is felt by everybody – not only number but also mathematical magnitudes and what is outside the heaven are supposed to be infinite because they never give out in our thought. (Aristotle)

Aristotle postulated that an actual infinity was impossible, because if it were possible, then something would have attained infinite magnitude, and would be &quot;bigger than the heavens.&quot; However, he said, mathematics relating to infinity was not deprived of its applicability by this impossibility, because mathematicians did not need the infinite for their theorems, just a finite, arbitrarily large magnitude.

===Aristotle&#x27;s potential–actual distinction===
Aristotle handled the topic of infinity in &quot;Physics&quot; and in &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. He distinguished between &quot;actual&quot; and &quot;potential&quot; infinity. &quot;Actual infinity&quot; is completed and definite, and consists of infinitely many elements. &quot;Potential infinity&quot; is never complete: elements can be always added, but never infinitely many.

Aristotle distinguished between infinity with respect to addition and division.

&quot;As an example of a potentially infinite series in respect to increase, one number can always be added after another in the series that starts 1,2,3... but the process of adding more and more numbers cannot be exhausted or completed.&quot;With respect to division, a potentially infinite sequence of divisions might start, for example, 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, but the process of division cannot be exhausted or completed.

Aristotle also argued that Greek mathematicians knew the difference among the actual infinite and a potential one, but they &quot;do not need the [actual] infinite and do not use it&quot; (&quot;Phys.&quot; III 2079 29).

==Scholastic, Renaissance and Enlightenment thinkers==
The overwhelming majority of scholastic philosophers adhered to the motto &quot;Infinitum actu non datur&quot;. This means there is only a (developing, improper, &quot;syncategorematic&quot;) &quot;potential infinity&quot; but not a (fixed, proper, &quot;categorematic&quot;) &quot;actual infinity&quot;. There were exceptions, however, for example in England.

It is well known that in the Middle Ages all scholastic philosophers advocate Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;infinitum actu non datur&quot; as an irrefutable principle. (G. Cantor)

Actual infinity exists in number, time and quantity. (J. Baconthorpe [9, p. 96])

During the Renaissance and by early modern times the voices in favor of actual infinity were rather rare.

The continuum actually consists of infinitely many indivisibles (G. Galilei [9, p. 97])

I am so in favour of actual infinity. (G.W. Leibniz [9, p. 97])

However, the majority of pre-modern thinkers agreed with the well-known quote of Gauss:

I protest against the use of infinite magnitude as something completed, which is never permissible in mathematics. Infinity is merely a way of speaking, the true meaning being a limit which certain ratios approach indefinitely close, while others are permitted to increase without restriction. (C.F. Gauss [in a letter to Schumacher, 12 July 1831])

== Modern era ==
Actual infinity is now commonly accepted in mathematics, although the term is no longer in use, being replaced by the concept of infinite sets. This drastic change was initialized by Bolzano and Cantor in the 19th century, and was one of the origins of the foundational crisis of mathematics.

Bernard Bolzano, who introduced the notion of &quot;set&quot; (in German: &quot;Menge&quot;), and Georg Cantor, who introduced set theory, opposed the general attitude. Cantor distinguished three realms of infinity: (1) the infinity of God (which he called the &quot;absolutum&quot;), (2) the infinity of reality (which he called &quot;nature&quot;) and (3) the transfinite numbers and sets of mathematics.

A multitude which is larger than any finite multitude, i.e., a multitude with the property that every finite set [of members of the kind in question] is only a part of it, I will call an infinite multitude. (B. Bolzano [2, p. 6])

Accordingly I distinguish an eternal uncreated infinity or absolutum, which is due to God and his attributes, and a created infinity or transfinitum, which has to be used wherever in the created nature an actual infinity has to be noticed, for example, with respect to, according to my firm conviction, the actually infinite number of created individuals, in the universe as well as on our earth and, most probably, even in every arbitrarily small extended piece of space. (Georg Cantor) (G. Cantor [8, p. 252])

The numbers are a free creation of human mind. (R. Dedekind [3a, p. III])

One proof is based on the notion of God. First, from the highest perfection of God, we infer the possibility of the creation of the transfinite, then, from his all-grace and splendor, we infer the necessity that the creation of the transfinite in fact has happened. (G. Cantor [3, p. 400])

Cantor distinguished two types of actual infinity, the transfinite and the absolute, about which he affirmed:
These concepts are to be strictly differentiated, insofar the former is, to be sure, &quot;infinite&quot;, yet capable of &quot;increase&quot;, whereas the latter is &quot;incapable of increase&quot; and is therefore &quot;indeterminable&quot; as a mathematical concept. This mistake we find, for example, in &quot;Pantheism&quot;. (G. Cantor, &quot;Über verschiedene Standpunkte in bezug auf das aktuelle Unendliche&quot;, in &quot;Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts&quot;, pp. 375, 378)

== Current mathematical practice ==
Actual infinity is now commonly accepted in mathematics under the name &quot;infinite set&quot;. Indeed, set theory has been formalized as the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF). One of the axioms of ZF is the axiom of infinity, that essentially says that the natural numbers form a set. 

All mathematics has been rewritten in terms of ZF. In particular, line, curves, all sort of spaces are defined as the set of their points. Infinite sets are so common, that when one considers finite sets, this is generally explicitly stated; for example finite geometry, finite field, etc.

Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is a theorem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, which has been proved only more than 350 years later. The original Wiles&#x27;s proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, used not only the full power of ZF with the axiom of choice, but used implicitly a further axiom that implies the existence of very large sets. The requirement of this further axiom has been later dismissed, but infinite sets remains used in a fundamental way. This was not an obstacle for the recognition of the correctness of the proof by the community of mathematicians.

==Opposition from the Intuitionist school==
The mathematical meaning of the term &quot;actual&quot; in actual infinity is synonymous with definite, completed, extended or existential,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleene 1952/1971:48.&quot;&gt;Kleene 1952/1971:48.&lt;/ref&gt; but not to be mistaken for &quot;physically existing&quot;. The question of whether natural or real numbers form definite sets is therefore independent of the question of whether infinite things exist physically in nature.

Proponents of intuitionism, from Kronecker onwards, reject the claim that there are actually infinite mathematical objects or sets. Consequently, they reconstruct the foundations of mathematics in a way that does not assume the existence of actual infinities. On the other hand, constructive analysis does accept the existence of the completed infinity of the integers.

For intuitionists, infinity is described as &quot;potential&quot;; terms synonymous with this notion are &quot;becoming&quot; or &quot;constructive&quot;. For example, Stephen Kleene describes the notion of a Turing machine tape as &quot;a linear &#x27;tape&#x27;, (potentially) infinite in both directions.&quot; To access memory on the tape, a Turing machine moves a &quot;read head&quot; along it in finitely many steps: the tape is therefore only &quot;potentially&quot; infinite, since — while there is always the ability to take another step — infinity itself is never actually reached.

Mathematicians generally accept actual infinities. Georg Cantor is the most significant mathematician who defended actual infinities. He decided that it is possible for natural and real numbers to be definite sets, and that if one rejects the axiom of Euclidean finiteness (that states that actualities, singly and in aggregates, are necessarily finite), then one is not involved in any contradiction.

The present-day conventional finitist interpretation of ordinal and cardinal numbers is that they consist of a collection of special symbols, and an associated formal language, within which statements may be made. All such statements are necessarily finite in length. The soundness of the manipulations is founded only on the basic principles of a formal language: term algebras, term rewriting, and so on. More abstractly, both (finite) model theory and proof theory offer the needed tools to work with infinities. One does not have to &quot;believe&quot; in infinity in order to write down algebraically valid expressions employing symbols for infinity.

==Modern set theory==
The philosophical problem of actual infinity concerns whether the notion is coherent and epistemically sound.

Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory is presently the standard foundation of mathematics. One of its axioms is the axiom of infinity that states that there exist infinite sets, and in particular that the natural numbers form an infinite set. However, some finitist philosophers of mathematics and constructivists still object to the notion.

<text>Keep the Aspidistra Flying, first published in 1936, is a socially critical novel by George Orwell set in 1930s London. The main theme is Gordon Comstock&#x27;s romantic ambition to defy worship of the money-god and status, and the dismal life that results.

==Background==

Orwell wrote the book in 1934 and 1935 while he was living at various locations near Hampstead in London, and drew on his experiences in these and the preceding few years. At the beginning of 1928 he lived in lodgings in Portobello Road from where he started his tramping expeditions, sleeping rough and roaming the poorer parts of London. At this time he wrote a fragment of a play in which the protagonist Stone needs money for a life-saving operation for his child. Stone would prefer to prostitute his wife rather than prostitute his artistic integrity by writing advertising copy.

Orwell&#x27;s early writings appeared in &quot;The Adelphi&quot;, a left-wing literary journal edited by Sir Richard Rees, a wealthy and idealistic baronet who made Orwell one of his protégés. The character of Ravelston, the wealthy publisher in &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, has a lot in common with Rees. Ravelston is acutely self-conscious about his upper-class status and defensive about his unearned income. Comstock speculates that Ravelston receives nearly two thousand pounds a year after tax — a very comfortable sum in those days — and Rees, in a volume of autobiography published in 1963, wrote: &quot;I have never had the spending of much less than £1,000 a year of unearned income, and sometimes considerably more. ... Before the war, this was wealth, especially for an unmarried man. Many of my socialist and intellectual friends were paupers compared to me ...&quot; In quoting this, Orwell&#x27;s biographer Michael Shelden comments that &quot;One of these &#x27;paupers&#x27; — at least in 1935 — was Orwell, who was lucky if he made £200 that year. ... He appreciated Rees&#x27;s editorial support at the &quot;Adelphi&quot; and sincerely enjoyed having him as a friend, but he could not have avoided feeling some degree of resentment toward a man who had no real job but who enjoyed an income four or five times greater than his.&quot;

In 1932 Orwell took a job as a teacher in a small school in West London. From there he visited Burnham Beeches and other places in the countryside. There are allusions to Burnham Beeches and walks in the country in Orwell&#x27;s correspondence with Brenda Salkeld and Eleanor Jacques at this time.

In October 1934, after Orwell had spent nine months at his parents&#x27; home in Southwold, his aunt Nellie Limouzin found him a job as a part-time assistant at Booklovers&#x27; Corner, a second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope. The Westropes, who were friends of Nellie in the Esperanto movement, had an easygoing outlook and provided Orwell with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was job sharing with Jon Kimche, who also lived with the Westropes. Orwell worked at the shop in the afternoons, having the mornings free to write and the evenings to socialise. He was at Booklovers&#x27; Corner for fifteen months. In his essay &quot;Bookshop Memories&quot;, published in November 1936, he recalled aspects of his time at the bookshop, and in &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; &quot;he described it, or revenged himself upon it, with acerbity and wit and spleen&quot;. 

In their study of Orwell the writers Stansky and Abrahams remark upon the improvement on the &quot;stumbling attempts at female portraiture in his first two novels: the stereotyped Elizabeth Lackersteen in &quot;Burmese Days&quot; and the hapless Dorothy in &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;,&quot; and contend that, in contrast, &quot;Rosemary is a credible female portrait&quot;. Through his work in the bookshop Orwell was in a position to become acquainted with women, &quot;first as a clerk, then as a friend&quot;, and found that, &quot;if circumstances were favourable, he might eventually embark upon a &#x27;relationship&#x27; ... This, for Orwell the author and Blair the man, was the chief reward of working at Booklovers&#x27; Corner.&quot; In particular, Orwell met Sally Jerome, who was then working for an advertising agency (like Rosemary in &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;), and Kay Ekevall, who ran a small typing and secretarial service that worked for the &quot;Adelphi&quot;.

By the end of February 1935 Orwell had moved into a flat in Parliament Hill; his landlady, Rosalind Obermeyer, was studying at the University of London. It was through a joint party with his landlady that Orwell met his future wife, Eileen O&#x27;Shaughnessy. In August Orwell moved into a flat in Kentish Town, which he shared with Michael Sayers and Rayner Heppenstall. Over this period he was working on &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, and had two novels, &quot;Burmese Days&quot; and &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, published. At the beginning of 1936 Orwell was dealing with pre-publication issues for &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; while he was touring the North of England collecting material for &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;. The novel was published by Victor Gollancz Ltd on 20 April 1936.

==Title==
The aspidistra is a hardy, long-living plant that has been used as a house plant in England, and which can grow to an impressive, even unwieldy size. It was especially popular in the Victorian era, in large part because it could tolerate not only weak sunlight but also the poor indoor air quality that resulted from the use of oil lamps and, later, coal gas lamps. Aspidistras had fallen out of favour by the 20th century, following the advent of electric lighting, but their use had been so widespread among the middle class that they had become a music hall joke, appearing in songs such as &quot;Biggest Aspidistra in the World&quot;, of which Gracie Fields made a recording.

In the titular phrase Orwell uses the aspidistra, a symbol of the stuffiness of middle-class society, in conjunction with the locution &quot;to keep the flag (or colours) flying.&quot; The title can thus be interpreted as a sarcastic exhortation in the sense of &quot;Hooray for the middle class!&quot;

Orwell also used the phrase in his previous novel &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1935), where a character sings the words to the tune of the German national anthem.

In subsequent adaptations and translations the original title has frequently been altered; in German, to the equivalent of &quot;The Joys of the Aspidistra&quot;, in Spanish to &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Aspidistra Die&quot;, in Italian to &quot;May the Aspidistra Bloom&quot;, in Dutch to &quot;Keep the Sanseveria High&quot;. The 1997 film adaptation was released in the United States as &quot;A Merry War&quot;.

&quot;Keep the aspidistra flying!&quot; is the final line of &quot;Nexus&quot; by Henry Miller, published in 1959. Orwell owned some of Miller&#x27;s works while he was working at Booklovers&#x27; Corner. The books were banned in the UK at the time.

==Plot summary==
Gordon Comstock has &quot;declared war&quot; on what he sees as an &quot;overarching dependence&quot; on money by leaving a promising job as a copywriter for an advertising company called New Albion — at which he shows great dexterity — and taking a low-paying job instead, ostensibly so that he can write poetry. Coming from a respectable family background in which the inherited wealth has been dissipated, Gordon resents having to work for a living. The &quot;war&quot; and the poetry are not going well and, under the stress of his &quot;self-imposed exile&quot; from affluence, Gordon has become absurd, pettyminded and deeply neurotic.

Comstock lives without luxuries in a bedsit in London, which he affords by working in a small bookshop owned by a Scot, McKechnie. He works intermittently on a &quot;magnum opus&quot;, a long poem that he plans to call &quot;London Pleasures&quot;; meanwhile, copies of his only published work, a slim volume of poetry entitled &quot;Mice&quot;, collect dust on the remainder shelf. He is simultaneously content with his meagre existence and disdainful of it. He lives without financial ambition or the need for a &quot;good job&quot;, but his living conditions are uncomfortable and his job is boring.

Comstock is &quot;obsessed&quot; by what he sees as the pervasiveness of money (the &quot;Money God&quot;, as he calls it) behind social relationships, feeling sure that women would find him more attractive if he was better off. At the beginning of the novel he senses that his girlfriend, Rosemary Waterlow, whom he met at New Albion and who continues to work there, is dissatisfied with him because of his poverty. An example of his financial embarrassment occurs when he is desperate for a pint of beer at his local pub, but has run out of money and is ashamed to cadge a drink off his fellow lodger, Flaxman.

One of Comstock&#x27;s last remaining friends, Philip Ravelston, a Marxist who publishes a magazine called &quot;Anti-Christ&quot;, agrees with Comstock in principle, but is comfortably well-off himself. This causes strains when the practical miseries of Comstock&#x27;s life become apparent. Ravelston does, however, endeavour to publish some of Comstock&#x27;s work and his efforts, unbeknown to Comstock, resulted in &quot;Mice&quot; being published via one of his publisher contacts.

Gordon and Rosemary have little time together — she works late and lives in a hostel, and his &quot;bitch of a landlady&quot; forbids female visitors to her tenants. Then, one evening, having headed southward and having been thinking about &quot;this women business&quot; in general and Rosemary in particular, Gordon happens to see Rosemary in a street market. Rosemary refuses to have sex with him, but she wants to spend a Sunday with him, right out in the country, near Burnham Beeches. At their parting, as he takes the tram from Tottenham Court Road back to his bedsit, he is happy and feels that somehow it is agreed between them that Rosemary is going to be his mistress. However, what was intended as a pleasant day out away from London&#x27;s grime turns into a disaster when, though they are hungry, they opt to pass by a &quot;rather low-looking&quot; pub, and then, not able to find another pub, are forced to eat an unappetising lunch at an overpriced fancy hotel. Gordon has to pay the bill with all the money he had set aside for their jaunt and worries about having to borrow money from Rosemary. Out in the countryside again, they are about to have sex for the first time when she violently pushes him back because he was not going to use contraception. He rails at her: &quot;Money again, you see! ... You say you &#x27;can&#x27;t&#x27; have a baby. ... You mean you daren&#x27;t; because you&#x27;d lose your job and I&#x27;ve got no money and all of us would starve.&quot;

Having sent a poem to an American publication, Gordon suddenly receives from them a cheque worth ten pounds, a considerable sum for him at the time (£10 in 1934 equates to £592.20 in 2023.). He intends to set aside half for his sister Julia, who has always given him money and support. He treats Rosemary and Ravelston to dinner: it begins well, but deteriorates as Gordon, drunk, tries to force himself on Rosemary. She angrily rebukes him and leaves. Gordon continues drinking, drags Ravelston with him to visit a pair of prostitutes, and ends up broke and in a police cell the next morning. He is guilt-ridden over the thought of being unable to pay his sister back the money he owes her, because his five-pound note has been given to, or stolen by, one of the prostitutes.

After Gordon makes a brief appearance before the magistrate Ravelston pays Gordon&#x27;s fine, but a reporter writes about the case in the local paper. The ensuing publicity results in Gordon losing his job at the bookshop. As he searches for another job, his life and his poetry stagnate. After living with his friend Ravelston, Gordon ends up working, this time in Lambeth, at another bookshop and lending library owned by the sinister Mr Cheeseman, where he is paid thirty shillings a week, ten shillings less than he was earning before. Yet Gordon is satisfied: &quot;The job would do. There was no &quot;trouble&quot; about a job like this; no room for ambition, no effort, no hope.&quot; Determined to sink to the lowest level of society, Gordon takes a furnished bed-sitting-room in a filthy alley parallel to Lambeth Cut. Both Julia and Rosemary, &quot;in feminine league against him&quot;, seek to get Gordon to go back to his &quot;good&quot; job at the New Albion advertising agency.

Rosemary, having avoided Gordon for some time, suddenly comes to visit him one day at his dismal lodgings. Despite his terrible poverty and shabbiness, they have sex, but it is without any emotion or passion. Later, Rosemary drops in one day unexpectedly at the library, having not been in touch with Gordon for some time, and tells him that she is pregnant. Since she and Gordon reject the idea of an abortion (which would have been both illegal and dangerous at that time), Gordon is presented with the choice between leaving Rosemary to a life of social shame at the hands of her family or marrying her and returning to a life of respectability by taking back the job at the New Albion agency that he once so deplored.

Gordon chooses Rosemary and respectability, and experiences relief at having abandoned his anti-money principles with such comparative ease. After two years of abject failure and poverty, he throws his poetic work &quot;London Pleasures&quot; down a drain, marries Rosemary, resumes his advertising career and plunges into a campaign to promote a new product to prevent foot odour. In his lonely walks around mean streets, aspidistras seem to appear in every lower-middle class window. As the book closes, Gordon wins an argument with Rosemary to install an aspidistra in their new small but comfortable flat off the Edgware Road.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Cyril Connolly wrote two reviews at the time of the novel&#x27;s publication. In the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; he described it as a &quot;savage and bitter book&quot;, and wrote that &quot;the truths which the author propounds are so disagreeable that one ends by dreading their mention&quot;. In the &quot;New Statesman&quot; he wrote that it gave &quot;a harrowing and stark account of poverty&quot;, and referred to its &quot;clear and violent language, at times making the reader feel he is in a dentist&#x27;s chair with the drill whirring&quot;.

Orwell wrote in a letter to George Woodcock dated 28 September 1946 that &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; was one of the two or three of his books that he was ashamed of because it &quot;was written simply as an exercise and I oughtn&#x27;t to have published it, but I was desperate for money. At that time I simply hadn&#x27;t a book in me, but I was half starved and had to turn out something to bring in £100 or so.&quot; Orwell did not want either this book or &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; reprinted during his lifetime. 

For an edition of the BBC Television show &quot;Omnibus&quot; (&quot;The Road to the Left&quot;, broadcast 10 January 1971), Melvyn Bragg interviewed Norman Mailer. Bragg said that he &quot;just assumed Mailer had read Orwell. In fact he&#x27;s mad on him.&quot; Of &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; Mailer said: &quot;It is perfect from the first page to the last.&quot;

The novel has won other admirers besides Mailer, notably Lionel Trilling, who called it &quot;a &quot;summa&quot; of all the criticisms of a commercial civilization that have ever been made&quot;.

Orwell&#x27;s biographer Jeffrey Meyers finds the novel flawed by weaknesses in plot, style and characterisation, but praises &quot;a poignant and moving quality that comes from Orwell&#x27;s perceptive portrayal of the alienation and loneliness of poverty, and from Rosemary&#x27;s tender response to Gordon&#x27;s mean misery&quot;. 

Tosco Fyvel, literary editor of &quot;Tribune&quot; from 1945 to 1949, and a friend and colleague of Orwell&#x27;s during the last ten years of Orwell&#x27;s life, found it interesting that &quot;through Gordon Comstock Orwell expressed violent dislike of London&#x27;s crowded life and mass advertising— a foretaste here of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Orwell has Gordon reacting to a poster saying &quot;Corner Table Enjoys His Meal With Bovex&quot; in a manner already suggesting that of the later novel:

Catherine Blount points to the theme of a London couple needing to go into the countryside in order to find a private place to have sex, which has a significant place in the plot of &quot;Aspidistra&quot; and which is taken up prominently in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. 

Orwell&#x27;s biographer D. J. Taylor writes of Gordon Comstock that, &quot;Like Dorothy in &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and like Winston Smith in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, he rebels against the system and is ultimately swallowed up by it ... Like Winston Smith, he rebels, the rebellion fails, and he has to reach an accommodation with a world he&#x27;d previously disparaged.&quot;

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation of the same title was released in 1997. It was directed by Robert Bierman and stars Richard E. Grant and Helena Bonham Carter. The film was released in North America and New Zealand under the alternative title &quot;A Merry War&quot;.

<text>Crucifixion is a method of capital punishment in which the condemned is tied or nailed to a large wooden cross, beam or stake and left to hang until eventual death. It was used as a punishment by the Persians, Carthaginians, and Romans, among others. Crucifixion has been used in some countries as recently as the 21st century.

The crucifixion of Jesus is central to Christianity and the cross (in Roman Catholicism usually depicted with Jesus nailed to it) is Christianity&#x27;s preeminent religious symbol. His death is the most prominent example of crucifixion in history, which in turn has led many cultures in the modern world to associate the execution method closely with Jesus and with Christian spirituality. Other figures in Christianity are traditionally believed to have undergone crucifixion as well, including Saint Peter, who was crucified upside-down. Today, limited numbers of Christians voluntarily undergo non-lethal crucifixions as a devotional practice.

== Terminology ==

Ancient Greek has two verbs for crucify: (), from (which in modern Greek only means &quot;cross&quot; but which in antiquity was used for any kind of wooden pole, pointed or blunt, bare or with attachments) and () &quot;crucify on a plank&quot;, together with ( &quot;impale&quot;). In earlier pre-Roman Greek texts usually means &quot;impale&quot;.

The Greek used in the Christian New Testament uses four verbs, three of them based upon (), usually translated &quot;cross&quot;. The most common term is (), &quot;to crucify&quot;, occurring 46 times; (), &quot;to crucify with&quot; or &quot;alongside&quot; occurs five times, while (), &quot;to crucify again&quot; occurs only once at the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:6. (), &quot;to fix or fasten to, impale, crucify&quot; occurs only once, at the Acts of the Apostles 2:23.

The English term &quot;cross&quot; derives from the Latin word , which classically referred to a tree or any construction of wood used to hang criminals as a form of execution. The term later came to refer specifically to a cross. The related term &quot;crucifix&quot; derives from the Latin or , past participle passive of or , meaning &quot;to crucify&quot; or &quot;to fasten to a cross&quot;.

== Detail ==
=== Cross shape ===

In the Roman Empire, the gibbet (instrument of execution) for crucifixions took on many shapes. Seneca the Younger () states: &quot;I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet.&quot; According to Josephus, during Emperor Titus&#x27;s Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE), Roman soldiers nailed innumerable Jewish captives to crosses in various ways.

At times the gibbet was only one vertical stake, called in Latin &quot;crux simplex&quot;. This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned. Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give the shape of a T (&quot;crux commissa&quot;) or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (&quot;crux immissa&quot;). The most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion depicts an individual on a cross. It is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of Trajan or Hadrian (late 1st century to early 2nd century CE).

Writers in the 2nd century who speak of the execution cross describe the crucified person&#x27;s arms as outstretched, not attached to a single stake: Lucian speaks of Prometheus as crucified &quot;above the ravine with his hands outstretched&quot;. He also says that the shape of the letter Τ (the Greek letter tau) was that of the wooden instrument used for crucifying. Artemidorus, another writer of the same period, says that a cross is made of posts (plural) and nails and that the arms of the crucified are outstretched. Speaking of the generic execution cross, Irenaeus (), a Christian writer, describes it as composed of an upright and a transverse beam, sometimes with a small projection in the upright.

New Testament writings about the crucifixion of Jesus do not specify the shape of that cross, but subsequent early writings liken it to the letter T. According to William Barclay, because tau is shaped exactly like the &quot;crux commissa&quot; and represented the number 300, &quot;wherever the fathers came across the number 300 in the Old Testament they took it to be a mystical prefiguring of the cross of Christ&quot;. The earliest example, written around the late 1st century, is the &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot;, with another example being Clement of Alexandria (c. 215).

Justin Martyr () sees the cross of Christ represented in the crossed spits used to roast the Passover lamb.

=== Nail placement ===
In popular depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus (possibly because in translations of the wounds are described as being &quot;in his hands&quot;), Jesus is shown with nails in his hands. But in Greek the word &quot;χείρ&quot;, usually translated as &quot;hand&quot;, could refer to the entire portion of the arm below the elbow, and to denote the &quot;hand&quot; as distinct from the &quot;arm&quot; some other word could be added, as &quot;ἄκρην οὔτασε χεῖρα&quot; (he wounded the end of the χείρ, i.e., &quot;he wounded him in the hand&quot;.

A possibility that does not require tying is that the nails were inserted just above the wrist, through the soft tissue, between the two bones of the forearm (the radius and the ulna).

A foot-rest (&quot;suppedaneum&quot;) attached to the cross, perhaps for the purpose of taking the person&#x27;s weight off the wrists, is sometimes included in representations of the crucifixion of Jesus but is not discussed in ancient sources. Some scholars interpret the Alexamenos graffito (), the earliest surviving depiction of the crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest. Ancient sources also mention the &quot;sedile&quot;, a small seat attached to the front of the cross, about halfway down, which could have served a similar purpose.
In 1968, archaeologists discovered at Giv&#x27;at ha-Mivtar in northeast Jerusalem the remains of one Jehohanan, who was crucified in the 1st century CE. The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account of the length of the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that the man had been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, , suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright. As of 2011, the skeleton from Giv&#x27;at ha-Mivtar was the only confirmed example of ancient crucifixion in the archaeological record. A second set of skeletal remains with holes transverse through the calcaneum heel bones, found in 2007, could be a second archaeological record of crucifixion. The find in Cambridgeshire (United Kingdom) in November 2017 of the remains of the heel bone of a (probably enslaved) man with an iron nail through it, is believed by the archeologists to confirm the use of this method in ancient Rome.

=== Cause of death ===
The length of time required to reach death could range from hours to days depending on method, the victim&#x27;s health, and the environment.

A theory attributed to Pierre Barbet held that, when the whole body weight was supported by the stretched arms, the typical cause of death was asphyxiation. He wrote that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs. The condemned would therefore have to draw himself up by the arms, leading to exhaustion, or have his feet supported by tying or by a wood block. When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes. This theory has been supported by multiple scholars. Other scholars, including Frederick Zugibe, posit other causes of death. Zugibe suspended test subjects with their arms at 60° to 70° from the vertical. The test subjects had no difficulty breathing during experiments, but did suffer rapidly increasing pain, which is consistent with the Roman use of crucifixion to achieve a prolonged, agonizing death. However, Zugibe&#x27;s positioning of the test subjects necessarily did not precisely replicate the conditions of historical crucifixion. In 2023, an analysis of medical literature concluded that asphyxiation is discredited as the primary cause of death from crucifixion.

There is scholarly support for several possible non-asphyxiation causes of death: heart failure or arrhythmia, hypovolemic shock, acidosis, dehydration, and pulmonary embolism. Death could result from any combination of those factors, or from other causes, including sepsis following infection due to the wounds caused by the nails or by the scourging that often preceded crucifixion, or from stabbing by the guards.

=== Survival ===
Since death does not follow immediately on crucifixion, survival after a short period of crucifixion is possible, as in the case of those who choose each year as a devotional practice to be non-lethally crucified.

There is an ancient record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was intended to be lethal, but was interrupted. Josephus recounts:I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintances. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician&#x27;s hands, while the third recovered.Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends.

== History and religious texts ==
=== Pre-Roman states ===
Crucifixion (or impalement), in one form or another, was used by Persians, Carthaginians, and among the Greeks, the Macedonians.

The Greeks were generally opposed to performing crucifixions. However, in his &quot;Histories&quot;, ix.120–122, Greek writer Herodotus describes the execution of a Persian general at the hands of Athenians in about 479 BC: &quot;They nailed him to a plank and hung him up ... this Artayctes who suffered death by crucifixion.&quot; The &quot;Commentary on Herodotus&quot; by How and Wells remarks: &quot;They crucified him with hands and feet stretched out and nailed to cross-pieces; cf. vii.33. This act, supposedly unusual on the part of Greeks, may be explained by the enormity of the outrage or by Athenian deference to local feeling.&quot;

Some Christian theologians, beginning with Paul of Tarsus writing in Galatians 3:13, have interpreted an allusion to crucifixion in Deuteronomy . This reference is to being hanged from a tree, and may be associated with lynching or traditional hanging. However, Rabbinic law limited capital punishment to just 4 methods of execution: stoning, burning, strangulation, and decapitation, while the passage in Deuteronomy was interpreted as an obligation to hang the corpse on a tree as a form of deterrence. The fragmentary Aramaic Testament of Levi (DSS 4Q541) interprets in column 6: &quot;God ... (partially legible)-&quot;will set&quot; ... right errors. ... (partially legible)-&quot;He will judge&quot; ... revealed sins. Investigate and seek and know how Jonah wept. Thus, you shall not destroy the weak by wasting away or by ... (partially legible)-&quot;crucifixion&quot; ... Let not the nail touch him.&quot;

The Jewish king Alexander Jannaeus, king of Judea from 103 to 76 BCE, crucified 800 rebels, said to be Pharisees, in the middle of Jerusalem.

Alexander the Great is reputed to have crucified 2,000 survivors from his siege of the Phoenician city of Tyre, as well as the doctor who unsuccessfully treated Alexander&#x27;s lifelong friend Hephaestion. Some historians have also conjectured that Alexander crucified Callisthenes, his official historian and biographer, for objecting to Alexander&#x27;s adoption of the Persian ceremony of royal adoration.

In Carthage, crucifixion was an established mode of execution, which could even be imposed on generals for suffering a major defeat.

The oldest crucifixion may be a post-mortem one mentioned by Herodotus. Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, was put to death in 522 BCE by the Persians, and his dead body was then crucified.

=== Ancient Rome ===

==== History ====

The Greek and Latin words corresponding to &quot;crucifixion&quot; applied to many different forms of painful execution, including being impaled on a stake, or affixed to a tree, upright pole (a crux simplex), or to a combination of an upright (in Latin, &quot;stipes&quot;) and a crossbeam (in Latin, &quot;patibulum&quot;). Seneca the Younger wrote: &quot;I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet&quot;.

Crucifixion was generally performed within Ancient Rome as a means to dissuade others from perpetrating similar crimes, with victims sometimes left on display after death as a warning. Crucifixion was intended to provide a death that was particularly slow, painful (hence the term &quot;excruciating&quot;, literally &quot;out of crucifying&quot;), gruesome, humiliating, and public, using whatever means were most expedient for that goal. Crucifixion methods varied considerably with location and period.

One hypothesis suggested that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of &quot;arbori suspendere&quot;—hanging on an &quot;arbor infelix&quot; (&quot;inauspicious tree&quot;) dedicated to the gods of the nether world. This hypothesis is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the &quot;supplicium more maiorum&quot;, punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death. Tertullian mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion, but Seneca the Younger earlier used the phrase &quot;infelix lignum&quot; (unfortunate wood) for the transom (&quot;patibulum&quot;) or the whole cross. Plautus and Plutarch are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibula to the upright &quot;stipes&quot;.

Notorious mass crucifixions followed the Third Servile War in 73–71 BCE (the slave rebellion led by Spartacus), and other Roman civil wars in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. Crassus ordered the crucifixion of 6,000 of Spartacus&#x27; followers who had been hunted down and captured after the slave defeat in battle. Josephus says that in the siege that led to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, the Roman soldiers crucified Jewish captives before the walls of Jerusalem and out of anger and hatred amused themselves by nailing them in different positions.

In some cases, the condemned was forced to carry the crossbeam to the place of execution. A whole cross would weigh well over 135 kg (300 lb), but the crossbeam would not be as burdensome, weighing around 45 kg (100 lb). The Roman historian Tacitus records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the Esquiline Gate, and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion. Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with the condemned person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.

The person executed may have been attached to the cross by rope, though nails and other sharp materials are mentioned in a passage by Josephus, where he states that at the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE), &quot;the soldiers out of rage and hatred, &quot;nailed&quot; those they caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest&quot;. Objects used in the crucifixion of criminals, such as nails, were sought as amulets with perceived medicinal qualities.

While a crucifixion was an execution, it was also a humiliation, by making the condemned as vulnerable as possible. Although artists have traditionally depicted the figure on a cross with a loin cloth or a covering of the genitals, the person being crucified was usually stripped naked. Writings by Seneca the Younger state some victims suffered a stick forced upwards through their groin. Despite its frequent use by the Romans, the horrors of crucifixion did not escape criticism by some eminent Roman orators. Cicero, for example, described crucifixion as &quot;a most cruel and disgusting punishment&quot;, and suggested that &quot;the very mention of the cross should be far removed not only from a Roman citizen&#x27;s body, but from his mind, his eyes, his ears&quot;. Elsewhere he says, &quot;It is a crime to bind a Roman citizen; to scourge him is a wickedness; to put him to death is almost parricide. What shall I say of crucifying him? So guilty an action cannot by any possibility be adequately expressed by any name bad enough for it.&quot;

Frequently, the legs of the person executed were broken or shattered with an iron club, an act called &quot;crurifragium&quot;, which was also frequently applied without crucifixion to slaves. This act hastened the death of the person but was also meant to deter those who observed the crucifixion from committing offenses.

Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, abolished crucifixion in the Roman Empire in 337 out of veneration for Jesus Christ, its most famous victim.

==== Society and law ====
Crucifixion was intended to be a gruesome spectacle: the most painful and humiliating death imaginable. It was used to punish slaves, pirates, and enemies of the state. It was originally reserved for slaves (hence still called &quot;supplicium servile&quot; by Seneca), and later extended to citizens of the lower classes (&quot;humiliores&quot;). The victims of crucifixion were stripped naked and put on public display while they were slowly tortured to death so that they would serve as a spectacle and an example.

According to Roman law, if a slave killed his or her owner, all of the owner&#x27;s slaves would be crucified as punishment. Both men and women were crucified. Tacitus writes in his &quot;Annals&quot; that when Lucius Pedanius Secundus was murdered by a slave, some in the Senate tried to prevent the mass crucifixion of four hundred of his slaves because there were so many women and children, but in the end tradition prevailed and they were all executed. Although not conclusive evidence for female crucifixion by itself, the most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion may depict a crucified woman, whether real or imaginary. Crucifixion was such a gruesome and humiliating way to die that the subject was somewhat of a taboo in Roman culture, and few crucifixions were specifically documented. One of the only specific female crucifixions that are documented is that of Ida, a freedwoman (former slave) who was crucified by order of Tiberius.

==== Process ====
Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding centurion and his soldiers. First, the condemned would be stripped naked and scourged. This would cause the person to lose a large amount of blood, and approach a state of shock. The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (&quot;patibulum&quot; in Latin) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross.

During the death march, the prisoner, probably still nude after the scourging, would be led through the most crowded streets bearing a &quot;titulus&quot; – a sign board proclaiming the prisoner&#x27;s name and crime. Upon arrival at the place of execution, selected to be especially public, the convict would be stripped of any remaining clothing, then nailed to the cross naked. If the crucifixion took place in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (&quot;stipes&quot;) might be permanently embedded in the ground. In this case, the condemned person&#x27;s wrists would first be nailed to the &quot;patibulum&quot;, and then he or she would be hoisted off the ground with ropes to hang from the elevated &quot;patibulum&quot; while it was fastened to the &quot;stipes&quot;. Next the feet or ankles would be nailed to the upright stake. The &#x27;nails&#x27; were tapered iron spikes approximately long, with a square shaft across. The &quot;titulus&quot; would also be fastened to the cross to notify onlookers of the person&#x27;s name and crime as they hung on the cross, further maximizing the public impact.

There may have been considerable variation in the position in which prisoners were nailed to their crosses and how their bodies were supported while they died. Seneca the Younger recounts: &quot;I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet.&quot; One source claims that for Jews (apparently not for others), a man would be crucified with his back to the cross as is traditionally depicted, while a woman would be nailed facing her cross, probably with her back to onlookers, or at least with the &quot;stipes&quot; providing some semblance of modesty if viewed from the front. Such concessions were &quot;unique&quot; and not made outside a Jewish context. Several sources mention some sort of seat fastened to the &quot;stipes&quot; to help support the person&#x27;s body, thereby prolonging the person&#x27;s suffering and humiliation by preventing the asphyxiation caused by hanging without support. Justin Martyr calls the seat a &quot;cornu&quot;, or &quot;horn,&quot; leading some scholars to believe it may have had a pointed shape designed to torment the crucified person. This would be consistent with Seneca&#x27;s observation of victims with their private parts impaled.

In Roman-style crucifixion, the condemned could take up to a few days to die, but death was sometimes hastened by human action. &quot;The attending Roman guards could leave the site only after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim.&quot; The Romans sometimes broke the prisoner&#x27;s legs to hasten death and usually forbade burial. On the other hand, the person was often deliberately kept alive as long as possible to prolong their suffering and humiliation, so as to provide the maximum deterrent effect. Corpses of the crucified were typically left on the crosses to decompose and be eaten by animals.

=== In Islam ===
Islam spread in a region where many societies, including the Persian and Roman empires, had used crucifixion to punish traitors, rebels, robbers and criminal slaves. The Qur&#x27;an refers to crucifixion in six passages, of which the most significant for later legal developments is verse 5:33:

The corpus of hadith provides contradictory statements about the first use of crucifixion under Islamic rule, attributing it variously to Muhammad himself (for murder and robbery of a shepherd) or to the second caliph Umar (applied to two slaves who murdered their mistress). Classical Islamic jurisprudence applies the verse 5:33 chiefly to highway robbers, as a &quot;hadd&quot; (scripturally prescribed) punishment. The preference for crucifixion over the other punishments mentioned in the verse or for their combination (which Sadakat Kadri has called &quot;Islam&#x27;s equivalent of the hanging, drawing and quartering that medieval Europeans inflicted on traitors&quot;) is subject to &quot;complex and contested rules&quot; in classical jurisprudence. Most scholars required crucifixion for highway robbery combined with murder, while others allowed execution by other methods for this scenario. The main methods of crucifixion are:

* Exposure of the culprit&#x27;s body after execution by another method, ascribed to &quot;most scholars&quot; and in particular to Ibn Hanbal and Al-Shafi&#x27;i; or Hanbalis and Shafi&#x27;is.
* Crucifying the culprit alive, then executing him with a lance thrust or another method, ascribed to Malikis, most Hanafis and most Twelver Shi&#x27;is; the majority of the Malikis; Malik, Abu Hanifa, and al-Awza&#x27;i; or Malikis, Hanafis, and Shafi&#x27;is.
* Crucifying the culprit alive and sparing his life if he survives for three days, ascribed to Shiites.

Most classical jurists limit the period of crucifixion to three days. Crucifixion involves affixing or impaling the body to a beam or a tree trunk. Various minority opinions also prescribed crucifixion as punishment for a number of other crimes. Cases of crucifixion under most of the legally prescribed categories have been recorded in the history of Islam, and prolonged exposure of crucified bodies was especially common for political and religious opponents.

=== Japan ===
Crucifixion was introduced into Japan during the Sengoku period (1467–1573), after a 350-year period with no capital punishment. It is believed to have been suggested to the Japanese by the introduction of Christianity into the region, although similar types of punishment had been used as early as the Kamakura period. Known in Japanese as , crucifixion was used in Japan before and during the Tokugawa Shogunate. Several related crucifixion techniques were used. Petra Schmidt, in &quot;Capital Punishment in Japan&quot;, writes:
In 1597, 26 Christian Martyrs were nailed to crosses at Nagasaki, Japan. Among those executed were Saints Paulo Miki, Philip of Jesus and Pedro Bautista, a Spanish Franciscan. The executions marked the beginning of a long history of persecution of Christianity in Japan, which continued until its decriminalization in 1871.

Crucifixion was used as a punishment for prisoners of war during World War II. Ringer Edwards, an Australian prisoner of war, was crucified for killing cattle, along with two others. He survived 63 hours before being let down.

=== Burma ===
In Burma, crucifixion was a central element in several execution rituals. Felix Carey, a missionary in Burma from 1806 to 1812, wrote the following:
=== Europe ===

During World War I, there were persistent rumors that German soldiers had crucified a Canadian soldier on a tree or barn door with bayonets or combat knives. The event was initially reported in 1915 by Private George Barrie of the 1st Canadian Division. Two investigations, one a post-war official investigation, and the other an independent investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, concluded that there was no evidence to support the story. However, British documentary maker Iain Overton in 2001 published an article claiming that the story was true, identifying the soldier as Harry Band. Overton&#x27;s article was the basis for a 2002 episode of the Channel 4 documentary show &quot;Secret History&quot;.

It has been reported that crucifixion was used in several cases against the German civil population of East Prussia when it was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War II.

== Archaeological evidence ==

Although the Roman historians Josephus and Appian refer to the crucifixion of thousands in during the Roman-Jewish wars in Judaea by the Romans, there are few actual archaeological remains. A prominent example is the crucified body found in a Jewish tomb dating back to the 1st century which was discovered at Givat HaMivtar, Jerusalem in 1968. The remains were found accidentally in an ossuary with the crucified man&#x27;s name on it, &quot;Jehohanan, the son of Hagakol.&quot; Nicu Haas, from the Hebrew University Medical School, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating that the man had been crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone suggests the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together to the front of the cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree.

Additionally, a piece of acacia wood was located between the bones and the head of the nail, presumably to keep the condemned from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death. It is thought that because in earlier Roman times iron was valuable, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed. Haas had also identified a scratch on the inner surface of the right radius bone of the forearm, close to the wrist. He deduced from the form of the scratch, as well as from the intact wrist bones, that a nail had been driven into the forearm at that position.

Many of Haas&#x27; findings have, however, been challenged. For instance, it was subsequently determined that the scratches in the wrist area were non-traumatic – and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion – while reexamination of the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but rather separately to either side of the upright post of the cross.

In 2007, a possible case of a crucified body, with a round hole in a heel bone, possibly caused by a nail, was discovered in the Po Valley near Rovigo, in northern Italy.
In 2017 part of a crucified body, with a nail in the heel, was additionally discovered at Fenstanton in the United Kingdom. Further studies suggested that the remains may be those of a slave, because at that time crucifixion was banned in Roman law for citizens, although not necessarily for slaves.

== Modern use ==
=== Crucifixion in Europe ===
In 2005, a priest and four nuns in Romania were convicted of crucifying Maricica Irina Cornici, a 25 year old nun with schizophrenia, who they believed was possessed by the devil.

=== Crucifixion in the South Sudan Civil War ===

In 2017, The Standard News Channel reported on a series of crimes against civilians, including women being hung up trees

=== Legal execution in Islamic states ===
Crucifixion is still used as a rare method of execution in Saudi Arabia. The punishment of crucifixion (&quot;șalb&quot;) imposed in Islamic law is variously interpreted as exposure of the body after execution, crucifixion followed by stabbing in the chest, or crucifixion for three days, survivors of which are allowed to live.

Several people have been subjected to crucifixion in Saudi Arabia in the 2000s, although on occasion they were first beheaded and then crucified. In March 2013, a robber was set to be executed by being crucified for three days. However, the method was changed to death by firing squad. The Saudi Press Agency reported that the body of another individual was crucified after his execution in April 2019 as part of a crackdown on charges of terrorism.

Ali Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr was arrested in 2012 when he was 17 years old for taking part in an anti-government protest in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring. In May 2014, Ali al-Nimr was sentenced to be publicly beheaded and crucified.

Theoretically, crucifixion is still one of the Hadd punishments in Iran. If a crucified person were to survive three days of crucifixion, that person would be allowed to live. Execution by hanging is described as follows: &quot;In execution by hanging, the prisoner will be hung on a hanging truss which should look like a cross, while his (her) back is toward the cross, and (s)he faces the direction of Mecca [in Saudi Arabia], and his (her) legs are vertical and distant from the ground.&quot;

Sudan&#x27;s penal code, based upon the government&#x27;s interpretation of shari&#x27;a, includes execution followed by crucifixion as a penalty. When, in 2002, 88 people were sentenced to death for crimes relating to murder, armed robbery, and participating in ethnic clashes, Amnesty International wrote that they could be executed by either hanging or crucifixion.
=== Jihadism ===
On 5 February 2015, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) reported that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had committed &quot;several cases of mass executions of boys, as well as reports of beheadings, crucifixions of children and burying children alive&quot;.

On 30 April 2014, a total of seven public executions were carried out in Raqqa, northern Syria. The pictures, originally posted to Twitter by a student at Oxford University, were retweeted by a Twitter account owned by a known member of ISIL causing major media outlets to incorrectly attribute the origin of the post to the militant group. In most of these cases of crucifixion the victims are shot first then their bodies are displayed but there have also been reports of crucifixion preceding shootings or decapitations as well as a case where a man was said to have been &quot;crucified alive for eight hours&quot; with no indication of whether he died.

=== Other incidents ===
The human rights group Karen Women Organization documented a case of Tatmadaw forces crucifying several Karen villagers in 2000 in the Dooplaya District in Burma&#x27;s Kayin State.

On 22 January 2014, Dmytro Bulatov, a Ukrainian anti-government activist and member of AutoMaidan, claimed to have been kidnapped by unknown persons &quot;speaking in Russian accents&quot; and tortured for a week. His captors kept him in the dark, beat him, cut off a piece of his ear, and nailed him to a cross. His captors ultimately left him in a forest outside Kyiv after forcing him to confess to being an American spy and accepting money from the US Embassy in Ukraine to organize protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Bulatov said he believed Russian secret services were responsible.

In 1997, the Ministry of Justice in the United Arab Emirates issued a statement that a court had sentenced two murderers to be crucified, to be followed by their executions the next day. A Ministry of Justice official later stated that the crucifixion sentence should be considered cancelled. The crucifixions were not carried out, and the convicts were instead executed by firing squad.

During the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, Captain Vladyslav Pastukh of the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade crucified another member of the brigade by tying the soldier&#x27;s hands to a wooden cross and the soldier&#x27;s helmet to his left arm. He then took a picture of himself squatting in front of the cross with the soldier&#x27;s body hanging from it. On 16 December 2024, Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov ordered an immediate investigation into the incident as well as an investigation into other alleged abuse, extortion, and humiliation of soldiers of the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade by their commanding officers.

== In culture and arts ==

== As a devotional practice ==
In July 1805, a man named Mattio Lovat attempted to crucify himself at a public street in Venice, Italy. The attempt was unsuccessful, and he was sent to an asylum, where he died a year later.

In some cases, a crucifixion is simulated within a passion play, as in the ceremonial re-enactment that has been performed yearly in the town of Iztapalapa, on the outskirts of Mexico City, since 1833, and in the famous Oberammergau Passion Play. Also, since at least the mid-19th century, a group of flagellants in New Mexico, called &quot;Hermanos de Luz&quot; (&quot;Brothers of Light&quot;), have annually conducted reenactments of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion during Holy Week, in which a penitent is tied—but not nailed—to a cross. This tradition is sometimes practiced in other regions of the United States, such as in Appalachia, where members of Protestant churches stage mock crucifixions wherein worshippers hang from straps on the crosses during Good Friday re-enactments. 
The Catholic Church frowns upon self-crucifixion as a form of devotion: &quot;Penitential practices leading to self-crucifixion with nails are not to be encouraged.&quot; Despite this, the practice persists in the Philippines, where some Catholics are voluntarily, non-lethally crucified for a limited time on Good Friday to imitate the sufferings of Christ. Pre-sterilised nails are driven through the palm of the hand between the bones, while there is a footrest to which the feet are nailed. Rolando del Campo, a carpenter in Pampanga, vowed to be crucified every Good Friday for 15 years if God would carry his wife through a difficult childbirth, while in San Pedro Cutud, Ruben Enaje has been crucified 34 times. The Filipino Catholic Church has repeatedly voiced disapproval of crucifixions and self-flagellation, while the government has noted that it cannot deter devotees. The Department of Health recommends that participants in the rites should have tetanus shots and that the nails used should be sterilized.

== Notable crucifixions ==

*The rebel slaves of the Third Servile War: Between 73 and 71 BCE, a band of slaves, eventually numbering about 120,000, under the (at least partial) leadership of Spartacus were in open revolt against the Roman republic. The rebellion was eventually crushed and, while Spartacus himself most likely died in the final battle of the revolt, approximately 6,000 of his followers were crucified along the 200-km Appian Way between Capua and Rome as a warning to any other would-be rebels.
* Jehohanan: Jewish man who was crucified around the same time as Jesus; it is widely accepted that his ankles were nailed to the side of the &quot;stipes&quot; of the cross.
*Jesus: His death by crucifixion under Pontius Pilate (c. 30 or 33 AD), recounted in the four 1st-century canonical Gospels, is referred to repeatedly as something well known in the earlier letters of Saint Paul, for instance, five times in his First Letter to the Corinthians, written in 57 CE (1:13, 1:18, 1:23, 2:2, 2:8). Pilate, the Roman governor of Judaea province at the time, is explicitly linked with the condemnation of Jesus by the Gospels, and subsequently by Tacitus. The civil charge was a claim to be King of the Jews.
*Saint Peter: Christian apostle, who according to tradition was crucified upside-down at his own request (hence the Cross of Saint Peter), because he did not feel worthy enough to die the same way as Jesus.
*Saint Andrew: Christian apostle and Saint Peter&#x27;s brother, who is traditionally said to have been crucified on an cross (hence the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross).
*Simeon of Jerusalem: second Bishop of Jerusalem, crucified in either 106 or 107 CE.
*Mani: the founder of Manicheanism, he was depicted by followers as having died by crucifixion in 274 CE.
*Eulalia of Barcelona was venerated as a saint. According to her hagiography, she was stripped naked, tortured, and ultimately crucified on an cross.
*Wilgefortis was venerated as a saint and represented as a crucified woman, however her legend comes from a misinterpretation of a full-clothed crucifix known as the Volto Santo of Lucca.
*The 26 Martyrs of Japan: Japanese martyrs who were crucified and impaled with spears.

<doc id="38117" wikidata="Q76139" url="?curid=38117" title="Gerry Adams">
<text>Gerard Adams (; born 6 October 1948) is a retired Irish republican politician who was the president of Sinn Féin between 13 November 1983 and 10 February 2018, and served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Louth from 2011–2020. From 1983–1992 and from 1997–2011, he won election as a Member of Parliament (MP) of the UK Parliament for the Belfast West constituency, but followed the Sinn Féin policy of abstentionism.

Adams first became involved in Irish republicanism in the late 1960s, and was an established figure in Irish activism for more than a decade before his 1983 election to Parliament. In 1984, Adams was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). From the late 1980s onwards, he was an important figure in the Northern Ireland peace process, entering into talks initially with Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume and then subsequently with the Irish and British governments. In 1986, he convinced Sinn Féin to change its traditional policy of abstentionism towards the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Republic of Ireland. In 1998, it also took seats in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly. In 2005, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) stated that its armed campaign was over and that it was exclusively committed to peaceful politics.

Adams has often been accused of being a member of the IRA leadership in the 1970s and 80s, though he consistently denied any involvement in the organisation. In 2014, he was held for four days by the Police Service of Northern Ireland for questioning in connection with the 1972 abduction and murder of Jean McConville. He was released without charge and a file was sent to the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland, which later stated there was insufficient evidence to charge him. Adams announced in November 2017 that he would step down as leader of Sinn Féin in 2018, and that he would not stand for re-election to his seat in Dáil Éireann in 2020. He was succeeded by Mary Lou McDonald at a special &quot;ardfheis&quot; (party conference) on 10 February 2018.

==Early life==
Adams was born in the Ballymurphy district of Belfast on 6 October 1948. His parents, Anne (née Hannaway) and Gerry Adams Sr., came from republican backgrounds. His grandfather, also named Gerry Adams, was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) during the Irish War of Independence. Two of his uncles, Dominic and Patrick Adams, had been interned by the governments in Belfast and Dublin. In J. Bowyer Bell&#x27;s book &quot;The Secret Army&quot;, Bell states that Dominic was a senior figure in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) of the mid-1940s. Gerry Adams Sr. joined the IRA at age 16. In 1942, he participated in an IRA ambush on a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) patrol but was shot, arrested and sentenced to eight years&#x27; imprisonment. Adams&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Michael Hannaway, was also a member of the IRB during its bombing campaign in England in the 1860s and 1870s. Michael&#x27;s son, Billy, was election agent for Éamon de Valera at the 1918 Irish general election in West Belfast.

Adams attended St Finian&#x27;s Primary School on Falls Road, where he was taught by La Salle brothers. Having passed the eleven-plus exam in 1960, he attended St Mary&#x27;s Christian Brothers Grammar School. He left St Mary&#x27;s with six O-levels and worked in bars.

==Early political career==

In the late 1960s, a civil rights campaign developed in Northern Ireland. After being radicalised by the Divis Street riots during the 1964 United Kingdom general election campaign, Adams joined Sinn Féin and Fianna Éireann. Adams was an active supporter and joined the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in 1967. The civil rights movement was met with violence from loyalist counter-demonstrations and the RUC, and British troops were called in at the request of the Government of Northern Ireland.

Adams was active in rioting at this time and later became involved in the republican movement. In August 1971, internment was reintroduced to Northern Ireland under the Special Powers Act 1922. Adams was captured by British soldiers in March 1972 and in a &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; report on Adams&#x27; capture he was said to be &quot;one of the most wanted men in Belfast&quot;. Adams was interned on , but on the Provisional IRA&#x27;s insistence was released in June to take part in secret, but abortive talks in London. The IRA negotiated a short-lived truce with the British government and an IRA delegation met with British Home Secretary William Whitelaw at Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. The delegation included Adams, Martin McGuinness, Sean Mac Stiofain (IRA Chief of Staff), Daithi O&#x27;Conaill, Seamus Twomey, Ivor Bell and Dublin solicitor Myles Shevlin.

Adams was re-arrested in July 1973 and interned at the Maze prison. After taking part in an IRA-organised escape attempt, he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. During this time, he wrote articles in the paper &quot;An Phoblacht&quot; under the by-line &quot;Brownie&quot;, where he criticised the strategy and policy of Sinn Féin president Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Billy McKee, the IRA&#x27;s officer commanding in Belfast. He was also highly critical of a decision taken by McKee to assassinate members of the rival Official IRA, who had been on ceasefire since 1972. In 2020, the UK Supreme Court quashed Adams&#x27; convictions for attempting to escape on Christmas Eve in 1973 and again in July 1974.

In 1977, Ballymurphy priest Des Wilson (who had officiated at Adams&#x27;s wedding) assisted with an early attempt by Adams to open channels to dissident unionists. He helped set up meeting with Desmond Boal QC, a unionist barrister who had been first chairman of Ian Paisley&#x27;s Democratic Unionist Party. At the time, Boal was co-operating with Seán MacBride as joint mediator in confidential negotiations between the Provisional IRA and the Ulster Volunteer Force about a federal settlement for Ireland. A short time later, Wilson drove Adams to a meeting with John McKeague, founding member of the Red Hand Commando, then flirting with the idea of an independent Ulster. Inasmuch as they were &quot;frank&quot; , Adams found the meetings &quot;constructive&quot;, but could find no common political ground. Wilson was of the view that Adams was &quot;one of the very few people who could actually bring a military campaign into a political campaign&quot;.

===IRA membership allegations===
Adams has stated repeatedly that he has never been a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). However, journalists such as Ed Moloney, Peter Taylor, and Mark Urban, and historians, such as Richard English and John Bowyer Bell, have all named Adams as part of the IRA leadership since the 1970s. Furthermore, several former IRA members, including Brendan Hughes, Ivor Bell, and Seán Mac Stíofáin, have said Adams was also a member of the organisation. Practically all academics agree that Adams joined the IRA in the mid-1960s, was the Officer commanding (OC) of the 2nd battalion of the Belfast Brigade from 1971-1972, became the adjutant for the brigade in 1972, and had become the OC of the brigade by 1973.

Moloney and Taylor state that Adams became the IRA&#x27;s Chief of Staff following the arrest of Seamus Twomey in early December 1977, remaining in the position until 18 February 1978 when he, along with twenty other republican suspects, was arrested following the La Mon restaurant bombing. He was charged with IRA membership and remanded to Crumlin Road Gaol. He was released seven months later when the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Robert Lowry ruled there was insufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution. Moloney and English state Adams had been a member of the IRA Army Council since 1977, remaining a member until 2005 according to former Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Michael McDowell.

==Rise in Sinn Féin==

In 1978, Adams became joint vice-president of Sinn Féin and a key figure in directing a challenge to the Sinn Féin leadership of President Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and joint vice-president Dáithí Ó Conaill. The 1975 IRA-British truce is often viewed as the event that began the challenge to the original Provisional Sinn Féin leadership, which was dominated by southerners like Ó Brádaigh and Ó Conaill.

One of the reasons that the Provisional IRA and Provisional Sinn Féin were founded, in December 1969 and January 1970, respectively, was that people like Ó Brádaigh, Ó Conaill and McKee opposed participation in constitutional politics. The other reason was the failure of the Cathal Goulding leadership to provide for the defence of Irish nationalist areas during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. When, at the December 1969 IRA convention and the January 1970 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, the delegates voted to participate in the Dublin (Leinster House), Belfast (Stormont) and London (Westminster) parliaments, the organisations split. Adams, who had joined the republican movement in the early 1960s, sided with the Provisionals.

In the Maze prison in the mid-1970s, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Brownie&quot; in &quot;Republican News&quot;, Adams called for increased political activity among republicans, especially at local level. The call resonated with younger Northern people, many of whom had been active in the Provisional IRA but few of whom had been active in Sinn Féin. In 1977, Adams and Danny Morrison drafted the address of Jimmy Drumm at the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration at Bodenstown. The address was viewed as watershed in that Drumm acknowledged that the war would be a long one and that success depended on political activity that would complement the IRA&#x27;s armed campaign. For some, this wedding of politics and armed struggle culminated in Danny Morrison&#x27;s statement at the 1981 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in which he asked &quot;Who here really believes we can win the war through the ballot box? But will anyone here object if, with a ballot paper in one hand and the Armalite in the other, we take power in Ireland?&quot; For others, however, the call to link political activity with armed struggle had already been defined in Sinn Féin policy and in the presidential addresses of Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, but this had not resonated with young Northerners.
Even after the election of Bobby Sands as MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, a part of the mass mobilisation associated with the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike by republican prisoners in the H blocks of the Maze Prison, Adams was cautious that the level of political involvement by Sinn Féin could lead to electoral embarrassment. Charles Haughey, the Taoiseach of Ireland, called an election for June 1981. At an Ard Chomhairle meeting, Adams recommended that they contest only four constituencies which were in border counties. Instead, H-Block/Armagh candidates contested nine constituencies and elected two TDs. This, along with the election of Sands, was a precursor to an electoral breakthrough in elections in 1982 to the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly. Adams, Danny Morrison, Martin McGuinness, Jim McAllister and Owen Carron were elected as abstentionists. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had announced before the election that it would not take any seats and so its 14 elected representatives also abstained from participating in the Assembly and it was a failure. The 1982 election was followed by the 1983 Westminster election, in which Sinn Féin&#x27;s vote increased and Adams was elected, as an abstentionist, as MP for Belfast West. It was in 1983 that Ruairí Ó Brádaigh resigned as President of Sinn Féin and was succeeded by Adams.

In 1983, Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin and became the first Sinn Féin MP elected to the British House of Commons since Phil Clarke and Tom Mitchell in the mid-1950s. Following his election as MP for Belfast West, the British government lifted a ban on his travelling to Great Britain. In line with Sinn Féin policy, he refused to take his seat in the House of Commons.

===Assassination attempt by the UDA===
On 14 March 1984 in central Belfast, Adams was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt when Ulster Defence Association (UDA) gunmen fired about 20 shots into the car in which he was travelling. He was hit in the neck, shoulder and arm. He was rushed to the Royal Victoria Hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove three bullets. John Gregg and his team were apprehended almost immediately by a British Army patrol that opened fire on them before ramming their car. The attack had been known in advance by security forces due to a tip-off from informants within the UDA; Adams and his co-passengers had survived in part because RUC officers, acting on the informants&#x27; information, had replaced much of the ammunition in the UDA&#x27;s Rathcoole weapons dump with low-velocity bullets. Some, including Adams himself, still have unanswered questions about the RUC&#x27;s actions prior to the shooting. An Ulster Defence Regiment NCO subsequently received the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal for chasing and arresting an assailant.

==President of Sinn Féin==
Many republicans had long claimed that the only legitimate Irish state was the Irish Republic declared in the 1916 Proclamation of the Republic. In their view, the legitimate government was the IRA Army Council, which had been vested with the authority of that Republic in 1938 (prior to the Second World War) by the last remaining anti-Treaty deputies of the Second Dáil. In his 2005 speech to the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in Dublin, Adams explicitly rejected this view. &quot;But we refuse to criminalise those who break the law in pursuit of legitimate political objectives. ... Sinn Féin is accused of recognising the Army Council of the IRA as the legitimate government of this island. That is not the case. [We] do not believe that the Army Council is the government of Ireland. Such a government will only exist when all the people of this island elect it. Does Sinn Féin accept the institutions of this state as the legitimate institutions of this state? Of course we do.&quot;

As a result of this non-recognition, Sinn Féin had abstained from taking any of the seats they won in the British or Irish parliaments. At its 1986 Ard Fheis, Sinn Féin delegates passed a resolution to amend the rules and constitution that would allow its members to sit in the Dublin parliament. At this, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh led a small walkout, just as he and Sean Mac Stiofain had done sixteen years earlier with the creation of Provisional Sinn Féin. This minority, which rejected dropping the policy of abstentionism, now distinguishes itself from Sinn Féin by using the name Republican Sinn Féin, and maintains that they are the true Sinn Féin.

Adams&#x27; leadership of Sinn Féin was supported by a Northern-based cadre that included people like Danny Morrison and Martin McGuinness. Over time, Adams and others pointed to republican electoral successes in the early and mid-1980s, when hunger strikers Bobby Sands and Kieran Doherty were elected to the British House of Commons and Dáil Éireann respectively, and they advocated that Sinn Féin become increasingly political and base its influence on electoral politics rather than paramilitarism. The electoral effects of this strategy were shown later by the election of Adams and McGuinness to the House of Commons.

===Voice ban===
Adams&#x27;s prominence as an Irish republican leader was increased by the 1988–1994 British broadcasting voice restrictions, which were imposed by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to &quot;starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend&quot;. Thatcher was moved to act after BBC interviews of Martin McGuinness and Adams had been the focus of a row over an edition of &quot;After Dark&quot;, a proposed Channel 4 discussion programme which in the event was never made. While the ban covered 11 Irish political parties and paramilitary organisations, in practice it mostly affected Sinn Féin, the most prominent of these bodies.

A similar ban, known as Section 31, had been law in the Republic of Ireland since the 1970s. However, media outlets soon found ways around the bans. In the UK, this was initially by the use of subtitles, but later and more often by an actor reading words accompanied by video footage of the banned person speaking. Actors who voiced Adams included Stephen Rea and Paul Loughran. This loophole could not be used in the Republic, as word-for-word broadcasts were not allowed. Instead, the banned speaker&#x27;s words were summarised by the newsreader, over video of them speaking.

These bans were lampooned in cartoons, by comedians and satirical TV shows, such as &quot;Jasper Carrott&quot;, &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, and in &quot;The Day Today&quot;, and were criticised by freedom of speech organisations and media personalities, including BBC Director General John Birt and BBC foreign editor John Simpson. The Republic&#x27;s ban was allowed to lapse in January 1994, and the British ban was lifted by Prime Minister John Major in September 1994.

==Movement into mainstream politics==

Sinn Féin continued its policy of refusing to sit in the Westminster Parliament after Adams won the Belfast West constituency. He lost his seat to Joe Hendron of the SDLP in the 1992 general election, regaining it at the following 1997 election. Under Adams, Sinn Féin moved away from being a political voice of the Provisional IRA to becoming a professionally organised political party in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

SDLP leader John Hume identified the possibility that a negotiated settlement might be possible and began secret talks with Adams in 1988. These discussions led to unofficial contacts with the British Northern Ireland Office under the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke, and with the government of the Republic under Charles Haughey – although both governments maintained in public that they would not negotiate with terrorists. These talks provided the groundwork for what was later to be the Belfast Agreement, preceded by the milestone Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.

These negotiations led to the IRA ceasefire in August 1994. Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, who had replaced Haughey and who had played a key role in the Hume/Adams dialogue through his Special Advisor Martin Mansergh, regarded the ceasefire as permanent. However, the slow pace of developments contributed in part to the (wider) political difficulties of the British government of John Major. His consequent reliance on Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) votes in the House of Commons led to him agreeing with the UUP demand to exclude Sinn Féin from talks until the IRA had decommissioned its weapons. Sinn Féin&#x27;s exclusion led the IRA to end its ceasefire and resume its campaign.

After the 1997 United Kingdom general election, the new Labour government had a majority in the House of Commons and was not reliant on unionist votes. The subsequent dropping of the insistence led to another IRA ceasefire, as part of the negotiations strategy, which saw teams from the British and Irish governments, the UUP, the SDLP, Sinn Féin, and representatives of loyalist paramilitary organisations, under the chairmanship of former United States Senator George Mitchell, produce the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Under the Agreement, structures were created reflecting the Irish and British identities of the people of Ireland, creating a British-Irish Council and a Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly.

Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland of the Republic&#x27;s constitution, which claimed sovereignty over all of Ireland, were reworded, and a power-sharing Executive Committee was provided for. As part of their deal, Sinn Féin agreed to abandon its abstentionist policy regarding a &quot;six-county parliament&quot;, as a result taking seats in the new Stormont-based Assembly and running the education and health and social services ministries in the power-sharing government.

===Sinn Féin in government===

On 15 August 1998, four months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the Omagh bombing by the Real IRA, killed 29 people and injured 220, from many communities. Adams said in reaction to the bombing &quot;I am totally horrified by this action. I condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever.&quot; Prior to this, Adams had not used the word &quot;condemn&quot; in relation to IRA or their splinter groups&#x27; actions.

In March 2007, Adams was re-elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in March 2007, and subsequently met with DUP leader Ian Paisley face-to-face for the first time. These talks led to the St Andrews Agreement, which brought about the return of the power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland. When Sinn Féin came to nominate its two ministers to the Northern Ireland Executive, for tactical reasons the party, like the SDLP and the DUP, chose not to include its leader among its ministers.

In January 2009, Adams attended the United States presidential inauguration of Barack Obama as a guest of US Congressman Richard Neal.

===Election to Dáil Éireann===
Adams was re-elected as MP for West Belfast with 71.1% of the vote in May 2010, but resigned his seat the following December, in order to seek election as a TD (member of Irish Parliament) for the constituency of Louth at the 2011 Irish general election. He topped the poll in the consistuency with 15,072 (21.7%) first preference votes, and was duly elected to Dáil Éireann where he succeeded Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin as Sinn Féin parliamentary leader.

In December 2013, Adams was a member of the Guard of Honour at Nelson Mandela&#x27;s funeral.

===2014 arrest===
On 30 April 2014, Adams was arrested by detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Serious Crime Branch, under the Terrorism Act 2000, in connection with the murder of Jean McConville in 1972. He had previously voluntarily arranged to be interviewed by police regarding the matter, and maintained he had no involvement. Fellow Sinn Féin politician Alex Maskey stated that the timing of the arrest, &quot;three weeks into an election&quot;, was evidence of a &quot;political agenda [...] a negative agenda&quot; by the PSNI. McConville&#x27;s family had campaigned for the arrest of Adams for the murder. McConville&#x27;s son Michael said that his family did not think the arrest of Adams would ever happen, and were glad that the arrest took place. Adams was released without charge after four days in custody when a file was sent to the Public Prosecution Service, which would decide if criminal charges should be brought.

At a press conference after his release, Adams criticised the timing of his arrest, reiterated Sinn Féin&#x27;s support for the PSNI and said: &quot;The IRA is gone. It is finished.&quot; Adams denied that he had any involvement in the murder or was ever a member of the IRA, and said the allegations came from &quot;enemies of the peace process&quot;. On 29 September 2015 the Public Prosecution Service announced Adams would not face charges, due to insufficient evidence, as had been expected ever since a BBC report dated 6 May 2014 (2 days after the BBC reported his release), which was widely repeated elsewhere.

===Late presidency===

On 19 May 2015, while on an official royal trip to Ireland, Prince Charles shook Adams&#x27; hand in what was described as a highly symbolic gesture of reconciliation. The meeting, described as &quot;historic&quot;, took place in Galway.

In September 2017, Adams said he would allow his name to go forward for a one-year term as president of Sinn Féin at the November ardfheis, at which point Sinn Féin would begin a &quot;planned process of generational change, including [Adams&#x27;] own future intentions&quot;. This resulted in speculation in the Irish and British media that Adams was preparing to stand down as party leader, and that he might run for President of Ireland in the next election. At the ardfheis on 18 November, Adams was re-elected for another year as party president, but announced that he would step down at some point in 2018, and would not seek re-election as TD for Louth.

===End of Sinn Féin presidency===

Adams&#x27; presidency of Sinn Féin ended on 10 February 2018, with his stepping down and the election of Mary Lou McDonald as the party&#x27;s new president.

On 13 July 2018, a home-made bomb was thrown at Adams&#x27; home in West Belfast, damaging a car parked in his driveway. Adams escaped injury and claimed that his two grandchildren were standing in the driveway only ten minutes before the blast. Another bomb was set off that same evening at the nearby home of former IRA volunteer and Sinn Féin official Bobby Storey. In a press conference the following day, Adams said he thought the attacks were linked to the riots in Derry, and asked that those responsible &quot;come and sit down&quot; and &quot;give us the rationale for this action&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1971, Adams married Collette McArdle. Their son Gearoid was born in 1973, went on to play Gaelic football for Antrim GAA senior men&#x27;s team and became its assistant manager in 2012.

In 2013, Adams&#x27; brother Liam was found guilty of 10 offences, including rape and gross indecency committed against his own daughter. After the allegations of abuse were first made public in 2009, Gerry Adams alleged that his father had subjected family members to emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Liam was jailed for 16 years, and died of pancreatic cancer in February 2019 at the age of 63 while in Maghaberry Prison.

In 2016, Adams sparked controversy by posting &quot;Watching &quot;Django Unchained&quot;—A Ballymurphy Nigger!&quot; on social media. This was widely reported, and Adams deleted it and apologised.

<text>Peperomia is one of the two large genera of the family Piperaceae. It is estimated that there are at least over 1,000 species, occurring in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They are concentrated in South and Central America, but may also be found in southern North America, the Caribbean islands, Africa, Oceania, and southern and eastern parts of Asia. The exact number of species is difficult to determine, as some plants have been recorded several times with different names, and new species continue to be discovered. Peperomias have adapted to many different environments and their appearances vary greatly. Some are epiphytes (growing on other plants) or lithophytes (growing on rock or in rock crevices), and many are xerophytes (drought-tolerant, with thick succulent structures to save water) or possess underground tubers (geophytes). Most species are compact perennial shrubs or vines.

Some Peperomias have thick, waxy, succulent leaves and stems; still, others are rather delicate, with paper-thin leaves. Many species will easily sunburn, preferring filtered or indirect, bright sunlight. Most of the Peperomias have minimal to virtually non-existent root systems (species-depending), with the entire mass often being nothing more than a collection of tiny, hair-like appendages used to anchor the plant. These roots, while delicate, also enable the plants to survive in less-than-ideal conditions; however, their fragility also places them at a greater risk for root rot if water does not drain sufficiently quickly.

The genus name &quot;Peperomia&quot; was coined by Spanish botanists Ruiz López and Pavón Jiménez in 1794 after their travels in Peru and Chile. &quot;Peperomia&quot; plants do not have a widely- accepted common name, and some argue that it is better to use the genus name, as is the case with genera such as &quot;Petunia&quot; and &quot;Begonia&quot;. They are sometimes called radiator plants, a name possibly coined by L.H. Bailey because many of them enjoy bright and dry environments similar to a windowsill above a radiator. Furthermore, many individuals simply refer to the many Peperomias by their individual nicknames, such as &quot;Peperomia polybotrya&quot; being called the “Raindrop Peperomia” (due to its large, drop-shaped leaves), or &quot;P. argyreia&quot; being the “Watermelon Peperomia”, due to its leaf veining and shape resembling the look of a watermelon.

==Description==
Peperomias vary considerably in appearance (see gallery below) and there is no universally accepted method of categorising them, although three main groups can be distinguished. Most species are compact and usually do not exceed in height.

First are plants with decorative foliage, which often grow in rain or cloud forests as epiphytes. They are adapted to living in small shady crevices on, for example, trees, with small root systems. As they do not have access to ground water they are typically succulent to a certain degree, which in many species shows as thick, fleshy leaves which have a waxy surface and are sometimes rippled. The leaves may be oval with the leafstalk at or near the center of the leaf blade, or they may be heart-shaped or lance-shaped; their size varies from long. They may be green or striped, marbled or bordered with pale green, red or gray, and the petioles of some kinds are red. They also enjoy high air humidity, warm temperatures, and grow all year round. Examples include &quot;P. argyreia&quot;, &quot;P. caperata&quot;, &quot;P. nitida&quot;, &quot;P. obtusifolia&quot;, &quot;P. polybotrya&quot;, and &quot;P. scandens&quot;.

The second group consists of more arid-climate, succulent peperomias, which are often found in higher altitudes. They are adapted to withstanding a long warm season followed by a colder winter and very little rainfall. They store water both in their stout stems and in their succulent leaves, which typically form a sort of “tube” or “burrito”, appearing U- or V-shaped in cross-section, often with epidermal windows on the top-side. &quot;P. columella&quot;, &quot;P. ferreyrae&quot;, &quot;P. graveolens&quot; and &quot;P. nivalis&quot; fall into this category.

The third group contains geophytic peperomias. These plants have leaves that fall off in the colder dry season, survive due to their underground tubers, and grow the leaves back as more rain falls. Examples include &quot;P. macrorhiza&quot;, &quot;P. peruviana&quot;, and &quot;P. umbilicata&quot;. Currently just under 50 species of geophytic peperomias are known, but new ones continue to be discovered.

Peperomia flowers are typically unnoticeable, growing in cordlike spikes, although there are some exceptions such as &quot;P. fraseri&quot;. Most peperomia flowers seem odorless to humans but some carry a musty or even unpleasant odor, such as &quot;P. graveolens&quot;. The fruit is a berry that eventually dries out and shows the tiny pepper-like seed.

==Species==
There are over a thousand Peperomia species, although the exact number is unclear as some plants have been recorded several times with different names (c. 3,000 names have been used in publications) and new species continue to be discovered. At the moment Catalogue of Life lists around 1,400 recognized species.

==Distribution==
Peperomias are found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world. Northern South America and Central America host the largest number of species, but peperomias can also be found in Africa, southern Asia, and Oceania. The exact number of peperomia species continues to change as new plants are discovered and some distinct plant names, perhaps catalogued in separate geographical regions, are realised to describe the same species. Therefore, the table below gives only a rough overall impression of the worldwide distribution.

Note that many peperomias are found in wide overlapping regions, for example everywhere in tropical America or Asia, and so may have not been included in the species count for individual areas.

==Peperomias and humans==
===Horticulture===
Peperomias are often grown for their ornamental foliage and many species are considered easy to grow in homes and greenhouses. Several species have been given the Award of Garden Merit by the Royal Horticultural Society. Peperomias are considered non-toxic and are recommended for households with children or animals.

Out of the 1,000+ &quot;Peperomia&quot; species, currently only about 40 of them are commonly used as houseplants. These peperomias fare well in average home conditions and can relatively easily be found in stores and garden centers. Species in this basic group include &quot;P. alata&quot;, &quot;P. albovittata&quot;, &quot;P. argyreia&quot;, &quot;P. blanda&quot;, &quot;P. boivinii&quot;, &quot;P. caperata&quot;, &quot;P. clusiifolia&quot;, &quot;P. columella&quot;, &quot;P. dolabriformis&quot;, &quot;P. ferreyrae&quot;, &quot;P. fraseri&quot;, &quot;P. glabella&quot;, &quot;P. graveolens&quot;, &quot;P. griseoargentea&quot;, &quot;P. hoffmannii&quot;, &quot;P. incana&quot;, &quot;P. japonica&quot;, &quot;P. kimnachii&quot;, &quot;P. maculosa&quot;, &quot;P. metallica&quot;, &quot;P. nitida&quot; (often sold as &quot;P. scandens&quot;), &quot;P. nivalis&quot;, &quot;P. obtusifolia&quot;, &quot;P. pellucida&quot;, &quot;P. perciliata&quot;, &quot;P. pereskiifolia&quot;, &quot;P. polybotrya&quot;, &quot;P. prostrata&quot;, &quot;P. quadrangularis&quot; (syn. &quot;P. angulata&quot;), &quot;P. rotundifolia&quot;, &quot;P. rugosa&quot;, &quot;P. tetragona&quot; (syn. &quot;P. puteolata&quot;), &quot;P. tetraphylla&quot;, &quot;P. turboensis&quot;, &quot;P. urocarpa&quot;, &quot;P. verschaffeltii&quot;, &quot;P. verticillata&quot; (syn. &quot;P. rubella&quot;), and &quot;P. wheeleri&quot;.

There can be, however, several cultivars available from each species. Identifying species can be challenging as plants are often sold under marketing names, older synonyms, or under names that have not been officially accepted. This is the case, for example, with &quot;Peperomia orba&quot; (often sold as &quot;Peperomia&quot; &#x27;Pixie&#x27;), &quot;Peperomia viridis&quot;, and &quot;Peperomia axillaris&quot;. In addition to natural species and their cultivars, some artificial hybrid varieties can also be found on the market, such as &quot;Peperomia&quot; &#x27;Hope&#x27; (a cross between &quot;P. deppeana&quot; and &quot;P. quadrifolia&quot;).

Most species need airy, well-draining substrate and want to dry out to some extent or even completely between waterings. A typical reason for losing a peperomia is through root rot caused by over-watering. The tropical, decorative foliage plants, typically enjoy shadier conditions with more humidity. Some might even require a terrarium or a bottle garden to maintain high humidity. The arid climate succulent types should be treated similarly to cacti and other succulents: they can tolerate more light and will survive a dry cold period, during which they are watered only seldomly. The geophytic peperomias are used to experiencing a cold resting period once a year.

===Food and medicine===
Many peperomias are herbs in the sense that their leaves carry a spicy flavour and, when crushed, emit a strong odour. Therefore, some species, such as &quot;Peperomia pellucida&quot; are used in salads and cooking, or to flavour drinks. But it is advised that people should not try to eat the peperomias sold as houseplants.

Some species, including &quot;Peperomia inaequalifolia&quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;Peperomia congona&quot; and &quot;Peperomia pellucida&quot;, are also used in herbal medicine for various health conditions. 
While such folk medicine usage is common in Peru and elsewhere, the possible medicinal qualities of peperomias remain poorly investigated, although there has been a growing interest for the subject recently.

==Propagation==
These plants can be propagated by seeds, by cuttings, or by dividing. &quot;Peperomia&quot; cuttings of many species root easily. 

Cuttings should be taken in spring or summer, with the lower leaves removed and a cut made just below a node. The cuttings are left to dry for about an hour to allow a protective callus tissue to form, preventing rot. Once dried, they can be planted in a well-draining substrate such as perlite or peat moss. Semi-succulent species benefit from bottom heat around 21–24°C (70–75°F), but it is important not to seal the top completely, as excessive humidity can be detrimental. Once roots have formed, the cuttings can be transplanted into 75 mm (3 in) pots or hanging baskets.

Peperomia plants can also be propagated by division, especially clumping species. Division involves separating the plant into smaller sections, each with roots attached, and is best done during repotting in the growing season. Seed propagation is less common due to slower germination but can be achieved by sowing seeds in a well-draining, sterile medium while maintaining warm, humid conditions.

Maintaining warm temperatures (18–24°C) and moderate humidity is essential for successful propagation. Overwatering should be avoided, as Pepperonis are prone to root rot in poorly draining soils.

<text>Herbert Jeffrey Hancock (born April 12, 1940) is an American jazz musician, bandleader, and composer. He started his career with trumpeter Donald Byrd&#x27;s group. Hancock soon joined the Miles Davis Quintet, where he helped to redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section and was one of the primary architects of the post-bop sound. In the 1970s, he experimented with jazz fusion, funk, and electro styles using a wide array of synthesizers and electronics. It was during this time that he released one of his best-known and most influential albums, &quot;Head Hunters&quot;.

Hancock&#x27;s best-known compositions include &quot;Cantaloupe Island&quot;, &quot;Watermelon Man&quot;, &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;, and &quot;Chameleon&quot;, all of which are jazz standards. During the 1980s, he had a hit single with the electronic instrumental &quot;Rockit&quot;, a collaboration with bassist/producer Bill Laswell. Hancock has won an Academy Award and 14 Grammy Awards including Album of the Year for his 2007 Joni Mitchell tribute album &quot;&quot;. In 2024, Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked Hancock as the greatest keyboard player of all time.

Since 2012, Hancock has served as a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he teaches at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. He is also the chairman of the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz (known as the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz until 2019).

== Early life ==
Hancock was born in Chicago, the son of Winnie Belle (née Griffin), a secretary, and Wayman Edward Hancock, a meat inspector for the government. His parents named him after the singer and actor Herb Jeffries. He attended Hyde Park High School in Chicago. Like many jazz pianists, Herbie began with a classical education. He started playing piano when he was seven years old, and his talent was recognized when he was young. Considered to be a child prodigy, he played the first movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major, K. 537 &quot;(Coronation)&quot; at a young people&#x27;s concert on February 5, 1952, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (led by CSO assistant conductor George Schick) at age 11.

Throughout his teens, Herbie Hancock never had a jazz teacher; he developed his ear and sense of harmony by listening to the records of jazz pianists including George Shearing, Erroll Garner, Bill Evans, and Oscar Peterson. He was also influenced by records of the vocal group the Hi-Lo&#x27;s. In his words:
By the time I actually heard the Hi-Lo&#x27;s, I started picking that stuff out; my ear was happening. I could hear stuff and that&#x27;s when I really learned some much farther-out voicings – like the harmonies I used on &quot;Speak Like a Child&quot; – just being able to do that. I really got that from Clare Fischer&#x27;s arrangements for the Hi-Lo&#x27;s. Clare Fischer was a major influence on my harmonic concept... he and Bill Evans, and Ravel and Gil Evans, finally. You know, that&#x27;s where it came from.

In 1960, Hancock heard Chris Anderson play just once and begged him to accept him as a student. Hancock often mentions Anderson as his harmonic guru.

Hancock graduated from Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa in 1960 with degrees in electrical engineering and music. Hancock then moved to Chicago, and began working with Donald Byrd and Coleman Hawkins. During this time he also took courses at Roosevelt University. Grinnell also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree in 1972. Byrd was attending the Manhattan School of Music in New York at the time and suggested that Hancock study composition with Vittorio Giannini (which he did for a short time in 1960). The pianist quickly earned a reputation, and played subsequent sessions with Oliver Nelson and Phil Woods. Hancock recorded his first solo album, &quot;Takin&#x27; Off&quot;, for Blue Note Records in 1962. &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; (from &quot;Takin&#x27; Off&quot;) was to provide Mongo Santamaría with a hit single, but more importantly for Hancock, &quot;Takin&#x27; Off&quot; caught the attention of Miles Davis, who was at that time assembling a new band. Hancock was introduced to Davis by the young drummer Tony Williams, a member of the new band.

==Career==
=== Miles Davis Quintet (1963–1968) and Blue Note Records (1962–1969) ===
Hancock received considerable attention when, in May 1963, he joined Davis&#x27;s Second Great Quintet. Davis personally sought out Hancock, whom he saw as one of the most promising talents in jazz. The rhythm section Davis organized was young but effective, comprising bassist Ron Carter, 17-year-old drummer Williams, and Hancock on piano. After George Coleman and Sam Rivers each took a turn at the saxophone spot, the quintet gelled with Wayne Shorter on tenor saxophone. This quintet is often regarded as one of the finest jazz ensembles yet.

While in Davis&#x27;s band, Hancock also found time to record dozens of sessions for the Blue Note label, both under his own name and as a sideman with other musicians such as Wayne Shorter, Williams, Grant Green, Bobby Hutcherson, Rivers, Byrd, Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, Freddie Hubbard, and Eric Dolphy. Hancock also recorded several less-well-known but still critically acclaimed albums with larger ensembles – &quot;My Point of View&quot; (1963), &quot;Speak Like a Child&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1969), albums which featured flugelhorn, alto flute and bass trombone in addition to the traditional jazz instrumentation. 1963&#x27;s &quot;Inventions and Dimensions&quot; was an album of almost entirely improvised music, teaming Hancock with bassist Paul Chambers and two Latin percussionists, Willie Bobo and Osvaldo &quot;Chihuahua&quot; Martinez.

During that period, Hancock also composed the score to Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s film &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966), the first of many film soundtracks he recorded in his career. As well as feature film soundtracks, Hancock recorded a number of musical themes used on American television commercials for such then-well-known products as Pillsbury&#x27;s Space Food Sticks, Standard Oil, Tab diet cola, and Virginia Slims cigarettes. Hancock also wrote, arranged and conducted a spy type theme for a series of F. William Free commercials for Silva Thins cigarettes. Hancock liked it so much he wished to record it as a song but the ad agency would not let him. He rewrote the harmony, tempo and tone and recorded the piece as the track &quot;He Who Lives in Fear&quot; from his &quot;The Prisoner&quot; album of 1969.

Davis had begun incorporating elements of rock and popular music into his recordings by the end of Hancock&#x27;s tenure with the band. Despite some initial reluctance, Hancock began doubling on electric keyboards, including the Fender Rhodes electric piano at Davis&#x27;s insistence. Hancock adapted quickly to the new instruments, which proved to be important in his future artistic endeavors. Under the pretext that he had returned late from a honeymoon in Brazil, Hancock was dismissed from Davis&#x27; band. In the summer of 1968 Hancock formed his own sextet. Although Davis soon disbanded his quintet to search for a new sound, Hancock, despite his departure from the working band, continued to appear on Davis records for the next few years. His appearances included &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;, &quot;A Tribute to Jack Johnson,&quot; and &quot;On the Corner&quot;.

=== &quot;Fat Albert&quot; (1969) and Mwandishi era (1971–1973) ===

Hancock left Blue Note in 1969, signing with Warner Bros. Records. In 1969, Hancock composed the soundtrack for Bill Cosby&#x27;s animated prime-time television special &quot;Hey, Hey, Hey, It&#x27;s Fat Albert&quot;. Music from the soundtrack was later included on &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; (1969), an R&amp;B-inspired album with strong jazz overtones. One of the jazzier songs on the record, the moody ballad &quot;Tell Me a Bedtime Story&quot;, was later re-worked as a more electronic sounding song for the Quincy Jones album &quot;Sounds...and Stuff Like That!!&quot; (1978).

Hancock became fascinated with electronic musical instruments. Together with the profound influence of Davis&#x27;s &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; (1970), this fascination culminated in a series of albums in which electronic instruments were coupled with acoustic instruments. Hancock&#x27;s first ventures into electronic music started with a sextet comprising Hancock, bassist Buster Williams and drummer Billy Hart, and a trio of horn players: Eddie Henderson (trumpet), Julian Priester (trombone), and multireedist Bennie Maupin. Patrick Gleeson was eventually added to the mix to play and program the synthesizers.

The sextet, later a septet with the addition of Gleeson, made three albums under Hancock&#x27;s name: &quot;Mwandishi&quot; (1971), &quot;Crossings&quot; (1972) (both on Warner Bros. Records), and &quot;Sextant&quot; (1973) (released on Columbia Records); two more, &quot;Realization&quot; and &quot;Inside Out&quot;, were recorded under Henderson&#x27;s name with essentially the same personnel. The music exhibited strong improvisational aspect beyond the confines of jazz mainstream and showed influence from the electronic music of contemporary classical composers. Hancock&#x27;s three records released in 1971–73 later became known as the &quot;Mwandishi&quot; albums, so-called after a Swahili name Hancock sometimes used during this era (&quot;Mwandishi&quot; is Swahili for &quot;writer&quot;). The first two, including &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; were made available on the 2-CD set &quot;Mwandishi: the Complete Warner Bros. Recordings&quot;, released in 1994. &quot;Hornets&quot; was later revised on the 2001 album &quot;Future2Future&quot; as &quot;Virtual Hornets&quot;.

Among the instruments Hancock and Gleeson used were Fender Rhodes piano, ARP Odyssey, ARP 2600, ARP Pro Soloist Synthesizer, a Mellotron and the Moog synthesizer III.

=== From &quot;Head Hunters&quot; (1973) to &quot;Secrets&quot; (1976) ===

Hancock formed the Headhunters, keeping only Maupin from the sextet and adding bassist Paul Jackson, percussionist Bill Summers, and drummer Harvey Mason. The album &quot;Head Hunters&quot; (1973) was a hit, crossing over to pop audiences but criticized within his jazz audience. Stephen Erlewine, in a retrospective summary for AllMusic, said, &quot;&quot;Head Hunters&quot; still sounds fresh and vital three decades after its initial release, and its genre-bending proved vastly influential on not only jazz, but funk, soul, and hip-hop.&quot;

Drummer Mason was replaced by Mike Clark, and the band released a second album, &quot;Thrust&quot;, in 1974. (A live album from a Japan performance, consisting of compositions from those first two &quot;Head Hunters&quot; releases was released in 1975 as &quot;Flood&quot;). This was almost as well received as its predecessor, if not attaining the same level of commercial success. The Headhunters made another successful album called &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; in 1975 without Hancock, while Hancock himself started to make even more commercial albums, often featuring members of the band, but no longer billed as the Headhunters. The Headhunters reunited with Hancock in 1998 for &quot;Return of the Headhunters&quot;, and a version of the band (featuring Jackson and Clark) continues to play and record.

In 1973, Hancock composed his soundtrack to the controversial film &quot;The Spook Who Sat by the Door&quot;. In the following year he composed the soundtrack to the first &quot;Death Wish&quot; film. One of his songs, &quot;Joanna&#x27;s Theme&quot;, was re-recorded in 1997 on his duet album with Shorter, &quot;1+1&quot;. Hancock&#x27;s next jazz-funk albums of the 1970s were &quot;Man-Child&quot; (1975) and &quot;Secrets&quot; (1976), which point toward the more commercial direction Hancock would take over the next decade. These albums feature the members of the Headhunters band, but also a variety of other musicians in important roles.

=== From &quot;V.S.O.P.&quot; (1976) to &quot;Future Shock&quot; (1983) ===

In 1978, Hancock recorded a duet with Chick Corea, who replaced him in the Davis band a decade earlier. Hancock also released a solo acoustic piano album, &quot;The Piano&quot; (1979), which was released only in Japan. (It was released in the US in 2004). Other Japan-only albums include &quot;Dedication&quot; (1974), &quot;&quot; (1977), and &quot;Direct Step&quot; (1978). &quot;&quot; was a VSOP album remastered for the US in 2004 and included a second concert from the tour in July 1979.

From 1978 to 1982, Hancock recorded many albums of jazz-inflected disco and pop music, beginning with &quot;Sunlight&quot; (featuring guest musicians including Williams and Pastorius on the last track) (1978). Singing through a vocoder, he earned a British hit, &quot;I Thought It Was You&quot;, although critics were unimpressed. This led to more vocoder on his next album, &quot;Feets, Don&#x27;t Fail Me Now&quot; (1979), which gave him another UK hit in &quot;You Bet Your Love&quot;.

Hancock toured with Williams and Carter in 1981, recording &quot;Herbie Hancock Trio&quot;, a five-track album released only in Japan. A month later, he recorded &quot;Quartet&quot; with trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, released in the US the following year. Hancock, Williams, and Carter toured internationally with Wynton Marsalis and his brother, saxophonist Branford Marsalis, in what was known as &quot;VSOP II&quot;. This quintet can be heard on Wynton Marsalis&#x27;s debut album on Columbia (1981). In 1984 VSOP II performed at the Playboy Jazz Festival as a sextet with Hancock, Williams, Carter, the Marsalis Brothers, and Bobby McFerrin. In 1982, Hancock contributed to the album &quot;New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)&quot; by Simple Minds, playing a synthesizer solo on the track &quot;Hunter and the Hunted&quot;.

In 1983, Hancock had a pop hit with the Grammy Award-winning single &quot;Rockit&quot; from the album &quot;Future Shock&quot;. It was the first jazz hip-hop song and became a worldwide anthem for breakdancers and for hip-hop in the 1980s. It was the first mainstream single to feature scratching, and also featured an innovative animated music video, which was directed by Godley and Creme and showed several robot-like artworks by Jim Whiting. The video was a hit on MTV and reached No. 8 in the UK. The video won in five categories at the inaugural MTV Video Music Awards. This single ushered in a collaboration with noted bassist and producer Bill Laswell. Hancock experimented with electronic music on a string of three LPs produced by Laswell: &quot;Future Shock&quot; (1983), the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Sound-System&quot; (1984), and &quot;Perfect Machine&quot; (1988).

During that period he appeared onstage at the Grammy Awards with Stevie Wonder, Howard Jones, and Thomas Dolby, in a synthesizer jam. Lesser known works from the 1980s are the live album &quot;Jazz Africa&quot; (1987) and the studio album &quot;Village Life&quot; (1984), which were recorded with Gambian kora player Foday Musa Suso. In 1985, Hancock performed as a guest on the album &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; (1985) by the Duran Duran spinoff group Arcadia. He also provided introductory and closing comments for the PBS rebroadcast in the United States of the BBC educational series from the mid-1980s, &quot;Rockschool&quot; (not to be confused with the most recent &quot;Gene Simmons&#x27; Rock School&quot; series).

In 1986, Hancock performed and acted in the film &quot;Round Midnight&quot;. He also wrote the score/soundtrack, for which he won an Academy Award for Original Music Score. His film work was prolific during the 1980s, and included the scores to &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot; (1984), &quot;Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling&quot; (1986), &quot;Action Jackson&quot; (1988 with Michael Kamen), &quot;Colors&quot; (1988), and the Eddie Murphy comedy &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; (1989). He would also write music for television commercials, with &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; starting out as a cologne advertisement. At the end of the &quot;Perfect Machine&quot; tour, Hancock decided to leave Columbia Records after a 15-plus-year relationship.

=== 1990s to 2000 ===

The departure led to a hiatus from recording and the release of several compilations during the first half of the 1990s. He returned with Carter, Williams, Shorter, and Davis admirer Wallace Roney to record &quot;A Tribute to Miles&quot;, which was released in 1994. The album contained two live recordings and studio recording songs, with Roney playing Davis&#x27;s part as trumpet player. The album won a Grammy for best group album. Hancock also toured with Jack DeJohnette, Dave Holland, and Pat Metheny in 1990 on their &quot;Parallel Realities&quot; tour which included a performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in July 1990, and scored the 1991 comedy film &quot;Livin&#x27; Large&quot;, which starred Terrence C. Carson.

Hancock&#x27;s next album, &quot;Dis Is da Drum&quot;, released in 1994 is a return to acid jazz. Also in 1994, he appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In 1995, &#x27;the release of &quot;The New Standard&quot; had Hancock and an all-star band including John Scofield, DeJohnette and Michael Brecker, interpreting pop songs by Nirvana, Stevie Wonder, the Beatles, Prince, Peter Gabriel, and others.

A 1997 duet album with Shorter, &quot;1+1&quot;, was successful; the song &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi&quot; winning the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. Hancock also achieved great success in 1998 with his album &quot;Gershwin&#x27;s World&quot;, which featured readings of George and Ira Gershwin standards by Hancock and a plethora of guest stars including Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell and Shorter. Hancock toured the world in support of &quot;Gershwin&#x27;s World&quot; with a sextet featuring Cyro Baptista, Terri Lynne Carrington, Ira Coleman, Eli Degibri, and Eddie Henderson.

=== 2000 to 2009 ===
In 2001, Hancock recorded &quot;Future2Future&quot;, which reunited Hancock with Laswell and featured doses of electronica as well as turntablist Rob Swift of the X-Ecutioners. Hancock later toured with the band, and released a concert DVD with a different lineup, which also included the &quot;Rockit&quot; music video. Also in 2001 Hancock partnered with Brecker and Roy Hargrove to record a live concert album saluting Davis and John Coltrane, &quot;Directions in Music: Live at Massey Hall&quot;, recorded live in Toronto. The threesome toured to support the album, and toured on-and-off through 2005.
A duet album called &quot;Possibilities&quot; was released in 2005. It featured duets with Carlos Santana, Paul Simon, Annie Lennox, John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Sting, and others. In 2006, &quot;Possibilities&quot; was nominated for Grammy Awards in two categories: &quot;A Song for You&quot; (featuring Aguilera) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, and &quot;Gelo No Montanha&quot; (featuring Trey Anastasio on guitar) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Performance, although neither nomination resulted in an award.

Also in 2005, Hancock toured Europe with a new quartet that included Beninese guitarist Lionel Loueke and explored textures ranging from ambient to straight jazz to African music. During the summer, Hancock re-staffed the Headhunters and went on tour with them, including a performance at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. The lineup did not consist of any of the original Headhunters musicians. The group included Marcus Miller, Carrington, Loueke, and Mayer. Hancock also served as the first artist in residence for Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee that summer.

In 2006, Sony BMG Music Entertainment (which bought out Hancock&#x27;s old label, Columbia Records) released the two-disc retrospective &quot;The Essential Herbie Hancock&quot;. This set was the first compilation of his work at Warner Bros., Blue Note, Columbia and Verve/Polygram. This became Hancock&#x27;s second major compilation of work since the 2002 Columbia-only &quot;The Herbie Hancock Box&quot;, which was released at first in a plastic 4 × 4 cube then re-released in 2004 in a long box set. Also in 2006, Hancock recorded a new song with Josh Groban and Eric Mouquet (co-founder of Deep Forest), &quot;Machine&quot;, which featured on Groban&#x27;s album &quot;Awake&quot;. Hancock also recorded and improvised with guitarist Loueke on Loueke&#x27;s 1996 debut album &quot;Virgin Forest&quot;, on the ObliqSound label, resulting in two improvisational tracks – &quot;Le Réveil des agneaux (The Awakening of the Lambs)&quot; and &quot;La Poursuite du lion (The Lion&#x27;s Pursuit)&quot;.

Hancock, a longtime associate and friend of Joni Mitchell, released a 2007 album, &quot;&quot;, that paid tribute to her work, with Norah Jones, Tina Turner, and Corinne Bailey Rae adding vocals to the album. Leonard Cohen contributed a spoken piece set to Hancock&#x27;s piano. Mitchell herself also made an appearance. The album was released on September 25, 2007, simultaneously with the release of Mitchell&#x27;s album &quot;Shine&quot;. &quot;River&quot; won the 2008 Album of the Year Grammy Award. The album also won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album, and the song &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; was nominated for Best Instrumental Jazz Solo, which made it only the second time in history that a jazz album won those two Grammy Awards.

On June 14, 2008, Hancock performed with others at Rhythm on the Vine at the South Coast Winery in Temecula, California for Shriners Hospitals for Children. The event raised $515,000 for Shriners Hospital. On January 18, 2009, Hancock performed at the We Are One concert, marking the start of inaugural celebrations for American President Barack Obama. Hancock also performed &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; at the 2009 Classical BRIT Awards with classical pianist Lang Lang. Hancock was named as the Los Angeles Philharmonic&#x27;s creative chair for jazz for 2010–12.

=== 2010 to present ===
In June 2010, Hancock released &quot;The Imagine Project&quot;. On June 5, 2010, he received an Alumni Award from his alma mater Grinnell College. On July 22, 2011, at a ceremony in Paris, he was named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the promotion of Intercultural Dialogue. In 2013, Hancock joined the University of California, Los Angeles faculty as a professor in the UCLA music department teaching jazz music.

In a June 2010 interview with Michael Gallant of &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine, Hancock talks about his Fazioli giving him inspiration to do things. On December 8, 2013, Hancock was given the Kennedy Center Honors Award for achievement in the performing arts. Terence Blanchard was the musical director and arranged Hancock compositions for performances with artists like Wayne Shorter, Joshua Redman, Vinnie Colaiuta, Lionel Loueke, and Aaron Parks. Snoop Dogg performed a mash-up of the US3 arrangement of Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Cantaloupe Island&quot; and his own &quot;Gin and Juice&quot;. Mixmaster Mike from the Beastie Boys was featured on a rendition of Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Rockit&quot;.

Hancock appeared on the album &quot;You&#x27;re Dead!&quot; by Flying Lotus, released in October 2014. He was the 2014 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University. Holders of the chair deliver a series of six lectures on poetry, &quot;The Norton Lectures&quot;, poetry being &quot;interpreted in the broadest sense, including all poetic expression in language, music, or fine arts&quot;. Previous Norton lecturers include musicians Leonard Bernstein, Igor Stravinsky, and John Cage. Hancock&#x27;s theme is &quot;The Ethics of Jazz&quot;.

Hancock&#x27;s next album is being produced by Terrace Martin, and will feature a broad variety of jazz and hip-hop artists including Wayne Shorter, Kendrick Lamar, Kamasi Washington, Thundercat, Flying Lotus, Lionel Loueke, Zakir Hussein, and Snoop Dogg. On May 15, 2015, Hancock received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Washington University in St. Louis. On May 19, 2018, he received an honorary degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. On June 26, 2022, he performed at the Glastonbury Festival. He was featured on the track &quot;MOON&quot; by the jazz duo Domi and JD Beck on their debut album &quot;NOT TiGHT&quot;, released July 29, 2022. On February 4, 2023, he performed at the Arise Fashion Week &amp; Jazz Festival at Eko Hotel in Lagos, Nigeria.

==Personal life==
Hancock has been married to Gigi Hancock () since 1968 and the couple have a daughter. In a 2019 interview, Herbie said: &quot;Gigi is very compassionate. She really cares about other people. She spends most of her time helping her friends. She has a big heart. At the same time she won&#x27;t let you get away with anything. If you try to sneak something past her, she&#x27;ll call you on it in a second. She got me into the pop art scene in New York in the 1960s and I introduced her to my jazz world&quot;.

In 1985, Herbie Hancock&#x27;s sister, Jean, a computer consultant and a lyricist who wrote for him, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Dianne Reeves, and Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s was killed in the crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191.

In his memoir &quot;Possibilities&quot;, written with Lisa Dickey and published in 2014, Herbie Hancock revealed he previously battled an addiction to crack cocaine in the 1990s and that his wife and daughter helped him get sober: &quot;This was an intervention, and I was so embarrassed, but there was another feeling creeping in, too: relief. I had been struggling with this habit, and this secret, for so long. I looked at my daughter and sobbed, wondering how I had gotten to this place but thankful that it was finally going to end&quot;. Since 1972, Hancock has practiced Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International. As part of Hancock&#x27;s spiritual practice, he recites the Buddhist chant &quot;Nam Myoho Renge Kyo&quot; each day. In 2013, Hancock&#x27;s dialogue with musician Wayne Shorter and Soka Gakkai International president Daisaku Ikeda on jazz, Buddhism and life was published in Japanese and English, then in French.
In 2014, Hancock delivered a lecture at Harvard University titled &quot;Buddhism and Creativity&quot; as part of his Norton Lecture series.

===Cobra automobile ownership===
In 1963, at the age of 23, Hancock purchased a new 1963 AC Shelby Cobra from a dealership in New York City for $6,000. He is still its owner and thus the longest owner of a Cobra. The car, serial number CSX2006, was the sixth Cobra ever produced, making it a rare and valuable vehicle. It is one of only 75 Cobras originally produced with a 260 cubic-inch engine and the only Cobra ever equipped with a two-barrel carburetor. The car has been estimated to be worth more than $2 million. Hancock plans to give the car to his grandson.

<text>Mystery plays and miracle plays (they are distinguished as two different forms although the terms are often used interchangeably) are among the earliest formally developed plays in medieval Europe. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of Bible stories in churches as tableaux with accompanying antiphonal song. They told of subjects such as the Creation, Adam and Eve, the murder of Abel, and the Last Judgment. Often they were performed together in cycles which could last for days. The name derives from &quot;mystery&quot; used in its sense of &quot;miracle,&quot; but an occasionally quoted derivation is from &quot;ministerium&quot;, meaning &quot;craft&quot;, and so the &#x27;mysteries&#x27; or plays performed by the craft guilds.

==Origins==

As early as the fifth century, living tableaux were introduced into sacred services. The plays originated as simple &quot;tropes&quot;, verbal embellishments of liturgical texts, and slowly became more elaborate. At an early period chants from the service of the day were added to the prose dialogue. As these liturgical plays increased in popularity, vernacular forms emerged, and travelling companies of actors and theatrical productions became common in the later Middle Ages.

The &quot;Quem quaeritis?&quot; is the best known early form of the dramas. It is a schematic dialogue between the angel at the tomb of Christ and the women who are seeking his dead body. Early forms of the responsorium were later elaborated with dialogue and dramatic action. Early performances were given in Latin, and were preceded by a vernacular prologue spoken by a herald who gave a synopsis of the events. The writers and directors of the earliest plays were probably monks or clerics.

In 1210, suspicious of the growing popularity of miracle plays, Pope Innocent III issued a papal edict forbidding clergy from acting on a public stage. This had the effect of transferring the organization of the dramas to town guilds, after which several changes followed. Vernacular texts replaced Latin, and non-Biblical passages were added along with comic scenes, for example in the &quot;Secunda Pastorum&quot; of the Wakefield Cycle. Acting and characterization became more elaborate.

These vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as York, performed and produced by guilds, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin &quot;ministerium&quot; meaning &quot;occupation&quot; (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned as a result of the Reformation and the establishment of the Church of England in 1534.

The mystery play developed, in some places, into a series of plays dealing with major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the practice of acting these plays in cycles on festival days was established in several parts of Europe. Sometimes, each play was performed on a decorated pageant cart that moved about the city to allow different crowds to watch each play. The entire cycle could take up to twenty hours to perform and could be spread over a number of days. Taken as a whole, these are referred to as &quot;Corpus Christi cycles&quot;. These cycles were often performed during the Feast of Corpus Christi.

The plays were performed by a combination of clerics and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by extravagant sets and special effects, but could also be stark and intimate. There was a wide variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays.

==English mystery plays==

There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays. A collection is the &quot;York cycle&quot; of forty-eight pageants; there are also the &quot;Towneley plays&quot; of thirty-two pageants; the Ludus Coventriae; and the &quot;Chester cycle&quot; of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament cycle acted at Coventry. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of Mary Magdalene, &quot;The Brome Abraham and Isaac&quot; and a sixteenth-century play of the &quot;Conversion of Saint Paul&quot; exist. Besides the Middle English drama, there are a few surviving plays in Cornish: namely, the Ordinalia (which is a cycle of three plays) and Pascon Agan Aruth which both tell biblical stories, and Bewnans Ke and Bewnans Meriasek, which tell the stories of the lives of saints.

These biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the &quot;Fall of Lucifer&quot;, the &quot;Creation and Fall of Man&quot;, &quot;Cain and Abel&quot;, &quot;Noah and the Flood&quot;, &quot;Abraham and Isaac&quot;, the &quot;Nativity&quot;, the &quot;Raising of Lazarus&quot;, the &quot;Passion&quot;, and the &quot;Resurrection&quot;. Other pageants included the story of &quot;Moses&quot;, the &quot;Procession of the Prophets&quot;, &quot;Christ&#x27;s Baptism&quot;, the &quot;Temptation in the Wilderness&quot;, and the &quot;Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin&quot;. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval craft guilds. The York mercers, for example, sponsored the &quot;Doomsday&quot; pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the Ark from the carpenters&#x27; guild; the five loaves and fishes miracle from the bakers; and the visit of the Magi, with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths. The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on pageant wagons. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the &quot;Second Shepherds&#x27; Play&quot; to Horbery Shrogys is strongly suggestive. In &quot;The London Burial Grounds&quot; by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to St Katherine Cree on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.

==Spanish mystery plays==

The oldest liturgical drama in Spain is from the 12th century and kept today in Toledo Cathedral. It is a play about the Biblical Magi, three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. It is believed to have been based on an earlier play written in France.

The Misteri d&#x27;Elx (in English, the Elx Mystery Play or Mystery Play of Elx) is a liturgical drama dating from the 13th century which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa María in the city of Elx (also known as Elche). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the Council of Trent eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 Pope Urban VIII issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

==Miracle play==
Miracle plays, or Saint&#x27;s plays, are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the saints, particularly Saint Nicholas or St. Mary, rather than biblical events. Robert Chambers, writing in the 19th century, notes that &quot;especially in England, miracle [came] to stand for religious play in general&quot;.

Cornish language miracle plays, particularly the &quot;Ordinalia&quot; trilogy, the &quot;Beunans Meriasek&quot;, and the &quot;Bewnans Ke&quot;, were traditionally performed at the plain-an-gwarrys. To capture the attention of the audience, &quot;the plays were often noisy, bawdy and entertaining.&quot;

==Modern performances==
Attention to the Medieval Mystery plays began to grow during the early 1800s, after their reference and publication by William Hone and James Heywood Markland. Notably, poet Lord Byron wrote the plays Cain and Heaven and Earth: A Mystery as modern version of medieval dramas on similar subjects. Mystery plays are produced regularly throughout the United Kingdom. The local cycles were revived in both York and Chester in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain, and are still performed by the local guilds. The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the Lincoln mystery plays, and in 1994 the Lichfield Mysteries were revived.

In 1977 the National Theatre commissioned Tony Harrison to create &quot;The Mysteries&quot;, a re-working of the Wakefield Cycle and others. It was again revived in 1985 (the production was filmed for Channel 4 Television), and as a part of the theatre&#x27;s millennium celebration in 2000. The productions won Bill Bryden the Best Director title in both the 1985 &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Awards and the 1985 Laurence Olivier Awards, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the Lyceum Theatre.

In 2001, the Isango Ensemble produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the Garrick Theatre in London as &quot;The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso&quot;, performing in a combination of the Xhosa language, Zulu, English, Latin, and Afrikaans. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in 2015 as &quot;The Mysteries&quot;. In 2004, two mystery plays (one focusing on the Creation and the other on the Passion) were performed at Canterbury Cathedral, with actor Edward Woodward in the role of God. The large cast also included Daniel MacPherson, Thomas James Longley and Joseph McManners.

<doc id="38128" wikidata="Q190546" url="?curid=38128" title="Cauchy–Schwarz inequality">
<text>The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality (also called Cauchy–Bunyakovsky–Schwarz inequality) is an upper bound on the inner product between two vectors in an inner product space in terms of the product of the vector norms. It is considered one of the most important and widely used inequalities in mathematics.

Inner products of vectors can describe finite sums (via finite-dimensional vector spaces), infinite series (via vectors in sequence spaces), and integrals (via vectors in Hilbert spaces). The inequality for sums was published by . The corresponding inequality for integrals was published by and . Schwarz gave the modern proof of the integral version.

== Statement of the inequality ==
The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors formula_1 and formula_2 of an inner product space
where formula_3 is the inner product. Examples of inner products include the real and complex dot product; see the examples in inner product. Every inner product gives rise to a Euclidean formula_4 norm, called the or , where the norm of a vector formula_1 is denoted and defined by
formula_6 where formula_7 is always a non-negative real number (even if the inner product is complex-valued). 
By taking the square root of both sides of the above inequality, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality can be written in its more familiar form in terms of the norm:

Moreover, the two sides are equal if and only if formula_1 and formula_2 are linearly dependent.

== Special cases ==

=== Sedrakyan&#x27;s lemma – positive real numbers ===
Sedrakyan&#x27;s inequality, also known as Bergström&#x27;s inequality, Engel&#x27;s form, Titu&#x27;s lemma (or the T2 lemma), states that for real numbers formula_10 and positive real numbers formula_11:
formula_12
or, using summation notation,
formula_13

It is a direct consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, obtained by using the dot product on formula_14 upon substituting formula_15 and formula_16. This form is especially helpful when the inequality involves fractions where the numerator is a perfect square.

=== - The plane ===

The real vector space formula_17 denotes the 2-dimensional plane. It is also the 2-dimensional Euclidean space where the inner product is the dot product. 
If formula_18 and formula_19 then the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality becomes:
formula_20
where formula_21 is the angle between formula_1 and formula_2.

The form above is perhaps the easiest in which to understand the inequality, since the square of the cosine can be at most 1, which occurs when the vectors are in the same or opposite directions. It can also be restated in terms of the vector coordinates formula_24, formula_25, formula_26, and formula_27 as
formula_28
where equality holds if and only if the vector formula_29 is in the same or opposite direction as the vector formula_30, or if one of them is the zero vector.

=== : &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space ===
In Euclidean space formula_14 with the standard inner product, which is the dot product, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality becomes:
formula_32

The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality can be proved using only elementary algebra in this case by observing that the difference of the right and the left hand side is 
formula_33 

or by considering the following quadratic polynomial in formula_34
formula_35

Since the latter polynomial is nonnegative, it has at most one real root, hence its discriminant is less than or equal to zero. That is,
formula_36

=== : &quot;n&quot;-dimensional complex space===
If formula_37 with formula_38 and formula_39 (where formula_40 and formula_41) and if the inner product on the vector space formula_42 is the canonical complex inner product (defined by formula_43 where the bar notation is used for complex conjugation), then the inequality may be restated more explicitly as follows: 
formula_44

That is,
formula_45

For the inner product space of square-integrable complex-valued functions, the following inequality holds.
formula_46

The Hölder inequality is a generalization of this.

== Applications ==

=== Analysis ===
In any inner product space, the triangle inequality is a consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, as is now shown: 
formula_47

Taking square roots gives the triangle inequality:
formula_48

The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is used to prove that the inner product is a continuous function with respect to the topology induced by the inner product itself.

=== Geometry ===
The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality allows one to extend the notion of &quot;angle between two vectors&quot; to any real inner-product space by defining:
formula_49

The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality proves that this definition is sensible, by showing that the right-hand side lies in the interval and justifies the notion that (real) Hilbert spaces are simply generalizations of the Euclidean space. It can also be used to define an angle in complex inner-product spaces, by taking the absolute value or the real part of the right-hand side, as is done when extracting a metric from quantum fidelity.

=== Probability theory ===
Let formula_50 and formula_51 be random variables. Then the covariance inequality is given by:
formula_52

After defining an inner product on the set of random variables using the expectation of their product,
formula_53
the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality becomes
formula_54

To prove the covariance inequality using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, let formula_55 and formula_56 then
formula_57
where formula_58 denotes variance and formula_59 denotes covariance.

==Proofs==

There are many different proofs of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality other than those given below. 
When consulting other sources, there are often two sources of confusion. First, some authors define to be linear in the second argument rather than the first. 
Second, some proofs are only valid when the field is formula_60 and not formula_61

This section gives two proofs of the following theorem:


In both of the proofs given below, the proof in the trivial case where at least one of the vectors is zero (or equivalently, in the case where formula_62) is the same. It is presented immediately below only once to reduce repetition. It also includes the easy part of the proof of the Equality Characterization given above; that is, it proves that if formula_1 and formula_2 are linearly dependent then formula_65 

By definition, formula_1 and formula_2 are linearly dependent if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other. 
If formula_68 where formula_69 is some scalar then 
formula_70

which shows that equality holds in the . 
The case where formula_71 for some scalar formula_69 follows from the previous case:
formula_73

In particular, if at least one of formula_1 and formula_2 is the zero vector then formula_1 and formula_2 are necessarily linearly dependent (for example, if formula_78 then formula_68 where formula_80), so the above computation shows that the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality holds in this case. 
Consequently, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality only needs to be proven only for non-zero vectors and also only the non-trivial direction of the Equality Characterization must be shown. 

===Proof via the Pythagorean theorem===

The special case of formula_81 was proven above so it is henceforth assumed that formula_82 
Let
formula_83

It follows from the linearity of the inner product in its first argument that:
formula_84

Therefore, formula_85 is a vector orthogonal to the vector formula_2 (Indeed, formula_85 is the projection of formula_1 onto the plane orthogonal to formula_89) We can thus apply the Pythagorean theorem to
formula_90
which gives
formula_91

The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality follows by multiplying by formula_92 and then taking the square root. 
Moreover, if the relation formula_93 in the above expression is actually an equality, then formula_94 and hence formula_95 the definition of formula_85 then establishes a relation of linear dependence between formula_1 and formula_89 The converse was proved at the beginning of this section, so the proof is complete. formula_99

===Proof by analyzing a quadratic===

Consider an arbitrary pair of vectors formula_100. Define the function formula_101 defined by formula_102, where formula_103 is a complex number satisfying formula_104 and formula_105.
Such an formula_103 exists since if formula_107 then formula_103 can be taken to be 1.

Since the inner product is positive-definite, formula_109 only takes non-negative real values. On the other hand, formula_109 can be expanded using the bilinearity of the inner product:
formula_111
Thus, formula_112 is a polynomial of degree formula_113 (unless formula_114 which is a case that was checked earlier). Since the sign of formula_112 does not change, the discriminant of this polynomial must be non-positive:
formula_116
The conclusion follows.

For the equality case, notice that formula_117 happens if and only if formula_118 If formula_119 then formula_120 and hence formula_121

== Generalizations ==
Various generalizations of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality exist. Hölder&#x27;s inequality generalizes it to formula_122 norms. More generally, it can be interpreted as a special case of the definition of the norm of a linear operator on a Banach space (Namely, when the space is a Hilbert space). Further generalizations are in the context of operator theory, e.g. for operator-convex functions and operator algebras, where the domain and/or range are replaced by a C*-algebra or W*-algebra.

An inner product can be used to define a positive linear functional. For example, given a Hilbert space formula_123 being a finite measure, the standard inner product gives rise to a positive functional formula_124 by formula_125 Conversely, every positive linear functional formula_124 on formula_127 can be used to define an inner product formula_128 where formula_129 is the pointwise complex conjugate of formula_130 In this language, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality becomes
formula_131

which extends verbatim to positive functionals on C*-algebras:

The next two theorems are further examples in operator algebra.

This extends the fact formula_132 when formula_124 is a linear functional. The case when formula_134 is self-adjoint, that is, formula_135 is sometimes known as Kadison&#x27;s inequality.

Another generalization is a refinement obtained by interpolating between both sides of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality: 

This theorem can be deduced from Hölder&#x27;s inequality. There are also non-commutative versions for operators and tensor products of matrices.

Several matrix versions of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and Kantorovich inequality are applied to linear regression models.

<text>HM Prison Maze (previously Long Kesh Detention Centre, and known colloquially as the Maze or H-Blocks) was a prison and internment camp in Northern Ireland that was used to house paramilitary prisoners during the Troubles from August 1971 to September 2000. On 15 October 1974 Irish Republican internees burned 21 of the compounds used to house the internees thereby destroying much of Long Kesh.

The prison was situated at the former Royal Air Force station of Long Kesh, on the outskirts of Lisburn. This was in the townland of Maze, about southwest of Belfast. The prison and its inmates were involved in such events as the 1981 hunger strike. The prison was closed in 2000 and demolition began on 30 October 2006, but on 18 April 2013 it was announced by the Northern Ireland Executive that the remaining buildings would be redeveloped into a peace centre, however these plans were later abandoned.

==Background==
Following the introduction of internment in 1971, Operation Demetrius was implemented by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army with raids for 452 suspects on 9 August 1971. The RUC and army arrested 342 Irish nationalists, but key Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) members had been tipped off and 104 of those arrested were released when it emerged they had no paramilitary connections. Those behind Operation Demetrius were accused of bungling the raids by arresting many of the wrong people and using out-of-date information. Following nationalist protests, some Ulster loyalists were also arrested. By 1972, there were 924 internees and by the end of internment on 5 December 1975, 1,981 people had been detained; 1,874 (94.6%) of whom were Catholic/Irish nationalist and 107 (5.4%) Ulster Protestants/loyalists.

Initially, the internees were housed with different paramilitary groups separated from each other, in Nissen huts at a disused RAF airfield that became the Long Kesh Detention Centre. The internees and their supporters agitated for improvements in their conditions and status; they saw themselves as political prisoners rather than common criminals. In July 1972, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw introduced Special Category Status for those sentenced for crimes relating to the civil violence. There were 1,100 Special Category Status prisoners at that time.

Special Category Status for convicted paramilitary-linked prisoners gave them the same privileges previously available only to internees. These privileges included free association between prisoners, extra visits, food parcels, and the right to wear their own clothes rather than prison uniforms.

However, Special Category Status was short-lived. As part of a new British policy of &quot;criminalisation&quot; and coinciding with the end of internment, the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, ended Special Category Status from 1 March 1976. Those convicted of &quot;scheduled terrorist offences&quot; after that date were housed in the eight new &quot;H-Blocks&quot; that had been constructed at Long Kesh, now officially named Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison Maze (HMP Maze). Existing prisoners remained in separate compounds and retained their Special Category Status with the last prisoner to hold this status being released in 1986. Some prisoners changed from being Special Category Status prisoners to being common criminals. Brendan Hughes, an IRA prisoner, had been imprisoned with Special Category Status in Cage 11, but was alleged to have been involved in a fight with warders. He was taken to court and convicted then returned to the jail as a common prisoner and incarcerated in the H-Blocks as an ordinary prisoner, all within the space of several hours.

== H-Blocks ==

Prisoners convicted of scheduled offences after 1 March 1976 were housed in the &quot;H-Blocks&quot; that had been newly constructed. Prisoners without Special Category Status began protesting for its return immediately after they were transferred to the H-Blocks. Their first act of defiance, initiated by Kieran Nugent, was to refuse to wear the prison uniforms, stating that convicted criminals, and not political prisoners, wear uniforms. Not allowed their own clothes, they wrapped themselves in bedsheets. Prisoners participating in the protest were &quot;on the blanket&quot;. By 1978, more than 300 men had joined the protest. The British government refused to back down.

In March 1978, some prisoners refused to leave their cells to shower or use the lavatory because they were being beaten when they did, and were provided with wash-hand basins in their cells. Prisoners &quot;on the blanket&quot; reported that one of the things that caused the most stress was &quot;...waiting for the moment the cell door would open and they would be dragged out, naked and defenseless, and then pounded into semi-consciousness before being thrown back in again&quot;.

Republican prisoners were also abused prior to and upon entering the Maze. Writing about the abuse of prisoners Queen&#x27;s University Belfast academic Prof Phil Scraton stated: &quot;...it is evident they endured unacceptable levels of physical and psychological punishment, violence and violation. Administered purposefully, without the checks and balances of state institutional accountability, it constituted cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment/ punishment within the UN General Assembly’s 1975 definition of torture.&quot; In 1978, the British government was found guilty and censured by the European Court of Human Rights for &quot;cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment in the interrogation procedures&quot;.

The prisoners requested that showers be installed in their cells; and when this request was turned down, they refused to use the wash-hand basins. At the end of April 1978, a fight occurred between a prisoner and a prison officer in H-Block 6. The prisoner was taken away to solitary confinement, and rumours spread across the wing that the prisoner had been badly beaten. The prisoners responded by smashing the furniture in their cells, forcing the prison authorities to remove the remaining furniture from the cells, leaving only blankets and mattresses. The prisoners responded by refusing to leave their cells and, as a result, the prison officers were unable to clear them. This resulted in the blanket protest escalating into the dirty protest, as the prisoners would not leave their cells to &quot;slop out&quot; (i.e., empty their chamber pots), and started smearing excrement on the walls of their cells to &quot;mitigate the spread of maggots&quot;.

===Hunger strike===

Republicans outside the prison took the battle to the media and both sides fought for public support. Inside the prison, the prisoners took another step and organised a hunger strike.

On 27 October 1980, seven republican prisoners refused food and demanded political status. The Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher did not initially give in. In December, the prisoners called off the hunger strike when the government appeared to concede to their demands. However, the government immediately reverted to their previous stance, in the belief that the prisoners would not start another strike. Bobby Sands, the leader of the Provisional IRA prisoners, began a second action on 1 March 1981. Outside the prison, in a major publicity coup, Sands was nominated for Parliament and won the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election. But the British government still resisted and on 5 May, after 66 days on hunger strike, Sands died. More than 100,000 people attended Sands&#x27; funeral in Belfast. Another nine hunger strikers (members of both the IRA and the INLA) died by the end of August before the hunger strike was called off in October.

===Breakouts and attempted breakouts===
On 25 September 1983, the Maze saw the biggest prison escape in British peacetime history. Thirty-eight prisoners hijacked a prison meals lorry and smashed their way out. During the breakout, four prison officers were stabbed, including one, James Ferris, who died of a heart attack. Another officer was shot in the head by Gerry Kelly, and several other officers were injured by the escapees. Nineteen of the prisoners were soon recaptured, but the other nineteen escaped.

In March 1997, an IRA escape attempt was foiled when a tunnel was found. The tunnel led from H-Block 7 and was short of the perimeter wall.

In December 1997, IRA prisoner Liam Averill escaped dressed as a woman during a Christmas party for prisoners&#x27; children. Averill, who was jailed for life after committing two murders, was not recaptured, and was instead given amnesty in early 2001 when he was one of a number of republican escapees to present themselves to the authorities in a two-week period.

===Organisation===
During the 1980s, the British government slowly introduced changes, granting what some would see as political status in all but name. Republican and loyalist prisoners were housed according to group. They organised themselves along military lines and exercised wide control over their respective H-Blocks. The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) leader Billy Wright was shot dead in December 1997 by two Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners.

==Peace process==
The prisoners also played a significant role in the Northern Ireland peace process. On 9 January 1998, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, paid a surprise visit to the prison to talk to members of the Ulster Defence Association including Johnny Adair, Sam &quot;Skelly&quot; McCrory and Michael Stone. They had voted for their political representatives to pull out of talks. Shortly after Mowlam&#x27;s visit, they changed their minds, allowing their representatives to continue talks that would lead to the Good Friday Agreement of 10 April 1998. Afterwards, the prison was emptied of its paramilitary prisoners as the groups they represented agreed to the ceasefire. In the two years following the agreement, 428 prisoners were released. On 29 September 2000, the remaining four prisoners at the Maze were transferred to other prisons in Northern Ireland and the Maze Prison was closed.

==Maze Long Kesh Development Corporation==
A monitoring group was set up on 14 January 2003 to debate the future of the site. With close motorway and rail links, there were many proposals, including a museum, a multi-purpose sports stadium and an office, hotel and leisure village.

In January 2006, the government unveiled a masterplan for the site incorporating many of these proposals, including a 45,000 seat national multi-sport stadium for football, rugby and Gaelic games. The Government&#x27;s infrastructure organisation, the Strategic Investment Board (SIB), was tasked with taking forward the proposed stadium idea and appointed one of its senior advisers, Tony Whitehead, to manage the project. The capacity of the proposed stadium was later adjusted to first 35,000 and then 38,000 and the organising bodies of all three sports – Irish FA, Ulster Rugby and Ulster GAA – agreed in principle to support the integrated scheme. In October 2006, demolition work started in preparation for construction on the site.

In January 2009, plans to build the new multi-purpose stadium on the site of the prison were cancelled, with the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Gregory Campbell, citing a lack of support and concerns for a net loss to the economy.

Discussion is still ongoing as to the listed status of sections of the old prison. The hospital and part of the H-Blocks are currently listed buildings, and would remain as part of the proposed site redevelopment as a &quot;conflict transformation centre&quot; with support from republicans such as Martin McGuinness and opposition from unionists, who consider that this risks creating &quot;a shrine to the IRA&quot;.

In January 2013, plans were approved by the Northern Ireland environment minister Alex Attwood for the site to be redeveloped as showgrounds as the result of an application by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society with the objective of relocating Balmoral Show from its current location in Belfast. The site is now known as Balmoral Park.

In October 2019, the European Union withdrew £18m that had been approved to develop a peace centre, due to disagreements between Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party.

In April 2020, the former prison was reportedly under consideration for conversion into a temporary hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel (born 19 February 1963) is an English singer, songwriter and record producer. He is the recipient of three Brit Awards, four Grammy Awards and an MTV Video Music Award, with 20 million albums or singles sold by October 2011. He signed with record producer Trevor Horn&#x27;s ZTT Records to release his eponymous debut studio album (1991). Met with critical and commercial success, it spawned the singles &quot;Crazy&quot; and &quot;Killer&quot;, which peaked at numbers two and one on the UK singles chart, respectively, while both entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. His 1994 single, &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot;, peaked atop the latter chart after its inclusion on the film soundtracks for &quot;The NeverEnding Story III&quot; and &quot;Batman Forever&quot;.

&quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; spawned from Seal&#x27;s second eponymous studio album (1994), which peaked atop the UK Albums Chart along with its predecessor. His following albums—&quot;Human Being&quot; (1998), &quot;Seal IV&quot; (2003), &quot;System&quot; (2007), &quot;Soul&quot; (2008), &quot;Seal 6: Commitment&quot; (2010), &quot;Soul 2&quot; (2011), &quot;7&quot; (2015) and &quot;Standards&quot; (2017)—were each met with critical praise. As a songwriter, Seal has won two Ivor Novello Awards for &quot;Best Song Musically and Lyrically&quot; by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for &quot;Killer&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;.

He served as a coach on &quot;The Voice Australia&quot; in 2012, 2013, and 2017.

==Early life and education==
Seal Henry Olusegun Olumide Adeola Samuel was born on 19 February 1963 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Paddington, London, to a Nigerian mother, Adebisi Ogundeji, and an Afro-Brazilian father, Francis Samuel. He was raised by a foster family in Westminster, London. He received a two-year diploma in architecture and had various jobs in the London area.

==Career==
===Early career===
In the 1980s, Seal spent a short time singing in local clubs and bars. In 1987, he joined Push, a British funk band, and toured with them in Japan. In Thailand, he joined a blues band for a while before separating from the group and journeying throughout India on his own. He returned to England, sleeping on the couch of friend Julian Bunster, then a model. He sometimes asked him, &quot;Do I sing well?&quot;, to which he often received the response that he sang better than most current artists. Then he met the producer Adamski to whom Seal provided lyrics and vocals on Adamski&#x27;s single &quot;Killer&quot;.

===Initial success: 1990s===
&quot;Killer&quot; eventually reached number one in the UK. Seal subsequently signed to ZTT Records and released his self-titled début album (produced by Trevor Horn) in 1991. Two versions of the album are known to be in circulation: the original &quot;premix&quot; version and a second, more common version with an updated mix. This is attributed to the demand for a produced single rushing the final album edit and, as Seal puts it, producer Horn&#x27;s &quot;inability to let go&quot;.

&quot;Seal&quot; was positively received by critics. The singles &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Future Love Paradise&quot; and his own rendition of &quot;Killer&quot; performed well on the charts. In particular, &quot;Crazy&quot; became an international hit in 1991, reaching number two in the UK Singles Chart and number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US. Seal stole the show at the 1992 Brit Awards held at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, with the first hat-trick of wins in the history of the event. He won in three categories: Best British Male, Best British Video (&quot;Killer&quot;) and Best British Album (&quot;Seal&quot;).

In 1992, Seal appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation CD &quot;Red Hot + Dance&quot;, contributing an exclusive track &quot;Crazy (If I Was Trev Mix)&quot;. The album, featuring George Michael and Madonna among others, raised money and awareness in support of the AIDS epidemic by donating all proceeds to AIDS charities.

Jeff Beck and Seal performed a cover of &quot;Manic Depression&quot; for the 1993 album &quot;Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;. Seal also contributed vocals to a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; for the 2010 Herbie Hancock album, &quot;The Imagine Project&quot; along with P!nk, India.Arie, Jeff Beck, Konono Nº1, Oumou Sangaré and others.

After Seal regrouped with Trevor Horn, his second album, also self-titled, was released in 1994. A success, the album featured the singles &quot;Prayer for the Dying&quot; and &quot;Newborn Friend&quot;, and later received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. &quot;Prayer for the Dying&quot; became a minor pop hit in the US, peaking at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A third single, &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot;, performed modestly when released, but was later featured to much wider popularity when it was remixed for the soundtrack to &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1996, becoming Seal&#x27;s best-performing single on the US market (it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in late August 1995) and hit number four in the UK.

In 1998, Seal released &quot;Human Being&quot;. The album was the product of a turbulent time in his life, including a split and later reconciliation with producer Horn, as well as Seal&#x27;s parting with ZTT Records and his signing with Warner Bros. Records in 1997. The record was panned upon its release. It received gold record certification by the RIAA just two months after its release date. The album provided two singles – &quot;Human Beings&quot; and &quot;Lost My Faith&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
In 2001, fans awaited the arrival of a new album, announced as &quot;Togetherland&quot;. After a protracted postproduction period, the album was cancelled. The official word was that Seal simply did not think it made the grade, although this conflicts with other reports, that said the album was turned down by the label because producers felt the album would not be commercially successful. Even so, one single was released from the album; &quot;This Could Be Heaven&quot; was released in the US and featured on &quot;The Family Man&quot; soundtrack. Since December 2006, Seal has indicated that he has plans to excerpt cuts from &quot;Togetherland&quot; and make them available for streaming download. Meanwhile, Seal co-wrote and provided vocals for the hit single &quot;My Vision&quot; from Jakatta in 2002. He also recorded a successful duet with French singer Mylène Farmer called &quot;&quot;Les Mots&quot;&quot; during that same period. Also in 2002, Seal lent his vocals to the song &quot;You Are My Kind&quot;, the fourth track on Santana&#x27;s album &quot;Shaman&quot;.

In 2003, Seal released his fourth album &quot;Seal IV&quot;. Although it never achieved the sales figures of either of his first two albums, this release brought him back into the public eye in the United States and continental Europe. Singles from the album include &quot;Waiting for You&quot;, &quot;Get It Together&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Divine&quot;; the latter was released in 2004 and was a big hit in several European countries.

In 2004, a greatest-hits album entitled &quot;Best 1991–2004&quot; was released, including a cover of the Bacharach/David classic &quot;Walk On By&quot; and a cover of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s &quot;Lips Like Sugar&quot;. An edition of the album was available that included an extra CD with acoustic versions of some of Seal&#x27;s hits. Also in 2004, Seal performed shows at the Olympia Theatre in Paris. The show of 6 July 2004 was recorded and released about one year after as a CD/DVD package, simply titled &quot;Live in Paris&quot;.

In June 2005, Seal recorded a concert which was subsequently released in 2006, entitled &quot;One Night to Remember&quot;, as a CD/DVD combination. The DVD includes a &quot;making of&quot; documentary in addition to the live performance. Recorded in a historic steel mill, the &quot;Altes Kesselhaus&quot; (&quot;old boiler house&quot;), in Düsseldorf, Germany, this performance includes a version of Brahms&#x27; &quot;Lullaby&quot; which Seal sings in German and then in English. Unlike earlier recordings in which Seal is accompanied by his band, a full orchestra and choir of 52 musicians accompanies the singer.
&quot;System&quot; was released in the UK on 12 November 2007 and in the US on 13 November 2007. Seal describes the album as more dance-oriented, apparently a return to the roots of his first album. On the track titled &quot;Wedding Day&quot;, Seal sings a duet with his then-wife, model Heidi Klum. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Amazing&quot;, was released on 25 September 2007 and nominated for the &quot;Best Male Pop Vocal Performance&quot; Grammy at the 2007 50th Annual Grammy Awards.

Seal performed &quot;Amazing&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot; at the 2007 Royal Variety Performance. Seal also performed &quot;Amazing&quot; at the 2007 Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show in December, as well as the duet &quot;Wedding Day&quot; with his wife. Other performers at the 2007 Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show include the Spice Girls and will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas. He appeared on the American Idol season-seven finale, singing with third-place contestant Syesha Mercado.

Seal&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Soul&quot;, was released on 3 November 2008 internationally and on 11 November 2008 in the US. It contains 11 soul classics produced by David Foster. The first single was a cover of Sam Cooke song &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;.

On 14 March 2009, Seal performed a song from the album and coached the participants on the &quot;Top 9-Show&quot; of the sixth season of the German TV show &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot; (&quot;German Idol&quot;). On 4 December 2009, &quot;Hits&quot;, a compilation album, was released. It contains two new tracks, &quot;I Am Your Man&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot;.

===2010s ===

Seal&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Seal 6: Commitment&quot; was released on 20 September 2010 internationally and 28 September 2010 in the US. The first single &quot;Secret&quot; was released 10 August 2010 on iTunes in the US and in the UK on 13 September 2010. This album was said to be inspired by his wife, Heidi. On 7 November 2011, Seal released his second cover album of classic soul songs, &quot;Soul 2&quot; through Reprise Records.

====Performance in Chechnya, 2011====
In October 2011, Seal was criticized by human-rights groups for appearing at an event in Grozny, Chechnya, that turned into a birthday celebration for Ramzan Kadyrov, the President of Chechnya. Also appearing at the event were the actress Hilary Swank, actor Jean-Claude Van Damme and violinist Vanessa-Mae. The New York–based Human Rights Foundation claims that it sent letters to invitees in advance of the event noting Kadyrov&#x27;s record and asking them to decline the invitations. Human Rights Watch sent an enquiry to Seal regarding his performance at the event and released a statement about the incident that said:
Seal refused to apologise for appearing at the event, sending a message from his Twitter account telling people to &quot;leave me out of your politics&quot;. Seal was reported to have made $500,000 for singing at the party.

====2012–2017====
In 2012, Seal was one of the four vocal coaches in the first season of the Australian version of the reality singing competition &quot;The Voice&quot;. He was the coach of the series winner Karise Eden. Seal returned to &quot;The Voice &quot;season two, which debuted on 7 April 2013, where he became the winning coach once again, coaching eventual winner Harrison Craig. He did not return for the third season in 2014 with the Nine Network stating that Seal &quot;will take a break from the third season of &quot;The Voice&quot; to focus on music and material for a new album.&quot; Channel NINE announced on 8 November 2016 that Seal would be returning alongside Delta Goodrem to &quot;The Voice&quot; as a coach in 2017, replacing Jessie J after a three-year hiatus.

On 15 November 2014, Seal joined the charity group Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in West Africa. Seal was cast as Pontius Pilate in Tyler Perry&#x27;s musical rendition of &quot;The Passion&quot;, which aired on Fox on 20 March 2016.

Seal began work on a new album, initially entitled &quot;Let Yourself&quot;, produced again by Horn. In February 2015, Horn said the album was nearly finished. Seal later re-signed to Perfect Songs and had a two-week writing period in Horn&#x27;s Los Angeles studio booked for October 2012. Stewart Copeland (formerly of the Police) said that month on his Twitter feed that Trevor Horn and Lol Crème were working with Seal on a project. In April 2013, Seal said on Twitter that the new album would be released in about June (which did not eventuate) and that tracks to be included were &quot;Let Yourself&quot;, &quot;Do You Ever&quot; and &quot;Laying with an Angel&quot;. The album was later retitled &quot;Beautifully Scarred&quot;. On 10 September 2015, Seal announced that the album, now named &quot;7&quot;, would be released on 6 November 2015.

Seal released the album &quot;Standards&quot; in November 2017. The album was produced by classical crossover composer Nick Patrick. It received a nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 2018 Annual Grammy Awards.

===2020s===
In 2022, Seal launched his own limited-edition camera with Leica, a Q2 camera called Dawn, which is limited to 500 cameras.

Seal announced a North American tour in 2023 with Trevor Horn as the musical director, who also doubles as the show opener with his band, The Buggles. In 2024, he released an alternate version of &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; with a deluxe edition of the album &quot;Seal&quot; upon its 30th anniversary.

He released a new song, &quot;All I Know is Now&quot;, produced by Horn, on 14 February 2025.

==Personal life==
The prominent scarring on Seal&#x27;s face is the result of a type of lupus called discoid lupus erythematosus, which affects the skin and leaves large scars.

Seal&#x27;s brother, Jeymes Samuel, better known as the Bullitts, is also a singer-songwriter.

Seal first began dating German model Heidi Klum in February 2004, shortly after she announced her pregnancy and the end of her relationship with Italian Formula One team manager Flavio Briatore. Seal proposed to Klum on 23 December 2004 in a quinzee he had built on a glacier in Whistler, British Columbia. On 10 May 2005, the couple married on a beach in Mexico near Seal&#x27;s home on Costa Careyes. Every year during their marriage, Seal and Klum renewed their vows on their anniversary with close friends and family. About these renewals, Seal said in 2010, &quot;Each year, Heidi and I get remarried. It&#x27;s a great party, but for about an hour, we go off on our own down to a private beach. We sit there with the kids and read vows to each other as the sun sets. It&#x27;s a very special moment to us.&quot; In November 2009, Klum officially adopted Seal&#x27;s surname and became legally known as Heidi Samuel.

On 11 June 2009, Seal, on tour with his new album &quot;Soul&quot;, revealed, &quot;It is nice to be in newspapers and magazines for something other than my marriage&quot;. He said his marriage to Klum may take away the attention, but does not detract from what he loves doing: making music. In February 2011, Klum praised Seal for his good parenting skills, saying, &quot;When I first met Seal he had a kindness and compassion that was so sincere I knew he&#x27;d be a good father... He has infinite amounts of love and patience for our kids... He puts me and the children first&quot;. Klum also remarked how lucky she was to have a husband like Seal.

Klum gave birth to Briatore&#x27;s daughter in May 2004 in New York City with Seal at her side. According to Klum, Briatore is not involved in fathering duties and she has stated emphatically that Seal is Leni&#x27;s father. Seal is her only father figure and he has praised Briatore for keeping his distance. In late 2009, Seal officially adopted Klum&#x27;s daughter and her last name was changed to Samuel. The couple have three other children: two sons Henry Günther Ademola Dashtu Samuel (born September 2005) and Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel (born November 2006); and a daughter named Lou born in October 2009.

On 22 January 2012, Seal and Klum announced that they were separating after nearly seven years of marriage. Klum filed for divorce from Seal on 6 April 2012. Their divorce was finalised on 14 October 2014.

Since 2021, he has been in a relationship with his former personal assistant Laura Strayer.

===Charity work===
In April 1992, Seal performed with the surviving members of Queen at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert held at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium five months after Mercury&#x27;s death. Seal sang the 1986 Queen hit &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; and joined the rest of the acts for the all-star finale singing &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. Thomas Curtis-Horsfall of Smooth Radio stated Seal&#x27;s performance of &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; was &quot;one of the standout moments&quot; from the concert, adding &quot;his spine-tingling rendition of the Queen classic had everyone in the arena close to tears.&quot;

On 10 March 2012, Seal shared the stage with Kanye West, Soul Rebels Brass Band and Snoop Dogg at Brad Pitt&#x27;s Night to Make It Right Foundation New Orleans after-party, hosted by comedian Aziz Ansari. The charity event, hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, raised money to build homes for victims of Hurricane Katrina.

<text>A seal is a device for making an impression in wax, clay, paper, or some other medium, including an embossment on paper, and is also the impression thus made. The original purpose was to authenticate a document, or to prevent interference with a package or envelope by applying a seal which had to be broken to open the container (hence the modern English verb &quot;to seal&quot;, which implies secure closing without an actual wax seal).

The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal &quot;matrix&quot; or &quot;die&quot;; the imprint it creates as the seal impression (or, more rarely, the &quot;sealing&quot;). If the impression is made purely as a relief resulting from the greater pressure on the paper where the high parts of the matrix touch, the seal is known as a &quot;dry seal&quot;; in other cases ink or another liquid or liquefied medium is used, in another color than the paper.

In most traditional forms of dry seal the design on the seal matrix is in intaglio (cut below the flat surface) and therefore the design on the impressions made is in relief (raised above the surface). The design on the impression will reverse (be a mirror-image of) that of the matrix, which is especially important when script is included in the design, as it very often is. This will not be the case if paper is embossed from behind, where the matrix and impression read the same way, and both matrix and impression are in relief. However engraved gems were often carved in relief, called cameo in this context, giving a &quot;counter-relief&quot; or intaglio impression when used as seals. The process is essentially that of a mould.

Most seals have always given a single impression on an essentially flat surface, but in medieval Europe two-sided seals with two matrices were often used by institutions or rulers (such as towns, bishops and kings) to make two-sided or fully three-dimensional impressions in wax, with a &quot;tag&quot;, a piece of ribbon or strip of parchment, running through them. These &quot;pendent&quot; seal impressions dangled below the documents they authenticated, to which the attachment tag was sewn or otherwise attached (single-sided seals were treated in the same way).

Some jurisdictions consider rubber stamps or specified signature-accompanying words such as &quot;seal&quot; or &quot;L.S.&quot; (abbreviation of &quot;locus sigilli&quot;, &quot;place of the seal&quot;) to be the legal equivalent of, &quot;i.e.&quot;, an equally effective substitute for, a seal.

In the United States, the word &quot;seal&quot; is sometimes assigned to a facsimile of the seal design (in monochrome or color), which may be used in a variety of contexts including architectural settings, on flags, or on official letterheads. Thus, for example, the Great Seal of the United States, among other uses, appears on the reverse of the one-dollar bill; and several of the seals of the U.S. states appear on their respective state flags. In Europe, although coats of arms and heraldic badges may well feature in such contexts as well as on seals, the seal design in its entirety rarely appears as a graphical emblem and is used mainly as originally intended: as an impression on documents.

The study of seals is known as sigillography or sphragistics.

==Ancient Near East==
 

The stamp seal was a common seal die, frequently carved from stone, known at least since the 6th millennium BC (Halaf culture) and probably earlier. The oldest stamp seals were button-shaped objects with primitive ornamental forms chiseled onto them.


Seals were used in the earliest civilizations and are of considerable importance in archaeology and art history. In ancient Mesopotamia carved or engraved cylinder seals in stone or other materials were used. These could be rolled along to create an impression on clay (which could be repeated indefinitely), and used as labels on consignments of trade goods, or for other purposes. They are normally hollow and it is presumed that they were worn on a string or chain round the neck. Many have only images, often very finely carved, with no writing, while others have both. From ancient Egypt seals in the form of signet rings, including some with the names of kings, have been found; these tend to show only names in hieroglyphics.

Recently, seals datable to the Himyarite age have come to light in South Arabia. One example shows a name written in Aramaic (Yitsḥaq bar Ḥanina) engraved in reverse so as to read correctly in the impression.

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
From the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC until the Middle Ages, seals of various kinds were in production in the Aegean islands and mainland Greece. In the Early Minoan age these were formed of soft stone and ivory and show particular characteristic forms. By the Middle Minoan age a new set for seal forms, motifs and materials appear. Hard stone requires new rotary carving techniques. The Late Bronze Age is the time par excellence of the lens-shaped seal and the seal ring, which continued into the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods, in the form of pictorial engraved gems. These were a major luxury art form and became keenly collected, with King Mithridates VI of Pontus the first major collector according to Pliny the Elder. His collection fell as booty to Pompey the Great, who deposited it in a temple in Rome. Engraved gems continued to be produced and collected until the 19th century. Pliny also explained the significance of the signet ring, and how over time this ring was worn on the little finger.

==East Asia== 

Known as &quot;yinzhang&quot; () in Greater China, &quot;injang&quot; in Korea, &quot;inshō&quot; in Japan, &quot;ấn triện&quot; (or &quot;ấn chương&quot;) in Vietnam, seals have been used in East Asia as a form of written identification since the Qin dynasty (221 BC–). The seals of the Han dynasty were impressed in a soft clay, but from the Tang dynasty a red ink made from cinnabar was normally used. Even in modern times, seals, often known as &quot;chops&quot; in local colloquial English, are still commonly used instead of handwritten signatures to authenticate official documents or financial transactions. Both individuals and organizations have official seals, and they often have multiple seals in different sizes and styles for different situations. East Asian seals usually bear the names of the people or organizations represented, but they can also bear poems or personal mottoes. Sometimes both types of seals, or large seals that bear both names and mottoes, are used to authenticate official documents. Seals are so important in East Asia that foreigners who frequently conduct business there also commission the engraving of personal seals.

East Asian seals are carved from a variety of hard materials, including wood, soapstone, sea glass and jade. East Asian seals are traditionally used with a red oil-based paste consisting of finely ground cinnabar, which contrasts with the black ink traditionally used for the ink brush. Red chemical inks are more commonly used in modern times for sealing documents. Seal engraving is considered a form of calligraphy in East Asia. Like ink-brush calligraphy, there are several styles of engraving. Some engraving styles emulate calligraphy styles, but many styles are so highly stylized that the characters represented on the seal are difficult for untrained readers to identify. Seal engravers are considered artists, and, in the past, several famous calligraphers also became famous as engravers. Some seals, carved by famous engravers, or owned by famous artists or political leaders, have become valuable as historical works of art.

Because seals are commissioned by individuals and carved by artists, every seal is unique, and engravers often personalize the seals that they create. The materials of seals and the styles of the engraving are typically matched to the personalities of the owners. Seals can be traditional or modern, or conservative or expressive. Seals are sometimes carved with the owners&#x27; zodiac animals on the tops of the seals. Seals are also sometimes carved with images or calligraphy on the sides.

Although it is a utilitarian instrument of daily business in East Asia, westerners and other non-Asians seldom see Asian seals except on Asian paintings and calligraphic art. All traditional paintings in China, Japan, Korea, and the rest of East Asia are watercolor paintings on silk, paper, or some other surface to which the red ink from seals can adhere. East Asian paintings often bear multiple seals, including one or two seals from the artist, and the seals from the owners of the paintings.

East Asian seals are the predecessors to block printing.

==Western tradition==

There is a direct line of descent from the seals used in the ancient world, to those used in medieval and post-medieval Europe, and so to those used in legal contexts in the western world to the present day. Seals were historically most often impressed in sealing wax (often simply described as &quot;wax&quot;): in the Middle Ages, this generally comprised a compound of about two-thirds beeswax to one-third of some kind of resin, but in the post-medieval period the resin (and other ingredients) came to dominate. During the early Middle Ages seals of lead, or more properly &quot;bullae&quot; (from the Latin), were in common use both in East and West, but with the notable exception of documents (&quot;bulls&quot;) issued by the Papal Chancery these leaden authentications fell out of favour in western Christendom. Byzantine Emperors sometimes issued documents with gold seals, known as Golden Bulls.
Wax seals were being used on a fairly regular basis by most western royal chanceries by about the end of the 10th century. In England, few wax seals have survived of earlier date than the Norman Conquest, although some earlier matrices are known, recovered from archaeological contexts: the earliest is a gold double-sided matrix found near Postwick, Norfolk, and dated to the late 7th century; the next oldest is a mid-9th-century matrix of a Bishop Ethilwald (probably Æthelwold, Bishop of East Anglia). The practice of sealing in wax gradually moved down the social hierarchy from monarchs and bishops to great magnates, to petty knights by the end of the 12th century, and to ordinary freemen by the middle of the 13th century. They also came to be used by a variety of corporate bodies, including cathedral chapters, municipalities, monasteries etc., to validate the acts executed in their name.

Traditional wax seals continue to be used on certain high-status and ceremonial documents, but in the 20th century they were gradually superseded in many other contexts by inked or dry embossed seals and by rubber stamps.

While many instruments formerly required seals for validity (e.g. deeds or covenants) it is now unusual in most countries in the west for private citizens to use seals. In Central and Eastern Europe, however, as in East Asia, a signature alone is considered insufficient to authenticate a document of any kind in business, and all managers, as well as many book-keepers and other employees, have personal seals, normally just containing text, with their name and their position. These are applied to all letters, invoices issued, and similar documents. In Europe these are today plastic self-inking stamps.

Notaries also still use seals on a daily basis. At least in Britain, each registered notary has an individual personal seal, registered with the authorities, which includes his or her name and a pictorial emblem, often an animal—the same combination found in many seals from ancient Greece.

===Practices===

Seals are used primarily to authenticate documents, specifically those which carry some legal import. There are two main ways in which a seal may be attached to a document. It may be applied directly to the face of the paper or parchment (an &quot;applied seal&quot;); or it may hang loose from it (a &quot;pendent seal&quot;). A pendent seal may be attached to cords or ribbons (sometimes in the owner&#x27;s livery colors), or to the two ends of a strip (or &quot;tag&quot;) of parchment, threaded through holes or slots cut in the lower edge of the document: the document is often folded double at this point (a &quot;plica&quot;) to provide extra strength. Alternatively, the seal may be attached to a narrow strip of the material of the document (again, in this case, usually parchment), sliced and folded down, as a tail or &quot;tongue&quot;, but not detached. The object in all cases is to help ensure authenticity by maintaining the integrity of the relationship between document and seal, and to prevent the seal&#x27;s reuse. If a forger tries to remove an applied seal from its document, it will almost certainly break. A pendent seal is easily detached by cutting the cords or strips of parchment, but the forger would then have great difficulty in attaching it to another document (not least because the cords or parchment are normally knotted inside the seal), and would again almost certainly break it.

In the Middle Ages, the majority of seals were pendent. They were attached both to legal instruments and to letters patent (i.e. open letters) conferring rights or privileges, which were intended to be available for all to view. In the case of important transactions or agreements, the seals of all parties to the arrangement as well as of witnesses might be attached to the document, and so once executed it would carry several seals. Most governments still attach pendent seals to letters patent.
Applied seals, by contrast, were originally used to seal a document closed: that is to say, the document would be folded and the seal applied in such a way that the item could not be opened without the seal being broken. Applied seals were used on letters close (letters intended only for the recipient) and parcels to indicate whether or not the item had been opened or tampered with since it had left the sender, as well as providing evidence that the item was actually from the sender and not a forgery. In the post-medieval period, seals came to be commonly used in this way for private letters. A letter writer would fold the completed letter, pour wax over the joint formed by the top of the page, and then impress a ring or other seal matrix. Governments sometimes sent letters to citizens under the governmental seal for their eyes only, known as letters secret. Wax seals might also be used with letterlocking techniques to ensure that only the intended recipient would read the message. In general, seals are no longer used in these ways except for ceremonial purposes. However, applied seals also came to be used on legal instruments applied directly to the face of the document, so that there was no need to break them, and this use continues.

===Designs===

Historically, the majority of seals were circular in design, although ovals, triangles, shield-shapes and other patterns are also known. The design generally comprised a graphic emblem (sometimes, but not always, incorporating heraldic devices), surrounded by a text (the &quot;legend&quot;) running around the perimeter. The legend most often consisted merely of the words &quot;The seal of [the name of the owner]&quot;, either in Latin or in the local vernacular language: the Latin word &quot;Sigillum&quot; was frequently abbreviated to a simple &quot;S:&quot;. Occasionally, the legend took the form of a motto.

In the Middle Ages it became customary for the seals of women and of ecclesiastics to be given a vesica (pointed oval) shape. The central emblem was often a standing figure of the owner, or (in the case of ecclesiastical seals) of a saint. Medieval townspeople used a wide variety of different emblems but some had seals that included an image relating to their work.

Sealing wax was naturally yellowish or pale brownish in tone, but could also be artificially colored red or green (with many intermediary variations). In some medieval royal chanceries, different colours of wax were customarily used for different functions or departments of state, or to distinguish grants and decrees made in perpetuity from more ephemeral documents.

The matrices for pendent seals were sometimes accompanied by a smaller &quot;counter-seal&quot;, which would be used to impress a small emblem on the reverse of the impression. In some cases the seal and counter-seal would be kept by two different individuals, in order to provide an element of double-checking to the process of authentication. Sometimes, a large official seal, which might be in the custody of chancery officials, would need to be counter-sealed by the individual in whose name it had been applied (the monarch, or the mayor of a town): such a counter-seal might be carried on the person (perhaps secured by a chain or cord), or later, take the form of a signet ring, and so would be necessarily smaller. Other pendent seals were double-sided, with elaborate and equally-sized obverses and reverses. The impression would be formed by pressing a &quot;sandwich&quot; of matrices and wax firmly together by means of rollers or, later, a lever-press or a screw press. Certain medieval seals were more complex still, involving two levels of impression on each side of the wax which would be used to create a scene of three-dimensional depth.

On the death of a seal-holder, as a sign of continuity, a son and heir might commission a new seal employing the same symbols and design-elements as those used by his father. It is likely that this practice was a factor in the emergence of hereditary heraldry in western Europe in the 12th century.

===Ecclesiasticism===
Ecclesiastical seals are frequently mandorla-shaped, as in the shape of an almond, also known as vesica-shaped. The use of a seal by men of wealth and position was common before the Christian era, but high functionaries of the Church adopted the habit.
An incidental allusion in one of St. Augustine&#x27;s letters (217 to Victorinus) indicates that he used a seal. The practice spread, and it seems to be taken for granted by King Clovis I at the very beginning of the Merovingian dynasty.

Later ecclesiastical synods require that letters under the bishop&#x27;s seal should be given to priests when for some reason they lawfully quit their own proper diocese. Such a ruling was enacted at Chalon-sur-Saône in 813. Pope Nicholas I in the same century complained that the bishops of Dôle and Reims had, &quot;contra morem&quot; (contrary to custom), sent their letters to him unsealed. The custom of bishops possessing seals may from this date be assumed to have been pretty general.

In the British Museum collection the earliest bishop&#x27;s seals preserved are those of William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham (1081–96) and of St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury (1093–1109).

===Architects, surveyors and professional engineers===
Seals are also affixed on architectural or engineering construction documents, or land survey drawings, to certify the identity of the licensed professional who supervised the development. Depending on the authority having jurisdiction for the project, these seals may be embossed and signed, stamped and signed, or in certain situations a computer generated facsimile of the original seal validated by a digital certificate owned by the professional may be attached to a security protected computer file. The identities on the professional seals determine legal responsibility for any errors or omissions, and in some cases financial responsibility for their correction as well as the territory of their responsibility, e.g.: &quot;State of Minnesota&quot;.

In some jurisdictions, especially in Canada, it is a legal requirement for a professional engineer to seal documents in accordance with the Engineering Profession Act and Regulations. Professional engineers may also be legally entitled to seal any document they prepare. The seal identifies work performed by, or under the direct supervision of, a licensed professional engineer, and assures the document&#x27;s recipient that the work meets the standards expected of experienced professionals who take personal responsibility for their judgments and decisions.

===Custom houses===
In old English law, a cocket was a custom house seal; or a certified document given to a shipper as a warrant that his goods have been duly entered and have paid duty. Hence, in Scotland, there was an officer called the &quot;clerk of the cocket&quot;. It may have given its name to cocket bread, which was perhaps stamped as though with a seal.

===Destruction===
The importance of the seal as a means of authentication necessitated that when authority passed into new hands the old seal should be destroyed and a new one made. When the pope dies it is the first duty of the Cardinal Camerlengo to obtain possession of the Ring of the Fisherman, the papal signet, and to see that it is broken up. A similar practice prevailed in the Middle Ages and it is often alluded to by historians, as it seems to have been a matter of some ceremony. For example, on the death of Robert of Holy Island, Bishop of Durham, in 1283, the chronicler Robert Greystones reports: &quot;After his burial, his seal was publicly broken up in the presence of all by Master Robert Avenel.&quot; Matthew Paris gives a similar description of the breaking of the seal of William of Trumpington, Abbot of St Albans, in 1235.

The practice is less widely attested in the case of medieval laypeople, but certainly occurred on occasion, particularly in the 13th and 14th centuries. Silver seal matrices have been found in the graves of some of the 12th-century queens of France. These were probably deliberately buried as a means of cancelling them.

When King James II of England was dethroned in the Glorious Revolution of 1688/9, he is supposed to have thrown the Great Seal of the Realm into the River Thames before his flight to France in order to ensure that the machinery of government would cease to function. It is unclear how much truth there is to this story, but certainly the seal was recovered: James&#x27;s successors, William III and Mary used the same Great Seal matrix, fairly crudely adapted – possibly quite deliberately, in order to demonstrate the continuity of government.

===Signet rings===

A signet ring is a ring bearing on its flat top surface the equivalent of a seal. A typical signet ring has a design, often a family or personal crest, created in intaglio so that it will leave a raised (relief) impression of the design when the ring is pressed onto liquid sealing wax. The design is often made out of agate, carnelian, or sardonyx which tend not to bind with the wax. Most smaller classical engraved gems were probably originally worn as signet rings, or as seals on a necklace.

The wearing of signet rings (from Latin &quot;signum&quot; meaning &quot;sign&quot; or &quot;mark&quot;) dates back to ancient Egypt: the seal of a pharaoh is mentioned in the Book of Genesis. Genesis 41:42: &quot;Removing his signet ring from his hand, Pharaoh put it on Joseph&#x27;s hand; he arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck.&quot;

Because it is used to attest to the authority of its bearer, the ring has also been seen as a symbol of power, which is why it is included in the regalia of certain monarchies. After the death of a Pope, the destruction of his signet ring is a prescribed act clearing the way for the &quot;sede vacante&quot; and subsequent election of a new Pope.

Signet rings are also used as a souvenir or membership attribute, e.g., class rings (which typically bear the coat of arms or crest of the school). One may also have their initials engraved as a sign of their personal stature. Traditionally, signet rings were worn either on the little or the ring finger of the least dominant hand, with the most common usage being on the little.

The less noble classes began wearing and using signet rings as early as the 13th century. In the 17th century, signet rings fell out of favor in the upper levels of society, replaced by other means for mounting and carrying the signet. In the 18th century, though, signet rings again became popular, and by the 19th century, men of all classes wore them.

Since at least the 16th century there have also been pseudo-signet rings where the engraving is not reversed (mirror image), as it should be if the impression is to read correctly.

Rings have been used since antiquity as spy identification and in espionage. During World War II, US Air Force personnel would privately purchase signet rings with a hidden compartment that would hold a small compass or hidden message. MI9 purchased a number of signet rings from Regent Street jewelers that were used to conceal compasses.

===Modern tamper-proofing===
In modern use, seals are used to tamper-proof equipment. For example, to prevent gas and electricity meters from being interfered with to show lower chargeable readings, they may be sealed with a lead or plastic seal with a government marking, typically fixed to a wire that passes through part of the meter housing. The meter cannot be opened without cutting the wire or damaging the seal.

Specially-made tamper-evident labels are available which are destroyed if the protected container or equipment is opened, functionally equivalent to a wax seal. They are used to protect things which must not be tampered with such as pharmaceuticals, equipment whose opening voids a manufacturer&#x27;s warranty, etc.

===Approval===

The expression &quot;seal of approval&quot; refers to a formal approval, regardless whether it involves a seal or other external marking, by an authoritative person or institute.

It is also part of the formal name of certain quality marks, such as:
* Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval of the Good Housekeeping Institute
* Good Netkeeping Seal of Approval

<text>Saxony-Anhalt ( ; ) is a state of Germany, bordering the states of Brandenburg, Saxony, Thuringia and Lower Saxony. It covers an area of 
and has a population of 2.17 million inhabitants, making it the 8th-largest state in Germany by area and the 11th-largest by population. Its capital and most populous city is Magdeburg.

The state of Saxony-Anhalt was formed in July 1945 after World War II, when the Soviet army administration in Allied-occupied Germany formed it from the former Prussian Province of Saxony and the Free State of Anhalt. Saxony-Anhalt became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, but was dissolved in 1952 during administrative reforms and its territory was divided into the districts of Halle and Magdeburg. Following German reunification, the state of Saxony-Anhalt was re-established in 1990 and became one of the new states of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Saxony-Anhalt is renowned for its rich cultural heritage and possesses the highest concentration of UNESCO World Heritage sites in Germany.

==Geography==
Saxony-Anhalt is one of 16 constituent states of Germany. It is located in the western part of eastern Germany. By size, it is the 8th largest state in Germany and by population, it is the 11th largest.

It borders four other states: Brandenburg to the north-east, Saxony to the south-east, Thuringia to the south-west and Lower Saxony to the north-west.

In the north, the Saxony-Anhalt landscape is dominated by the flat expanse of the North German Plain. The old Hanseatic towns Salzwedel, Gardelegen, Stendal and Tangermünde are located in the sparsely populated Altmark. The Colbitz-Letzlingen Heath and the Drömling near Wolfsburg mark the transition between the Altmark region and the Elbe-Börde-Heath region with its fertile, sparsely wooded Magdeburg Börde. Notable towns in the Magdeburg Börde are Haldensleben, Oschersleben (Bode), Wanzleben, Schönebeck (Elbe), Aschersleben and the capital Magdeburg, from which the Börde derives its name.

The Harz mountains are located in the south-west, comprising the Harz National Park, the Harz Foreland and Mansfeld Land. The highest mountain of the Harz (and of Northern Germany) is Brocken, with an elevation of 1,141 meters (3,735 ft). In this area, one can find the towns of Halberstadt, Wernigerode, Thale, Eisleben and Quedlinburg.

The wine-growing area Saale-Unstrut and the towns of Zeitz, Naumburg (Saale), Weißenfels and Freyburg (Unstrut) are located on the rivers Saale and Unstrut in the south of the state.

The metropolitan area of Halle (Saale) forms an agglomeration with Leipzig in Saxony. This area is known for its highly developed chemical industry (the &quot;Chemiedreieck&quot; – chemical triangle), with major production plants at Leuna, Schkopau (&quot;Buna-Werke&quot;) and Bitterfeld. Finally, in the east, Dessau-Roßlau and Wittenberg are situated on the Elbe (as is the capital Magdeburg) in the Anhalt-Wittenberg region.

==Administrative subdivisions==

The capital and largest city of Saxony-Anhalt is Magdeburg. The second-largest city in the state is Halle (Saale). From 1994 to 2003, the state was divided into three regions (), Dessau, Halle and Magdeburg and, below the regional level, 21 districts (&quot;Landkreise&quot;). Since 2004, however, this system has been replaced by 11 rural districts and three urban districts.
The districts are:
*Altmarkkreis Salzwedel
*Anhalt-Bitterfeld
*Börde
*Burgenlandkreis
*Harz
*Jerichower Land
*Mansfeld-Südharz
*Saalekreis
*Salzlandkreis
*Stendal
*Wittenberg

The independent cities are:
*Dessau-Roßlau
*Halle (Saale)
*Magdeburg

==History==

Saxony-Anhalt is a federal state with a relatively short history, compared to other German federal states. It was formed in 1945 out of former Prussian territories and mainly consists of three distinct historical regions: the area around Magdeburg, the formerly independent Anhalt and a southern part which once was part of Saxony but had been annexed by Prussia in the 19th century. This historical origin can still be seen in the coat of arms of the federal state.

In April 1945 the US Army took control of most of the western and northern area of the future Saxony-Anhalt. The &quot;U.S. Group Control Council, Germany&quot; (a precursor of the OMGUS) appointed the first non-Nazi officials in leading positions in the area. Erhard Hübener, put on leave by the Nazis, was reappointed Landeshauptmann (state governor). By early July the US Army withdrew from the former Prussian Province of Saxony to make way for the Red Army to take it as part of the Soviet occupation zone, as agreed by the London Protocol in 1944.

On 9 July the Soviet SVAG ordered the merger of the Free State of Anhalt, Halle-Merseburg, the governorate of Magdeburg (in its then borders), Allstedt (before Thuringia) and some Brunswickian eastern exclaves and salients (Calvörde and the eastern part of the former Blankenburg district) with the Province of Saxony. The previously Saxon Erfurt governorate had become a part of Thuringia.

&quot;Anhalt&quot; takes its name from Anhalt Castle near Harzgerode; the origin of the name of the castle remains unknown. Anhalt was once an independent German federal state dating back centuries.

The SVAG appointed Hübener as president of the provincial Saxon administration, a newly created function. The administration was seated in Halle an der Saale, which became the capital, also of later Saxony-Anhalt until 1952. On 3 September 1945 the new administration enacted by Soviet-inspired ordinance the mass expropriations, mostly hitting holders of large real estates, often of noble descent.

On the occasion of the first (and one and only) election in the Soviet zone, allowing parties truly to compete for seats in provincial and state parliaments, on 20 October 1946, the Province of Saxony was renamed as the Province of Saxony-Anhalt (&quot;&quot;), taking the prior merger into account. On 3 December 1946 the members of the new provincial parliament elected Hübener the first minister-president of Saxony-Anhalt, with the votes of the CDU and Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD). Thus he became the only governor in the Soviet zone who was not a member of the communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), making him an inconvenience for the Soviet forces.

After the official Allied decision to dissolve the Free State of Prussia, which had remained in limbo since the Prussian coup of 1932, its former provinces, in as far as they still existed, achieved statehood; thus the province emerged into the &quot;State of Saxony-Anhalt&quot; on 6 October 1947. It became part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1949. From 1952 on the East German states were dissolved, and Saxony-Anhalt&#x27;s territory was divided into the East German districts of Halle and Magdeburg, except that the territory around Torgau was assigned to Leipzig. In 1990, in the course of German reunification, the districts were reintegrated as a state. The territory around Torgau did not return to the state and joined Saxony. Torgau is now the centre of the Nordsachsen district (since 2008).

In 2015 the skeletal remains of an ancient inhabitant of Karsdorf dated from the Early Neolithic (7200 BP) were analysed; he turned out to belong to the paternal T1a-M70 lineage and maternal lineage H1.

==Demographics==
Since German reunification, there has been a continuous downward trend in the population of Saxony-Anhalt. This is partly due to outward migration and partly because the death rate exceeds the birth rate. Although the birth rate has been steady since 1994, the net reproduction rate is only approximately 70%. However, the total fertility rate reached 1.50 in 2014, the highest value since 1990.

===Religion===

The region has historically been associated with the Lutheran faith, but under Communist rule, church membership was strongly discouraged and much of the population disassociated itself from any religious body. Saxony-Anhalt contains many sites tied to Martin Luther&#x27;s life, including Lutherstadt Eisleben and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.

In 2018, the majority of citizens in Saxony-Anhalt were irreligious and more were leaving the churches than entering them – in fact, Saxony-Anhalt is the most irreligious state in Germany. Of the Saxon-Anhaltish, 15.2% adhered to the major denominations of Christianity (11.9% were members of the Protestant Church in Germany and 3.3% were Catholics), 2% were members of other religions (mostly Islam, Judaism, the New Apostolic Church and Mandeism). Of the citizens of Saxony-Anhalt, 82.8% were religiously unaffiliated. As of July 2019 there were 1,892 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (publishers) in Sachsen-Anhalt. Originally their branch office for Germany was in Magdeburg. When World War II ended in 1945, the property in Magdeburg, then part of East Germany, was returned and the branch was reestablished. But on 30 August 1950 Communist police stormed the facilities and arrested the workers, and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the German Democratic Republic (DDR) were banned.

===Foreigners===

The percentage of foreigners in Saxony-Anhalt was 4.9 percent by 31 December 2018, the third lowest among the 16 states of Germany (together with Saxony and Thuringia).

The largest foreign resident groups by 31 December 2022 were:

=== Ministry of Finance ===
===Landtag===
===2021 state election===

Minister-president Reiner Haseloff (CDU) retained his position in a coalition with former partner SPD and newly the FDP. Before the election the coalition had consisted of the CDU, SPD and Greens.

==Economy==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 62.7 billion euros in 2018, which accounts for 1.9% of Germany&#x27;s total economic output and ranks 13th among the 16 German states. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,000 euros or 86% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 88% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the second lowest of all German states. 

By 2020, the GDP of the state dropped to 62.654 billion euros, shortly after reaching an all-time high of 64.115 billion euros in 2019.

===Development===
Saxony-Anhalt was part of the communist German Democratic Republic. After the breakdown of communism and the German reunification in 1990, the collapse of non-competitive former GDR industries temporarily caused severe economic problems. In 2000, Saxony-Anhalt had the highest unemployment rate of all German states, at 20.2%.

However, the process of economic transformation towards a modern market economy seems to be completed. Massive investments in modern infrastructure have taken place since 1990, and the remaining and newly created businesses are highly competitive. For example, the industry has doubled its share of international revenue from 13 percent in 1995 to 26 percent in 2008. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has fallen considerably. By 2010 the GDP of Saxony-Anhalt was almost two and a half times higher than it was in 1991.

Even though part of this recovery was brought on by the positive performance of the German economy, Saxony-Anhalt not only followed the national trend, but clearly outperformed other German states. For example, it outperformed three German states in terms of unemployment (10.8%, as of September 2011): the German capital and city-state of Berlin (12.7%), the city-state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (11.3%) and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (11%).

The unemployment began to fall under 10% in 2016, and stood at 7.1% in October 2018.
===Structure===
*The chemical industry is quite important, with almost 25,500 employees across 214 plants in 2010. One of the biggest chemical producing areas can be found around the city of Bitterfeld-Wolfen. Because of the chemical industry, Saxony-Anhalt attracts more foreign direct investments than any other state in eastern Germany.
*The state is the location of numerous wind farms producing wind-turbine energy.
*Saxony-Anhalt is also famous for its good soil. Hence, the food industry has an important role with almost 19,500 employees across 190 plants in 2010. Some of the best known products are Baumkuchen from Salzwedel and Halloren chocolate globes from Germany&#x27;s oldest chocolate factory in Halle.

===Tourism===
Saxony-Anhalt has seven World Heritage Sites, the highest number of all states in Germany.
==Education==
Saxony-Anhalt has several universities, including:

*Anhalt University of Applied Sciences
*Harz University of Applied Studies
*Magdeburg-Stendal University of Applied Sciences
*Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg
*Merseburg University of Applied Sciences
*Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg

==Anthem==

<doc id="38140" wikidata="Q11384" url="?curid=38140" title="Wide area network">
<text>A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area. Wide area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.

Businesses, as well as schools and government entities, use wide area networks to relay data to staff, students, clients, buyers and suppliers from various locations around the world. In essence, this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location. The Internet may be considered a WAN. Many WANs are, however, built for one particular organization and are private. WANs can be separated from local area networks (LANs) in that the latter refers to physically proximal networks.

==Design options==
The textbook definition of a WAN is a computer network spanning regions, countries, or even the world. However, in terms of the application of communication protocols and concepts, it may be best to view WANs as computer networking technologies used to transmit data over long distances, and between different networks. This distinction stems from the fact that common local area network (LAN) technologies operating at lower layers of the OSI model (such as the forms of Ethernet or Wi-Fi) are often designed for physically proximal networks, and thus cannot transmit data over tens, hundreds, or even thousands of miles or kilometres.

WANs are used to connect LANs and other types of networks together so that users and computers in one location can communicate with users and computers in other locations. Many WANs are built for one particular organization and are private. Others, built by Internet service providers, provide connections from an organization&#x27;s LAN to the Internet. 

WANs are often built using leased lines. At each end of the leased line, a router connects the LAN on one side with a second router within the LAN on the other. Because leased lines can be very expensive, instead of using leased lines, WANs can also be built using less costly circuit switching or packet switching methods. Network protocols including TCP/IP deliver transport and addressing functions. Protocols including Packet over SONET/SDH, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Frame Relay are often used by service providers to deliver the links that are used in WANs. It is also possible to build a WAN with Ethernet.

Academic research into wide area networks can be broken down into three areas: mathematical models, network emulation, and network simulation. 

Performance improvements are sometimes delivered via wide area file services or WAN optimization.

==Private networks==
Of the approximately four billion addresses defined in IPv4, about 18 million addresses in three ranges are reserved for use in private networks. Packets addressed in these ranges are not routable on the public Internet; they are ignored by all public routers. Therefore, private hosts cannot directly communicate with public networks, but require network address translation at a routing gateway for this purpose.
&lt;section begin=IPv4-private-networks/&gt;
:&lt;section end=IPv4-private-networks/&gt;

Since two private networks, e.g., two branch offices, cannot directly communicate via the public Internet, the two networks must be bridged across the Internet via a virtual private network (VPN) or other form of IP tunnel that encapsulates packets, including their headers containing the private addresses, for transmission across the public network. Additionally, encapsulated packets may be encrypted to secure their data.

==Connection technology==
Many technologies are available for wide area network links. Examples include circuit-switched telephone lines, radio wave transmission, and optical fiber. New developments have successively increased transmission rates. In , a line was normal on the edge of the WAN, while core links of 56 or 64 kbit/s were considered fast. Today, households are connected to the Internet with dial-up, asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), cable, WiMAX, cellular network or fiber. The speeds that people can currently use range from 28.8 kbit/s through a 28K modem over a telephone connection to speeds as high as 100 Gbit/s using 100 Gigabit Ethernet.

The following communication and networking technologies have been used to implement WANs.

* Asynchronous Transfer Mode
* Cable modem
* Cellular networks
* Dial-up internet
* Digital subscriber line
* Fiber-optic communication
* Frame Relay
* ISDN
* Leased line
* SD-WAN
* Synchronous optical networking
* Very small aperture terminal (VSAT)
*Wi-Fi
*WiMAX
* X.25
AT&amp;T conducted trials in 2017 for business use of 400-gigabit Ethernet. Researchers Robert Maher, Alex Alvarado, Domaniç Lavery, and Polina Bayvel of University College London were able to increase networking speeds to 1.125 terabits per second. Christos Santis, graduate student Scott Steger, Amnon Yariv, Martin and Eileen Summerfield developed a new laser that potentially quadruples transfer speeds with fiber optics.

<doc id="38144" wikidata="Q678105" url="?curid=38144" title="Milford H. Wolpoff">
<text>Milford Howell Wolpoff is a paleoanthropologist and professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan and its museum of Anthropology. He is the leading proponent of the multiregional evolution hypothesis that explains the evolution of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; as a consequence of evolutionary processes and gene flow across continents within a single species. Wolpoff authored the widely used textbook &quot;Paleoanthropology&quot; (1980 and 1999 eds.), and co-authored &quot;Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction&quot;, which reviews the scientific evidence and conflicting theories about the interpretation of human evolution, and biological anthropology&#x27;s relationship to views about race.

Wolpoff is best known for his vocal support of the multiregional model of human evolution when it was challenged by the &#x27;Out of Africa&#x27; theory. The basis for advancing the multiregional interpretation stems from his skepticism of punctuated equilibrium (the idea evolution typically proceeds with long static periods and abrupt changes, instead of gradual modification during speciation) as an accurate model for Pleistocene humanity, noting that speciation played a role earlier in human evolution.

==Education==
Wolpoff was born in 1942 to Ruth (Silver) and Ben Wolpoff, in Chicago. He received an A.B. in 1964 with a major in anthropology and a minor in mathematics, and a PhD in 1969 in physical anthropology, with minors in zoology and archaeology, from the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois. His research advisor and intellectual mentor was Eugene Giles. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1971, and became a professor of anthropology in 1977.

==Professional work==
Wolpoff was trained primarily as a paleoanthropologist at the University of Illinois under Eugene Giles. With his multidisciplinary training, he brings to the study of the human and non-human primate fossil record a background that combines evolutionary theory, population genetics, and biomechanics. With over 50 grants funded by the National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences, and the University of Michigan, Wolpoff has visited the museums where human and primate fossils are stored and has studied in detail and at length all the materials addressing the fossil evidence for human evolution across Europe, Asia, and Africa. His research foci have included the evolution and fate of the European Neandertals, the role of culture in early hominid evolution, the nature and explanation of allometry, robust australopithecine evolution, the distribution and explanation of sexual dimorphism, hominid origins, the pattern and explanation of Australasian hominid evolution, the contributions and role of genetics in paleoanthropological research, and the taxonomy of the genus &quot;Homo&quot;. In addition, he is a primary describer of many hominid fossil remains. Since 1976 Wolpoff has graduated more than 20 PhD students. 
===Multiregional evolution and the punctuated equilibrium theory===

Drawing on this background and research experience, Wolpoff&#x27;s continuing research in the last 15 years has been the development, articulation, and defense of his multiregional model of human evolution. He suggests that after an African origin of the Homo lineage (including &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;/&quot;Homo erectus&quot;) and the subsequent migration of &quot;H. erectus&quot; throughout much of the globe (Africa, Europe, Asia), local evolutionary events took place, and when they were advantageous, they spread everywhere else. According to Wolpoff, populations of &quot;Homo&quot; evolved together as a single species. Change in Pleistocene populations did not involve speciation (the splitting of one species into two): all this time, the geographically distinct populations maintained small amounts of gene flow. This idea directly challenges the Out of Africa model, which claims &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; evolved recently as a new species in Africa, and then dispersed throughout the Old World, replacing the existing human populations without mixing with them.

His theory evoked rivalry with the proponents of punctuated equilibrium, Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge, who endorsed &quot;H. erectus&quot; as a model of their theory. In an earlier example of punctuated evolution preceding the global diffusion of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; genes from Africa, some two million years ago, Wolpoff points to evidence of an earlier &#x27;genetic revolution&#x27; that took place in a small group isolated from australopithecine forebears. &quot;The earliest &quot;H. sapiens&quot; remains differ significantly from australopithecines in both size and anatomical details,&quot; he notes, &quot;Insofar as we can tell, these changes were sudden and not gradual.&quot;

<text>Los Alamos National Laboratory (often shortened as Los Alamos and LANL) is one of the sixteen research and development laboratories of the United States Department of Energy (DOE), located a short distance northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the American southwest. Best known for its central role in helping develop the first atomic bomb, LANL is one of the world&#x27;s largest and most advanced scientific institutions.

Los Alamos was established in 1943 as Project Y, a top-secret site for designing nuclear weapons under the Manhattan Project during World War II. Chosen for its remote yet relatively accessible location, it served as the main hub for conducting and coordinating nuclear research, bringing together some of the world&#x27;s most famous scientists, among them numerous Nobel Prize winners. The town of Los Alamos, directly north of the lab, grew extensively through this period.

After the war ended in 1945, Project Y&#x27;s existence was made public, and it became known universally as Los Alamos. In 1952, the Atomic Energy Commission formed a second design lab under the direction of the University of California, Berkeley, which became the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The two labs competed on a wide variety of bomb designs, but with the end of the Cold War, have focused increasingly on civilian missions. Today, Los Alamos conducts multidisciplinary research in fields such as national security, space exploration, nuclear fusion, renewable energy, medicine, nanotechnology, and supercomputing.

While owned by the federal government, LANL is privately managed and operated by Triad National Security, LLC.

==History==

===The Manhattan Project===

The laboratory was founded during World War II as a secret, centralized facility to coordinate the scientific research of the Manhattan Project, the Allied project to develop the first nuclear weapons. In September 1942, the difficulties encountered in conducting preliminary studies on nuclear weapons at universities scattered across the country indicated the need for a laboratory dedicated solely to that purpose.

General Leslie Groves wanted a central laboratory at an isolated location for safety, and to keep the scientists away from the populace. It should be at least 200 miles from international boundaries and west of the Mississippi. Major John Dudley suggested Oak City, Utah, or Jemez Springs, New Mexico, but both were rejected. Jemez Springs was only a short distance from the current site. Project Y director J. Robert Oppenheimer had spent much time in his youth in the New Mexico area and suggested the Los Alamos Ranch School on the mesa. Dudley had rejected the school as not meeting Groves&#x27; criteria, but as soon as Groves saw it he said in effect &quot;This is the place&quot;. Oppenheimer became the laboratory&#x27;s first director; from 19 October 1942.

During the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos hosted thousands of employees, including many Nobel Prize-winning scientists. The location was a total secret. Its only mailing address was a post office box, number 1663, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Eventually two other post office boxes were used, 180 and 1539, also in Santa Fe. Though its contract with the University of California was initially intended to be temporary, the relationship was maintained long after the war. Until the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, University of California president Robert Sproul did not know what the purpose of the laboratory was and thought it might be producing a &quot;death ray&quot;. The only member of the UC administration who knew its true purpose—indeed, the only one who knew its exact physical location—was the Secretary-Treasurer Robert Underhill, who was in charge of wartime contracts and liabilities.
The work of the laboratory culminated in several atomic devices, one of which was used in the first nuclear test near Alamogordo, New Mexico, codenamed &quot;Trinity&quot;, on July 16, 1945. The other two were weapons, &quot;Little Boy&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot;, which were used in the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Laboratory received the Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award for Excellence in production on October 16, 1945.

===Post-war===
After the war, Oppenheimer retired from the directorship, and it was taken over by Norris Bradbury, whose initial mission was to make the previously hand-assembled atomic bombs &quot;G.I. proof&quot; so that they could be mass-produced and used without the assistance of highly trained scientists. Other founding members of Los Alamos left the laboratory and became outspoken opponents to the further development of nuclear weapons.

The name officially changed to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) on January 1, 1947. By this time, Argonne had already been made the first National Laboratory the previous year. Los Alamos would not become a National Laboratory in name until 1981.

In the years since the 1940s, Los Alamos was responsible for the development of the hydrogen bomb, and many other variants of nuclear weapons. In 1952, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was founded to act as Los Alamos&#x27; &quot;competitor&quot;, with the hope that two laboratories for the design of nuclear weapons would spur innovation. Los Alamos and Livermore served as the primary classified laboratories in the U.S. national laboratory system, designing all the country&#x27;s nuclear arsenal. Additional work included basic scientific research, particle accelerator development, health physics, and fusion power research as part of Project Sherwood. Many nuclear tests were undertaken in the Marshall Islands and at the Nevada Test Site. During the late-1950s, a number of scientists including Dr. J. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Beyster left Los Alamos to work for General Atomics (GA) in San Diego.

Three major nuclear-related accidents have occurred at LANL. Criticality accidents occurred in August 1945 and May 1946, and a third accident occurred during an annual physical inventory in December 1958.

Several buildings associated with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965.

===Post-Cold War===
At the end of the Cold War, both labs went through a process of intense scientific diversification in their research programs to adapt to the changing political conditions that no longer required as much research towards developing new nuclear weapons and has led the lab to increase research for &quot;non-war&quot; science and technology. Los Alamos&#x27; nuclear work is currently thought to relate primarily to computer simulations and stockpile stewardship. The development of the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility will allow complex simulations of nuclear tests to take place without full explosive yields.

The laboratory contributed to the early development of the flow cytometry technology. In the 1950s, researcher Mack Fulwyler developed a technique for sorting erythrocytes that combined the Coulter Principle of Coulter counter technologies, which measures the presence of cells and their size, with ink jet technology, which produces a laminar flow of liquid that breaks up into separate, fine drops. In 1969, Los Alamos reported the first fluorescence detector apparatus, which accurately measured the number and size of ovarian cells and blood cells.

As of 2017, other research performed at the lab included developing cheaper, cleaner biofuels and advancing scientific understanding around renewable energy.

Non-nuclear national security and defense development is also a priority at the lab. This includes preventing outbreaks of deadly diseases by improving detection tools and the monitoring the effectiveness of the United States&#x27; vaccine distribution infrastructure. Additional advancements include the ASPECT airplane that can detect bio threats from the sky.

====Medical work====
In 2008, development for a safer, more comfortable and accurate test for breast cancer was ongoing by scientists Lianjie Huang and Kenneth M. Hanson and collaborators. The new technique, called ultrasound-computed tomography (ultrasound CT), uses sound waves to accurately detect small tumors that traditional mammography cannot.

The lab has made intense efforts for humanitarian causes through its scientific research in medicine. In 2010, three vaccines for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus were being tested by lab scientist Bette Korber and her team. &quot;These vaccines might finally deal a lethal blow to the AIDS virus&quot;, says Chang-Shung Tung, leader of the Lab&#x27;s Theoretical Biology and Biophysics group.

====Negative publicity====
The laboratory has attracted negative publicity from a number of events. In 1999, Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was accused of 59 counts of mishandling classified information by downloading nuclear secrets—&quot;weapons codes&quot; used for computer simulations of nuclear weapons tests—to data tapes and removing them from the lab. After ten months in jail, Lee pleaded guilty to a single count and the other 58 were dismissed with an apology from U.S. District Judge James Parker for his incarceration. Lee had been suspected for having shared U.S. nuclear secrets with China, but investigators were never able to establish what Lee did with the downloaded data. In 2000, two computer hard drives containing classified data were announced to have gone missing from a secure area within the laboratory, but were later found behind a photocopier.

== Science mission ==
Los Alamos National Laboratory&#x27;s mission is to &quot;solve national security challenges through simultaneous excellence&quot;. The laboratory&#x27;s strategic plan reflects U.S. priorities spanning nuclear security, intelligence, defense, emergency response, nonproliferation, counterterrorism, energy security, emerging threats, and environmental management. This strategy is aligned with priorities set by the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and national strategy guidance documents, such as the Nuclear Posture Review, the National Security Strategy, and the Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future

Los Alamos is the senior laboratory in the DOE system, and executes work in all areas of the DOE mission: national security, science, energy, and environmental management. The laboratory also performs work for the Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), among others. The laboratory&#x27;s multidisciplinary scientific capabilities and activities are organized into six Capability Pillars:
* Information, Science and Technology (IS&amp;T)
* Materials for the Future seeks to optimize materials for national security applications by predicting and controlling their performance and functionality through discovery science and engineering.
* Nuclear and Particle Futures integrates nuclear experiments, theory, and simulation to understand and engineer complex nuclear phenomena.
* Science of Signatures (SoS) applies science and technology to intransigent problems of system identification and characterization in areas of global security, nuclear defense, energy, and health.
* Complex Natural and Engineered Systems (CNES)
* Weapons Systems (WS)

Los Alamos operates three main user facilities:
# The Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies: The Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies is a DOE/Office of Science National User Facility operated jointly by Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories with facilities at both Laboratories. CINT is dedicated to establishing the scientific principles that govern the design, performance, and integration of nanoscale materials into microscale and macroscale systems and devices.
# Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE): The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center is one of the world&#x27;s most powerful linear accelerators. LANSCE provides the scientific community with intense sources of neutrons with the capability of performing experiments supporting civilian and national security research. This facility is sponsored by the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, Office of Science and Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology.
# The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), Pulsed Field Facility: The Pulsed Field Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, is one of three campuses of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), the other two being at Florida State University, Tallahassee and the University of Florida. The Pulsed Field Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory operates an international user program for research in high magnetic fields.
As of 2017, the Los Alamos National Laboratory is using data and algorithms to possibly protect public health by tracking the growth of infectious diseases. Digital epidemiologists at the lab&#x27;s Information Systems and Modeling group are using clinical surveillance data, Google search queries, census data, Wikipedia, and even tweets to create a system that could predict epidemics. The team is using data from Brazil as its model; Brazil was notably threatened by the Zika virus as it prepared to host the Summer Olympics in 2016.

==Laboratory management and operations==
Within LANL&#x27;s 43-square-mile property are approximately 2,000 dumpsites which have contaminated the environment. It also contributed to thousands of dumpsites at 108 locations in 29 US states.

===Contract changes===
Continuing efforts to make the laboratory more efficient led the Department of Energy to open its contract with the University of California to bids from other vendors in 2003. Though the university and the laboratory had difficult relations many times since their first World War II contract, this was the first time that the university ever had to compete for management of the laboratory. The University of California decided to create a private company with the Bechtel Corporation, Washington Group International, and the BWX Technologies to bid on the contract to operate the laboratory. The UC/Bechtel led corporation—Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS)—was pitted against a team formed by the University of Texas System partnered with Lockheed-Martin. In December 2005, the Department of Energy announced that LANS had won the next seven-year contract to manage and operate the laboratory.

On June 1, 2006, the University of California ended its sixty years of direct involvement in operating Los Alamos National Laboratory, and management control of the laboratory was taken over by Los Alamos National Security, LLC with effect October 1, 2007. Approximately 95% of the former 10,000 plus UC employees at LANL were rehired by LANS to continue working at LANL. Other than UC appointing three members to the eleven member board of directors that oversees LANS, UC now has virtually no responsibility or direct involvement in LANL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and its two national laboratories in California (Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore) no longer apply to LANL, and the LANL director no longer reports to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.

On June 8, 2018, the NNSA announced that Triad National Security, LLC, a joint venture between Battelle Memorial Institute, the University of California, and Texas A&amp;M University, would assume operation and management of LANL beginning November 1, 2018.

===Safety management===

In August 2011, the close placement of eight plutonium rods for a photo nearly led to a criticality incident. The photo shoot, which was directed by the laboratory&#x27;s management, was one of several factors relating to unsafe management practices that led to the departure of 12 of the lab&#x27;s 14 safety staff. The criticality incident was one of several that led the Department of Energy to seek alternative bids to manage the laboratory after the 2018 expiration of the LANS contract.

The lab was penalized with a $57 million reduction in its 2014 budget over the February 14, 2014, accident at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant for which it was partly responsible.

In August 2017, the improper storage of plutonium metal could have triggered a criticality accident, and subsequently staff failed to declare the failure as required by procedure.

==Extended operations==

With support of the National Science Foundation, LANL operates one of the three National High Magnetic Field Laboratories in conjunction with and located at two other sites Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, and University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida.

Los Alamos National Laboratory is a partner in the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) located in Walnut Creek, California. JGI was founded in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the three genome centers at University of California&#x27;s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and LANL.

The Integrated Computing Network (ICN) is a multi-security level network at the LANL integrating large host supercomputers, a file server, a batch server, a printer and graphics output server and numerous other general purpose and specialized systems. IBM Roadrunner, which was part of this network, was the first supercomputer to hit petaflop speeds.

Until 1999, The Los Alamos National Laboratory hosted the arXiv e-print archive. The arXiv is currently operated and funded by Cornell University.

The coreboot project was initially developed at LANL.

In the recent years, the Laboratory has developed a major research program in systems biology modeling, known at LANL under the name q-bio.

Several serials are published by LANL:
* &quot;National Security Science&quot;
* &quot;1663&quot;
* &quot;Community Connections&quot;

LANL also published &quot;Los Alamos Science&quot; from 1980 to 2005, as well as the &quot;Nuclear Weapons Journal&quot;, which was replaced by &quot;National Security Science&quot; after two issues in 2009.

==Controversy and criticism==
In 2005, Congress held new hearings on lingering security issues at Los Alamos National Weapons Laboratory in New Mexico; documented problems continued to be ignored.

In November 2008, a drum containing nuclear waste was ruptured due to a &#x27;deflagration&#x27; according to an inspector general report of the Dept. of Energy, which due to lab mistakes, also occurred in 2014 at the Carlsbad plant with significant disruptions and costs across the industry.

In 2009, 69 computers which did not contain classified information were lost. The same year also saw a scare in which 1 kg (2.2 lb) of missing plutonium prompted a Department of Energy investigation into the laboratory. The investigation found that the &quot;missing plutonium&quot; was a result of miscalculation by LANL&#x27;s statisticians and did not actually exist; but the investigation did lead to heavy criticism of the laboratory by the DOE for security flaws and weaknesses that the DOE claimed to have found.

==Institutional statistics==
LANL is northern New Mexico&#x27;s largest institution and the largest employer with approximately 8,762 direct employees, 277 guard force, 505 contractors, 1,613 students, 1,143 unionized craft workers, and 452 post-doctoral researchers. Additionally, there are roughly 120 DOE employees stationed at the laboratory to provide federal oversight of LANL&#x27;s work and operations. Approximately one-third of the laboratory&#x27;s technical staff members are physicists, one-quarter are engineers, one-sixth are chemists and materials scientists, and the remainder work in mathematics and computational science, biology, geoscience, and other disciplines. Professional scientists and students also come to Los Alamos as visitors to participate in scientific projects. The staff collaborates with universities and industry in both basic and applied research to develop resources for the future. The annual budget is approximately US$2.2 billion.

<text>Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is a federally funded research and development center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States. Founded in 1943, the laboratory is now sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and administered by UT–Battelle, LLC.

Established in 1943, ORNL is the largest science and energy national laboratory in the Department of Energy system by size and third largest by annual budget. It is located in the Roane County section of Oak Ridge. Its scientific programs focus on materials, nuclear science, neutron science, energy, high-performance computing, environmental science, systems biology and national security, sometimes in partnership with the state of Tennessee, universities and other industries.

ORNL has several of the world&#x27;s top supercomputers, including Frontier, ranked by the TOP500 as the world&#x27;s second most powerful. The lab is a leading neutron and nuclear power research facility that includes the Spallation Neutron Source, the High Flux Isotope Reactor, and the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences.

==Overview==
Oak Ridge National Laboratory is managed by UT–Battelle, a limited liability partnership between the University of Tennessee and the Battelle Memorial Institute, formed in 2000 for that purpose. The annual budget is US$2.4 billion. As of 2021 there is a staff of 5,700 working at ORNL, around 2,000 of whom are scientists and engineers, and an additional 3,200 guest researchers annually.

There are five campuses on the Department of Energy&#x27;s Oak Ridge reservation: the National Laboratory, the Y-12 National Security Complex, the East Tennessee Technology Park (formerly the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant), the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, and the developing Oak Ridge Science and Technology Park, although the four other facilities are unrelated to the National Laboratory. The total area of the reservation is 150 square kilometres (58 sq mi) of which the lab takes up 18 square kilometres (7 sq mi).

== History ==
In 1934 the Freel Farm Mound Site, an archaeological site and burial mound of the Late Woodland period was excavated. The site is currently inundated by Melton Hill Lake.

The city of Oak Ridge was established by the Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Clinton Engineer Works in 1942 on isolated farm land as part of the Manhattan Project. During World War II, advanced research for the government was managed at the site by the University of Chicago&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory. In 1943, construction of the Clinton Laboratories, what would later be known as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was completed. The site was chosen for the X-10 Graphite Reactor, used to produce plutonium from natural uranium. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues developed the world&#x27;s second self-sustaining nuclear reactor after Fermi&#x27;s previous experiment, the Chicago Pile-1. The X-10 was the first reactor designed for continuous operation.

After the end of World War II, management of the lab was contracted by the US government to Monsanto; however, they withdrew in 1947. The University of Chicago temporarily re-assumed responsibility, with the site receiving the prestigious &quot;National&quot; laboratory designation, until in December 1947, when Union Carbide and Carbon Co., which already operated two other facilities at Oak Ridge, took control of the laboratory and renamed the site Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

Post-war, the demand for military science had fallen dramatically, and the future of the lab was uncertain. The X-10 reactor and the laboratory&#x27;s 1,000 employees were no longer involved in nuclear weapons. Instead, it was used for scientific research. In 1946 the first medical isotopes were produced in the X-10 reactor, and by 1950 almost 20,000 samples had been shipped to various hospitals. The quantity and variety of radionuclides produced by X-10 for medicine grew steadily in the 1950s. ORNL was the only Western source of californium-252. ORNL scientists also performed the world&#x27;s first successful bone marrow transplant in mice by suppressing their immune systems.

In 1950 the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology was established with two courses in reactor operation and safety; almost 1,000 students graduated. Much of the research performed at ORNL in the 1950s was related to nuclear reactors as a form of energy production, both for propulsion and electricity. More reactors were built in the 1950s than in the rest of the ORNL&#x27;s history combined. One of their most influential projects was the light-water reactor, a precursor to many modern nuclear power stations. The US Military funded much of its development, for nuclear-powered submarines and ships of the US Navy. The US Army also contracted the design of portable nuclear reactors in 1953 for heat and electricity generation in remote military bases. The reactors were produced by the American Locomotive Company and used in Greenland, the Panama Canal Zone, and Antarctica. The US Air Force also contributed funding to three reactors, the lab&#x27;s first computers, and its first particle accelerators. ORNL built its first molten salt reactor in 1954 as a proof-of-concept for a proposed fleet of long-range bombers, but it was never used.Alvin M. Weinberg was named Director of Research, ORNL, and in 1955 Director of the Laboratory. In the early 1960s there was a large push at ORNL to develop nuclear-powered desalination plants, where deserts met the sea, to provide water. The project, called Water for Peace, was backed by John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and was presented at a 1964 United Nations conference, but increases in the cost of construction and falling public confidence in nuclear power caused the plan to be shuttered. The Health Physics Research Reactor built in 1962 was used for radiation exposure experiments leading to more accurate dosage limits and dosimeters, and improved radiation shielding.

In 1964 the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment began with the construction of the reactor. It operated from 1966 until 1969 (with six months down time to move from U-235 to U-233 fuel) and proved the viability of molten salt reactors, while also producing fuel for other reactors as a byproduct of its own reaction. The High Flux Isotope Reactor built in 1965 had the highest neutron flux of any reactor at the time. It improved upon the work of the X-10 reactor, producing more medical isotopes as well as allowing higher fidelity of materials research. Researchers in the biology division studied the effects of chemicals on mice, including petrol fumes, pesticides, and tobacco. 

In the late 1960s, cuts in funding led to the cancellation of plans for another particle accelerator, and the United States Atomic Energy Commission cut the breeder reactor program by two-thirds, leading to a downsizing in staff from 5,000 to 3,800. In the 1970s, the prospect of fusion power was strongly considered, sparking research at ORNL. A tokamak called ORMAK, made operational in 1971, was the first tokamak to achieve a plasma temperature of 20 million Kelvin. After the success of the fusion experiments, it was enlarged and renamed ORMAK II in 1973; however, the experiments ultimately failed to lead to fusion power plants.

The US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) required improved safety standards in the early 1970s for nuclear reactors, so ORNL staff wrote almost 100 requirements covering many factors including fuel transport and earthquake resistance. In 1972 the AEC held a series of public hearings where emergency cooling requirements were highlighted and the safety requirements became more stringent. Also in 1972, Peter Mazur, a biologist at ORNL, froze with liquid nitrogen, thawed and implanted mouse embryos in a surrogate mother. The mouse pups were born healthy. The technique is popular in the livestock industry, as it allows the embryos of valuable cattle to be transported easily and a prize cow can have multiple eggs extracted and thus, through &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilisation, have many more offspring than would naturally be possible.

In 1974 Alvin Weinberg, director of the lab for 19 years, was replaced by Herman Postma, a fusion scientist. In 1977 construction began for 6 metre (20 foot) superconducting electromagnets, intended to control fusion reactions. The project was an international effort: three electromagnets were produced in the US, one in Japan, one in Switzerland and the final by remaining European states. ORNL was involved in analysing the damage to the core of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station after the accident in 1979. 

The 1980s brought more changes to ORNL: a focus on efficiency became paramount. An accelerated climate simulation chamber was built that applied varying weather conditions to insulation to test its efficacy and durability faster than real time. Materials research into heat resistant ceramics for use in truck and high-tech car engines was performed, building upon the materials research that began in the nuclear reactors of the 1950s. In 1987 the High Temperature Materials Laboratory was established, where ORNL and industry researchers cooperated on ceramic and alloy projects. The materials research budget at ORNL doubled after initial uncertainty regarding Reagan&#x27;s economic policy of less government expenditure. In 1981, the Holifield Heavy Ion Research Facility, a 25 MV particle accelerator, was opened at ORNL. At the time, Holifield had the widest range of ion species and was twice as powerful as other accelerators, attracting hundreds of guest researchers each year.

The Department of Energy was concerned with the pollution surrounding ORNL, and it began clean-up efforts. Burial trenches and leaking pipes had contaminated the groundwater beneath the lab, and radiation tanks were sitting idle, full of waste. Estimates of the total cost of clean-up were into the hundreds of millions of US dollars. The five older reactors were subjected to safety reviews in 1987, ordered to be deactivated until the reviews were complete. By 1989 when the High Flux Isotope Reactor was restarted, the US supply of certain medical isotopes was depleted. In 1989 the former executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Alvin Trivelpiece, became director of ORNL; he remained in the role until 2000.

In 1992 whistleblower Charles Varnadore filed complaints against ORNL, alleging safety violations and retaliation by his superiors. While an administrative law judge ruled in Varnadore&#x27;s favor, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich overturned that ruling. However, Varnadore&#x27;s case saw prime contractor Martin Marietta cited for safety violations and ultimately led to additional whistleblower protection within DOE.

In January 2019 ORNL announced a major breakthrough in its capacity to automate Pu-238 production which helped push annual production from 50 grams to 400 grams, moving closer to NASA&#x27;s goal of 1.5 kilograms per year by 2025 in order to sustain its space exploration programs.

==Areas of research==
ORNL conducts research and development activities that span a wide range of scientific disciplines. Many research areas have a significant overlap with each other; researchers often work in two or more of the fields listed here. The laboratory&#x27;s major research areas are described briefly below.
* Chemical sciences: ORNL conducts both fundamental and applied research in numerous areas, including catalysis, surface science and interfacial chemistry; molecular transformations and fuel chemistry; heavy element chemistry and radioactive materials characterization; aqueous solution chemistry and geochemistry; mass spectrometry and laser spectroscopy; separations chemistry; materials chemistry including synthesis and characterization of polymers and other soft materials; chemical biosciences; and neutron science.
* Electron microscopy: the program investigates key issues in condensed matter, materials, chemical and nanosciences.
* Nuclear medicine: research is focused on the development of improved reactor production and processing methods to provide medical radioisotopes, the development of new radionuclide generator systems, the design and evaluation of new radiopharmaceuticals for applications in nuclear medicine, and oncology.
* Physics: research is focused primarily on studies of the fundamental properties of matter at the atomic, nuclear, and subnuclear levels and the development of experimental devices in support of these studies.
* Population: ORNL provides federal, state and international organizations with a gridded population database, called Landscan, for estimating ambient population. LandScan is a raster image, or grid, of population counts, which provides human population estimates every 30 x 30 arc seconds, which translates roughly to population estimates for 1 kilometer square windows or grid cells at the Equator, with cell width decreasing at higher latitudes. Though many population datasets exist, LandScan is the best spatial population dataset, updated annually. Landscan data are accessible through GIS applications and a USAID public domain application called Population Explorer.

===Energy===
The laboratory has a long history of energy research; nuclear reactor experiments have been conducted since the end of World War II in 1945. Because of the availability of reactors and high-performance computing resources, an emphasis on improving the efficiency of nuclear reactors is present. The programs develop more efficient materials, more accurate simulations of aging reactor cores, sensors and controls as well as safety procedures for regulatory authorities.

The Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program aims to improve air quality in the US and reduce dependence on foreign oil supplies. There are three key areas of research: electricity, manufacturing and mobility. The electricity division focuses on reducing electricity consumption and finding alternative sources for production. Buildings, which account for 39% of US electricity consumption as of 2012, are a key area of research as the program aims to create affordable, carbon-neutral homes. Research also takes place into higher efficiency solar panels, geothermal electricity and heating, lower cost wind generators, and the economic and environmental feasibility of potential hydro power plants.

The Fusion Energy Division pursues short-term goals to develop components such as high-temperature superconductors, high-speed hydrogen pellet injectors, and suitable materials for future fusion research. Much research into the behaviour and maintenance of plasma takes place at the Fusion Energy Division to further the understanding of plasma physics, a crucial area for developing a fusion power plant. The US ITER office is at ORNL with partners at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Savannah River National Laboratory. The US contribution to the ITER project is 9.1% which is expected to be in excess of US$1.6 billion throughout the contract. ORNL researchers participated in developing of an extensive research plan for the US-ITER collaboration detailed in 2022.

===Biology===
Biological research covers ecology, forestry, genomics, computational biology, structural biology and bioinformatics. The BioEnergy Program aims to improve the efficiency of all stages of the biofuel process to improve the energy security of the United States. The program aims to make genetic improvements to the potential biomass used, formulate methods for refineries that can accept a diverse range of fuels, and to improve the efficiency of energy delivery both to power plants and end users.

The Center for Molecular Biophysics conducts research into the behaviour of biological molecules in various conditions. The center hosts projects that examine cell walls for biofuel production, use neutron scattering to analyse protein folding, and simulate the effect of catalysis on a conventional and quantum scale. ORNL is home to a field site for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which has a field office nearby. The Department of Energy works closely with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency out of ORNL to monitor forest ecology for the surrounding Appalachians &amp; Cumberland Plateau Domain of NEON.

===Neutron science===
There are two neutron sources at ORNL; the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). HFIR provides neutrons in a stable beam resulting from a constant nuclear reaction whereas SNS, a particle accelerator, produces pulses of neutrons. HFIR went critical in 1965 and has been used for materials research and as a major source of medical radioisotopes since. As of 2013, HFIR provides the world&#x27;s highest constant neutron flux as a result of various upgrades. Berkelium-249, used to synthesize tennessine for the first time, was produced in the HFIR as part of an international effort. HFIR is likely to operate until approximately 2060 before the reactor pressure vessel is considered unsafe for continued use.

The SNS has the highest intensity neutron pulses of any human-made neutron source. SNS was made operational in 2006 and has since been upgraded to 1 megawatt with plans to continue up to 3 MW. High-power neutron pulses permit clearer images of the targets, meaning smaller samples can be analysed and accurate results require fewer pulses.

===Materials===

Between 2002 and 2008 ORNL partnered with Caterpillar Inc. to form a new material for their diesel engines that can withstand large temperature fluctuations. The new steel, named CF8C Plus, is based on conventional CF8C stainless steel with added manganese and nitrogen; the result has better high–temperature properties and is easier to cast at a similar cost. In 2003 the partners received an R&amp;D 100 award from &quot;R&amp;D magazine&quot; and in 2009 received an award for &quot;excellence in technology transfer&quot; from the Federal Laboratory Consortium for the commercialisation of the steel.

There is a high-temperature materials lab at ORNL that permits researchers from universities, private companies and other government initiatives to use their facilities. As is the case for all designated user facilities, the resources of the High Temperature Materials Laboratory are available for free if the results are published; private research is permitted but requires payment.

The Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) researches the behaviour and fabrication of nanomaterials. The center emphasises discovery of new materials and the understanding of underlying physical and chemical interactions that enable creation of nanomaterials. In 2012, CNMS produced a lithium-sulfide battery with a theoretical energy density three to five times greater than existing lithium ion batteries.

===Security===
ORNL provides resources to the United States Department of Homeland Security and other defense programs. The Global Security and Nonproliferation (GS&amp;N) program develops and implements policies, both US based and international, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear material. The program has developed safeguards for nuclear arsenals, guidelines for dismantling arsenals, plans of action should nuclear material fall into unauthorised hands, detection methods for stolen or missing nuclear material, and trade of nuclear material between the US and Russia. The GS&amp;N&#x27;s work overlaps with that of the Homeland Security Programs Office, providing detection of nuclear material and nonproliferation guidelines. Other areas concerning the Department Homeland Security include nuclear and radiological forensics, chemical and biological agent detection using mass spectrometry, and simulations of potential national hazards.

===High-performance computing===

ORNL has been the site of various supercomputers, home to the fastest on several occasions. In 1953, ORNL partnered with the Argonne National Laboratory to build ORACLE (Oak Ridge Automatic Computer and Logical Engine), a computer to research nuclear physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. ORACLE had 2048 words (80 Kibit) of memory and took approximately 590 microseconds to perform addition or multiplication of integers. In the 1960s ORNL was equipped with an IBM 360/91 and an IBM 360/65. In 1995 ORNL bought an Intel Paragon based computer called the &quot;Intel Paragon XP/S 150&quot; that performed at 154 gigaFLOPS and ranked third on the TOP500 list of supercomputers. In 2005 Jaguar was built, a Cray XT3-based system that performed at 25 teraFLOPS and received incremental upgrades up to the XT5 platform that performed at 2.3 petaFLOPS in 2009. It was recognised as the world&#x27;s fastest from November 2009 until November 2010. Summit was built for Oak Ridge National Laboratory during 2018, which benchmarked at 122.3 petaFLOPS. As of June 2020, Summit was the world&#x27;s second fastest [clocked] supercomputer with 202,752 CPU cores, 27,648 Nvidia Tesla GPUs, and 250 Petabytes of storage, having lost the top position to the Japanese Fugaku supercomputer. In May 2022, the ORNL Frontier system broke the exascale barrier, achieving 1.102 exaflop/s using 8,730,112 cores.

Since 1992 the Center for Computational Sciences has overseen high performance computing at ORNL. It manages the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility that contains the machines. In 2012, Jaguar was upgraded to the XK7 platform, a fundamental change as GPUs are used for the majority of processing, and renamed Titan. Titan performed at 17.59 petaFLOPS and held the number 1 spot on the TOP500 list for November 2012. Other computers include a 77 node cluster to visualise data that the larger machines output in the &quot;Exploratory Visualization Environment for Research in Science and Technology&quot; (EVEREST), a visualisation room with a 10 by 3 metre (30 by 10 ft) wall that displays 35 megapixel projections. Smoky is an 80 node Linux cluster used for application development. Research projects are refined and tested on Smoky before running on larger machines such as Titan.

In 1989 programmers at the Oak Ridge National Lab wrote the first version of Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM), software that enables distributed computing on machines of differing specifications. PVM is free software and has become the de facto standard for distributed computing. Jack Dongarra of ORNL and the University of Tennessee wrote the LINPACK software library and LINPACK benchmarks, used to calculate linear algebra and the standard method of measuring floating point performance of a supercomputer as used by the TOP500 organisation.

<text>(The Flying Dutchman), WWV 63, is a German-language opera, with libretto and music by Richard Wagner. The central theme is redemption through love. Wagner conducted the premiere at the Königliches Hoftheater Dresden in 1843. 

Wagner claimed in his 1870 autobiography &quot;Mein Leben&quot; that he had been inspired to write the opera following a stormy sea crossing he made from Riga to London in July and August 1839. In his 1843 &quot;Autobiographic Sketch&quot;, Wagner acknowledged he had taken the story from Heinrich Heine&#x27;s retelling of the legend in his 1833 satirical novel &quot;The Memoirs of Mister von Schnabelewopski&quot; (&quot;Aus den Memoiren des Herrn von Schnabelewopski&quot;).

This work shows early attempts at operatic styles that would characterise his later music dramas. In &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; Wagner uses a number of leitmotifs (literally, &quot;leading motifs&quot;) associated with the characters and themes. The leitmotifs are all introduced in the overture, which begins with a well-known ocean or storm motif before moving into the Dutchman and Senta motifs.

Wagner originally wrote the work to be performed without intermission – an example of his efforts to break with tradition – and, while today&#x27;s opera houses sometimes still follow this directive, it is also performed in a three-act version.

The autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.

==Composition history==

At the beginning of 1839, the 26-year-old Richard Wagner was employed as a conductor at the Court Theatre in Riga. His extravagant lifestyle plus the retirement from the stage of his actress wife, Minna Planer, caused him to run up huge debts that he was unable to repay. Wagner was writing &quot;Rienzi&quot; and hatched a plan to flee his creditors in Riga, escape to Paris via London and make his fortune by putting &quot;Rienzi&quot; on to the stage of the Paris Opéra. However, this plan quickly turned to disaster: his passport having been seized by the authorities on behalf of his creditors, he and Minna had to make a dangerous and illegal crossing over the Prussian border, during which Minna suffered a miscarriage. Boarding the ship &quot;Thetis&quot;, whose captain had agreed to take them without passports, their sea journey was hindered by storms and high seas. The ship at one point took refuge in the Norwegian fjords at Tvedestrand, and a trip that was expected to take eight days finally delivered Wagner to London three weeks after leaving Riga.

Wagner&#x27;s experience of Paris was also disastrous. He was unable to get work as a conductor, and the &quot;Opéra&quot; did not want to produce &quot;Rienzi&quot;. The Wagners were reduced to poverty, relying on handouts from friends and from the little income that Wagner could make writing articles on music and copying scores. Wagner hit on the idea of a one-act opera on the theme of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, which he hoped might be performed before a ballet at the &quot;Opéra&quot;.
The voyage through the Norwegian reefs made a wonderful impression on my imagination; the legend of the Flying Dutchman, which the sailors verified, took on a distinctive, strange colouring that only my sea adventures could have given it.
Wagner wrote the first prose draft of the story in Paris early in May 1840, basing the story on Heinrich Heine&#x27;s satire &quot;The Memoirs of Mister von Schnabelewopski&quot; (&quot;Aus den Memoiren des Herrn von Schnabelewopski&quot;) published in &quot;Der Salon&quot; in 1834. In Heine&#x27;s tale, the narrator watches a performance of a fictitious stage play on the theme of the sea captain cursed to sail forever for blasphemy. Heine introduces the character as a Wandering Jew of the ocean, and also added the device taken up so vigorously by Wagner in this, and many subsequent operas: the Dutchman can only be redeemed by the love of a faithful woman. In Heine&#x27;s version, this is presented as a means for ironic humour; however, Wagner took this theme literally and in his draft, the woman is faithful until death.

By the end of May 1841 Wagner had completed the libretto or &quot;poem&quot; as he preferred to call it. Composition of the music had begun during May to July of the previous year, 1840, when Wagner wrote Senta&#x27;s Ballad, the Norwegian Sailors&#x27; song in act 3 (&quot;&quot;) and the subsequent Phantom song of the Dutchman&#x27;s crew in the same scene. These were composed for an audition at the Paris &quot;Opéra&quot;, along with the sketch of the plot. Wagner actually sold the sketch to the Director of the &quot;Opéra&quot;, Léon Pillet, for 500 francs, but was unable to convince him that the music was worth anything. Wagner composed the rest of the &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; during the summer of 1841, with the Overture being written last, and by November 1841 the orchestration of the score was complete. While this score was designed to be played continuously in a single act, Wagner later divided the piece into a three-act work. In doing so, however, he did not alter the music significantly, but merely interrupted transitions that had originally been crafted to flow seamlessly (the original one-act layout is restored in some performances).

In his original draft Wagner set the action in Scotland, but he changed the location to Norway shortly before the first production staged in Dresden and conducted by himself in January 1843.

In his essay &quot;A Communication to My Friends&quot; in 1851, Wagner claimed that &quot;The Dutchman&quot; represented a new start for him: &quot;From here begins my career as poet, and my farewell to the mere concoctor of opera-texts.&quot; Indeed, to this day the opera is the earliest of Wagner&#x27;s works to be performed at the Bayreuth Festival, and, at least for that theatre, marks the start of the mature Wagner canon.

==Synopsis==
:Place: On the coast of Norway

===Act 1===

On his homeward journey, the sea captain Daland is compelled by stormy weather to seek a port of refuge near Sandwike in southern Norway. He leaves the helmsman on watch and he and the sailors retire. (Song of the helmsman: &quot;&quot; – &quot;With tempest and storm on distant seas.&quot;) The helmsman falls asleep. A ghostly vessel appearing astern is dashed against Daland&#x27;s vessel by the sea and the grappling irons hold the two ships together. Invisible hands furl the sails. A man of pale aspect, dressed in black, his face framed by a thick black beard, steps ashore. He laments his fate. (Aria: &quot;&quot; – &quot;The time has come and seven years have again elapsed&quot;) Because he once invoked Satan, the ghost captain is cursed to roam the sea forever without rest. An angel brought to him the terms of his redemption: Every seven years the waves will cast him upon the shore; if he can find a wife who will be true to him he will be released from his curse.

Daland wakes up and meets the stranger. The stranger hears that Daland has an unmarried daughter named Senta, and he asks for her hand in marriage, offering a chest of treasure as a gift. Tempted by gold, Daland agrees to the marriage. The southwind blows and both vessels set sail for Daland&#x27;s home.

===Act 2===
A group of local girls are singing and spinning in Daland&#x27;s house. (Spinning chorus: &quot; – &quot;Whir and whirl, good wheel&quot;) Senta, Daland&#x27;s daughter, dreamily gazes upon a gorgeous picture of the legendary Dutchman that hangs from the wall; she desires to save him. Against the will of her nurse, she sings to her friends the story of the Dutchman (Ballad with the Leitmotiv), how Satan heard him swear and took him at his word. She vows to save him by her fidelity.

The huntsman Erik, Senta&#x27;s former boyfriend, arrives and hears her; the girls depart, and the huntsman, who loves the maiden, warns her, telling her of his dream, in which Daland returned with a mysterious stranger, who carried her off to sea. She listens with delight, and Erik leaves in despair.

Daland arrives with the stranger; he and Senta stand gazing at each other in silence. Daland is scarcely noticed by his daughter, even when he presents his guest as her betrothed. In the following duet, which closes the act, Senta swears to be true till death.

===Act 3===

Later in the evening, the local girls bring Daland&#x27;s men food and drink. They invite the crew of the strange vessel to join in the merry-making, but in vain. The girls retire in wonder; ghostly forms appear at work upon the vessel, and Daland&#x27;s men retreat in fear.

Senta arrives, followed by Erik, who reproves her for deserting him, as she had formerly loved him and vowed constancy. When the stranger, who has been listening, hears these words, he is overwhelmed with despair, as he thinks he is now forever lost. He summons his men, tells Senta of the curse, and to the consternation of Daland and his crew declares that he is &quot;Der fliegende Holländer.&quot;

As the Dutchman sets sail, Senta throws herself into the sea, claiming that she will be faithful to him unto death. This is his salvation. The spectral ship disappears, and Senta and the Dutchman are seen ascending to heaven.

<doc id="38150" wikidata="Q23085" url="?curid=38150" title="Lohengrin (opera)">
<text>Lohengrin ( in German), WWV 75, is a Romantic opera in three acts composed and written by Richard Wagner, first performed in 1850. The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the &quot;Parzival&quot; of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and its sequel &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, itself inspired by the epic of &quot;Garin le Loherain&quot;. It is part of the Knight of the Swan legend.

The opera has inspired other works of art. King Ludwig II of Bavaria named his castle Neuschwanstein Castle after the Swan Knight. It was King Ludwig&#x27;s patronage that later gave Wagner the means and opportunity to complete, build a theatre for, and stage his epic cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. He had discontinued composing it at the end of Act II of &quot;Siegfried&quot;, the third of the &quot;Ring&quot; tetralogy, to create his radical chromatic masterpiece of the late 1850s, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, and his lyrical comic opera of the mid-1860s, &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;.

The most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the Bridal Chorus, colloquially known in English-speaking countries as &quot;Here Comes the Bride,&quot; usually played as a processional at weddings. The orchestral preludes to Acts I and III are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces.

The autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.

== Literary background ==
The literary figure of Lohengrin first appeared as a supporting character in the final chapter of the medieval epic poem &quot;Parzival&quot; of Wolfram von Eschenbach. The Grail Knight Lohengrin, son of the Grail King Parzival, is sent to the duchess of Brabant to defend her. His protection comes under the condition that she must never ask his name. If she violates this requirement, he will be forced to leave her. Wagner took up these characters and set the &quot;forbidden question&quot; theme at the core of a story which makes contrasts between the godly and the mundane, and between Early Middle Age Christendom and Germanic paganism. Wagner attempted at the same time to weave elements of Greek tragedy into the plot. He wrote the following in &quot;Mitteilungen an meine Freunde&quot; about his Lohengrin plans:Who doesn&#x27;t know &quot;Zeus and Semele&quot;? The god is in love with a human woman and approaches her in human form. The lover finds that she cannot recognize the god in this form, and demands that he should make the real sensual form of his being known. Zeus knows that she would be destroyed by the sight of his real self. He suffers in this awareness, suffers knowing that he must fulfill this demand and in doing so ruin their love. He will seal his own doom when the gleam of his godly form destroys his lover. Is the man who craves for God not destroyed?

== Composition ==
&quot;Lohengrin&quot; was written and composed between 1845 and 1848 when Wagner worked as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court. The opera&#x27;s genesis, however, starts some years earlier when Wagner was living and working in Paris. By late 1841, Wagner had conceived a five-act historical opera based on the Hohenstaufen dynasty entitled &quot;Die Sarazenin&quot; (The Saracen Woman) and, although he lavished on it all the trappings of Grand Opera, his attention was soon distracted by a Volksbuch that he obtained through his friendship with the philologist Samuel Lehrs. The book in question was Ludwig Bechstein&#x27;s 1835 anthology of legends &quot;Der Sagenschatz und die Sagenkreise des Thüringerlandes&quot;. As well as being the means by which Wagner first became aware of the Lohengrin legend, the anthology also retold the tale of Tannhäuser.

Seeking a more authentic picture of the Tannhäuser legend, Lehrs then provided Wagner with the annual proceedings of the Königsberg Germanic Society which not only included C.T.L. Lucas&#x27;s critical study of the &quot;Wartburg war&quot; but also included a piece of criticism about the poem &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, together with a lengthy narrative of the rambling epic&#x27;s principal content. Thus, Wagner admits, with one blow a whole new world was opened to him, and although unable to find the form to master the material for his own dramatic purpose, he could clearly visualize Lohengrin and it remained as an inextinguishable image within him.

Stewart Spencer neither regards the abandonment of the Hohenstaufen projects during the 1840s at this time nor, more specifically, in the musical and formal dissimilarities between &quot;&quot; and &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; as symptomatic of a fundamental turn from history towards myth. Instead Spencer argues that Wagner did not draw any fundamental distinction between history and myth, and that Wagner&#x27;s response to myth is dynamic and dialectical. History per se might be arid and reductive but it contained within it the potential for a categorical interpretation allowing Wagner to make use of Leopold August Warnkönig&#x27;s (1835–42), three volume &quot;Flandrische Staats- und Rechtsgeschichte bis zum Jahr 1305&quot; to be mined for an accurate evocation of 10th century Brabant. It would be nearly four years before Wagner&#x27;s image of Lohengrin would again manifest itself to his creative imagination.

Writing retrospectively in his 1865 biography (even if its royal patronage diminishes its reliability), Wagner tells the story of how &quot;Lohengrin&quot;″s libretto was written. In the summer of 1845 Wagner with his wife Minna planned their annual hydrotherapeutic visit to Marienbad. Putting his work as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court out of his mind, Wagner&#x27;s intention was to abandon himself to a life of the utmost leisure, and he had chosen his summer reading with care: the poems of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the anonymous epic of Lohengrin with an introduction by Joseph von Görres. His plan to lie beside a brook communing with Titurel and Parzival didn&#x27;t last long and the longing to create was overpowering:

Lohengrin stood suddenly revealed before me in full armor at the center of a comprehensive dramatic adaptation of the whole material. ... I struggled manfully against the temptation to set down the plan on paper. But I was fooling myself: no sooner had I stepped into the noonday bath than I was seized by such desire to write Lohengrin that, incapable of lingering in the bath for the prescribed hour, I leapt out after only a few minutes, scarcely took the time to clothe myself again properly, and ran like a madman to my quarters to put what was obsessing me on paper. This went on for several days, until the entire dramatic plan for Lohengrin had been set down in full detail.

By 3 August 1845 he had worked out the prose draft. Wagner, with his head in a whirl, wrote to his brother, Albert, the following day, 4 August 1845:

...it was in this frame of mind yesterday that I finished writing out a very full &amp; detailed scenario for Lohengrin; I am delighted with the result, indeed I freely admit that it fills me with a feeling of proud contentment. ... the more familiar I have become with my new subject &amp; the more profoundly I have grasped its central idea, the more it has dawned upon me how rich &amp; luxurious the seed of this new idea is, a seed which has grown into so full &amp; burgeoning a flower that I feel happy indeed. ...In creating this work, my powers of invention &amp; sense of formal structure have played their biggest part to date: the medieval poem which has preserved this highly poetical legend contains the most inadequate &amp; pedestrian account to have come down to us, and I feel very fortunate to have satisfied my desire to rescue what by now is an almost unrecognizable legend from the rubble &amp; decay to which the medieval poet has reduced the poem as a result of his inferior &amp; prosaic treatment of it, &amp; to have restored it to its rich &amp; highly poetical potential by dint of my own inventiveness &amp; reworking of it. – But quite apart from all this, how felicitous a libretto it has turned out to be! Effective, attractive, impressive &amp; affecting in all its parts! – Johanna]&#x27;s role in it (Albert&#x27;s daughter – see illustration below) – which is very important &amp; in point of fact the principal role in the work – is bound to turn out the most charming &amp; most moving in the world.

Between May and June 1846, Wagner made a through-composed draft for the whole work that consisted of only two staves: one for the voice, the other just indicating the harmonies. Coterminously, Wagner began work on a second draft of the poem, beginning with Act III. The complete draft of Act III was completed before the second draft of Acts I and II. This has sometime led to the erroneous conclusion that the entire work was completed from the end to the front. On 9 September 1846 Wagner began to elaborate the instrumental and choral parts, which, along with the Prelude, was completed on 29 August 1847.

Numerous changes to the poem, particularly Act III, took place during work on the second draft. At this time Wagner was still trying to clarify the precise nature of the tragedy, and the extent to which he needed to spell out the mechanics of the tragedy to the audience. On 30 May 1846 Wagner wrote to the journalist regarding the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa. It is apparent from the letter that Wagner and Franck had been discussing Lohengrin for some time, and Wagner refers back to an earlier argument about the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa, and in particular whether Elsa&#x27;s punishment of separation from Lohengrin at the end of the opera is justifiable. Wagner uses the letter firstly to argue in favour of his version and secondly to expand upon the more general mythical structure underpinning the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa – a theme he would publicly develop in his 1851 autobiographical essay A Communication To My Friends. Elsa&#x27;s punishment, Wagner argues, cannot be chastisement or death but that her separation from Lohengrin: &#x27;this idea of separation- which, if it were left out, would require a total transformation of the subject and probably allow no more than its most superficial externals to be retained&#x27;. Franck&#x27;s concern appears to be that this particular punishment of separation will make the opera incapable &#x27;of being dramatically effective in a unified way&#x27;. Wagner confesses that Franck&#x27;s concerns have forced him to look objectively at the poem and to consider ways of making Lohengrin&#x27;s involvement in the tragic outcome clearer than had previously been the case. To this end, Wagner decided not to alter Act I or II but to write new lines in Act III:

&lt;poem&gt;
(Wagner wrote five additional lines here but they were rejected in the final draft).&lt;/poem&gt;

Later, in the same act, when Elsa calls on Lohengrin to punish her, the latter replies:

&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Wagner asks Franck if he should explicitly mention the specific rule associated with the Grail which, although not expressly forbidding the Grail knights from committing such excesses, nevertheless, discourages them from acting in this way. Wagner&#x27;s opinion is that it should be sufficient for the audience to deduce the Grail&#x27;s advice. Readers of the libretto in English will note that in Amanda Holden&#x27;s 1990 singing translation for the English National Opera, the Grail&#x27;s advice is transformed into an explicit commandment, with Holden acknowledging, on her website, that translating a libretto is effectively writing a new one &quot;despite its compulsory faithfulness to the original&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;There&#x27;s one atonement, penance for your crime!
Ah! I as you suffer this cruel pain!
We must be parted! You must understand:
this the atonement, this the Grail&#x27;s command!&lt;/poem&gt;

Having completed the second complete draft of Act III ten months later on 5 March 1847, Wagner returned to the beginning of Act I and began work on the second draft of Act I on 12 May and which was complete on 8 June 1847. The second complete draft of Act II was started on 18 June and complete on 2 August 1847. In a letter to Ferdinand Heine dated 6 August 1847, Wagner announced that he had completed the &quot;Lohengrin&quot; opera:

I feel pleased and happy as a result, since I am well satisfied with what I have done.

As outlined to Heine, Wagner&#x27;s plan was to build on the success of the premiere of Rienzi in Berlin on 24 October 1847 with a follow-up performance of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. As it turned out &quot;Rienzi&quot; in Berlin was not a success and &quot;Lohengrin&quot; was not performed there until 1859.

Composition of the full score began three months later on 1 January 1848, and by 28 April 1848 the composition of Lohengrin was complete. In September 1848 Wagner conducted excerpts from Act I at a concert in Dresden to mark the 300th anniversary of the court orchestra (later Dresden Staatskapelle).

==Musical style==
&quot;Lohengrin&quot; occupies an ambiguous position within Wagner&#x27;s aesthetic oeuvre. Despite Wagner&#x27;s ostensible rejection of French grand opéra, &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, like all Wagner&#x27;s operas, and for that matter his later musikdramas, owes some debt to the form as practised by Auber, Halévy and, irrespective of what Wagner sets out in his prose writings, Meyerbeer. &quot;Lohengrin&quot; is also the last of Wagner&#x27;s four &quot;Romantic&quot; operas, and continues with the associative style of tonality that he had previously developed in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. And &quot;Lohengrin&quot; is also the last of his composed works before his political exile, and despite the seventeen-year-long performance hiatus, &quot;Lohengrin&quot;″s musical style nevertheless anticipates Wagner&#x27;s future leitmotif technique.

== Performance history ==
The first production of &quot;Lohengrin&quot; was in Weimar, Germany, on 28 August 1850 at the Staatskapelle Weimar under the direction of Franz Liszt, a close friend and early supporter of Wagner. Liszt chose the date in honour of Weimar&#x27;s most famous citizen, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who was born on 28 August 1749. Despite the inadequacies of the lead tenor Karl Beck, it was an immediate popular success.

Wagner himself was unable to attend the first performance, having been exiled because of his part in the 1849 May Uprising in Dresden. Although he conducted various extracts in concert in Zurich, London, Paris and Brussels, it was not until 1861 in Vienna that he was able to attend a full performance.

The opera&#x27;s first performance outside German-speaking lands was in Riga on 5 February 1855. The Austrian premiere took place in Vienna at the Theater am Kärntnertor on 19 August 1858, with Róza Csillag as Ortrud. The work was produced in Munich for the first time at the National Theatre on 16 June 1867, with Heinrich Vogl in the title role and Mathilde Mallinger as Elsa. Mallinger also took the role of Elsa in the work&#x27;s premiere at the Berlin State Opera on 6 April 1869.

&quot;Lohengrin&quot;″s Russian premiere, outside Riga, took place at the Mariinsky Theatre on 16 October 1868.
The Belgian premiere of the opera was given at La Monnaie on 22 March 1870 with Étienne Troy as Friedrich von Telramund and Feliciano Pons as Heinrich der Vogler.

The United States premiere of &quot;Lohengrin&quot; took place at the Stadt Theater at the Bowery in New York City on 3 April 1871. Conducted by Adolf Neuendorff, the cast included Theodor Habelmann as Lohengrin, Luise Garay-Lichtmay as Elsa, Marie Frederici as Ortrud, Adolf Franosch as Heinrich and Edward Vierling as Telramund. The first performance in Italy took place seven months later at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna on 1 November 1871 in an Italian translation by operatic baritone . It was notably the first performance of any Wagner opera in Italy. Angelo Mariani conducted the performance, which starred Italo Campanini as Lohengrin, Bianca Blume as Elsa, Maria Löwe Destin as Ortrud, Pietro Silenzi as Telramund, and Giuseppe Galvani as Heinrich der Vogler. The performance on 9 November was attended by Giuseppe Verdi, who annotated a copy of the vocal score with his impressions and opinions of Wagner (this was almost certainly his first exposure to Wagner&#x27;s music).

La Scala produced the opera for the first time on 30 March 1873, with Campanini as Lohengrin, Gabrielle Krauss as Elsa, Philippine von Edelsberg as Ortrud, Victor Maurel as Friedrich, and Gian Pietro Milesi as Heinrich.

The United Kingdom premiere of &quot;Lohengrin&quot; took place at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 8 May 1875 using the Italian translation by Marchesi. Auguste Vianesi conducted the performance, which featured Ernesto Nicolini as Lohengrin, Emma Albani as Elsa, Anna D&#x27;Angeri as Ortruda, Maurel as Friedrich, and Wladyslaw Seideman as Heinrich. The opera&#x27;s first performance in Australia took place at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Melbourne on 18 August 1877. The Metropolitan Opera mounted the opera for the first time on 7 November 1883, in Italian, during the company&#x27;s inaugural season. Campanini portrayed the title role with Christina Nilsson as Elsa, Emmy Fursch-Madi as Ortrud, Giuseppe Kaschmann as Telramund, Franco Novara as Heinrich, and Auguste Vianesi conducting.

&quot;Lohengrin&quot; was first publicly performed in France at the Eden-Théâtre in Paris on 30 April 1887 in a French translation by Charles-Louis-Étienne Nuitter. Conducted by Charles Lamoureux, the performance starred Ernest van Dyck as the title hero, Fidès Devriès as Elsa, Marthe Duvivier as Ortrud, Emil Blauwaert as Telramund, and Félix-Adolphe Couturier as Heinrich. There was however an 1881 French performance given as a Benefit, in the Cercle de la Méditerranée Salon at Nice, organized by Sophie Cruvelli, in which she took the role of Elsa. The opera received its Canadian premiere at the opera house in Vancouver on 9 February 1891 with Emma Juch as Elsa. The Palais Garnier staged the work for the first time the following 16 September with van Dyck as Lohengrin, Rose Caron as Elsa, Caroline Fiérens-Peters as Ortrud, Maurice Renaud as Telramund and Charles Douaillier as Heinrich.

The first Chicago performance of the opera took place at the Auditorium Building (now part of Roosevelt University) on 9 November 1891. Performed in Italian, the production starred Jean de Reszke as the title hero, Emma Eames as Elsa and Édouard de Reszke as Heinrich.

Lohengrin was first performed as part of the Bayreuth Festival in 1894, in a production directed by the composer&#x27;s widow, Cosima Wagner, with and Ernst van Dyck, alternating as Lohengrin, Lillian Nordica as Elsa, Marie Brema as Ortrud and Demeter Popovic as Telramund and was conducted by Felix Mottl. It received 6 performances in its first season in the opera house that Wagner built for the presentation of his works.

A typical performance lasts from about 3 hours, 30–50 minutes.

==Synopsis==
:Place: Antwerp, on the Scheldt River, in the Duchy of Lotharingia
:Time: Sometime between 925, when Henry the Fowler acquired Lotharingia as a vassal state, and 933, when his wars with the Magyars ended

===Summary===
The people of the Brabant are divided by quarrels and political infighting; also, a devious hostile power left over from the region&#x27;s pagan past is seeking to subvert the prevailing monotheistic government and to return Brabant to pagan rule. A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noblewoman Elsa from a false accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.

===Act 1===

King Henry the Fowler has arrived in Brabant, where he has assembled the German tribes in order to expel the marauding Hungarians from his dominions. He also needs to settle a dispute involving the disappearance of the child-Duke Gottfried of Brabant. The Duke&#x27;s guardian, Count Friedrich von Telramund, has accused the Duke&#x27;s older sister, Elsa, of murdering her brother in order to become Duchess of Brabant. Telramund calls upon the King to punish Elsa and to make him the new Duke of Brabant.

The King calls for Elsa to answer Telramund&#x27;s accusation. Elsa does not answer the King&#x27;s inquiries, only lamenting her brother&#x27;s fate (&quot;Einsam in trüben Tagen&quot;). The King declares that he cannot resolve the matter and will leave it to God&#x27;s judgment through ordeal by combat. Telramund, a strong and seasoned warrior, agrees enthusiastically. When the King asks Elsa who shall be her champion, Elsa describes a knight she has beheld in her dreams (&quot;Des Ritters will ich wahren&quot;).

Twice the Herald calls for a champion to step forward, but gets no response. Elsa kneels and prays that God may send her champion to her. A boat drawn by a swan appears on the river and in it stands a knight in shining armour. He disembarks, dismisses the swan, respectfully greets the king, and asks Elsa if she will have him as her champion and marry him. Elsa kneels in front of him and places her honour in his keeping. He asks only one thing in return for his service: Elsa must never ask him his name or where he has come from. Elsa agrees to this (&quot;Wenn ich im Kampfe für dich siege&quot;).

Telramund&#x27;s supporters advise him to withdraw because he cannot prevail against the Knight&#x27;s powers, but he proudly refuses. The chorus prays to God for victory for the one whose cause is just. Ortrud, Telramund&#x27;s wife, does not join the prayer, but privately expresses confidence that Telramund will win. The combat commences. The unknown Knight defeats Telramund but spares his life (&quot;Durch Gottes Sieg ist jetzt dein Leben mein&quot;). Taking Elsa by the hand, he declares her innocent. The crowd exits, cheering and celebrating.

===Act 2===

&quot;Night in the courtyard outside the cathedral&quot;

Telramund and Ortrud, banished from court, listen unhappily to the distant party-music. Ortrud reveals that she is a pagan witch (daughter of Radbod Duke of Frisia), and tries to revive Telramund&#x27;s courage, assuring him that her people (and he) are destined to rule the kingdom again. She plots to induce Elsa to violate the mysterious knight&#x27;s only condition.

When Elsa appears on the balcony before dawn, she hears Ortrud lamenting and pities her. As Elsa descends to open the castle door, Ortrud prays to her pagan gods, Wodan and Freia, for malice, guile, and cunning, in order to deceive Elsa and restore pagan rule to the region. Ortrud warns Elsa that since she knows nothing about her rescuer, he could leave at any time as suddenly as he came, but Elsa is sure of the Knight&#x27;s virtues. The two women go into the castle. Left alone outside, Telramund vows to bring about the Knight&#x27;s downfall.

The sun rises and the people assemble. The Herald announces that Telramund is now banished, and that anyone who follows Telramund shall be considered an outlaw by the law of the land. In addition, he announces that the King has offered to make the unnamed knight the Duke of Brabant; however, the Knight has declined the title, and prefers to be known only as &quot;Protector of Brabant&quot;. The Herald further announces that the Knight will lead the people to glorious new conquests, and will celebrate the marriage of himself and Elsa. In the back of the crowd, four noblemen quietly express misgivings to each other because the Knight has rescinded their privileges and is calling them to arms. Telramund secretly draws the four noblemen aside and assures them that he will regain his position and stop the Knight, by accusing him of sorcery.

As Elsa and her attendants are about to enter the church, Ortrud rushes to the front of the procession and challenges Elsa to explain who the Knight is and why anyone should follow him. Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the King with the Knight. Elsa tells both of them that Ortrud was interrupting the ceremony. The King tells Ortrud to step aside, then leads Elsa and the Knight toward the church. Just as they are about to enter the church, Telramund enters. He claims that his defeat in combat was invalid because the Knight did not give his name (trial by combat traditionally being open only to established citizens), then accuses the Knight of sorcery. He demands that the Knight must reveal his name; otherwise the King should rule the trial by combat invalid. The Knight refuses to reveal his identity and claims that only one person in the world has the right to make him do so: his beloved Elsa, and she has pledged not to exercise that right. Elsa, though visibly shaken and uncertain, assures him of her confidence. King Henry refuses Telramund&#x27;s questions, and the nobles of Brabant and Saxony praise and honor the Knight. Elsa falls back into the crowd where Ortrud and Telramund try to intimidate her, but the Knight forces them both to leave the ceremony, and consoles Elsa. Elsa takes one last look at the banished Ortrud, then enters the church with the wedding procession.

===Act 3===

&quot;Scene 1: The bridal chamber&quot;

Elsa and her new husband are ushered in with the well-known bridal chorus, and they express their love for each other. Ortrud&#x27;s words, however, have made an impression on Elsa; she laments that her name sounds so sweet on her husband&#x27;s lips but she cannot utter his name. She asks him to tell her his name when no one else is around, but at all instances he refuses. Finally, despite his warnings, she asks the Knight the fatal questions. Before the Knight can answer, Telramund and his four recruits rush into the room in order to attack him. The Knight defeats and kills Telramund. Then, he sorrowfully turns to Elsa and asks her to follow him to the King, to whom he will now reveal his secrets.

&quot;Scene 2: On the banks of the Scheldt (as in act 1)&quot;

The troops arrive equipped for war. Telramund&#x27;s corpse is brought in. Elsa comes forward, then the Knight. He tells the King that Elsa has broken her promise, and discloses his identity (&quot;In fernem Land&quot;) by recounting the story of the Holy Grail and of Monsalvat. He reveals himself as Lohengrin, Knight of the Grail and son of King Parsifal, sent to protect an unjustly accused woman. The laws of the Holy Grail say that Knights of the Grail must remain anonymous. If their identity is revealed, they must return home.

As Lohengrin sadly bids farewell to Elsa, the swan-boat reappears. Lohengrin tells Elsa that if she had kept her promise, she could have recovered her lost brother, and gives her his sword, horn and ring, for he is to become the future leader of Brabant. As Lohengrin tries to get in the boat, Ortrud appears. She tells Elsa that the swan is actually Gottfried, Elsa&#x27;s brother, whom she cursed to become a swan. The people consider Ortrud guilty of witchcraft. Lohengrin prays and the swan turns back into young Gottfried. Lohengrin declares him the Duke of Brabant. Ortrud sinks as she sees her plans thwarted.

A dove descends from heaven and, taking the place of the swan at the head of the boat, leads Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail. A grief-stricken Elsa falls to the ground dead.

==Interpretations==
Liszt initially requested Wagner to carefully translate his essay on the opera from French into German, that he might be the principal and long-standing interpreter of the work – a work which, after performing, he regarded as &quot;a sublime work from one end to the other&quot;.

In their article &quot;Elsa&#x27;s reason: on beliefs and motives in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;&quot;, Ilias Chrissochoidis and Steffen Huck propose what they describe as &quot;a complex and psychologically more compelling account [of the opera]. Elsa asks the forbidden question because she needs to confirm Lohengrin&#x27;s belief in her innocence, a belief that Ortrud successfully erodes in Act II. This interpretation reveals Elsa as a rational individual, upgrades the dramatic significance of the Act I combat scene, and, more broadly, signals a return to a hermeneutics of Wagnerian drama.&quot;

===Operatic mishaps===

Tenors have sometimes run into trouble in the third act, just before Lohengrin departs by stepping on a swan-driven vessel or on the swan itself. In 1913, the Moravian tenor Leo Slezak is reported to have missed hopping on the swan, afterwards turning to Elsa with the question: &quot;Wann geht der nächste Schwan?&quot; (&quot;When does the next swan leave?&quot;). In 1936, at the Metropolitan Opera, the same thing happened to Danish tenor Lauritz Melchior.

<text>The AGM-114 Hellfire is an American missile developed for anti-armor use, later developed for precision drone strikes against other target types, especially high-value targets. It was originally developed under the name &quot;Heliborne laser, fire-and-forget missile&quot;, which led to the colloquial name &quot;Hellfire&quot; ultimately becoming the missile&#x27;s formal name. It has a multi-mission, multi-target precision-strike ability and can be launched from multiple air, sea, and ground platforms, including the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper. The Hellfire missile is the primary class air-to-ground precision weapon for the armed forces of the United States and many other countries. It has also been fielded on surface platforms in the surface-to-surface and surface-to-air roles.

==Description==
Most variants are laser-guided, with one variant, the AGM-114L &quot;Longbow Hellfire&quot;, being radar-guided. Laser guidance can be provided either from the launcher, such as the nose-mounted opto-electronics of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, other airborne target designators or from ground-based observers, the latter two options allowing the launcher to break line of sight with the target and seek cover.

The development of the Hellfire Missile System began in 1974 with the United States Army requirement for a &quot;tank-buster&quot;, launched from helicopters to defeat armored fighting vehicles.

The Hellfire II, developed in the early 1990s is a modular missile system with several variants, and entered service with the U.S. Army in 1996. Hellfire II&#x27;s semi-active laser variants—AGM-114K high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), AGM-114KII with external blast fragmentation sleeve, AGM-114M (blast fragmentation), and AGM-114N metal augmented charge (MAC)—achieve pinpoint accuracy by homing in on a reflected laser beam aimed at the target. The General Atomics MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) carry the Hellfire II, but the most common platform is the helicopter gunship, such as the AH-64 Apache or AH-1 Cobra, which can carry up to 16 of them each. The AGM-114L, or Longbow Hellfire, is a fire-and-forget weapon: equipped with millimeter-wave (MMW) active radar homing, it requires no further guidance after launch—even being able to lock on to its target after launch—and can hit its target without the launcher or other friendly unit being in line of sight of the target. It also works in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, such as smoke and fog, which can mask the position of a target or prevent a designating laser from forming a detectable reflection. Each Hellfire weighs , including the warhead, and has a range of depending on trajectory. The Hellfire has a Circular Error Probable (CEP) of less than .

The AGM-114R &quot;Romeo&quot; Hellfire II entered service in late 2012. It uses a semi-active laser homing guidance system and a K-charge multipurpose warhead to engage targets that formerly needed multiple Hellfire variants. It will replace AGM-114K, M, N, and P variants in U.S. service.

In October 2012, the U.S. ordered 24,000 Hellfire II missiles, for both the U.S. armed forces and foreign customers.

A possible new JCM successor called the Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM) is under consideration. Due to budget reductions, JAGM development was separated into increments, with increment 1 focusing on adding a millimeter-wave radar to the Hellfire-R to give it a dual-mode seeker, enabling it to track moving targets in bad weather.

==Operational history==

In 2009, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) acknowledged that Army Air Corps (AAC) AgustaWestland Apaches had used AGM-114N Hellfire missiles against Taliban forces in Afghanistan. The MoD stated that 20 missiles were used in 2008 and a further 20 in 2009. In the British Parliament, Liberal Democrat politician Nick Harvey argued that the &quot;Parliament must be reassured these are a weapon of last resort.&quot;

AGM-114 Hellfire missiles were used to kill Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) in 2004, and by the US military to kill American-born Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011, Al-Qaeda operative Abu Yahya al-Libi in Pakistan in 2012, al-Shabaab militant Mukhtar Abu Zubair in Somalia in 2014, and British ISIL executioner Mohammed Emwazi (also known as &quot;Jihadi John&quot;) in Syria in 2015. They were also used in the assassination of Qasem Soleimani as well as the killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri.

The AGM-114 has occasionally been used as an air-to-air missile. The first operational air-to-air kill with a Hellfire took place on 24 May 2001, after a civilian Cessna 152 aircraft entered Israeli airspace from Lebanon, with unknown intentions and refusing to answer or comply with ATC repeated warnings to turn back. An Israeli Air Force AH-64A Apache helicopter fired on the Cessna, resulting in its complete disintegration. The second operational air-to-air kill with a Hellfire occurred on 10 February 2018, after an Iranian UAV entered Israeli airspace from Syria. An Israeli Air Force AH-64 launched a Hellfire missile at the UAV, successfully destroying it.

In January 2016 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that one training missile without a warhead was accidentally shipped to Cuba in 2014 after a training mission in Europe; it was later returned. A US official said that this was an inert &quot;dummy&quot; version of the Lockheed system stripped of its warhead, fuse, guidance equipment and motor, known as a &quot;Captive Air Training Missile&quot;.

; M36 Captive Flight Training Missile: The M36 is an inert device used for training in the handling of the Hellfire. It includes an operational laser seeker.

; AGM-114R-9X
: The Hellfire R-9X is a Hellfire variant with a kinetic warhead with pop-out blades instead of explosives, used against specific human targets. Its lethality is due to of dense material with six blades flying at high speed, to crush and cut the targeted person—the R-9X has also been referred to as the &quot;Ninja Missile&quot; and &quot;Flying Ginsu&quot;. It is intended to reduce collateral damage when targeting specific people. Deployed in secret in 2017, its existence has been public since 2019. This variant was used in the killing in 2017 of Abu Khayr al-Masri, a member of Al-Qaeda&#x27;s leadership, and in 2019 of Jamal Ahmad Mohammad Al Badawi, accused mastermind of the 2000 USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing. The weapon has also been used in Syria, and in Afghanistan against a Taliban commander. It was used twice in 2020 against senior al-Qaeda leaders in Syria; in September 2020 US officials estimated that it had been used in combat six times.

: Hellfire missiles fired by a Reaper drone were used on 31 July 2022 to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of Al-Qaeda, who had formerly been involved in planning the 9/11 and other attacks on US targets. It was reported that the missile hit him on a balcony, causing minimal collateral damage. Reports stress that avoiding other casualties was a priority for the mission, following drone attacks that killed several uninvolved people, attracting much criticism. It is widely thought that the Hellfires were the R-9X variant, but a United States Special Operations Command spokesman declined to comment, while confirming that the R9X was &quot;in US Special Operations Command&#x27;s munitions inventory&quot;.

: Images of the aftermath of a US attack on a member of Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah (claimed to be Abu Baqir al-Saadi by Hezbollah affiliated reports) suggests an R-9X was used. The nature and announcement of the attack has led Howard Altman to suggest the weapon system is made more widely available to US forces. In December 2024 an R-9X appears to have been used near Idlib.

The system has been tested for use on the Humvee and the Improved TOW Vehicle (ITV). Test shots have also been fired from a C-130 Hercules. Sweden and Norway use the Hellfire for coastal defense and have conducted tests with Hellfire launchers mounted on the Combat Boat 90 coastal assault boat.

The US Navy evaluated the missile for use on the &quot;Freedom&quot;-class littoral combat ship and &quot;Independence&quot;-class littoral combat ship from 2014. The missile was successfully fired from a LCS in early 2017. This system is set to deploy by late 2019.

In 2016 the Longbow Hellfire was tested by the US Army using a 15-tube Multi-Mission Launcher mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) truck. The MML is an Army-developed weapon system capable of deploying both surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles.

The Longbow Hellfire initially equipped the Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) version of the Stryker to serve as a surface-to-air counter-drone missile, but in 2024 the U.S. Army prohibited its use on the platform after discovering that prolonged placement of the missiles on a ground vehicle created wear and tear that lead to potential safety concerns.
