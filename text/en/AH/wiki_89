<text>Chinese law is one of the oldest legal traditions in the world. The core of modern Chinese law is based on Germanic-style civil law, socialist law, and traditional Chinese approaches. For most of the history of China, its legal system has been based on the Confucian philosophy of social control through moral education, as well as the Legalist emphasis on codified law and criminal sanction. Following the Xinhai Revolution, the Republic of China adopted a largely Western-style legal code in the civil law tradition (specifically German and Swiss based). The establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 brought with it a more Soviet-influenced system of socialist law. However, earlier traditions from Chinese history have retained their influence.

== Chinese legal tradition ==
The word for law in classical Chinese was &quot;fǎ&quot; (法). The Chinese character for &quot;fǎ&quot; denotes a meaning of &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;straight&quot; and &quot;just&quot;, derived from its water radical (氵). It also carries the sense of &quot;standard, measurement, and model&quot;. Derk Bodde and Clarence Morris held that the concept of &quot;fǎ&quot; had an association with &quot;yì&quot; (義: &quot;social rightness&quot;). Yan Fu, in his Chinese translation of Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;De l&#x27;esprit des lois&quot; published in 1913, warned his readers about the difference between the Chinese &quot;fǎ&quot; and Western law: &quot;The word &#x27;law&#x27; in Western languages has four different interpretations in Chinese as in &quot;lǐ&quot; (理: &quot;order&quot;), &quot;lǐ&quot; (禮: &quot;rites&quot;, &quot;decorum&quot;), &quot;fǎ&quot; (法: &quot;human laws&quot;) and &quot;zhì&quot; (制: &quot;control&quot;).

A term which preceded &quot;fǎ&quot; was &quot;xíng&quot; (刑), which originally probably referred to decapitation. &quot;Xíng&quot; later evolved to be a general term for laws that related to criminal punishment. The early history &quot;Shang Shu&quot; recorded the earliest forms of the &quot;five penalties&quot;: tattooing, disfigurement, castration, mutilation, and death. Once written law came into existence, the meaning of &quot;xíng&quot; was extended to include not only punishments but also any state prohibitions whose violation would result in punishments. In modern times, &quot;xíng&quot; denotes penal law or criminal law. An example of the classical use of &quot;xíng&quot; is &quot;Xíng Bù&quot; (刑部, lit. &quot;Department of Punishment&quot;) for the legal or justice department in imperial China.

The two major Chinese philosophical schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced the idea of law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus create a sense of shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to publicly promulgate standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today.

Unlike many other major civilizations where written law was held in honor and often attributed to divine origin, law in early China was viewed in purely secular terms, and its initial appearance was greeted with hostility by Confucian thinkers as indicative of a serious moral decline, a violation of human morality, and even a disturbance of the total cosmic order. Historically, the people&#x27;s awareness and acceptance of ethical norms was shaped far more by the pervasive influence of custom and usage of property and by inculcating moral precepts than by any formally enacted system of law. Early emperors however embraced the Legalist ideal as a way of exerting control over their large and growing territory and population. This process was integrated with traditional Chinese beliefs in the cosmic order, holding that correct behavior was behavior consonant with the appropriate responses set by &quot;fǎ&quot;. &quot;Xíng&quot; states the potential costs to the individual of exceeding them and imposes penalties for these actions.

The imperial period was characterized mainly by the concept of law as serving the state, a means of exerting control over the citizenry. In the late Qing dynasty there were efforts to reform the law codes mainly by importing German codes with slight modifications. This effort continued and was amplified in the republican period resulting in the Provisional Constitution of 1912 which included the idea of equality under the law, rights for women, and broader rights for citizens vis-à-vis the government. The onset of the communist period at first rolled back the development of individual rights with the primary concept of law returning to that of a tool of the state. After the Cultural Revolution devastated the ranks of intellectuals and legal professionals, it took until 1982 for the idea of individual rights to reemerge as a significant influence on Chinese law.

The current constitution, created in 1982, states in Article V that no organization or individual is above the law and in Article III makes the People&#x27;s Congresses and state administration responsible to the people, paving the way for later efforts to allow enforcement of individual rights. Passage of the Administrative Litigation Law of 1987 created legal recourse for individuals from arbitrary government action, an avenue previously unavailable. Despite the deep-seated norm against legal proceedings, litigation in the Chinese courts has increased dramatically, especially in recent years. The continuing weakness of courts resulting from their dependence on the local government for financial support and enforcement undermines the effectiveness of these remedies but this has also begun to change with China&#x27;s initiatives to increase legal training and the professionalism of the judiciary.

One avenue of individual appeal from government action which continues to be important is the custom of &quot;xìnfǎng&quot; 信访 (or &quot;shàngfǎng&quot; 上访) or petitions by citizens to the individuals officials for change. The continuing wide use of &quot;xìnfǎng&quot; reflects the fact that many officials are still able to avoid legal sanctions and the underlying avoidance of the legal system, as well as the personal ability of officials to personally intervene to change unjust results. Recently &quot;xìnfǎng&quot; has been institutionalized to some extent with the central government mandating that every level of administration establish a &quot;xìnfǎng&quot; office to handle petitions and report them up to high levels. This solution by exertion of personal power clearly goes against the idea of rule of law, and worse, some scholars have noted that &quot;xìnfǎng&quot; today functions more as an informational collection system for the government than an effective review mechanism.

=== Confucianism and Legalism ===
Confucianism and Legalism are two major Classical legal theories or philosophies developed during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, a time that saw the most impressive proliferation of new ideas and philosophies in Chinese history. While both theories call for governmental hierarchy, they differ drastically in their views of human potential and the preferred means to achieve political order. Nevertheless, both theories have influenced and continue to influence the development of cultural, social, and legal norms in China.

==== Confucianism ====

The basic premise of Confucianism is the idea that human beings are fundamentally good. With this optimistic view on human potential, Confucius advocates for ruling through &quot;li&quot; – traditional customs, mores, and norms – which allow people to have a sense of shame and become humane people with good character, rather than through government regulations and penal law. The idea is that people will internalize the acceptable norms and only take proper actions. This will not only lead to a harmonious social order, but it will also provide the additional benefit of improving an individual&#x27;s inner character and the overall quality of the society. In contrast, codified laws require external compliance, and people may abide by the laws without fully understanding the reason for compliance. As such, a social order achieved through formal laws does not come with the additional benefit of better citizenry. However, even Confucius did not advocate for the elimination of formal laws. Rather, according to Confucianism, law should be viewed as a subsidiary tool primarily to be used against determined wrongdoers who cannot be affected by moral instruction.

As Confucius rejects the general use of formal laws to achieve social order, what lies vital to Confucius&#x27; theory is the willing participation by citizens of the society to search for commonly accepted, cooperative solutions. In addition to willing participation of citizens, there must also be grounds or bases upon which commonly acceptable solutions can be arrived at – the concept known as &quot;li&quot;. &quot;Li&quot; is commonly understood as a set of culturally and socially valued norms that provide guidance to proper behaviors that will ultimately lead to a harmonious society. These norms are not fixed or unchangeable over time but rather a reflection of what is accepted at a particular time in a particular context. When conflicts arise, the &quot;li&quot; have to be applied and interpreted to produce a just result and restore the harmony of the society. However, in the absence of any procedural safeguard afforded by codified laws, interpretation of &quot;li&quot; is subject to abuse.

Recognizing that people in a society hold diverse interests, Confucius charges the ruler with the responsibility to unify these interests and maintain social order. This is not done by dictatorship but by setting an example. Therefore, a ruler needs not to force his people to behave properly. Instead, the ruler needs only to make himself respectful, and the people will be induced and enlightened by his superior virtues to follow his example – an ideal known as &quot;wúwéi&quot;. Nevertheless, the ruler must know and understand the &quot;li&quot; to be able to create solutions to conflict and problems the society faces. As the people are to follow the moral standards and example set by the ruler, to a large extent, the quality of the ruler determines the quality of the political order.

Although discourse in Confucianism considered law as an inferior means of control when compared to morality and ritual, law in Confucian China was in practice overwhelmingly penal.

==== Legalism ====

In contrast to Confucius&#x27; &quot;li&quot;-based theory, the Legalism advocates the utilization of codified laws and harsh punishment to achieve social order. This is due to the legalists&#x27; belief that all human beings are born evil and self-interested. Therefore, if left unrestrained, people would engage in selfish behavior which will undoubtedly lead to social unrest. To cure this defect and force people to behave morally, the only way, believed the legalists, is to publicly promulgate clearly written laws and impose harsh punishments.

Realizing that the abilities of rulers are often limited and that reliance on the ruler&#x27;s ability and judgment often leads to adverse results, the legalists designed a system in which the law is run by the state, not the ruler. This ensures that the laws will be applied impartially without the interference of personal bias of the ruler or ones who are responsible for applying the laws. It also makes it irrelevant whether the ruler has superior abilities. This non-action promoted by the legalists is their understanding of the concept of &quot;wuwei&quot;, which is different from the Confucians&#x27; understanding of the same concept.

==== Comparison ====
Notwithstanding such an understanding, the ruler, like in Confucianism, has the ultimate authority to decide what the law should be. Therefore, like Confucianism, Legalism is subject to abuse as well. In fact, the Qin emperor implemented strict laws and extremely harsh punishments without taking into account mitigating circumstances even for insignificant crimes. For example, books were burned and people holding different ideals were buried alive. While the Qin emperor successfully instilled fear and respect for law into the minds of his people, the harshness of the law led to his quick demise after only 14 years of reigning over China.

In summary, although both Confucianism and Legalism were developed in a period of turmoil and both were aimed at the re-unification of the country, the two theories went opposite directions with one advocating for and one against the use of formal laws to achieve social order. What the two theories have in common is their concession of the ultimate authority to the ruler, who remained above and beyond the li or law. It is true that neither theory is ideal in achieving a social order. Nevertheless, both theories have had a significant impact on the cultural and legal development in China, and their influence remains visible today.

The significant influence of the Legalist tradition in Chinese law has historically been overlooked. Although the Confucian ideology provided the fundamentals for the substance of traditional law, the Legalist school constructed the important framework of the traditional legal system. The Han dynasty retained the basic legal system established under the Qin but modified some of the harsher aspects in line with the Confucian philosophy of social control.

The Han dynasty formally recognized four sources of law: &quot;lü&quot; (律: &quot;codified laws&quot;), &quot;ling&quot; (令: &quot;the emperor&#x27;s order&quot;), &quot;ke&quot; (科: &quot;statutes inherited from previous dynasties&quot;) and &quot;bi&quot; (比: &quot;precedents&quot;), among which &quot;ling&quot; has the highest binding power over the other three. Most legal professionals were not lawyers but generalists trained in philosophy and literature. The local, classically trained, Confucian gentry played a crucial role as arbiters and handled all but the most serious local disputes.

Eventually, the incorporation of the essentials of Confucianist &quot;li&quot; into legal codes occurred with this Confucian conception dominating ancient Chinese law. Ch&#x27;ü concludes that the gradual process of Confucianisation of law was the most significant development in the legal system of China prior to 20th century modernization. The line between ruling by moral influence and ruling by punishment was not always clearly delineated. For example, &quot;li&quot; could be enforced by moral influence and legal means. The metamorphosis of &quot;li&quot; into law depended on its widespread and unvaried acceptance by society.

Although the codification of law was largely completed by the &quot;Tang Code&quot; of CE 624, throughout the centuries the Confucian foundations of the Tang Code were retained, and indeed with some aspects of it strengthened by the later dynasties. &quot;The Great Ming Code&quot;, which was a model for the Qing code, covered every part of social and political life, especially family and ritual, but also foreign relations and even relations of earthly life with the cosmos.

The Confucian notion that morality and self-discipline was more important than legal codes caused many historians, such as Max Weber, until the mid-20th century to conclude that law was not an important part of Imperial Chinese society. This notion, however, has come under extreme criticism and is no longer the conventional wisdom among Sinologists, who have concluded that Imperial China had an elaborate system of both criminal and civil law which was comparable to anything found in Europe.

During the Qing dynasty, criminal justice was based on extremely detailed &quot;Great Qing Legal Code&quot;. One element of the traditional Chinese criminal justice system is the notion that criminal law has a moral purpose, one of which is to get the convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of torture, in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All capital offenses were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the emperor.

There was no civil code separate from the criminal code, which led to the now discredited belief that traditional Chinese law had no civil law. More recent studies have demonstrated that most of the magistrates&#x27; legal work was in civil disputes, and that there was an elaborate system of civil law which used the criminal code to establish torts.

== Modernization ==
The introduction and translation of Western legal texts into Chinese is believed to have been started under the auspices of Lin Zexu in 1839. More systematic introduction of Western law together with other Western sciences started with the establishment of Tongwen Guan in 1862. The major efforts in translation of Western law that continued until the 1920s prepared the building blocks for modern Chinese legal language and Chinese law. Legal translation was very important from 1896 to 1936 during which period the Chinese absorbed and codified their version of Western laws. These efforts were assisted by the medium of the Japanese legal language and law developed in Japan during the Meiji period which involved in large part Japanese translation of European Continental laws.

Under pressure from European powers and increasing commercial interactions, the influence of European legal systems on China increased. The First Opium War ended with the 1842 Treaty of Nanjing between China and the United Kingdom. The first of the unequal treaties, it required the establishment of five treaty ports in Chinese cities. The Treaty of the Bogue introduced extraterritoriality in favor of the UK, pursuant to which UK citizens were immune from prosecution in Chinese courts and instead only UK law applied. The United States obtained similar privileges under the 1844 Treaty of Wanghia, as did France under the 1844 Treaty of Whampoa. Concessions, where foreign law applied not just to foreigners but also to Chinese, further accelerated the influence of non-Chinese legal concepts.

In the early 1900s, the Qing dynasty&#x27;s Imperial Recodification Commission prepared a proposed civil code which was significantly influenced by the German and Japanese legal systems. Jurist Shen Jiaben and Governor Zhang Zidong led late Qing legal reform efforts. The Qing dynasty was defeated before the code was adopted and the Republic of China rejected the proposed code, instead developing its own.

Attitudes toward the traditional Chinese legal system changed markedly in the late-20th century. Most Chinese and Westerners of the early 20th century regarded the traditional Chinese legal system as backward and barbaric. However, extensive research into China&#x27;s traditional legal system has caused attitudes to become more favorable in the late-20th and early 21st centuries. Researchers of the early and mid-20th century tended to compare the traditional Chinese legal system to then contemporary systems, finding the former to be backward. However, more recent research compared the 18th-century Chinese legal system to European systems of the 18th century, resulting in a far more positive view of traditional Chinese law.

The Department of Punishment was changed to &quot;fa bu&quot; (法部: &quot;Department of Law&quot;) in the early 1900s legal reforms.

=== Republic of China ===

The Republic of China discarded the proposed code drafted at the end of the Qing empire and prepared its own civil code which it adopted in 1929. It was significantly influenced by German civil law.

Law in the Republic of China (Taiwan) is mainly a civil law system. The legal structure is codified into the Six Codes: the Constitution, the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedures, the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedures and in Administrative Laws.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

Unlike traditional Chinese law, modern Chinese law is based mainly on statutory law and court judgments do not have binding precedential value.

After the Communist victory in 1949, the newly established People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) quickly abolished the ROC&#x27;s legal codes and attempted to create a system of socialist law copied from the Soviet Union. With the Sino-Soviet split (1960–1989) and the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), all legal work came under suspicion of being counter-revolutionary, and the legal system completely collapsed. A new concept of justice called judicial populism (&quot;sifa dazhonghua&quot;) was established. Instead of the requirement for judges to comply with strict judicial procedures, it promoted substantive justice and problem-solving mechanisms. This legal tradition is based on a cultural view of the non-finality in justice as well as the revolutionary practice of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that relies on people&#x27;s justice.

Over the past century China has had several constitutions. The first attempts towards implementing a constitution in China occurred during the final decade (1902–1912) of the Qing dynasty. Various controlling groups subsequently promulgated different constitutions between that time and the establishment of the PRC in 1949. The PRC had a provisional constitution from its inception until the enactment of its first constitution in 1954. This initial constitution was based on the constitution of the Soviet Union. It was shortly ignored, however, and became without legal force. Although it provided for the election of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) every four years as the highest state power, these guidelines were not adhered to. The second constitution of the PRC, modeled on the ideology of the Cultural Revolution, came into force in 1975. This constitution subjected the NPC to the CCP and removed previous constitutional protections such as equality under the law and private-property succession rights. It was also immediately disregarded through breaches of its provisions and non-adherence to guidelines regarding the NPC. The third constitution of the PRC was adopted in 1978. Although this version moved away from the ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, it did retain some remnants of it. It also retained CCP control over the state structure. However, reformists subsequently gained power, which led to the breakdown of this constitution as focus shifted to economic construction and modernization.

With the start of the Deng Xiaoping reforms (), the idea of reconstructing a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and developing a &quot;rule of law&quot; to replace rule by dictatorship began to gain traction. New laws were passed and foreign investors sought improvements in property rights which had not been a feature of Maoist government but there was internal conflict in China over the extent of incorporating foreign legal norms into the Chinese legal system. Chinese reformers sought to create a special arbitration body, independent of the local legal system, called the China International Economic Trade and Arbitration Commission (CIETAC). In 1982 Peng Zhen said &quot;It is necessary to draw on beneficial experiences – ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign – in studying the science of law...We study them in order to make the past serve the present and foreign things serve China&quot;. Others who were more supportive of reforms like Qiao Shi still urged caution against &quot;just copying blindly&quot; and Deng Xiaoping himself said &quot;we must pay attention to studying and absorbing foreign experience...However, we will never succeed if we mechanically copy the experiences and models of other countries&quot;.

The Constitution of the PRC, enacted in 1982, reflects the model of the first PRC constitution. The Constitution provides for leadership through the working class, led in turn by the CCP. The Constitution provides that the NPC is the supreme organ of state power over a structure of other people&#x27;s congresses at various levels. The NPC has power to:

* amend the Constitution by a two-thirds majority
* promulgate legislation
* elect and remove highest-level officials
* determine the budget
* control economic and social-development planning

The NPC also includes a Standing Committee that functions much as the NPC does when the NPC is not in session. Although the Standing Committee has had some powers since 1955, its law-making powers were initially provided for in the 1982 Constitution. The NPC sits at the highest level in the hierarchy of governmental structure in the PRC. This national level is followed in descending order by the provincial level (including autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the national level), the prefectural level, the county level, and the townships and towns level. Government members at the lower two levels are directly elected, and those at the higher levels are elected by the lower levels. In addition to the NPC, the provincial people&#x27;s congresses possesses legislative power and can pass laws so long as they do not contravene the Constitution or higher legislation or administrative regulations.

The Constitution states its own supremacy. However, it has been theorized that the supremacy of the CCP means that the Constitution and law are not supreme, and that this perspective results from the Marxist view of law as simply a superstructure combined with a lack of recognition of rule of law in philosophical or historical tradition. Although the Constitution provides for legislative, executive, judicial, and procuratorial powers, they all remain subject to CCP leadership. Often, important political decisions are made through actions which are not regulated by the Constitution. Additionally, courts need not rely on the Constitution in deciding cases, and they may not review legislation for Constitutionality.

Since 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 300 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. The use of mediation committees, informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC&#x27;s civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties, is one innovative device. More than 800,000 such committees operate – in both rural and urban areas.

In drafting the new laws, the PRC has not copied any other legal system wholesale, and the general pattern has involved issuing laws for a specific topic or location. Often laws are drafted on a trial basis, with the law being redrafted after several years. This process of creating a legal infrastructure piecemeal has led to many situations where the laws are missing, confusing, or contradictory, and has led to judicial decisions having more precedental value than in most civil law jurisdictions. In formulating laws, the PRC has been influenced by a number of sources, including traditional Chinese views toward the role of law, the PRC&#x27;s socialist background, the German-based law of the Republic of China on Taiwan, and the English-based common law used in Hong Kong.

Legal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. The Chinese government has promoted a reform it often calls &quot;legalisation&quot; (法制化). Legalisation, among other things, has provided the régime with a gloss of legitimacy and has enhanced predictability. There have been major efforts in the rationalization and strengthening of the legal structure and institution building in terms of developing and improving the professionalism of the legislature, judiciary and legal profession. As market reforms have deepened and social inequality has widened, legal forums – ranging from mediation and arbitration commissions to courts – have come to play an increasingly prominent role.

The 1994 Administrative Procedural Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal-procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal-law amendments abolished the crime of &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; activity. However political dissidents are sometimes charged on the grounds of subverting state security or of publishing state secrets. Criminal-procedures reforms also encouraged establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. Minor crimes such as prostitution and drug use are sometimes dealt with under re-education through labor laws. The PRC constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, but some have argued that they are often ignored in practice. (See Human rights in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.)

As a result of a trade war with the United States of America over violations of intellectual property rights of American corporations in the early 1990s, the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s trademark law has been modified and offers significant protections to foreign trademark-owners.

After their respective transfers of sovereignty, Hong Kong and Macau continue to practice English common law and Portuguese legal systems respectively, with their own courts of final appeal. Hong Kong and Macau lie outside of the legal jurisdiction of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, except on constitutional issues.

Due to the growing sophistication of Chinese laws, the expansion of the rule of law, as well as an influx of foreign law firms, China has also begun to develop a legal-services market. Foreign lawyers have accompanied foreign capital and their clients to China, which has had an immense influence on the promulgation of new Chinese laws based on international norms, especially in regards to intellectual property and corporate and securities law.

On July 1, 1992, in order to meet growing demand, the Chinese government opened the legal-services market to foreign law-firms, allowing them to establish offices in China when the Ministry of Justice and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAOIC) issued the Provisional Regulation of Establishment of Offices by Foreign Law Firms regulation. As a result, many foreign law firms incorporated consulting firms in their home countries or in Hong Kong and then set up subsidiaries in Beijing or Shanghai to provide legal services.

However, many regulatory barriers to entry remain to protect the domestic legal industry. Issues relating to Chinese law must be referred to Chinese law firms, and foreign lawyers are also prohibited from interpreting or practicing Chinese law or from representing their clients in court. However, in reality many foreign law firms interpret laws and manage litigation by directing the local firms they must have cooperative relationships with. In this regard, China&#x27;s restrictive legal market can be directly tied to a phobia of people asserting their legal rights in the face of rampant corruption. Information received from the State Council Legislative Office suggests that China may be allowing foreigners to sit the Chinese Lawyers Examination, or have a mutual recognition treaty with other countries to allow foreign lawyers to conduct non-litigation Chinese legal work.

Since the early 2000s, environmental lawsuits have been available in China. 2014 amendments to China&#x27;s Environmental Protection Law permit public interest environmental litigation, including with non-governmental organizations as proper plaintiffs.

In 2005, China started implementing legal reform, which revived the Maoist-era ideals adopted during the 1950s due to the position that the law is cold and unresponsive to the needs of its citizens. This initiative favored mediation over court trials when it came to resolving conflicts among citizens and conflicts between citizens and the state. It also revived judicial populism at the expense of judicial professionalism and was marked by the return of the mass-trial model used during the 1940s.

China&#x27;s first comprehensive antitrust law was the Anti-Monopoly Law which was passed in 2007 and became effective in 2008.

In 2009, China amended its Criminal Law to set a low threshold for the prosecution of malicious cybercrimes and illegal data sales.

Xi Jinping encourages legal professionals to selectively integrate elements of traditional legal practice into modern approaches.

In 2015, the Administrative Procedure Law was revised to expand the people&#x27;s right to sue the government.

The primary laws regarding personal data security and privacy are the 2017 Cyber Security Law, the 2021 Data Security Law, and the 2021 Personal Information Protection Law.

== Legal rights ==
The modern idea of legal rights was introduced to China from the West in the 19th century. Its translation as &quot;quánlì&quot; (权利) was coined by William Alexander Parsons Martin in 1864, in his translation of Henry Wheaton&#x27;s &quot;Elements of International Law&quot;.

== Rule of law ==
One of the most commonly used phrases in contemporary China, by legal scholars and politicians alike, is fǎzhì (法治). Fǎzhì can be translated into English as &quot;rule of law&quot;, but questions have often been asked whether Chinese leaders meant &quot;rule by law&quot;, which means the instrumental use of laws by rulers to facilitate social control and to impose punishment as understood in the Legalist tradition. 

Late Qing dynasty legal reforms unsuccessfully sought to implement Western legal principles including the rule of law and judicial independence. Judicial independence further decreased under Chiang Kai-shek per the Kuomintang&#x27;s policy of particization (&quot;danghua&quot;) under which administrative judges were required to have &quot;deep comprehension&quot; of the KMT&#x27;s principles.

After China&#x27;s Reform and Opening Up, the CCP emphasized the rule of law as a basic strategy and method for state management. The concepts of yīfǎ zhìguó (依法治国: &quot;governing the nation according to the rule of law&quot;) and jiànshè shèhuì zhǔyì fǎzhì guójiā (建设社会主义法制国家: &quot;building a socialist rule of law state&quot;) have been part of the CCP&#x27;s official policy since the mid-1990s. Jiang Zemin called for establishing a socialist rule of law at the Fifteenth Party Congress in 1997. In 1999, the NPC adopted an amendment to the Chinese Constitution, incorporating &quot;governing the nation according to the rule of law&quot; and &quot;building a socialist rule of law state&quot; into Article 5. In 2014, the CCP formally adopted a policy of constructing a &quot;socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics.&quot;

The existence of the rule of law in China has been widely debated. When discussing Chinese law, it is worth noting that various expressions have been used, including &quot;strengthening the law,&quot; &quot;tightening up the legal system,&quot; &quot;abiding by the law in administration,&quot; &quot;rule by law,&quot; and the &quot;rule of law&quot;. Different shades of meanings have been attached to each of these terms, but Chinese officials and scholars have employed the expressions rather loosely and sometimes interchangeably. However, the central government had originally preferred the expression, &quot;strengthening the law/legal system&quot; to &quot;the rule of law&quot;. It was thought that the latter might give a controversial connotation of the instrumentality, while the former conveyed a straightforward meaning of strengthening the law and institutions. &quot;Strengthening the law&quot; meant reform of legislation and enforcement of laws.

Despite the newly elevated role of courts in Chinese society, there still remains some consensus about defects in China&#x27;s legal system in regards to progressing towards the rule of law. Scholars point to the following defects as slowing movement toward rule of law. These include:
* First, the National People&#x27;s Congress is ineffective at executing its constitutional duty to legislate and supervise the government.
* Second, the Chinese Constitution is not treated as the supreme law, nor is it enforced.
* Third, the judiciary is not independent from political pressure. On the other hand, direct intervention in particular cases by the Chinese Communist Party has lessened in recent years, as has the direct influence of the party on the legislative process.
* Fourth, there is a high level of corruption among public officials. Personal favors, bribery, and taking of public monies are all too common at all levels of government.
* Finally, the legal profession is inadequate for lack of qualified attorneys and judges. This failure is being remedied by legislation aimed at instituting higher educational standards for judges, opening more courts and law schools throughout China.

Lawyers in China have to swear an oath of loyalty to the CCP. Lawyers who refuse to follow the party line may have their license to practice law revoked.

Xi Jinping opposes Western views of the rule of law, such as the requirement of judicial independence. Xi states that the two fundamental aspects of the socialist rule of law are: (1) that the political and legal organs (including courts, the police, and the procuratorate) must believe in the law and uphold the law, and (2) all political and legal officials must follow the CCP.Xi&#x27;s view of the rule of law tends to equate the rule of law with the development of legislation. In his writings on socialist rule of law, Xi has emphasized traditional Chinese concepts including people as the root of the state (&quot;mingben&quot;), &quot;the ideal of no lawsuit&quot; (&quot;tianxia wusong&quot;), &quot;respecting rite and stressing law&quot; (&quot;longli zhongfa&quot;), &quot;virtue first, penalty second&quot; (&quot;dezhu xingfu&quot;), and &quot;promoting virtue and being prudent in punishment&quot; (&quot;mingde shenfa&quot;). 

Xi describes the leadership of the CCP as essential to upholding the socialist rule of law. In his view, &quot;The Party leads the People to enact and enforce the laws&quot; and it &quot;must lead the legislation, guarantee the law enforcement, and become the leader in conforming the law.&quot; 

According to academic Keyu Jin, the revised Administrative Procedures Law codified in 2021 marks a milestone in formalizing the rule of law in China.

<doc id="37570" wikidata="Q2285706" url="?curid=37570" title="Head of government">
<text>In the executive branch, the head of government is the highest or the second-highest official of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, autonomous region, or other government who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. 

In diplomacy, &quot;head of government&quot; is differentiated from &quot;head of state&quot;. 

The authority of a head of government, such as a president, chancellor, or prime minister, and the relationship between that position and other state institutions, such as the relation between the head of state and of the legislature, varies greatly among sovereign states, depending largely on the particular system of the government that has been chosen, won, or evolved over time.

In most parliamentary systems, including constitutional monarchies, the head of government is the &quot;de facto&quot; political leader of the government, and is answerable to at least one chamber of the legislature. Although there is often a formal reporting relationship to a head of state, the latter usually acts as a figurehead who may take the role of chief executive on limited occasions, either when receiving constitutional advice from the head of government or under specific provisions in a constitution.

In presidential republics or in absolute monarchies, the head of state is also usually the head of government. The relationship between that leader and the government, however, can vary greatly, ranging from separation of powers to autocracy, according to the constitution (or other basic laws) of the particular state.

In semi-presidential systems, the head of government may answer to both the head of state and the legislature with the specifics provided by each country&#x27;s constitution. A modern example is the present French government, which originated as the French Fifth Republic in 1958. In France, the president, the head of state, appoints the prime minister, who is the head of government. However, the president must choose someone who can act effectively as an executive, but who also enjoys the support of France&#x27;s legislature, the National Assembly, to be able to pass legislation. 

In some cases, the head of state may represent one political party but the majority in the National Assembly is of a different party. Given that the majority party has greater control over state funding and primary legislation, the president is in effect forced to choose a prime minister from the opposition party to ensure an effective, functioning legislature. In this case, known as cohabitation, the prime minister, along with the cabinet, controls domestic policy, with the president&#x27;s influence largely restricted to foreign affairs.

In communist states, the general secretary of the Communist Party is the supreme leader, serving as &quot;de facto&quot; head of state and government. In China, the &quot;de jure&quot; head of government is the Premier. The Chinese president is legally a ceremonial office, but the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (top leader in a one-party system) has always held this office since 1993 except for the months of transition.

In directorial systems, the executive responsibilities of the head of government are spread among a group of people. A prominent example is the Swiss Federal Council, where each member of the council heads a department and also votes on proposals relating to all departments.

== Titles of respective heads of government ==

The most common title for a head of government is Prime Minister. This is used as a formal title in many states, but may also be an informal generic term to refer to whichever office is considered the principal minister under an otherwise styled head of state, as &quot;minister&quot;—Latin for servants or subordinates—is a common title for members of a government (but many other titles are in use, e.g. chancellor and secretary of state). Formally the head of state can also be the head of government as well (ex officio or by ad hoc cumulation, such as a ruling monarch exercising all powers himself) but otherwise has formal precedence over the head of government and other ministers, whether he is their actual political superior (ruling monarch, executive president) or rather theoretical or ceremonial in character (constitutional monarch, non-executive president). Various constitutions use different titles, and even the same title can have various multiple meanings, depending on the constitutional order and political system of the state in question.

=== As political chief ===
In addition to prime minister, titles used for the democratic model, where there is an elected legislative body checking the head of government, include the following. Some of these titles relate to governments below the national level (e.g. states or provinces).

==== Alternative English terms and renderings ====
* Chancellor (primarily in German-speaking countries; today used in Germany and Austria)
* Chief Minister (often subnational)
* Chief Executive (often subnational)
* First Minister (often subnational)
* Minister-President
* Premier (from French &quot;premier ministre&quot;)
* President of the Council of Ministers
* President of the Council of State
* President of the Executive Council
* President of the Government
* State Counsellor (used exclusively in Myanmar)
* State President (used exclusively in South Africa)
* Taoiseach (used in Ireland)

=== Under a dominant head of state ===
In a broader sense, a head of government can be used loosely when referring to various comparable positions under a dominant head of state (especially is the case of ancient or feudal eras, so the term &quot;head of government&quot;, in this case, could be considered a contradiction in terms). In this case, the prime minister serves at the pleasure of the monarch and holds no more power than the monarch allows. Some such titles are diwan, mahamantri, pradhan, wasir or vizier.

However, just because the head of state is the &quot;de jure&quot; dominant position does not mean that he/she will not always be the &quot;de facto&quot; political leader. A skilled head of government like 19th-century German statesman Otto von Bismarck, Minister President of Prussia and later Chancellor of Germany under Emperor/King Wilhelm I, serves as an example showing that possession of formal powers does not equal political influence.

=== Indirectly referred as the head of state ===
In some cases, the head of state is a figurehead whilst the head of the government leads the ruling party. In some cases a head of government may even pass on the title in hereditary fashion. Such titles include the following:
* Mayor of the palace of the Merovingian kingdoms
* Nawab wasir of the Mughal Empire (also governor of Awadh)
* Peshwa of Satara and the Maratha empire
* &quot;Shōgun&quot; in feudal Japan
* Sultan in the original case of the Seljuk Turks who made the caliphs of Baghdad their puppets

=== Combined heads of state and government ===
In some models the head of state and head of government are one and the same. These include:
* President (chief executive)
* An absolute monarch reigning and ruling without a separate principal minister
* Chief magistrate
* Führer (used in Nazi Germany for Adolf Hitler)
* Supreme Leader (disambiguation)
* A State Governor in the United States (subnational executives)
An alternative formula is a single chief political body (e.g., presidium) which collectively leads the government and provides (e.g. by turns) the ceremonial Head of state. The only state in which this system is currently employed is Switzerland but other countries such as Uruguay have employed it in the past. This system is described as the directorial system.
* Sultan of Brunei
* King of Saudi Arabia
&quot;See Head of state for further explanation of these cases.&quot;

== Parliamentary heads of government ==

In parliamentary systems, government functions along the following lines:
* The head of government — usually the leader of the majority party or coalition — forms the government, which is answerable to parliament;
* Full answerability of government to parliament is achieved through
** The ability of parliament to pass a vote of no confidence.
** The ability to vote down legislative proposals of the government.
** Control over or ability to vote down fiscal measures and the budget (or supply); a government is powerless without control of the state finances. In a bicameral system, it is often the so-called lower house (e.g. the British House of Commons) that exercises the major elements of control and oversight; however, in some (e.g. Australia, Italy), the government is constitutionally or by convention answerable to both chambers/Houses of Parliament.

All of these requirements directly impact the head of government&#x27;s role. Consequently, they often play a &#x27;day to day&#x27; role in parliament, answering questions and defending the government on the &#x27;floor of the House&#x27;, while in semi-presidential systems they may not be required to play as much of a role in the functioning of parliament.

=== Appointment ===
In many countries, the head of government is commissioned by the head of state to form a government, on the basis of the strength of party support in the lower house; in some other states, the head of government is directly elected by parliament. Many parliamentary systems require ministers to serve in parliament, while others ban ministers from sitting in parliament (they must resign on becoming ministers).

=== Removal ===
Heads of government are typically removed from power in a parliamentary system by
* Resignation, following:
** Defeat in a general election.
** Defeat in a leadership vote at their party caucus, to be replaced by another member of the same party.
** Defeat in a parliamentary vote on a major issue, e.g., loss of supply, loss of confidence. (In such cases, a head of government may seek a parliamentary dissolution from the head of state and attempt to regain support by popular vote.)
* Dismissal — some constitutions allow a head of state (or their designated representative, as is the case in some Commonwealth countries) to dismiss a head of government, though its use can be controversial, as occurred in 1975 when then Australian Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in the Australian Constitutional Crisis.
* Death — in this case, the deputy head of government typically acts as the head of government until a new head of government is appointed.

=== First among equals or dominating the cabinet? ===
Constitutions differ in the range and scope of powers granted to the head of government. Some older constitutions; for example, Australia&#x27;s 1900 text, and Belgium&#x27;s 1830 text; do not mention their prime ministerial offices at all, the offices became a &quot;de facto&quot; political reality without a formal constitutional status. Some constitutions make a Prime Minister (first among equals) and that remains the practical reality for the Prime Minister of Belgium and the Prime Minister of Finland. Other states however, make their head of government a central and dominant figure within the cabinet system; Ireland&#x27;s Taoiseach, for example, alone can decide when to seek a parliamentary dissolution, in contrast to other countries where this is a cabinet decision, with the Prime Minister just one member voting on the suggestion. In Israel, while the Government is nominally a collegiate body with a role for the Prime Minister, the Israeli Prime Minister is the dominant figure in the executive branch in practice. The Prime Minister of Sweden, under the 1974 Instrument of Government, is a constitutional office with all key executive powers either directly at his or her disposal or indirectly through the collegial Government, whose members are all appointed and dismissed at the Prime Minister&#x27;s sole discretion.

Under the unwritten British constitution, the prime minister&#x27;s role has evolved, based often on the individual&#x27;s personal appeal and strength of character, as contrasted between, for example, Winston Churchill as against Clement Attlee, Margaret Thatcher as against John Major. It is alleged that the increased personalisation of leadership in a number of states has led to heads of government becoming themselves &quot;semi-presidential&quot; figures, due in part to media coverage of politics that focuses on the leader and his or her mandate, rather than on parliament; and to the increasing centralisation of power in the hands of the head of government. Such allegations have been made against three former British Prime ministers: Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, and Boris Johnson. They were also made against Italian prime ministers Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Renzi, Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau and Federal Chancellor of West Germany (later all of Germany), Helmut Kohl, when in power.

== Official residence ==


The head of government is often provided with an official residence, often in the same fashion as heads of state often are. The name of the residence is often used as a metonym or alternative title for &#x27;the government&#x27; when the office is politically the highest, e.g. in the UK &quot;Downing Street announced today…&quot;

Well-known official residences of heads of government include:
* 10 Downing Street in London — Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (who also has a country residence, Chequers)
* The Lodge in Canberra — Prime Minister of Australia (with an additional residence, Kirribilli House, in Sydney)
* 24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa — Prime Minister of Canada (who also has a country residence, Harrington Lake)
* Premier House in Wellington — Prime Minister of New Zealand
* 7, Lok Kalyan Marg in New Delhi — Prime Minister of India
* Prime Minister House in Islamabad — Prime Minister of Pakistan
* Catshuis in The Hague — Prime Minister of the Netherlands
* Ballhausplatz in Vienna — Chancellor of Austria
* Zhongnanhai in Beijing — Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China
* Kantei in Tokyo — Prime Minister of Japan
* Kramář&#x27;s Villa in Prague — Prime Minister of the Czech Republic
* Chigi Palace in Rome — Prime Minister of Italy
* Hôtel Matignon in Paris— Prime Minister of France
* Villa Parkowa in Warsaw— Prime Minister of Poland 
* Federal Chancellery in Berlin — Chancellor of Germany
* The Lambermont in Brussels — Prime Minister of Belgium
* Palacio de la Moncloa in Madrid — President of the Government of Spain
* Palacete de São Bento in Lisbon — Prime Minister of Portugal
* Kesäranta in Helsinki — Prime Minister of Finland
* Sager House in Stockholm — Prime Minister of Sweden (who also has a country residence, Harpsund)
* White House in Moscow — Prime Minister of Russia
* Palace of the Governorate in Vatican City — Governorate of the Vatican City State
* Phitsanulok Mansion in Bangkok - Prime Minister of Thailand
Similarly, heads of government of federal entities below the level of the sovereign state (often without an actual head of state, at least under international law) may also be given an official residence, sometimes used as an opportunity to display aspirations of statehood:
* &quot;Hotel Errera&quot; in Brussels — Minister-President of the Flemish community and region
* Bavarian State Chancellery – Minister-President of the State of Bavaria
* &quot;Élysette&quot; in Namur — Minister-President of Wallonia
* Bute House, Edinburgh; First Minister of Scotland
* Hesse State Chancellery, Wiesbaden; Minister-President of the State of Hesse
* Kazan Kremlin, Kazan – President of Tatarstan
* Government House, Hong Kong – Chief Executive of Hong Kong
* Macau Government Headquarters – Chief Executive of Macau
* Red City Hall – Governing Mayor of Berlin
* Quinta Vigia – President of the Regional Government of Madeira

Usually, the residence of the heads of government is not as prestigious and grand as that of the head of state, even if the head of state only performs ceremonial duties. Even the formal representative of the head of state, such as a governor-general, may well be housed in a grander, palace-type residence. However, this is not the case when both positions are combined into one:
* The White House (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue) in Washington, D.C. — President of the United States of America
* The Presidential Complex in Ankara – President of Turkey
* The Blue House (1 Sejongno Jongno-gu) in Seoul — President of South Korea
* Istana Nurul Iman in Bandar Seri Begawan — Sultan of Brunei
* Palácio da Alvorada in Brasília — President of the Federative Republic of Brazil
* The Malacañang Palace in Manila - President of the Philippines
* The Merdeka Palace in Jakarta - President of Indonesia

<text>Cordelia Chase is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;; she also appeared on &quot;Buffy&#x27;s&quot; spin-off series, &quot;Angel&quot;. Portrayed by Charisma Carpenter, the character appears as a series regular in the first three seasons of &quot;Buffy&quot;, before leaving the show and becoming a series regular during the first four seasons of &quot;Angel&quot;. The character made her last television appearance in 2004, appearing as a special guest star in &quot;Angel&quot; 100th episode. Cordelia also appears in both canonical and apocryphal &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; material such as comic books and novels.

Cordelia is introduced in &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot; as one of Sunnydale High&#x27;s popular students, attending school alongside vampire slayer Buffy Summers. Through her interactions with Buffy and her friends, she comes to accept the existence of supernatural forces and helps Buffy fight against them. In the television series &quot;Angel&quot;, Cordelia joins Angel, a heroic vampire with a soul, in forming a detective agency dedicated to stopping supernatural forces and helping the helpless. After Cordelia acquires the ability to see visions of those in need, she becomes a more compassionate and heroic character. In the middle of the third season, she becomes a love interest of the protagonist Angel. In the fourth season of &quot;Angel&quot;, she appears to take on a villainous role before it is revealed that she is possessed by a malevolent deity; this storyline eventually leads to her death and subsequent exit from the series. The character makes further canonical appearances in the comic books &quot;Buffy Season Eight&quot; and &quot;&quot;, in a dream flashback and as a spirit guide.

Created as a foil for &quot;Buffy&quot; titular heroine, Cordelia was initially characterized as &quot;shallow&quot;, &quot;vain&quot; and &quot;self-centered&quot;, and was used in the series to create conflict for the other characters. The character went through changes as she gradually redeemed herself throughout the course of &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, and has received attention in academic texts related to gender studies and social status.

== Appearances ==

===Television===
Cordelia Chase first appears in the premiere episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, titled &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot;. Introduced as a potential friend for Sunnydale High&#x27;s newest student, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Cordelia reveals her true colors by cruelly mocking Willow (Alyson Hannigan) whom Buffy befriends instead. Ignorant of the supernatural, Cordelia shows up regularly throughout the first season of &quot;Buffy&quot; to insult and ridicule the other characters. She plays a larger role in the episode &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;, in which she falls victim to a social outcast who wants revenge on popular students for ignoring her so much that she turned invisible. In the season finale, Cordelia helps Buffy and her friends battle vampires, finally coming to terms with the existence of supernatural forces. In season 2, Cordelia becomes a more active ally to the &quot;Scooby Gang&quot; and begins a romantic relationship with Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) in &quot;What’s My Line? Part 2.&quot; Dating someone of Xander&#x27;s social status causes Cordelia&#x27;s ostracism from her popular peers and she reluctantly breaks up with him. However, when Xander performs a love spell to pay her back for hurting him, Cordelia realises how much he cares about her and takes him back, rejecting her superficial friends in the process. In season 3&#x27;s &quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, Cordelia is heartbroken to see Xander kissing Willow and ends their relationship. By the season 3 episode &quot;The Wish&quot;, Cordelia slips back into her antagonistic persona from the first season, disassociating herself from the Scooby Gang altogether. In the episode &quot;The Prom&quot;, she reveals that her house and her family&#x27;s entire wealth has just been seized for tax fraud and both of her parents (never named or seen on-camera) are now in prison. Cordelia later attempts an unsuccessful relationship with Wesley (Alexis Denisof) and makes peace with Xander at the prom. In the season 3 finale, she rallies alongside Buffy and her friends at graduation against the demonic Mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener), where Cordelia slays her first vampire.

After three seasons on &quot;Buffy&quot;, Cordelia left the series to move over to star in &quot;Angel&quot;, a spin-off series focusing on the reformed vampire Angel (David Boreanaz). The first season sees Cordelia move to Los Angeles, in the hopes of escaping her new-found poverty by becoming an actress. After Angel saves her life in the series pilot, Cordelia helps him found the supernatural detective agency Angel Investigations, working in an administrative position. She also becomes close to half-demon co-worker Doyle (Glenn Quinn), but their budding romance is ended by his death nine episodes into the series. Before dying in the episode &quot;Hero&quot;, Doyle passes his ability to see people in distress over to Cordelia when he kisses her. Although she initially views the visions as a curse, in the season 1 finale, a demon causes Cordelia&#x27;s visions to overwhelm her – causing her to experience worldwide pain – and upon her recovery she vows to help those in need. In season 2&#x27;s &quot;Reunion&quot;, Cordelia and the other staff at Angel Investigations are fired by Angel, who is becoming increasingly obsessed with bringing down the evil law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart. Cordelia joins Wesley and Charles Gunn (J. August Richards) in re-forming the agency on their own. Angel and Cordelia eventually reconcile in the episode &quot;Epiphany&quot;. As her acting career continues to flounder, Cordelia is sucked into and made princess of a medieval hell dimension called Pylea in the episode &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. When presented with the opportunity to pass her visions over to a champion named the Groosalugg (Mark Lutz), Cordelia refuses and returns to L.A. with her friends in the season 2 finale.

In season 3&#x27;s &quot;Birthday&quot;, Cordelia learns from the demon Skip (David Denman) that her visions are slowly killing her because human beings are not strong enough to control them. To save her life, Cordelia accepts Skip&#x27;s offer to alter history so that she never met Angel in L.A., instead landing her big break as an actress. However, even in this alternate timeline, Cordelia feels compelled to help others and eventually crosses paths with Angel again, who received the visions in her place and is now insane. Unable to let her friend suffer, Cordelia has Skip return the timeline to normal, and agrees to become half-demon, with new powers, in order to harbor the visions safely. Season 3 also sees Angel become a father, with Cordelia stepping in to mother Connor until the infant is kidnapped into a hell dimension in the episode &quot;Sleep Tight&quot;, only to emerge as a disturbed teenager (Vincent Kartheiser) in &quot;The Price&quot;. In the episode &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;, Angel realizes he has romantic feelings for Cordelia, but is prevented from voicing them by the return of Groosalugg. Cordelia dates Groosalugg for season 3&#x27;s remainder, but Groo notices she loves Angel instead and decides to leave. In the season 3 finale, Cordelia arranges to meet Angel to confess her feelings, but is prevented from doing so by Skip, who informs her that she has become a higher being. Cordelia accepts her duty, and leaves Earth for another dimension. In season 4, Cordelia feels trapped in her position as a higher being, and so in the episode &quot;The House Always Wins&quot; she returns to Earth in an amnesiac state. In &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot;, her memories are returned via a spell, along with a vision of a mysterious Beast (Vladimir Kulich). Afterward, she admits to Angel the feelings she once had for him. As L.A. succumbs to the apocalypse in the episode &quot;Apocalypse, Nowish&quot;, Cordelia begins to behave out-of-character; she seduces Connor, murders Lilah (Stephanie Romanov) in the episode &quot;Calvary&quot;, commands the Beast in &quot;Salvage&quot;, and magically battles former friend Willow to keep Angel from his soul in the episode &quot;Orpheus&quot;. In the episode &quot;Players&quot;, the team realize that the now pregnant Cordelia is possessed, so Cordelia takes the unstable Connor on the run with her so they may give birth to their supernatural &#x27;offspring&#x27; Jasmine (Gina Torres). In &quot;Inside Out&quot;; Jasmine is a higher being who possessed Cordelia before her returning to Earth, manipulating events to be born in a new body of her own. Cordelia falls into a post-natal coma for season 4&#x27;s remainder. 

Following an eleven-episode absence, Cordelia returns in season 5, in the 100th episode &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot;. Having (apparently) awoken from her coma, Cordelia reunites with Angel Investigations, who she discovers have taken over Wolfram &amp; Hart since their defeat of Jasmine. She chastises Angel for accepting W&amp;H&#x27;s &quot;deal with the devil&quot; and reminds him of his true mission and higher calling. Together, they face and defeat their old enemy Lindsey McDonald (Christian Kane) who had been impersonating Doyle in an attempt to destroy Angel. In the episode&#x27;s closing moments, Cordelia reiterates to Angel that she loves him and kisses him, shortly before he receives a phone call reporting that Cordelia died that morning in the hospital. When Angel turns around, Cordelia is gone. It is later revealed that this encounter - the Powers That Be repaying their debt to Cordelia - allowed Cordelia to pass one last vision over to Angel, giving him the knowledge he needs to bring down the Circle of the Black Thorn.

Between 2001 and 2004, Joss Whedon and Jeph Loeb developed a 4-minute pilot episode for &quot;Buffy the Animated Series&quot;, which was set during the show&#x27;s first season. Had the series been picked up by a network, it would have featured Cordelia (voiced by Charisma Carpenter) in more high-school adventures. Following a 2008 leak of the pilot to YouTube, Loeb expressed some hope that the series may be resurrected in some form.

=== Literature ===
Cordelia also appears in comic books and novels based on the &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; television series. &quot;The Cordelia Collection, Vol. 1&quot; by Nancy Krulik is a novelization of the &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;, &quot;Some Assembly Required&quot; and &quot;Homecoming&quot;. These episodes tell specific incidents in which Cordelia becomes targeted: by a scorned classmate, to become a zombie&#x27;s bride and by hunters in a case of mistaken identity. She appears in numerous &quot;Angel&quot; novels as a member of Angel Investigations, but some feature Cordelia more prominently; in &quot;Not Forgotten&quot; she uncovers exploitation of child immigrants, while in &quot;Haunted&quot; she appears as a contestant on a supernatural-themed reality television show when she has a vision about another applicant. Cordelia appears in the majority of &quot;Angel&quot; comics, published by Dark Horse Comics during 2000–2002 and set between episodes of the television series. She appears less frequently in those by IDW Publishing between 2005 and 2011, mainly in stories set in and after the fifth season. Cordelia typically plays a minimal role in the Dark Horse &quot;Angel&quot; comics. However, issue seventeen was a &quot;Cordelia Special&quot;, in which demonic items are stashed in Cordelia&#x27;s apartment. In the &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; story &quot;Lovely dark and deep&quot;, Cordelia lands a role as the star of a demonic movie. Cordelia appears in the IDW Publishing comic mini-series &quot;Angel: The Curse&quot;, set after season 5, in flashback scenes. She subsequently reappears in the mini-series &quot;Angel: Old Friends&quot;, which sees Angel battle evil clones of his friends. Cordelia claims to be the genuine article, having returned from the dead, but Angel is unconvinced and kills her; his suspicions prove correct when her body immediately disintegrates like the other clones.

&quot;&quot;, a canonical comic book continuation of the television series plotted by Joss Whedon and written by Brian Lynch, features the characters of &quot;Angel&quot; and all of Los Angeles condemned to Hell after the events of the series finale &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;. Cordelia does not appear until the twelfth issue, in which she acts as a guide to Angel in his dying moments; it is revealed she serves in some capacity as a higher power now. The character departs in issue thirteen. Cordelia also appears in a dream sequence within the twentieth issue of &quot;Buffy&quot;″s canonical continuation, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;, titled &quot;After These Messages... We&#x27;ll Be Right Back!&quot;. Buffy dreams of when she was in her first year at Sunnydale High; Cordelia&#x27;s physical appearance is based on the art style of Loeb and Whedon&#x27;s unproduced &quot;Buffy&quot; animated series.

== Conception and casting ==
Cordelia was originally intended to serve as a dramatic foil to the series&#x27; main character Buffy Summers. Adapting the concept of the movie into a television series, Whedon decided to reinvent the character of Buffy. The shallow cheerleader of the 1992 &quot;Buffy&quot; film, as played by Kristy Swanson, had grown more mature and open-minded. Buffy now identified with the social outcasts, such as Willow and Xander. As a result, Cordelia Chase was created to embody the traits of that shallower Buffy. Despite portraying a shallow, valley girl stock character, actress Charisma Carpenter felt that Cordelia in early seasons was not &quot;one-dimensional&quot;, nor was she &quot;as superficial as people thought&quot;. At the same time, Carpenter was critical of her frequent role as the damsel in distress. &quot;Angel&quot; co-creator and executive producer David Greenwalt describes Cordelia in her &quot;Buffy&quot; years as &quot;a somewhat shallow, somewhat vain, somewhat self-centered but [a] lively and honest character who spoke her mind&quot;. Indeed, even not when superhuman, she showed a lot of hardiness.

Charisma Carpenter had originally planned to read for the role of Buffy, but was late for her audition and instead tried out for Cordelia. Carpenter, who had dressed casually for the role of Buffy—who she believed &quot;could really be herself&quot;—felt unprepared to read for Cordelia because she &quot;was definitely a character to dress for&quot;. Although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for the character, the producers were &quot;really responsive&quot; to Carpenter&#x27;s audition, and she left feeling confident she had got the part. After Carpenter&#x27;s audition, actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had been offered the role of Cordelia before Carpenter, was asked to come back and audition for the part of Buffy. Bianca Lawson originally won the role of Cordelia Chase, but turned it down due to other contractual obligations. Lawson would later be cast as vampire slayer Kendra in the show&#x27;s second season. Carpenter, proud of her own character&#x27;s growth across the two series, did not envy Gellar for winning the role of Buffy over her.

== Characterization ==

=== Characteristics and analysis ===
Cordelia&#x27;s representation of an assertive modern woman and her character arc in &quot;Buffy&quot; has been commented on in several academic texts, particularly in gender studies, such as &quot;Praising Cordelia: Aggression and Adaptation Among Adolescent Girls&quot;, or &quot;Sex and the Slayer&quot;. In the latter, Dr. Lorna Jowett of the University of Northampton describes Cordelia&#x27;s initial place in the series where &quot;At first glance, Cordelia seems to have the &#x27;normal life&#x27; Buffy often longs for. She is a familiar character from the teen drama: popular, a cheerleader, the center of cliques (power as status). Elizabeth Rambo notes how Cordelia&#x27;s status is highlighted by her nickname, &quot;Queen C&quot;, and Harmony&#x27;s remark to her, &quot;Cordy, you reign.&quot; Cordelia functions recognizably as the typical female victim of horror, often screaming and running away, and this makes her a perfect contrast for other female characters.&quot;

&quot;Praising Cordelia&quot; argues that both Buffy and Cordelia are representations of assertive and competitive young women, who &quot;represent two kinds of aggressive adolescent girls&quot;. The article focuses on the competitive relationship between the characters. Buffy&#x27;s initial friendship with Cordelia is compromised once Cordelia sees the attractive, socially competent Buffy as a threat to her. Even after Cordelia joins the Scooby Gang and becomes Buffy&#x27;s friend, theirs is not a friendship of &quot;mutual support, warmth, and intimacy&quot; but rather one of &quot;mutual antipathy&quot;. The authors opine that Cordelia, unlike Buffy, is a &quot;representation of the archetypal &#x27;feminine type&#x27;&quot;, one who conforms to the &quot;pervasive stereotypes of femininity while, at the same time, dominating the other girls in the school&quot; and commanding the attention of the boys. Describing her character arc in &quot;Buffy&quot;, Mary Alice Money views Cordelia as one of many transformed or redeemed &quot;Buffy&quot; characters, one who &quot;reveals a previously unexpected vulnerability that nullifies some of their less attractive traits.&quot; Jowett argues that Cordelia&#x27;s assimilation within the main group is due largely to her relationship with main character Xander, and she is rendered sympathetic to the audience once they witness her rebuff the peer pressure from her old friends. She is further endeared to the viewer when Xander betrays her because the scenes showing her pain are shown only to the viewer. After Cordelia is cheated on by Xander with Willow she chooses not to go back to him and instead retains her autonomy.

Others such as Susanne Kord and Elisabeth Krimer note how Cordelia is also a subversive representation of feminine stereotypes, describing &quot;Although superficially, Cordelia conforms to the stereotype of the insensitive bitch&quot;, what she actually does is &quot;offers her viewers the clandestine pleasures of female self-assertion&quot;. One of Cordelia&#x27;s strongest traits, her honesty, is also highlighted in &quot;Earshot&quot;, where Buffy temporarily develops telepathic powers and can hear the thoughts of her friends, who avoid her to hide these thoughts. For Cordelia however, &quot;her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical&quot; and because of this, she embodies an &quot;antithesis of female self-sacrifice&quot; in these years but also &quot;the opposite of the kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women&quot;. Writer Jennifer Crusie interprets this as Cordelia&#x27;s &quot;lack of depth&quot; becoming &quot;her strength&quot;. She does not mean to argue that Cordelia is stupid, however, pointing out &quot;Cordy&#x27;s solipsism could easily be mistaken for stupidity, but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a fixity of purpose that makes her almost invincible.&quot; Jowett feels Cordelia&#x27;s confidence is based in her wealth. Despite becoming more sympathetic as the series progressed, &quot;bitchiness enhances Cordelia&#x27;s comic appeal&quot;, as it offers viewers an opportunity to relish its honest truth-telling.

=== Development ===

In early seasons of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Cordelia was often used both as comic relief and occasionally for the damsel in distress plot device, which would require series&#x27; heroine Buffy to save her. Any concerns that she was simply one-dimensional were alleviated for the actress when writers developed the character through her relationships with Xander and later Wesley, which led Carpenter to become more convinced of her potential. In an article about the psychology of characters in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Steven C. Schlozman writes about how &quot;Cordelia is wealthy and, at first glance, superficial, appearing to care most about her own popularity. However, as the show progresses, we learn that her mother has myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and her father was prosecuted for income tax evasion. She is a reluctant participant, baffled at her own loyal feelings and bewildered at her attraction to the unpopular Xander.&quot; He goes on to describe how Cordelia, and &quot;all the characters of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; are particularly compelling for their depictions of important adolescent themes.&quot;
Discussing Cordelia&#x27;s relationship with Xander, Carpenter says, &quot;A lot of Cordy&#x27;s conflict, and a lot of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [Nicholas Brendon].&quot; However, her character&#x27;s growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; &quot;I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it, because I didn&#x27;t want to lose my edge. I didn&#x27;t want her to be nice; I didn&#x27;t want her to change because that&#x27;s who she is.&quot; Carpenter&#x27;s challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, &quot;That&#x27;s why I enjoy playing her so much. She&#x27;s got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [try] not to lose her edge, her honesty.&quot; Carpenter claims that Cordelia&#x27;s &quot;rough edges&quot; made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final &quot;Buffy&quot; appearance, &quot;Graduation Day, Part Two&quot;.

Over the course of her appearances in &quot;Angel&quot;, Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, &quot;When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn&#x27;t nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She&#x27;s a team player, which was not the case in the beginning.&quot; Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to &quot;selfish, superficial Los Angeles&quot;, which turned out to be her &quot;trial by fire&quot;.

Executive producer David Greenwalt was very keen to acquire the character of Cordelia for the spin-off series, commenting, &quot;I desperately wanted her to come to &quot;Angel&quot; because Angel being dark and broody, we need a big bright smile.&quot; At the same time, Whedon felt her presence was sorely missed in the fourth season of &quot;Buffy&quot; where &quot;All of our characters got to the point where they were loving and hugging, and it was sort of like, where&#x27;s Cordelia?&quot;, leading him to introduce Spike (James Marsters) to the cast to accommodate her absence. According to Marsters, his request for a salary equal to what he was paid on &quot;Buffy&quot; caused Whedon to remove Carpenter as a regular cast member.

Kelly A. Manners describes Cordelia as a &quot;rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to the IRS. So in episode one of &quot;Angel&quot;, Cordelia showed up in LA trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail, actually.&quot; Crusie states that in mourning for Doyle Cordelia also begins &quot;finding within herself a new level of humanity&quot;.

Greenwalt discusses how Cordelia &quot;is sort of forced to become a deeper character&quot; when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, &quot;She&#x27;s sort of living with one foot in the world of &#x27;I want to be an actress&#x27; and with another foot in the world of &#x27;I want to save and help people, and I have a deeper purpose and mission.&#x27;&quot; Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a &quot;vainglorious high schooler to someone who&#x27;s almost like a superhero&quot;; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, &quot;Parting Gifts&quot;, Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia&#x27;s visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter&#x27;s acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating &quot;I saw the world and there&#x27;s so much pain. We have to help them.&quot; Carpenter explains, &quot;Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what&#x27;s important in life.&quot;

Carpenter pleaded to the producers to let her cut her hair in the second season of &quot;Angel&quot;, but they were dissatisfied with the darker tone and cut which created a &quot;dark edge of Cordelia&quot; which wasn&#x27;t as &quot;warm and effervescent as she usually is&quot;, so for the third season they wanted her to &quot;go shorter and blonder&quot;. &quot;Angel&quot; third season demonstrates Cordelia&#x27;s development into a full-fledged heroine. The episode &quot;Birthday&quot; saw her being offered the chance to live a life where she never met Angel, but her inner desire to help others sees her sacrifice this life and her humanity to become a half-demon who can better withstand the visions she carries. In &quot;Billy&quot;, Cordelia begins to train alongside Angel to become a better fighter and learns quickly. Carpenter began to train extensively with the show&#x27;s stunt co-ordinators both to learn how to fight and to handle weaponry. In the episode &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;, both Angel and Lorne remark on what a fine woman Cordelia has finally become, with Cordelia noting she is more like a superhero than she ever expected to be growing up in Sunnydale. Also in this episode, she and Angel both realize they have fallen for one another, but their love goes unconsummated. Critically, Jennifer Crusie considers Cordelia&#x27;s ascension to the heavens at the end of season 3 to be the &quot;point that the Mutant Enemy Productions writers evidently lost their minds&quot;. She goes on to describe how Cordelia&#x27;s compliance with Skip seems entirely out of character. Jes Battis also argues that a paradox is created when &quot;the character who embraces her privilege (Cordelia) gets to become a higher being and exit &quot;Angel&quot;, and as an overwhelmingly positive force&quot; where later Fred (Amy Acker), &quot;the character who is conflicted about her privilege&quot; in season 5 &quot;ends up being possessed by a millennia-old demon&quot;.

&quot;Angel&quot; season 4 played with audience&#x27;s expectations of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season&#x27;s Big Bad; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine. The storyline was controversial with fans, and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel&#x27;s teenage son. Carpenter has said, &quot;I&#x27;m in denial about that whole storyline. It was creepy.&quot; She tried to keep a positive attitude about the situation, though; director Terrence O&#x27;Hara commented that he thought Carpenter had &quot;a lot of fun&quot; playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode &quot;Orpheus&quot; because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia&#x27;s new &quot;schizophrenic madwoman&quot; characterization. David Boreanaz was also unsettled by the incestuous pairing. At a 2004 convention, he admitted that the season 4 storyline &quot;freaked him out.&quot; The episode &quot;Inside Out&quot; saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia&#x27;s character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite the birth of the child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor&#x27;s mother Darla (Julie Benz) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. Steven S. DeKnight, who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire. Much of season 4&#x27;s storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter&#x27;s real-life pregnancy; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode &quot;Inside Out&quot; she is left in a coma for the remainder of the fourth season. Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, 

Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also discuss the treatment of Cordelia (and Darla) in &quot;&quot;Angel&quot; Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in &#x27;Television Horror&#x27;&quot;, from &quot;Reading Angel: The TV Spin-off With a Soul&quot; by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters as part of a pattern of highly gendered &quot;elaborated abjection&quot; seen in &quot;Angel&quot;. They also see Cordelia&#x27;s possession in season 4 as part of a recurring pattern: &quot;More so than other characters in [&quot;Buffy&quot;] and &quot;Angel&quot;, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally&quot; and recounts the demon impregnation in &quot;Expecting&quot;, and similarly in &quot;Epiphany&quot;, where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;. Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her &quot;status as a violated and devalued character&quot;; Cordelia states, &quot;If you ever figure out how to get us out of here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn&#x27;t want to impregnate me with his spawn!&quot; They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in &quot;Inside Out&quot;, to what Barbara Creed called the &#x27;monstrous womb&#x27; in her book &quot;The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis&quot;. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season 5 storyline, Cordelia&#x27;s storyline is not as positive as Fred&#x27;s rebirth, because Fred got to &quot;&#x27;live on&#x27; through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation&quot;. Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the &quot;real&quot; Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, &quot;and the &#x27;true&#x27; Cordy wakes up from her coma&quot;. Further illustrating the comparisons, &quot;Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew.&quot; Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes 

For &quot;Angel&quot; fifth season, as with &quot;Buffy&quot; fourth, Spike steps in to replace Cordelia as a source of comedic dialogue within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, &quot;it doesn&#x27;t take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not&quot;. Concerning Cordelia&#x27;s last appearance in &quot;Angel&quot; fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the &quot;mission statement&quot; of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was &quot;there at the beginning&quot;—ask of Angel, &quot;Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and how do you feel about that?&quot; The return to the show&#x27;s &quot;original concerns&quot; is echoed by the flashback to Doyle&#x27;s first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel &quot;You forgot who you are,&quot; bringing back the show&#x27;s link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel &#x27;back on track&#x27;, but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since &quot;we couldn&#x27;t get Sarah&quot; the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, &quot;This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic.&quot; In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because &quot;the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn&#x27;t want to tip it too soon,&quot; says Fury.

== Reception ==
For her role as Cordelia Chase, as she appeared in the television series &quot;Angel&quot;, Charisma Carpenter has been nominated four times by the Saturn Awards. Carpenter earned back-to-back nominations in 2000 and 2001 for Best Genre TV Supporting Actress and Best Actress on Television, respectively. The actress did not receive any nominations in 2002, but again obtained two back-to-back nominations in 2003 and 2004 for Best Actress in a Television Series and Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series, respectively.

== Cultural impact ==
The character of Cordelia Chase has been credited by some for making the mean girl, queen bee trope more likeable. Gillian Bennett wrote about Cordelia Chase in &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; noting, &quot;The good old-fashioned high school mean girl; we all know them and may (secretly) love them. Regina George. Blair Waldorf. Girls who stomp around with their minions, shoving aside anyone in their way and harboring a—usually inexplicable—hatred for the female protagonist. What has made these mean girls, at sixteen, so bitter to the world and to others? The answer is almost never revealed before she is inevitably defeated by the “good girl,” but Buffy the Vampire Slayer gives us a rare glimpse beneath the cold mask of the mean girl with Cordelia Chase.&quot;

Angelica Jade Bastién included Cordelia in the inspirations of the girls from the Riverdale show in the article wrote on &quot;Vulture&quot;. She suggested that Cordelia is one of the most famous pop culture queen bees. In the &quot;Glamour&quot; article, Leeann Duggan wrote about the character Veronica Lodge by citing Cordelia as one of the examples of the trope which the character represents. She also put Cordelia and her counterpart Buffy Summers as one of the most prominent examples of the &quot;Blonde versus brunette rivalry&quot;.

Alexis Gunderson wrote an article named &quot;Chasing Cordelia : The Rise of The Mean Girl heroine from Buffy to Pretty Little Liars&quot; in Paste Magazine. In the article, Alexis claimed that Charisma Carpenter&#x27;s Cordelia begun the tradition of the Mean Girl heroine seen in so many TV shows quoting Caroline Forbes (Candice King) from The Vampire Diaries, Rebekah Mikaelson (Claire Holt) from The Originals, Lydia Martin (Holland Roden) and Malia Tate (Shelley Hennig) from Teen Wolf, Petra Solano (Yael Grobglas) from Jane the Virgin,Lauren Cooper (Catherine Tate) from Faking It. &quot;What defines the Cordelia Chase-style Mean Girl Heroine is her ambivalent, tempestuous alliance with the Scooby Gang at her series’ core, an ambivalence heightened by the Mean Girl’s certainty that she is just as good as—if not better than!—the allies and assumptions the protagonist arms herself with. This Mean Girl/Alpha Bitch not only could be but should be the heroine of the story being told.&quot; say Alexis about the character and her influence.

WatchMojo ranked Cordelia 5th in the list of Top 20 TV mean girls. The Valnet site Collider ranked Cordelia 8th in the list of &quot;Best Mean Girls On Television&quot;, citing &quot;Unquestionably one of television&#x27;s most well-known mean girls, Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#x27;s Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) is renowned for her razor-sharp humor, stinging remarks, and unshakable dedication to upholding her social position. Cordelia&#x27;s meanness is a central facet of her character, and she embraces her role as Sunnydale High&#x27;s resident queen bee with gusto.&quot; The site Comic Book Resources published an article talking about how the show Legacies took inspiration from Buffy quoting &quot;It is near impossible not to compare this to the Buffy Season 3 episode, &quot;The Wish,&quot; where Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), who is equally vain as Lizzie, wishes Buffy never came to Sunnydale. Both episodes take a character on a journey to discover life would be worse, only for things to be corrected in the end.&quot; stating how Jenny Boyd&#x27;s Lizzie Saltzman was a successor of Cordelia Chase. Vulture quote Cordelia as the predecessor to Prudence Blackwood in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.

<doc id="37575" wikidata="Q1248784" url="?curid=37575" title="Airport">
<text>An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport. They usually consist of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals, to maintain and monitor aircraft. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.

Airport operations are extremely complex, with a complicated system of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other kinds of transit. Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports, in order to reduce hazards. Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the environmental effects of aviation. Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather, climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.

== Terminology ==

The terms &quot;aerodrome&quot;, &quot;airfield&quot;, and &quot;airstrip&quot; also refer to airports, and the terms &quot;heliport&quot;, &quot;seaplane base&quot;, and &quot;STOLport&quot; refer to airports dedicated exclusively to helicopters, seaplanes, and short take-off and landing aircraft.

In colloquial use in certain environments, the terms &quot;airport&quot; and &quot;aerodrome&quot; are often interchanged. However, in general, the term &quot;airport&quot; may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, &quot;airport&quot; is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.

That is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between &quot;aerodrome&quot; and &quot;airport&quot;, which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. In US technical/legal usage, &quot;landing area&quot; is used instead of &quot;aerodrome&quot;, and &quot;airport&quot; means &quot;a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo&quot;.

=== Types of airports ===

An airport solely serving helicopters is called a heliport. An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up.

An international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals.

==Management==
Smaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than . Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of or longer. Skyline Airport in Inkom, Idaho, has a runway that is only long.

In the United States, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the FAR Landing And Takeoff Field Lengths. These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff.

The longest public-use runway in the world is at Qamdo Bamda Airport in China. It has a length of . The world&#x27;s widest paved runway is at Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport in Russia and is wide.

, the CIA stated that there were approximately 44,000 &quot;airports or airfields recognizable from the air&quot; around the world, including 15,095 in the US, the US having the most in the world.

=== Airport ownership and operation ===
Most of the world&#x27;s large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport&#x27;s operation. For example, in the UK the state-owned British Airports Authority originally operated eight of the nation&#x27;s major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the Spanish Ferrovial consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just Heathrow. Germany&#x27;s Frankfurt Airport is managed by the quasi-private firm Fraport. While in India GMR Group operates, through joint ventures, Indira Gandhi International Airport and Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. Bengaluru International Airport is controlled by Fairfax .Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport, Mangalore International Airport, Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport, Jaipur International Airport, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport are operated by Adani Group through a Public Private Partnership wherein Adani Group, the operator pays Airports Authority of India, the owner of the airports, a predetermined sum of money based on the number of passengers handled by the airports. The rest of India&#x27;s airports are managed by the Airports Authority of India. In Pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority except for Sialkot International Airport which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in Pakistan and South Asia.

In the US, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created airport authorities (also known as port authorities), such as the Los Angeles World Airports authority that oversees several airports in the Greater Los Angeles area, including Los Angeles International Airport.

In Canada, the federal authority, Transport Canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. Now most airports in Canada are operated by individual legal authorities, such as Vancouver International Airport Authority (although still owned by Transport Canada); some airports, such as Boundary Bay Airport and Pitt Meadows Airport, are municipally owned.

Many US airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. All US commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA under the Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 Part 139, &quot;Certification of Commercial Service Airports&quot; but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the FAA.

Despite the reluctance to privatize airports in the US (contrary to the FAA sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world.

=== Airport funding ===

The Airport &amp; Airway Trust Fund (AATF) was created by the Airport and Airway Development in 1970 which finances aviation programs in the United States. Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&amp;E), and Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&amp;D) are the three major accounts of Federal Aviation Administration which are financed by the AATF, as well as pays for the FAA&#x27;s Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) account. The funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. Passenger tickets, fuel, and cargo tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts.

=== Airport revenue ===
Airports revenues are divided into three major parts: aeronautical revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. Aeronautical revenue makes up 50% in 2021 (from 54% and 48% in 2019 and 2020, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 34% (40%, 39% in previous years), and non-operating revenue makes up 16% (6%, 14%) of the total revenue of airports.

==== Aeronautical revenue ====
Aeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property. Landing fees are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight. Passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, wifi and shows which is paid while paying for an airline ticket. Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. Aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there. Every airport has its own rates of parking, for example, John F Kennedy airport in New York City charges $45 per hour for a plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight.

==== Non-aeronautical revenue ====
Non-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. It includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising. Concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through duty free, bookstores, restaurants and money exchange. Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the parking facilities of the airport. O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago charges $2 per hour for every car.

==== Price regulation ====
Many airports are local monopolies. To prevent them from abusing their market power, governments regulate how much airports may charge to airlines, using price-cap regulation.

===Landside and airside areas===

Airports are divided into landside and airside zones. The landside is subject to fewer special laws and is part of the public realm, while access to the airside zone is tightly controlled. Landside facilities may include publicly accessible airport check-in desks, shops and ground transportation facilities. The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are restricted to staff, and sections of these extended to travelling, airside shopping, dining, or waiting passengers. Depending on the airport, passengers and staff must be checked by security or border control before being permitted to enter the airside zone. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through border control and customs to access the landside area, in which they exit, unless in airside transit. Most multi-terminal airports have (variously termed) flight/passenger/air connections buses, moving walkways and/or people movers for inter-terminal airside transit. Their airlines can arrange for baggage to be routed directly to the passenger&#x27;s destination. Most major airports issue a secure keycard, an airside pass to employees, to assist in their reliable, standardized and efficient verification of identity.

==Facilities==


A terminal is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports, like Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of gates, which provide passengers with access to the plane.

Passenger facilities typically include:
* Airport check-in, including a baggage drop-off
* Airport security
* Passport control
* Gates
* Waiting areas
* Baggage reclaim facilities, often in the form of a carousel
* Customs (international arrivals only)

Links between passenger facilities and aircraft include jet bridges or airstairs. Baggage handling systems transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.

The area where the aircraft parks to load passengers and baggage is known as an &quot;apron&quot; or &quot;ramp&quot; (or incorrectly, &quot;the tarmac&quot;).

===Airport security===

Airport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the September 11 attacks and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and gotten tighter and stricter than ever before.

===Products and services===

Most major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2 billion in 2015. Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to &quot;street prices&quot;. This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers&#x27; suggested retail price (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.

Many new airports include walkthrough duty-free stores that require air passengers to enter a retail store upon exiting security. Airport planners sometimes incorporate winding routes within these stores such that passengers encounter more goods as they walk towards their gate. Planners also install artworks next to the airport&#x27;s shops in order to draw passengers into the stores.
Apart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food without leaving the airport.

Some airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.

Major airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the capsule hotel popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a sleep box. An even larger type is provided by the company YOTEL.

Some airports provide smoking areas and prayer areas.

=== Premium and VIP services ===

Airports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express check-in and dedicated check-in counters. These services are usually reserved for first and business class passengers, premium frequent flyers, and members of the airline&#x27;s clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline&#x27;s frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.

Sometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.

Airline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have seating, showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, Wi-Fi and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.

Airlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.

=== Cargo and freight service ===
In addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. Cargo airlines often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.

Cargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading the aircraft. Similarly, import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.

Every cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition, cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import, and interline or transshipment.
=== Access and onward travel ===
Airports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.

Many large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of multimodal transport, for instance Frankfurt Airport, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, London Heathrow Airport, Tokyo Haneda Airport, Tokyo Narita Airport, Hamad International Airport, London Gatwick Airport and London Stansted Airport. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with rapid transit, light rail lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the AirTrain JFK at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Link light rail that runs from the heart of downtown Seattle to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and the Silver Line T at Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to traffic congestion. Large airports usually have access also through controlled-access highways (&#x27;freeways&#x27; or &#x27;motorways&#x27;) from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.

=== Internal transport ===
The distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide moving walkways, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport and London Stansted Airport have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport, Mexico City International Airport and London Gatwick Airport.

== Airport operations ==
Airport operations are made possible by an organized network of trained personnel, specialized equipment, and spatial data. After thousands of ground operations staff left the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been discussions on the need for systemic improvements in three primary areas:

* Improving talent acquisition and retention
* Implementing global standardizations
* Digitizing and automating processes

The surfaces where ground operations occur are generally divided into three regions: runways, taxiways, and aprons.

=== Air traffic control ===

Air traffic control (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.

A &quot;towered&quot; or &quot;controlled&quot; airport has a control tower where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A &quot;non-towered&quot; airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport&#x27;s common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.

The majority of the world&#x27;s airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have 24/7 ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under area (en-route) control. Remote and virtual tower (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.

Air traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: &quot;ground&quot; and &quot;tower&quot;, though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with &quot;clearance delivery&quot;, &quot;apron control&quot;, and/or other specialized ATC stations.

====Ground control====
Ground control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated &quot;movement areas&quot;, except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be &quot;handed over&quot; from Tower to Ground Control.

====Tower control====
Tower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the controlled airspace immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft&#x27;s position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.

=== Traffic pattern ===
At all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a &quot;traffic circuit&quot; outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, &quot;provided there is no queue&quot;. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, things are very different though.

Generally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five &quot;legs&quot; that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually above ground level (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are &quot;left-handed&quot;, meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a mid-air collision.

At controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a &quot;straight-in&quot; approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.

=== Navigational aids ===

There are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.

Larger airports sometimes offer precision approach radar (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft&#x27;s horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.

=== Taxiway signs ===

Airport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.

=== Lighting ===

Many airports have lighting that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.

On runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. Runway edge lighting consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use pilot-controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs.

Along taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway&#x27;s edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.

=== Weather observations ===

Weather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the United States and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of automated airport weather station, whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the METAR format, are available over the radio, through automatic terminal information service (ATIS), via the ATC or the flight service station.

Planes take-off and land &quot;into&quot; the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a windsock can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.

=== Airport ground crew (ground handling) ===


Most airports have groundcrew handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services. Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines.

Among the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:
* A tow tractor to move the aircraft in and out of the berth.
* A jet bridge (in some airports) or stairs unit to allow passengers to embark and disembark.
* A ground power unit for supplying electricity. As the engines will be switched off, they will not be generating electricity as they do in flight.
* A cleaning service.
* A catering service to deliver food and drinks for a flight.
* A toilet waste truck to empty the tank which holds the waste from the toilets in the aircraft.
* A water truck to fill the water tanks of the aircraft.
* A refueling vehicle. The fuel may come from a tanker, or from underground fuel tanks.
* A conveyor belt unit for loading and unloading luggage.
* A vehicle to transport luggage to and from the terminal.
The length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as &quot;turnaround time&quot;. Airlines seek to minimize turnaround times, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes.

=== Maintenance management ===
Like industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.

To manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) predominate, and mainly enable a company&#x27;s maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.

=== Safety management ===
Aviation safety is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. Airport crash tender crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable aviation fuel. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, hijacking, and terrorist activities.

Hazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see foreign object damage). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings.

Many airports are built near open fields or wetlands. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of bird strikes. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.

Some airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.

An airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any incursions where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these &quot;hot spots&quot; to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.

During the 1980s, a phenomenon known as microburst became a growing concern due to aircraft accidents caused by microburst wind shear, such as Delta Air Lines Flight 191. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes&#x27; warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.

Some airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway (stopway or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like styrofoam, bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.

Airports often have on-site firefighters to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as airport crash tenders. Most civil aviation authorities have required levels of on-site emergency response capabilities based on an airport&#x27;s traffic. At airports where civil and military operations share a common set of runways and infrastructure, emergency response is often managed by the relevant military unit as part of their base&#x27;s operations.

== Environmental concerns and sustainability ==
Aircraft noise is a major cause of noise disturbance to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other health effects as well. Other noises and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading to the airport.

The construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, and local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.

The construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land. Airports are often built on low-lying coastal land, globally 269 airports are at risk of coastal flooding now. A temperature rise of 2oC – consistent with the Paris Agreement – would lead to 100 airports being below mean sea level and 364 airports at risk of flooding. If global mean temperature rise exceeds this then as many as 572 airports will be at risk by 2100, leading to major disruptions without appropriate adaptation.
Some of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all environmental protection measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.

A 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US Transportation Research Board showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a proving ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.

A growing number of airports are installing solar photovoltaic arrays to offset their electricity use. The National Renewable Energy Lab has shown this can be done safely. This can also be done on the roofs of the airports and it has been found that the solar panels on these buildings work more effectively when compared to residential panels.

The world&#x27;s first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at Kochi, India. Another airport known for considering environmental concerns is Seymour Airport in the Galapagos Islands.

As a part of their sustainability efforts, more and more airports are starting to explore the consequences of more electric aircraft coming into service. Electric aircraft require much energy; operating 49 small 50-passenger short-range battery electric aircraft would demand at least 16 GWh/year, and with short turnaround times between different flights, the charging powers have to be substantial. To tackle these issues, more airports are starting to look into alternative energy production such as solar power and wind power, but also how to use airport areas for biomass production. Another solution investigated is to use energy storage to charge during the night and use to charge the aircraft during daytime.

== Airport hygiene and public health concerns ==
Airports, as major international travel hubs, have the potential to be significant transmission points for infectious diseases. A notable study conducted during the peak of the 2015–2016 flu season at Helsinki-Vantaa airport in Finland revealed that commonly touched surfaces in airports, especially the plastic security screening trays, are highly susceptible to contamination by respiratory viruses. These trays are touched by hundreds of passengers daily and, being made of plastic, a non-porous material, provide an environment where viruses can survive for extended periods. In comparison, bathroom surfaces in the same airport tested negative for respiratory viruses, possibly indicating a heightened awareness of hygiene in these spaces.

Hand hygiene plays a pivotal role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases in airports. Research indicates that only about 70% of individuals wash their hands after using the toilet, and of those, only 50% do so correctly. In airport settings, just one in five individuals maintain clean hands—defined as washing with soap for at least 15 seconds in the preceding hour. Given the frequent touching of shared surfaces in airports, such as trays, railings, and touch panels, this poses a significant risk for disease transmission. A study from the University of Cyprus and MIT used models and simulations to demonstrate that increasing hand cleanliness from 20% to 30% in all airports could reduce the potential global impact of a disease by 24%. If cleanliness levels reached 60%, this impact could decrease by 69%. Focusing on just the top 10 most influential airports for disease spread, enhancing hand hygiene practices could still significantly reduce disease transmission rates from 45% to 37%. The findings underscore the importance of promoting hand-washing in airports as a key measure in preventing the global spread of diseases.

== Military air base ==
An airbase, sometimes referred to as an &quot;air station&quot; or &quot;airfield&quot;, provides basing and support of military aircraft. Some airbases, known as &quot;military airports&quot;, provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, RAF Brize Norton in the UK has a terminal that caters to passengers for the Royal Air Force&#x27;s scheduled flights to the Falkland Islands. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. Bardufoss Airport, Bardufoss Air Station in Norway and Pune Airport in India are examples of this.

An aircraft carrier is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a naval force to project air power without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.

== Airport designation and naming ==
Most airports in the United States are designated &quot;private-use airports&quot; meaning that, whether publicly- or privately owned, the airport is not open or available for use by the public (although use of the airport may be made available by invitation of the owner or manager).

Most airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., Charles de Gaulle Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Lennart Meri Airport, O.R. Tambo International Airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport), a monarch (e.g. Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, King Shaka International Airport), a cultural leader (e.g. Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. Allama Iqbal International Airport) and explorers (e.g. Venice Marco Polo Airport).

Some airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.

Some airport names include the word &quot;International&quot; to indicate their ability to handle international air traffic. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. Port Elizabeth International Airport).

== History and development ==
The earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields. The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.

The title of &quot;world&#x27;s oldest airport&quot; is disputed. Toussus-le-Noble airport near Paris was established in 1907 and has been operating since. College Park Airport in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by Wilbur Wright serves only general aviation traffic.

Beijing Nanyuan Airport in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910. It was in operation until September 2019. Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver, Washington, United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of February 2024.

Hamburg Airport opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted civil aircraft only since December 17, 1920, allowing Sydney Airport—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world&#x27;s oldest continuously operating commercial airports. Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. Don Mueang International Airport near Bangkok, Thailand, opened 1914, is also a contender, as well as the Rome Ciampino Airport, which opened in 1916.
Increased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.
Following the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was Paris – Le Bourget Airport at Le Bourget, near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by Croydon Airport in March 1920. In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at Flughafen Devau near what was then Königsberg, East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved &quot;apron&quot;, which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.

The first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft&#x27;s position on the glideslope. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.

After World War II, airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.

An improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane&#x27;s wheels.

Airport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic. Runways were extended out to . The fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.

The malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of counter unmanned air system (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia AARTOS which have been installed on major international airports.

== Airports in entertainment ==

Airports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is &quot;The Terminal&quot;, a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot;, &quot;Speed&quot;, &quot;Airplane!&quot;, &quot;Airport&quot; (1970), &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, &quot;Soul Plane&quot;, &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990), &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992), &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, &quot;Passenger 57&quot;, &quot;Final Destination&quot; (2000), &quot;Unaccompanied Minors&quot;, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, &quot;Rendition&quot; and &quot;The Langoliers&quot;. They have also played important parts in television series like &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model (season 10)&quot;, &quot;90 Day Fiancé&quot;, &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;.

Several computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport. These include the Airport Tycoon series, SimAirport and Airport CEO.

== Airport directories ==

Each civil aviation authority provides a source of information about airports in their country. This will contain information on airport elevation, airport lighting, runway information, communications facilities and frequencies, hours of operation, nearby NAVAIDs and contact information where prior arrangement for landing is necessary.
;Australia
:Information can be found on-line in the &quot;En route Supplement Australia&quot; (ERSA) which is published by Airservices Australia, a government owned corporation charged with managing Australian ATC.

;Brazil
:Infraero is responsible for the airports in Brazil

;Canada
:Two publications, the &quot;Canada Flight Supplement&quot; (CFS) and the &quot;Water Aerodrome Supplement&quot;, published by Nav Canada under the authority of Transport Canada provides equivalent information.

;Europe
:The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) provides an Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), aeronautical charts and NOTAM services for multiple European countries.

;Germany
:Provided by the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (Federal Office for Civil Aviation of Germany).

;France
:&quot;Aviation Generale Delage&quot; edited by Delville and published by Breitling.

;The United Kingdom
:The information is found in Pooley&#x27;s Flight Guide, a publication compiled with the assistance of the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Pooley&#x27;s also contains information on some continental European airports that are close to Great Britain. National Air Traffic Services, the UK&#x27;s Air Navigation Service Provider, a public–private partnership also publishes an online AIP for the UK.

;The United States
:The US uses the &quot;Airport/Facility Directory&quot; (A/FD) (now officially termed the Chart Supplement) published in seven volumes. DAFIF also includes extensive airport data but has been unavailable to the public at large since 2006.

;Japan
:&quot;Aeronautical Information Publication&quot; (AIP) is provided by Japan Aeronautical Information Service Center, under the authority of Japan Civil Aviation Bureau, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan.

&quot;A comprehensive, consumer/business directory of commercial airports in the world (primarily for airports as businesses, rather than for pilots) is organized by the trade group Airports Council International.&quot;

<text>The European Men&#x27;s Handball Championship is the official competition for senior men&#x27;s national handball teams of Europe and takes place every two years since 1994, in the even-numbered year between the World Championship. In addition to crowning the European champions, the tournament also serves as a qualifying tournament for the Olympic Games and World Championship. The most successful team is Sweden who have won five titles. Spain, however, have won most medals.

==History==
In 1946, the International Handball Federation was founded by eight European nations, and though non-European nations competed at the World Championships, the medals had always been taken by European nations. European Handball Federation is founded in 1991. At the same time (1995), the World Championship was changed from a quadrennial to a biannual event, and the European Handball Federation now began its own championship – which also acted as a regional qualifier for the World Championship.

===1990s===
The first championship was held in Portugal in June 1994. The host nation had not managed to qualify for any World Championship thus far, and they finished 12th and last after losing all six games, including 21–38 to Romania in the 11th-place play-off. Sweden became the first European champion after defeating Russia by 34–21 in the final, Russia&#x27;s heaviest loss in their international history. Both teams had gone through the tournament without loss, but Sweden&#x27;s fast breaks became the key in the final; they scored 14 of their 34 goals on fast breaks. Swedish middle back Magnus Andersson was named the event&#x27;s best player and Russian left back Vasily Kudinov was top scorer with 50 goals.

Two years later, the championship moved to Spain, with the same format. This time, no team went through the group stage without giving up points, but Russia and Sweden were to face off once again; this time in the semi-final, and Russia got revenge with a 24–21 win in front of 650 spectators. In the other semi-final, the hosts beat Yugoslavia 27–23, before 7,500 spectators littered the arena in Sevilla to watch the hosts go down by one goal despite the efforts of Talant Dujshebaev, a Kyrgyz-born back player who had played for Russia in 1994 but who now turned out for Spain. Federal Republic of Yugoslavia participated for the first time and finished third.

In 1998 the Championship was held in Italy, whose appearance at the 1997 World Championship was their first at the top level of international handball. Spain went through the first six matches of the tournament unbeaten, while their opponents Sweden had won the first four games before becoming the first team to lose to hosts Italy. However, in the final, Sweden were too strong and won by 25–23 after having led by 15–9 at half-time in front of 6,100 spectators in Bolzano.

===2000s===
Two years later, the Championship was held in the Croatian cities of Zagreb and Rijeka. By now, the Championship had been moved back to January in the middle of the European handball season. The Championship acted as an Olympic qualifier, and hosts Croatia, who had won the 1996 Olympics, needed to finish in the top five to qualify. They lost to Spain and drew with France in the group stage, which sent them into a fifth-place play-off with neighbours Slovenia. 10,000 spectators watched as Slovenia prevailed by one goal and qualified for the Sydney Games. The two teams who had won European Championships before, Sweden and Russia, qualified for the final – Sweden had won the group stage match 28–25, but Russia took a six-goal lead at half-time. Sweden came back to tie the game at full-time, and two 10-minute extra periods were required before Sweden won 32–31 after Magnus Wislander scored the deciding goal.

Three-time champions Sweden were the next to host the European Championship, in 2002. This was the first tournament with 16 teams, an expansion from 12 in the previous four instalments. The Swedes won their first seven matches, and had already qualified for the semi-finals when they lost 26–27 to Denmark, having led 17–11 at half time. In the other main round group, Iceland became the third Nordic team to qualify after defeating Germany in the final match, but both Denmark and Iceland were soundly beaten in the semi-finals – Denmark lost 23–28 to Germany, while Sweden defeated Iceland by 11 goals. Sweden thus qualified for their fourth final in five attempts, and in front of 14,300 spectators in Stockholm Globe, they came back from a one-goal deficit when Staffan Olsson equalised with five seconds to spare. Sweden had substituted their goalkeeper, and Florian Kehrmann replied with a goal in an empty net, but it was disallowed because the referees had not started play after the Swedish goal. In the extra time, Sweden held on, and could celebrate their fourth
title.

Sweden&#x27;s row of three successive Championships was broken in Slovenia in 2004, when Germany won despite not being touted as a medal candidate by news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur. Germany suffered an early defeat to Serbia and Montenegro, and qualified for the main round as the third and final team from their group, having drawn with France as well. However, as the favourites beat each other in Germany&#x27;s main round group, Germany qualified for the semi-finals in first place from the six-team group. In the other group, Croatia, who won the other group, had not lost any of their first seven games, while Denmark also had four successive wins.

Croatia faced hosts Slovenia in the semi-final, and the clash of the two Balkan neighbours saw heightened security measures. 7,000 spectators in the Hall Tivoli saw that the hosts became the first team to beat Croatia in this tournament despite 12 goals from Croatian right winger Mirza Džomba who was reputed to be the best handball player in the world at the time. Denmark, who had reached their second successive semi-final, once again had to bow out at this stage, as they lost 20–22 to Germany in what was described as a &quot;hard-fought victory.&quot; Germany won the final more convincingly; a 16–10 lead at half time was never squandered, as Slovenia only got within three goals in the second half, and eventually lost 25–30.

The 2006 tournament was held in Switzerland, in the cities of Basel, Bern, Lucerne, St Gallen and Zürich. France won the tournament, going through with one solitary loss – a 26–29 defeat to Spain in the preliminary round (where France trailed by eight goals at half-time). Defending champions Germany was also in this preliminary group, and this time taking one point through from the group stage would not be enough for Germany. Despite winning all three main round games, so did France and Spain, and those two teams qualified for the semi-finals from Group I. From the other group, Croatia qualified in first place after a 34–30 victory over Serbia and Montenegro in the last match. Later that evening, Denmark beat Russia and qualified for their third successive semi-final, one point behind Croatia. However, the Group II teams were both defeated by Group I teams, causing France and Spain to meet again in the final. In the third-place play-off, Croatia surprisingly lost to Denmark, while the final saw France prevail by eight goals to win their first European Championship

Norway was the host country for the 2008 tournament. Matches were played in Bergen, Drammen, Lillehammer, Stavanger and Trondheim. Croatia, Norway, Hungary and France won their preliminary groups, but two of the teams failed to utilise their advantage; Norway drew with Poland and lost to Slovenia, and needed to beat Croatia in the final match of the group stage. Instead, Ivano Balić scored the 23–22 goal with twenty seconds to spare, and only a late equaliser gave Norway third place in the group. Hungary, Spain and Germany had all gone through with two points from Group C, and Germany sealed their qualification with a two-goal win over Sweden in a match where a draw would have been enough for the Swedes. In the first semifinal Croatia played France in a game dominated by strong defense by both teams, with the Croats achieving a three-goal lead twice, only to see France come back strong. Croatia goalkeeper Mirko Alilović saved a shot from Nikola Karabatic with six seconds to go as Croatia won 24–23. Denmark came back from 7–12 down to beat Germany, despite the Germans equalising within the final minute, as Lars Christiansen slotted home a penalty shot with three seconds remaining. Croatia started off well in the final, scoring the first four goals, but with eight saves more from Denmark&#x27;s keeper, Kasper Hvidt, Denmark won 24–20 and took their first major trophy.

<doc id="37583" wikidata="Q188558" url="?curid=37583" title="Wine (software)">
<text>Wine is a free and open-source compatibility layer to allow application software and computer games developed for Microsoft Windows to run on Unix-like operating systems. Developers can compile Windows applications against WineLib to help port them to Unix-like systems. Wine is predominantly written using black-box testing reverse-engineering, to avoid copyright issues. No code emulation or virtualization occurs. Wine is primarily developed for Linux and macOS.

In a 2007 survey by desktoplinux.com of 38,500 Linux desktop users, 31.5% of respondents reported using Wine to run Windows applications. This plurality was larger than all x86 virtualization programs combined, and larger than the 27.9% who reported not running Windows applications.

==History==
Bob Amstadt, the initial project leader, and Eric Youngdale started the Wine project in 1993 as a way to run Windows applications on Linux. It was inspired by two Sun Microsystems products, Wabi for the Solaris operating system, and the Public Windows Interface, which was an attempt to get the Windows API fully reimplemented in the public domain as an ISO standard but rejected due to pressure from Microsoft in 1996. Wine originally targeted 16-bit applications for Windows 3.x, but focuses on 32-bit and 64-bit versions which have become the standard on newer operating systems. The project originated in discussions on Usenet in comp.os.linux in June 1993. Alexandre Julliard has led the project since 1994.

The project has proven time-consuming and difficult for the developers, mostly because of incomplete and incorrect documentation of the Windows API. While Microsoft extensively documents most Win32 functions, some areas such as file formats and protocols have no public, complete specification available from Microsoft. Windows also includes undocumented low-level functions, undocumented behavior and obscure bugs that Wine must duplicate precisely in order to allow some applications to work properly. Consequently, the Wine team has reverse-engineered many function calls and file formats in such areas as thunking.

The Wine project originally released Wine under the same MIT License as the X Window System, but owing to concern about proprietary versions of Wine not contributing their changes back to the core project, work as of March 2002 has used the LGPL for its licensing.

Wine officially entered beta with version 0.9 on 25 October 2005. Version 1.0 was released on 17 June 2008, after 15 years of development. Version 1.2 was released on 16 July 2010, version 1.4 on 7 March 2012, version 1.6 on 18 July 2013, version 1.8 on 19 December 2015 and version 9.0 on 16 January 2024. Development versions are released roughly every two weeks.

Wine-staging is an independently maintained set of aggressive patches not deemed ready by WineHQ developers for merging into the Wine repository, but still considered useful by the wine-compholio fork. It mainly covers experimental functions and bug fixes. Since January 2017, patches in wine-staging begins to be actively merged into the WineHQ upstream as wine-compholio transferred the project to Alistair Leslie-Hughes, a key WineHQ developer. , WineHQ also provides pre-built versions of wine-staging.

===Corporate sponsorship===
The main corporate sponsor of Wine is CodeWeavers, which employs Julliard and many other Wine developers to work on Wine and on CrossOver, CodeWeavers&#x27; supported version of Wine. CrossOver includes some application-specific tweaks not considered suitable for the upstream version, as well as some additional proprietary components.

The involvement of Corel for a time assisted the project, chiefly by employing Julliard and others to work on it. Corel had an interest in porting WordPerfect Office, its office suite, to Linux (especially Corel Linux). Corel later cancelled all Linux-related projects after Microsoft made major investments in Corel, stopping their Wine effort.

Other corporate sponsors include Google, which hired CodeWeavers to fix Wine so Picasa ran well enough to be ported directly to Linux using the same binary as on Windows; Google later paid for improvements to Wine&#x27;s support for Adobe Photoshop CS2. Wine is also a regular beneficiary of Google&#x27;s Summer of Code program.

Valve works with CodeWeavers to develop Proton, a Wine-based compatibility layer for Microsoft Windows games to run on Linux-based operating systems. Proton includes several patches that upstream Wine does not accept for various reasons, such as Linux-specific implementations of Win32 functions. Valve&#x27;s involvement in the development of Proton (and, thus, the improvement of Linux gaming) has helped to improve Wine compatibility with Windows games.

==Design==
The goal of Wine is to implement the Windows APIs fully or partially that are required by programs that the users of Wine wish to run on top of a Unix-like system.

=== Basic architecture ===

The programming interface of Microsoft Windows consists largely of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). These contain a huge number of wrapper sub-routines for the system calls of the kernel, the NTOS kernel-mode program (ntoskrnl.exe). A typical Windows program calls some Windows DLLs, which in turn calls user-mode gdi/user32 libraries, which in turn uses the kernel32.dll (win32 subsystem) responsible for dealing with the kernel through system calls. The system-call layer is considered private to Microsoft programmers as documentation is not publicly available, and published interfaces all rely on subsystems running on top of the kernel. Besides these, there are a number of programming interfaces implemented as services that run as separate processes. Applications communicate with user-mode services through RPCs.

Wine implements the Windows application binary interface (ABI) entirely in user space, rather than as a kernel module. Wine mostly mirrors the hierarchy, with services normally provided by the kernel in Windows instead provided by a daemon known as the wineserver, whose task is to implement basic Windows functionality, as well as integration with the X Window System, and translation of signals into native Windows exceptions. Although wineserver implements some aspects of the Windows kernel, it is not possible to use native Windows drivers with it, due to Wine&#x27;s underlying architecture.

===Libraries and applications===
Wine allows for loading both Windows DLLs and Unix shared objects for its Windows programs. Its built-in implementation of the most basic Windows DLLs, namely NTDLL, KERNEL32, GDI32, and USER32, uses the shared object method because they must use functions in the host operating system as well. Higher-level libraries, such as WineD3D, are free to use the DLL format. In many cases users can choose to load a DLL from Windows instead of the one implemented by Wine. Doing so can provide functionalities not yet implemented by Wine, but may also cause malfunctions if it relies on something else not present in Wine.

Wine tracks its state of implementation through automated unit testing done at every git commit.

===Graphics and gaming===
While most office software does not make use of complex GPU-accelerated graphics APIs, computer games do. To run these games properly, Wine would have to forward the drawing instructions to the host OS, and even translate them to something the host can understand.

DirectX is a collection of Microsoft APIs for rendering, audio and input. As of 2019, Wine 4.0 contains a DirectX 12 implementation for Vulkan API, and DirectX 11.2 for OpenGL. Direct2D support has been updated to Direct2D 1.2. Wine 4.0 also allows Wine to run Vulkan applications by handing draw commands to the host OS, or in the case of macOS, by translating them into the Metal API by MoltenVK.

; XAudio
:, Wine 4.3 uses the FAudio library (and Wine 4.13 included a fix for it) to implement the XAudio2 audio API (and more).
; XInput and Raw Input
: Wine, since 4.0 (2019), supports game controllers through its builtin implementations of these libraries. They are built as Unix shared objects as they need to access the controller interfaces of the underlying OS, specifically through SDL.

====Direct3D====
Much of Wine&#x27;s DirectX effort goes into building WineD3D, a translation layer from Direct3D and DirectDraw API calls into OpenGL. As of 2019, this component supports up to DirectX 11. As of 12 December 2016, Wine is good enough to run &quot;Overwatch&quot; with D3D11. Besides being used in Wine, WineD3D DLLs have also been used on Windows itself, allowing for older GPUs to run games using newer DirectX versions and for old DDraw-based games to render correctly.

Some work is ongoing to move the Direct3D backend to Vulkan API. Direct3D 12 support in 4.0 is provided by a &quot;vkd3d&quot; subproject, and WineD3D has in 2019 been experimentally ported to use the Vulkan API. Another implementation, DXVK, translates Direct3D 8, 9, 10, and 11 calls using Vulkan as well and is a separate project.

Wine, when patched, can alternatively run Direct3D 9 API commands directly via a free and open-source Gallium3D State Tracker (aka Gallium3D GPU driver) without translation into OpenGL API calls. In this case, the Gallium3D layer allows a direct pass-through of DX9 drawing commands which results in performance improvements of up to a factor of 2. As of 2020, the project is named Gallium.Nine. It is available now as a separate standalone package and no longer needs a patched Wine version.

==User interface==
Wine is usually invoked from the command-line interpreter: codice_1.

===winecfg===
There is the utility codice_2 that starts a graphical user interface with controls for adjusting basic options. It is a GUI configuration utility included with Wine. Winecfg makes configuring Wine easier by making it unnecessary to edit the registry directly, although, if needed, this can be done with the included registry editor (similar to Windows &quot;regedit&quot;).

===Third-party applications===
Some applications require more tweaking than simply installing the application in order to work properly, such as manually configuring Wine to use certain Windows DLLs. The Wine project does not integrate such workarounds into the Wine codebase, instead preferring to focus solely on improving Wine&#x27;s implementation of the Windows API. While this approach focuses Wine development on long-term compatibility, it makes it difficult for users to run applications that require workarounds. Consequently, many third-party applications have been created to ease the use of those applications that do not work &quot;out of the box&quot; within Wine itself. The Wine wiki maintains a page of current and obsolete third-party applications.
* &quot;Winetricks&quot; is a script to install some basic components (typically Microsoft DLLs and fonts) and tweak settings required for some applications to run correctly under Wine. It can fully automate the install of a number of applications and games, including applying any needed workarounds. Winetricks has a GUI. The Wine project will accept bug reports for users of Winetricks, unlike most third-party applications. It is maintained by Wine developer Austin English.
* &quot;Q4Wine&quot; is an open GUI for advanced setup of Wine.
* &quot;Wine-Doors&quot; is an application management tool for the GNOME desktop which adds functionality to Wine. Wine-Doors is an alternative to WineTools which aims to improve upon WineTools&#x27; features and extend on the original idea with a more modern design approach.
* &quot;IEs4Linux&quot; is a utility to install all versions of Internet Explorer, including versions 4 to 6 and version 7 (in beta).
* &quot;Wineskin&quot; is a utility to manage Wine engine versions and create wrappers for macOS.
* &quot;PlayOnLinux&quot; is an application to ease the installation of Windows applications (primarily games). There is also a corresponding Macintosh version called &quot;PlayOnMac&quot;.
* &quot;Lutris&quot; is an open-source application to install Windows games on Linux.
* &quot;Bordeaux&quot; is a proprietary Wine GUI configuration manager that runs winelib applications. It also supports installation of third-party utilities, installation of applications and games, and the ability to use custom configurations. &quot;Bordeaux&quot; currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD, PC-BSD, Solaris, OpenSolaris, OpenIndiana, and macOS computers.
* &quot;Bottles&quot; is an open-source graphical Wine prefix and runners manager for Wine based on GTK4+Libadwaita. It provides a repository-based dependency installation system and bottle versioning to restore a previous state.
* &quot;WineGUI&quot; is a free and open-source graphical interface to manage Wine. It allows a user to create Wine bottles and install Windows applications or games.

==Functionality==
The developers of the Direct3D portions of Wine have continued to implement new features such as pixel shaders to increase game support. Wine can also use native DLLs directly, thus increasing functionality, but then a license for Windows is needed unless the DLLs were distributed with the application itself.

Wine also includes its own open-source implementations of several Windows programs, such as &quot;Notepad&quot;, &quot;WordPad&quot;, &quot;Control Panel&quot;, &quot;Internet Explorer&quot;, and &quot;Windows Explorer&quot;.

The Wine Application Database (AppDB) is a community-maintained on-line database about which Windows programs works with Wine and how well they work.

===Backward compatibility===
Wine ensures good backward compatibility with legacy Windows applications, including those written for Windows 3.1x. Wine can mimic different Windows versions required for some programs, going as far back as Windows 2.0. However, Windows 1.x and Windows 2.x support was removed from Wine development version 1.3.12. If DOSBox is installed on the system (see below on MS-DOS), Wine development version 1.3.12 and later nevertheless show the &quot;Windows 2.0&quot; option for the Windows version to mimic, but Wine still will not run most Windows 2.0 programs because MS-DOS and Windows functions are not currently integrated.

Backward compatibility in Wine is generally superior to that of Windows, as newer versions of Windows can force users to upgrade legacy Windows applications, and may break unsupported software forever as there is nobody adjusting the program for the changes in the operating system. In many cases, Wine can offer better legacy support than newer versions of Windows with &quot;Compatibility Mode&quot;. Wine can run 16-bit Windows programs (Win16) on a 64-bit operating system, which uses an x86-64 (64-bit) CPU, a functionality not found in 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. WineVDM allows 16-bit Windows applications to run on 64-bit versions of Windows.

Wine partially supports Windows console applications, and the user can choose which backend to use to manage the console (choices include raw streams, curses, and user32). When using the raw streams or curses backends, Windows applications will run in a Unix terminal.

===64-bit applications===
Preliminary support for 64-bit Windows applications was added to Wine 1.1.10, in December 2008. , the support is considered stable. The two versions of Wine are built separately, and as a result only building wine64 produces an environment only capable of running x86-64 applications.

, Wine has stable support for a WoW64 build, which allows both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows applications to run inside the same Wine instance. To perform such a build, one must first build the 64-bit version, and then build the 32-bit version referencing the 64-bit version. Just like Microsoft&#x27;s WoW64, the 32-bit build process will add parts necessary for handling 32-bit programs to the 64-bit build. This functionality is seen from at least 2010.

===MS-DOS===
Early versions of Microsoft Windows run on top of MS-DOS, and Windows programs may depend on MS-DOS programs to be usable. Wine does not have good support for MS-DOS, but starting with development version 1.3.12, Wine tries running MS-DOS programs in DOSBox if DOSBox is available on the system. However, due to a bug, current versions of Wine incorrectly identify Windows 1.x and Windows 2.x programs as MS-DOS programs, attempting to run them in DOSBox (which does not work).

===Winelib===
Wine provides Winelib, which allows its shared-object implementations of the Windows API to be used as actual libraries for a Unix program. This allows for Windows code to be built into native Unix executables. Since October 2010, Winelib also works on the ARM platform.

===Non-x86 architectures===
Support for Solaris SPARC was dropped in version 1.5.26.

====ARM, Windows CE, and Windows RT====
Wine provides some support for ARM (as well as ARM64/AArch64) processors and the Windows flavors that run on it. , Wine can run ARM/Win32 applications intended for unlocked Windows RT devices (but not Windows RT programs). Windows CE support (either x86 or ARM) is missing, but an unofficial, pre-alpha proof-of-concept version called WineCE allows for some support.

====Wine for Android====
On 3 February 2013 at the FOSDEM talk in Brussels, Alexandre Julliard demonstrated an early demo of Wine running on Google&#x27;s Android operating system.

Experimental builds of WINE for Android (x86 and ARM) were released in late 2017. It has been routinely updated by the official developers ever since. The default builds do not implement cross-architecture emulation via QEMU, and as a result ARM versions will only run ARM applications that use the Win32 API.

===Microsoft applications===
Wine, by default, uses specialized Windows builds of Gecko and Mono to substitute for Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer and .NET Framework. Wine has built-in implementations of JScript and VBScript. It is possible to download and run Microsoft&#x27;s installers for those programs through winetricks or manually.

Wine is not known to have good support for most versions of Internet Explorer (IE). Of all the reasonably recent versions, Internet Explorer 8 for Windows XP is the only version that reports a usable rating on Wine&#x27;s AppDB, out-of-the-box. However Google Chrome gets a gold rating (as of Wine 5.5-staging), and Microsoft&#x27;s IE replacement web browser Edge, is known to be based on that browser (after switching from Microsoft&#x27;s own rendering engine). Winetricks offer auto-installation for Internet Explorer 6 through 8, so these versions can be reasonably expected to work with its built-in workarounds.

An alternative for installing Internet Explorer directly is to use the now-defunct IEs4Linux. It is not compatible with the latest versions of Wine, and the development of IEs4Linux is inactive.

==Other versions of Wine==
The core Wine development aims at a correct implementation of the Windows API as a whole and has sometimes lagged in some areas of compatibility with certain applications. Direct3D, for example, remained unimplemented until 1998, although newer releases have had an increasingly complete implementation.

===CrossOver===
CodeWeavers markets CrossOver specifically for running Microsoft Office and other major Windows applications, including some games. CodeWeavers employs Alexandre Julliard to work on Wine and contributes most of its code to the Wine project under the LGPL. CodeWeavers also released a new version called CrossOver Mac for Intel-based Apple Macintosh computers on 10 January 2007. Unlike upstream wine, CrossOver is notably able to run on the x64-only versions of macOS, using a technique known as &quot;wine32on64&quot;.

As of 2012, CrossOver includes the functionality of both the CrossOver Games and CrossOver Pro lines therefore CrossOver Games and CrossOver Pro are no longer available as single products.

CrossOver Games was optimized for running Windows video games. Unlike CrossOver, it didn&#x27;t focus on providing the most stable version of Wine. Instead, experimental features are provided to support newer games.

===Proton===
On 21 August 2018, Valve announced a new variation of Wine, named Proton, designed to integrate with the Linux version of the company&#x27;s Steam software (including Steam installations built into their Linux-based SteamOS operating system and Steam Machine computers). Valve&#x27;s goal for Proton is to enable Steam users on Linux to play games which lack a native Linux port (particularly back-catalog games), and ultimately, through integration with Steam as well as improvements to game support relative to mainline Wine, to give users &quot;the same simple plug-and-play experience&quot; that they would get if they were playing the game natively on Linux. Proton entered public beta immediately upon being announced.

Valve had already been collaborating with CodeWeavers since 2016 to develop improvements to Wine&#x27;s gaming performance, some of which have been merged to the upstream Wine project. Some of the specific improvements incorporated into Proton include Vulkan-based Direct3D 9, 10, 11, and 12 implementations via vkd3d, DXVK, and D9VK multi-threaded performance improvements via esync, improved handling of fullscreen games, and better automatic game controller hardware support.

Proton is fully open-source and available via GitHub.

===WINE@Etersoft===

The Russian company Etersoft has been developing a proprietary version of Wine since 2006. WINE@Etersoft supports popular Russian applications (for example, 1C:Enterprise by 1C Company).

===Other projects using Wine source code===
Other projects using Wine source code include:
* OTVDM, a 16-bit app compatibility layer for 64-bit Windows.
* ReactOS, a project to write an operating system compatible with Windows NT versions 5.x and up (which includes Windows 2000 and its successors) down to the device driver level. ReactOS uses Wine source code considerably; however due to architectural differences with ReactOS its code is not generally reused in Wine, such as in the case of ReactOS specific DLLs, such as ntdll, user32, kernel32, gdi32, and advapi. In July 2009, Aleksey Bragin, the ReactOS project lead, started a new ReactOS branch called Arwinss, and it was officially announced in January 2010. Arwinss is an alternative implementation of the core Win32 components, and uses mostly unchanged versions of Wine&#x27;s user32.dll and gdi32.dll.
* WineBottler, a wrapper around Wine in the form of a normal Mac application. It manages multiple Wine configurations for different programs in the form of &quot;bottles.&quot;
* &quot;Wineskin&quot;, an open source Wine GUI configuration manager for macOS. Wineskin creates a wrapper around Wine in the form of a normal Mac Application. The wrapper can also be used to make a distributable &quot;port&quot; of software.
* Odin, a project to run Win32 binaries on OS/2 or convert them to OS/2 native format. The project also provides the Odin32 API to compile Win32 programs for OS/2.
* Virtualization products such as Parallels Desktop for Mac and VirtualBox use WineD3D to make use of the GPU.
* WinOnX, a commercial package of Wine for macOS that includes a GUI for adding and managing applications and virtual machines.
* WineD3D for Windows, a compatibility wrapper which emulates old Direct3D versions and features that were removed by Microsoft in recent Windows releases, using OpenGL. This sometimes gets older games working again.
* Apple Game Porting Toolkit, a suite of software introduced at Apple&#x27;s Worldwide Developer Conference in June 2023 to facilitate porting games from Windows to Mac.

===Discontinued===
* Cedega / WineX: TransGaming Inc. (now Findev Inc. since the sale of its software businesses) produced the proprietary Cedega software. Formerly known as WineX, Cedega represented a fork from the last MIT-licensed version of Wine in 2002. Much like CrossOver Games, TransGaming&#x27;s Cedega was targeted towards running Windows video games. On 7 January 2011, TransGaming Inc. announced continued development of Cedega Technology under the GameTree Developer Program. TransGaming Inc. allowed members to keep using their Cedega ID and password until 28 February 2011.
* Cider: TransGaming also produced Cider, a library for Apple–Intel architecture Macintoshes. Instead of being an end-user product, Cider (like Winelib) is a wrapper allowing developers to adapt their games to run natively on Intel Mac without any changes in source code.
* Darwine: a port of the Wine libraries to Darwin and Mac OS X for the PowerPC and Intel x86 (32-bit) architectures, created by the OpenDarwin team in 2004. Its PowerPC version relied on QEMU. Darwine was merged back into Wine in 2009.
* E/OS LX: a project attempting to allow any program designed for any operating system to be run without the need to actually install any other operating system.
* Pipelight: a custom version of Wine (wine-compholio) that acts as a wrapper for Windows NPAPI plugins within Linux browsers. This tool permits Linux users to run Microsoft Silverlight, the Microsoft equivalent of Adobe Flash, and the Unity web plugin, along with a variety of other NPAPI plugins. The project provides an extensive set of patches against the upstream Wine project, some of which were approved and added to upstream Wine. Pipelight is largely obsolete, as modern browsers no longer support NPAPI plugins and Silverlight has been deprecated by Microsoft.

==Reception==
The Wine project has received a number of technical and philosophical complaints and concerns over the years.

===Security===
Because of Wine&#x27;s ability to run Windows binary code, concerns have been raised over native Windows viruses and malware affecting Unix-like operating systems as Wine can run limited malware made for Windows. A 2018 security analysis found that 5 out of 30 malware samples were able to successfully run through Wine, a relatively low rate that nevertheless posed a security risk. For this reason the developers of Wine recommend never running it as the superuser. Malware research software such as ZeroWine runs Wine on Linux in a virtual machine, to keep the malware completely isolated from the host system. An alternative to improve the security without the performance cost of using a virtual machine, is to run Wine in an LXC container, as Anbox software is doing by default with Android.

Another security concern is when the implemented specifications are ill-designed and allow for security compromise. Because Wine implements these specifications, it will likely also implement any security vulnerabilities they contain. One instance of this problem was the 2006 Windows Metafile vulnerability, which saw Wine implementing the vulnerable SETABORTPROC escape.

===Wine vs. native Unix applications===
A common concern about Wine is that its existence means that vendors are less likely to write native Linux, macOS, and BSD applications. As an example of this, it is worth considering IBM&#x27;s 1994 operating system, OS/2 Warp. An article describes the weaknesses of OS/2 which killed it, the first one being:

However, OS/2 had many problems with end user acceptance. Perhaps the most serious was that most computers sold already came with DOS and Windows, and many people didn&#x27;t bother to evaluate OS/2 on its merits due to already having an operating system. &quot;Bundling&quot; of DOS and Windows and the chilling effect this had on the operating system market frequently came up in &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corporation&quot;.

The Wine project itself responds to the specific complaint of &quot;encouraging&quot; the continued development for the Windows API on one of its wiki pages:
Also, the Wine Wiki page claims that Wine can help break the chicken-and-egg problem for Linux on the desktop:
The use of Wine for gaming has proved specifically controversial in the Linux community, as some feel it is preventing, or at least hindering, the further growth of native Linux gaming on the platform. One quirk however is that Wine is now able to run 16-bit and even certain 32-bit applications and games that do not launch on current 64-bit Windows versions. This use-case has led to running Wine on Windows itself via Windows Subsystem for Linux or third-party virtual machines, as well as encapsulated by means such as BoxedWine and Otvdm.

===Microsoft===
Until 2020, Microsoft had not made any public statements about Wine. However, the Windows Update online service will block updates to Microsoft applications running in Wine. On 16 February 2005, Ivan Leo Puoti discovered that Microsoft had started checking the Windows Registry for the Wine configuration key and would block the Windows Update for any component. As Puoti noted: &quot;It&#x27;s also the first time Microsoft acknowledges the existence of Wine.&quot;

In January 2020, Microsoft cited Wine as a positive consequence of being able to reimplement APIs, in its amicus curiae brief for &quot;Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.&quot;

In August 2024, Microsoft donated the Mono Project, a reimplementation of the .NET Framework, to the developers of Wine.

<doc id="37584" wikidata="Q2597416" url="?curid=37584" title="List of wine-producing regions">
<text>Wines are produced in significant growing regions where vineyards are planted. Wine grapes mostly grow between the 30th and the 50th degrees of latitude, in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, typically in regions of Mediterranean climate. Grapes will sometimes grow beyond this range, thus minor amounts of wine are made in some rather unexpected places.

In 2021, the five largest producers of wine in the world were, in order, Italy, France, Spain, the United States, and China.
==Countries==
2021 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) show a total worldwide production of 27 million tonnes of wine with the top 15 producing countries accounting for over 90% of the total.

In Ukraine, at the present time there are seven administrative regions (provinces) in which the wine industry has developed. Given the favorable climatic location, the law of Ukraine allocated 15 winegrowing areas (macrozones), which are the basis for growing certain varieties of grapes, and 58 natural wine regions (microzones). These are located mainly in the following areas.

* Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol – 6 macrozones with 12 microzones (69 wine grapes)
* Kherson Oblast – 2 macrozones with 10 microzones (28 wine grapes)
* Mykolaiv Oblast – 2 macrozones with 7 microzones (31 wine grapes)
* Odesa Oblast – 3 macrozones with 16 microzones (42 wine grapes)
* Zakarpattia Oblast – 1 macrozone with 12 microzones (24 wine grapes)
* Zaporizhzhia Oblast – 1 macrozone with 1 microzone (5 wine grapes)

In the UK, the area under vines is small, and whilst viticulture is not a major part of the rural economy, significant planting of new vines has occurred in the early 21st century. The greatest concentration of vineyards is found in the south east of England, in the counties of Hampshire, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex.

<text>A museum is an institution dedicated to displaying or preserving culturally or scientifically significant objects. Many museums have exhibitions of these objects on public display, and some have private collections that are used by researchers and specialists. Museums host a much wider range of objects than a library, and they usually focus on a specific theme, such as the arts, science, natural history or local history. Public museums that host exhibitions and interactive demonstrations are often tourist attractions, and many draw large numbers of visitors from outside of their host country, with the most visited museums in the world attracting millions of visitors annually.

Since the establishment of the earliest known museum in ancient times, museums have been associated with academia and the preservation of rare items. Museums originated as private collections of interesting items, and not until much later did the emphasis on educating the public take root.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;museum&quot; comes from Latin, and is pluralized as &quot;museums&quot; (or rarely, &quot;musea&quot;). It is originally from the Ancient Greek Μουσεῖον (&quot;mouseion&quot;), which denotes a place or temple dedicated to the muses (the patron divinities in Greek mythology of the arts), and hence was a building set apart for study and the arts, especially the Musaeum (institute) for philosophy and research at Alexandria, built under Ptolemy I Soter about 280 BC.

==Purpose==

The purpose of modern museums is to collect, preserve, interpret, and display objects of artistic, cultural, or scientific significance for the study and education of the public. To city leaders, an active museum community can be seen as a gauge of the cultural or economic health of a city, and a way to increase the sophistication of its inhabitants. To museum professionals, a museum might be seen as a way to educate the public about the museum&#x27;s mission, such as civil rights or environmentalism. Museums are, above all, storehouses of knowledge. In 1829, James Smithson&#x27;s bequest funding the Smithsonian Institution stated that he wanted to establish an institution &quot;for the increase and diffusion of knowledge&quot;.

In the late 19th century, museums of natural history exemplified the scientific drive for classifying life and interpreting the world. Their purpose was to gather examples from each field of knowledge for research and display. Concurrently, as American colleges expanded during the 19th century, they also developed their own natural history collections to support the education of their students. By the last quarter of the 19th century, scientific research in universities was shifting toward biological research on a cellular level, and cutting-edge research moved from museums to university laboratories. While many large museums, such as the Smithsonian Institution, are still respected as research centers, research is no longer a main purpose of most museums. While there is an ongoing debate about the purposes of interpretation of a museum&#x27;s collection, there has been a consistent mission to protect and preserve cultural artifacts for future generations. Much care, expertise, and expense is invested in preservation efforts to retard decomposition in ageing documents, artifacts, artworks, and buildings. All museums display objects that are important to a culture. As historian Steven Conn writes, &quot;To see the thing itself, with one&#x27;s own eyes and in a public place, surrounded by other people having some version of the same experience, can be enchanting.&quot;

Museum purposes vary from institution to institution. Some favor education over conservation, or vice versa. For example, in the 1970s, the Canada Science and Technology Museum favored education over the preservation of their objects. They displayed objects as well as their functions. One exhibit featured a historical printing press that a staff member used for visitors to create museum memorabilia. Some museums seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, while others have specific audiences, like the LDS Church History Museum or local history organizations. Generally speaking, museums collect objects of significance that comply with their mission statement for conservation and display. Apart from questions of provenance and conservation, museums take into consideration the former use and status of an object. Religious or holy objects, for instance, are handled according to cultural rules. Jewish objects that contain the name of God may not be discarded, but need to be buried.

Although most museums do not allow physical contact with the associated artifacts, there are some that are interactive and encourage a more hands-on approach. In 2009, Hampton Court Palace, a palace of Henry VIII, in England opened the council room to the general public to create an interactive environment for visitors. Rather than allowing visitors to handle 500-year-old objects, however, the museum created replicas, as well as replica costumes. The daily activities, historic clothing, and even temperature changes immerse the visitor in an impression of what Tudor life may have been.

===Definitions===
Major professional organizations from around the world offer some definitions as to what constitutes a museum, and their purpose. Common themes in all the definitions are public good and the care, preservation, and interpretation of collections.
The International Council of Museums&#x27; current definition of a museum (adopted in 2022): &quot;A museum is a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the service of society that researches, collects, conserves, interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage. Open to the public, accessible and inclusive, museums foster diversity and sustainability. They operate and communicate ethically, professionally and with the participation of communities, offering varied experiences for education, enjoyment, reflection and knowledge sharing.&quot;

The Canadian Museums Association&#x27;s definition: &quot;A museum is a non-profit, permanent establishment, that does not exist primarily for the purpose of conducting temporary exhibitions and that is open to the public during regular hours and administered in the public interest for the purpose of conserving, preserving, studying, interpreting, assembling and exhibiting to the public for the instruction and enjoyment of the public, objects and specimens or educational and cultural value including artistic, scientific, historical and technological material.&quot;

The United Kingdom&#x27;s Museums Association&#x27;s definition: &quot;Museums enable people to explore collections for inspiration, learning and enjoyment. They are institutions that collect, safeguard and make accessible artifacts and specimens, which they hold in trust for society.&quot;

While the American Alliance of Museums does not have such a definition, their list of accreditation criteria to participate in their Accreditation Program states a museum must: &quot;Be a legally organized nonprofit institution or part of a nonprofit organization or government entity; Be essentially educational in nature; Have a formally stated and approved mission; Use and interpret objects or a site for the public presentation of regularly scheduled programs and exhibits; Have a formal and appropriate program of documentation, care, and use of collections or objects; Carry out the above functions primarily at a physical facility or site; Have been open to the public for at least two years; Be open to the public at least 1,000 hours a year; Have accessioned 80 percent of its permanent collection; Have at least one paid professional staff with museum knowledge and experience; Have a full-time director to whom authority is delegated for day-to-day operations; Have the financial resources sufficient to operate effectively; Demonstrate that it meets the Core Standards for Museums; Successfully complete the Core Documents Verification Program&quot;.

Additionally, there is a legal definition of museum in United States legislation authorizing the establishment of the Institute of Museum and Library Services: &quot;Museum means a public, tribal, or private nonprofit institution which is organized on a permanent basis for essentially educational, cultural heritage, or aesthetic purposes and which, using a professional staff: Owns or uses tangible objects, either animate or inanimate; Cares for these objects; and Exhibits them to the general public on a regular basis&quot; (Museum Services Act 1976).

==History==
===Ancient===
One of the oldest museums known is Ennigaldi-Nanna&#x27;s museum, built by Princess Ennigaldi in modern Iraq at the end of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The site dates from , and contained artifacts from earlier Mesopotamian civilizations. Notably, a clay drum label—written in three languages—was found at the site, referencing the history and discovery of a museum item.

Ancient Greeks and Romans collected and displayed art and objects but perceived museums differently from modern-day views. In the classical period, the museums were the temples and their precincts which housed collections of votive offerings. Paintings and sculptures were displayed in gardens, forums, theaters, and bathhouses. In the ancient past there was little differentiation between libraries and museums with both occupying the building and were frequently connected to a temple or royal palace. The Museum of Alexandria, identical to the Library of Alexandria, was an inspiration during the early Renaissance period and thus originally libraries were called museums. The royal palaces and temples, such as the Roman temple of Peace, also functioned as a kind of museum outfitted with art and objects from conquered territories and gifts from ambassadors from other kingdoms allowing the ruler to display the amassed collections to guests and to visiting dignitaries.

Also in Alexandria from the time of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (r. 285–246 BCE), was the first zoological park. At first used by Philadelphus in an attempt to domesticate African elephants for use in war, the elephants were also used for show along with a menagerie of other animals specimens including hartebeests, ostriches, zebras, leopards, giraffes, rhinoceros, and pythons.

===Early ===
=== The Dresden Electoral Stable (1588) ===

The first museum of the modern era was the Renaissance stable building known as the &quot;Electoral Stable and Stable Courtyard Dresden&quot; (later called the Johanneum) in Dresden, constructed between 1586 and 1588. In this building, the Saxon Elector Christian I displayed not only his 128 elite stallions but also over 50 carved figures of horses and their riders, sleds with carved and later stuffed horses, saddles, weapons, and historical armors. Guided tours were offered for anyone desiring to see it from the very beginning, and it was even described in the region’s first travel guide in 1632. Numerous descriptions hence remain. 

To serve its purpose as an exhibition space, deliberately focused on the theme of expensive horses used in equestrian arts, the interior and exterior of the palace-like stable were elaborately painted. An automaton dispensed welcome drinks, and more than 35 rooms were decorated with equestrian accessories.

This magnificent equestrian museum was partly motivated by the rejection of images following the Reformation. However, it was also accompanied by an ancestral gallery of the Wettin family, which was also open for viewing in the Long Corridor (Langer Gang) in Dresden starting in 1588, and a guidebook was created for it. The main focus, however, remained on the horses, while the treatise &quot;Reflections on How to Establish a Kunstkammer&quot; by Gabriel Kaltenmarckt was already made available to Christian I starting in 1587.

=== Kunstkammer (Cabinet of Curiosities) ===
Other early museums began as the private collections of wealthy individuals, families or institutions of art and rare or curious natural objects and artifacts. These were often displayed in so-called &quot;wonder rooms&quot; or cabinets of curiosities. These collections first emerged in western Europe, then spread into other parts of the world.

Public access to these collections was often possible only at the whim of the owner and his staff. One way that elite men during this time period gained a higher social status in the world of elites was by becoming a collector of these curious objects and displaying them. Many of the items in these collections were new discoveries and these collectors or naturalists, since many of these people held interest in natural sciences, were eager to obtain them. By putting their collections in a museum and on display, they not only got to show their fantastic finds but also used the museum as a way to sort and &quot;manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced&quot;.

One of these naturalists and collectors was Ulisse Aldrovandi, whose collection policy of gathering as many objects and facts about them was &quot;encyclopedic&quot; in nature, reminiscent of that of Pliny, the Roman philosopher and naturalist. The idea was to consume and collect as much knowledge as possible, to put everything they collected and everything they knew in these displays. In time, however, museum philosophy would change and the encyclopedic nature of information that was so enjoyed by Aldrovandi and his cohorts would be dismissed as well as &quot;the museums that contained this knowledge&quot;. The 18th-century scholars of the Age of Enlightenment saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their natural history museums on &quot;organization and taxonomy&quot; rather than displaying everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi.

The first museums in the form of cabinets of curiosities were, contrary to the above mentioned Dresden stable building, often accessible only for the middle and upper classes. It could be difficult to gain entrance. In the Vienna Hofburg, the Dresden Residenzschloss as well as the Castle of Ambras such collections were housed since ca. 1560, but only for private eyes. 

An especially ancient collection is also the Capitolinian collection, dating from 1471, which was however only opened to the public in 1734.

When the British Museum opened to the public in 1759, it was a concern that large crowds could damage the artifacts. Prospective visitors to the British Museum had to apply in writing for admission, and small groups were allowed into the galleries each day. The British Museum became increasingly popular during the 19th century, amongst all age groups and social classes who visited the British Museum, especially on public holidays.

The Ashmolean Museum, however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of Elias Ashmole, was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public and is considered by some to be the first modern public museum. The collection included that of Elias Ashmole which he had collected himself, including objects he had acquired from the gardeners, travellers and collectors John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name. The collection included antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological specimens—one of which was the stuffed body of the last dodo ever seen in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, except for its head and one claw. The museum opened on 24 May 1683, with naturalist Robert Plot as the first keeper. The first building, which became known as the Old Ashmolean, is sometimes attributed to Sir Christopher Wren or Thomas Wood.
In France, the first public museum was the Louvre in Paris, opened in 1793 during the French Revolution, which enabled for the first time free access to the former French royal collections for people of all stations and status. The fabulous art treasures collected by the French monarchy over centuries were accessible to the public three days each &quot;décade&quot; (the 10-day unit which had replaced the week in the French Republican Calendar). The &quot;Conservatoire du muséum national des Arts&quot; (National Museum of Arts&#x27;s Conservatory) was charged with organizing the Louvre as a national public museum and the centerpiece of a planned national museum system. As Napoléon I conquered the great cities of Europe, confiscating art objects as he went, the collections grew and the organizational task became more and more complicated. After Napoleon was defeated in 1815, many of the treasures he had amassed were gradually returned to their owners (and many were not). His plan was never fully realized, but his concept of a museum as an agent of nationalistic fervor had a profound influence throughout Europe.
Chinese and Japanese visitors to Europe were fascinated by the museums they saw there, but had cultural difficulties in grasping their purpose and finding an equivalent Chinese or Japanese term for them. Chinese visitors in the early 19th century named these museums based on what they contained, so defined them as &quot;bone amassing buildings&quot; or &quot;courtyards of treasures&quot; or &quot;painting pavilions&quot; or &quot;curio stores&quot; or &quot;halls of military feats&quot; or &quot;gardens of everything&quot;. Japan first encountered Western museum institutions when it participated in Europe&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fairs in the 1860s. The British Museum was described by one of their delegates as a &#x27;hakubutsukan&#x27;, a &#x27;house of extensive things&#x27; – this would eventually become accepted as the equivalent word for &#x27;museum&#x27; in Japan and China.
===Modern ===
American museums eventually joined European museums as the world&#x27;s leading centers for the production of new knowledge in their fields of interest. A period of intense museum building, in both an intellectual and physical sense was realized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (this is often called &quot;The Museum Period&quot; or &quot;The Museum Age&quot;). While many American museums, both natural history museums and art museums alike, were founded with the intention of focusing on the scientific discoveries and artistic developments in North America, many moved to emulate their European counterparts in certain ways (including the development of Classical collections from ancient Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Rome). Drawing on Michel Foucault&#x27;s concept of liberal government, Tony Bennett has suggested the development of more modern 19th-century museums was part of new strategies by Western governments to produce a citizenry that, rather than be directed by coercive or external forces, monitored and regulated its own conduct. To incorporate the masses in this strategy, the private space of museums that previously had been restricted and socially exclusive were made public. As such, objects and artifacts, particularly those related to high culture, became instruments for these &quot;new tasks of social management&quot;. Universities became the primary centers for innovative research in the United States well before the start of World War II. Nevertheless, museums to this day contribute new knowledge to their fields and continue to build collections that are useful for both research and display.

The late twentieth century witnessed intense debate concerning the repatriation of religious, ethnic, and cultural artifacts housed in museum collections. In the United States, several Native American tribes and advocacy groups have lobbied extensively for the repatriation of sacred objects and the reburial of human remains. In 1990, Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which required federal agencies and federally funded institutions to repatriate Native American &quot;cultural items&quot; to culturally affiliate tribes and groups. Similarly, many European museum collections often contain objects and cultural artifacts acquired through imperialism and colonization. Some historians and scholars have criticized the British Museum for its possession of rare antiquities from Egypt, Greece, and the Middle East.

==Management==

The roles associated with the management of a museum largely depend on the size of the institution. Together, the Board and the Director establish a system of governance that is guided by policies that set standards for the institution. Documents that set these standards include an institutional or strategic plan, institutional code of ethics, bylaws, and collections policy. The American Alliance of Museums (AAM) has also formulated a series of standards and best practices that help guide the management of museums.

* Board of Trustees or Board of directors – The board governs the museum and is responsible for ensuring the museum is financially and ethically sound. They set standards and policies for the museum. Board members are often involved in fundraising aspects of the museum and represent the institution. Some museums use the terms &quot;directors&quot; and &quot;trustees&quot; interchangeably but both are different legal instruments. A board of directors governs a nonprofit corporation, a board of trustees is responsible for governing a charitable trust, foundation, or endowment. In the case of small museums and all volunteer museums, a board may be more hands-on in the day-to-day operations of the museum.
* Director – The director is the face of the museum to the professional and public community. They communicate closely with the board to guide and govern the museum. They work with the staff to ensure the museum runs smoothly. According to museum professionals Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, &quot;Administration of the organization requires skill in conflict management, interpersonal relations, budget management and monitoring, and staff supervision and evaluation. Managers must also set legal and ethical standards and maintain involvement in the museum profession.&quot;
Various positions within the museum carry out the policies established by the Board and the Director. All museum employees should work together toward the museum&#x27;s institutional goal. Here is a list of positions commonly found at museums:
* Curator – Curators are the intellectual drivers behind exhibits. They research the museum&#x27;s collection and topic of focus, develop exhibition themes, and publish their research aimed at either a public or academic audience. Larger museums have curators in a variety of areas. For example, The Henry Ford has a Curator of Transportation, a Curator of Public Life, a Curator of Decorative Arts, etc. Many art museums have curators dedicated to specific historical periods and geographic regions, such as American art and modern or contemporary art.
* Collections Management – Collections managers are primarily responsible for the hands-on care, movement, and storage of objects. They are responsible for the accessibility of collections and collections policy.
* Registrar – Registrars are the primary record keepers of the collection. They ensure that objects are properly accessioned, documented, insured, and, when appropriate, loaned. Ethical and legal issues related to the collection are dealt with by registrars. Along with collections managers, they uphold the museum&#x27;s collections policy.
*Educator – Museum educators are responsible for educating museum audiences. Their duties can include designing tours and public programs for children and adults, teacher training, developing classroom and continuing education resources, community outreach, and volunteer management. Educators not only work with the public, but also collaborate with other museum staff on exhibition and program development to ensure that exhibits are audience-friendly.
*Exhibit Designer – Exhibit designers are in charge of the layout and physical installation of exhibits. They create a conceptual design and then bring it to fruition in the physical space.
* Conservator – Conservators focus on object restoration. More than preserving the object in its present state, they seek to stabilize and repair artifacts to the condition of an earlier era.

Other positions commonly found at museums include: building operator, public programming staff, photographer, librarian, archivist, groundskeeper, volunteer coordinator, preparator, security staff, development officer, membership officer, business officer, gift shop manager, public relations staff, and graphic designer.

At smaller museums, staff members often fulfill multiple roles. Some of these positions are excluded entirely or may be carried out by a contractor when necessary.

The cultural property stored in museums is threatened in many countries by natural disaster, war, terrorist attacks or other emergencies. To this end, an internationally important aspect is a strong bundling of existing resources and the networking of existing specialist competencies in order to prevent any loss or damage to cultural property or to keep damage as low as possible. International partner for museums is UNESCO and Blue Shield International in accordance with the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property from 1954 and its 2nd Protocol from 1999. For legal reasons, there are many international collaborations between museums, and the local Blue Shield organizations.

Blue Shield has conducted extensive missions to protect museums and cultural assets in armed conflict, such as 2011 in Egypt and Libya, 2013 in Syria and 2014 in Mali and Iraq. During these operations, the looting of the collection is to be prevented in particular.

===Gallery – Museum storage===
==Planning==

The design of museums has evolved throughout history. However, museum planning involves planning the actual mission of the museum along with planning the space that the collection of the museum will be housed in. Intentional museum planning has its beginnings with the museum founder and librarian John Cotton Dana. Dana detailed the process of founding the Newark Museum in a series of books in the early 20th century so that other museum founders could plan their museums. Dana suggested that potential founders of museums should form a committee first, and reach out to the community for input as to what the museum should supply or do for the community. According to Dana, museums should be planned according to community&#x27;s needs:

&quot;The new museum ... does not build on an educational superstition. It examines its community&#x27;s life first, and then straightway bends its energies to supplying some the material which that community needs, and to making that material&#x27;s presence widely known, and to presenting it in such a way as to secure it for the maximum of use and the maximum efficiency of that use.&quot;

The way that museums are planned and designed vary according to what collections they house, but overall, they adhere to planning a space that is easily accessed by the public and easily displays the chosen artifacts. These elements of planning have their roots with John Cotton Dana, who was perturbed at the historical placement of museums outside of cities, and in areas that were not easily accessed by the public, in gloomy European style buildings.

Questions of accessibility continue to the present day. Many museums strive to make their buildings, programming, ideas, and collections more publicly accessible than in the past. Not every museum is participating in this trend, but that seems to be the trajectory of museums in the twenty-first century with its emphasis on inclusiveness. One pioneering way museums are attempting to make their collections more accessible is with open storage. Most of a museum&#x27;s collection is typically locked away in a secure location to be preserved, but the result is most people never get to see the vast majority of collections. The Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s Luce Center for American Art practices this open storage where the public can view items not on display, albeit with minimal interpretation. The practice of open storage is all part of an ongoing debate in the museum field of the role objects play and how accessible they should be.

In terms of modern museums, interpretive museums, as opposed to art museums, have missions reflecting curatorial guidance through the subject matter which now include content in the form of images, audio and visual effects, and interactive exhibits. Museum creation begins with a museum plan, created through a museum planning process. The process involves identifying the museum&#x27;s vision and the resources, organization and experiences needed to realize this vision. A feasibility study, analysis of comparable facilities, and an interpretive plan are all developed as part of the museum planning process.

Some museum experiences have very few or no artifacts and do not necessarily call themselves museums, and their mission reflects this; the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, being notable examples where there are few artifacts, but strong, memorable stories are told or information is interpreted. In contrast, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. uses many artifacts in their memorable exhibitions.

Museums are laid out in a specific way for a specific reason and each person who enters the doors of a museum will see its collection completely differently to the person behind them- this is what makes museums fascinating because they are represented differently to each individual.

===Financial uses===

In recent years, some cities have turned to museums as an avenue for economic development or rejuvenation. This is particularly true in the case of postindustrial cities. Examples of museums fulfilling these economic roles exist around the world. For example, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao was built in Bilbao, Spain, in a move by the Basque regional government to revitalize the dilapidated old port area of that city. The Basque government agreed to pay $100 million for the construction of the museum, a price tag that caused many Bilbaoans to protest against the project. Nonetheless, over 1.1 million people visited the museum in 2015, indicating it appeared to have paid off for the local government despite local backlash; key to this is the large demographic of foreign visitors to the museum, with 63% of the visitors residing outside of Spain and thus feeding foreign investment straight into Bilbao. A similar project to that undertaken in Bilbao was the Titanic Belfast, built on disused shipyards in Belfast, Northern Ireland, incidentally for the same price as the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and by the same architect, Frank Gehry, in time for the 100th anniversary of &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s maiden voyage in 2012. Initially expecting modest visitor numbers of 425,000 annually, first year visitor numbers reached over 800,000, with almost 60% coming from outside Northern Ireland. In the United States, similar projects include the 81,000 square foot Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia and The Broad in Los Angeles.

Museums being used as a cultural economic driver by city and local governments has proven to be controversial among museum activists and local populations alike. Public protests have occurred in numerous cities which have tried to employ museums in this way. While most subside if a museum is successful, as happened in Bilbao, others continue especially if a museum struggles to attract visitors. The Taubman Museum of Art is an example of an expensive museum (eventually $66 million) that attained little success and continues to have a low endowment for its size. Some museum activists see this method of museum use as a deeply flawed model for such institutions. Steven Conn, one such museum proponent, believes that &quot;to ask museums to solve our political and economic problems is to set them up for inevitable failure and to set us (the visitor) up for inevitable disappointment.&quot;

===Funding===
 Museums are facing funding shortages. Funding for museums comes from four major categories, and as of 2009 the breakdown for the United States is as follows: Government support (at all levels) 24.4%, private (charitable) giving 36.5%, earned income 27.6%, and investment income 11.5%. Government funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the largest museum funder in the United States, decreased by 19.586 million between 2011 and 2015, adjusted for inflation. The average spent per visitor in an art museum in 2016 was $8 between admissions, store and restaurant, where the average expense per visitor was $55. Corporations, which fall into the private giving category, can be a good source of funding to make up the funding gap. The amount corporations currently give to museums accounts for just 5% of total funding. Corporate giving to the arts, however, was set to increase by 3.3% in 2017.

==Exhibition design==
Most mid-size and large museums employ exhibit design staff for graphic and environmental design projects, including exhibitions. In addition to traditional 2-D and 3-D designers and architects, these staff departments may include audio-visual specialists, software designers, audience research, evaluation specialists, writers, editors, and preparators or art handlers. These staff specialists may also be charged with supervising contract design or production services. The exhibit design process builds on the interpretive plan for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. Museums of all sizes may also contract the outside services of exhibit fabrication businesses.

Some museum scholars have even begun to question whether museums truly need artifacts at all. Historian Steven Conn provocatively asks this question, suggesting that there are fewer objects in &quot;all&quot; museums now, as they have been progressively replaced by interactive technology. As educational programming has grown in museums, mass collections of objects have receded in importance. This is not necessarily a negative development; Dorothy Canfield Fisher observed that the reduction in objects has pushed museums to grow from institutions that artlessly showcased their many artifacts (in the style of early cabinets of curiosity) to instead &quot;thinning out&quot; the objects presented &quot;for a general view of any given subject or period, and to put the rest away in archive-storage-rooms, where they could be consulted by students, the only people who really needed to see them&quot;. This phenomenon of disappearing objects is especially present in science museums like the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, which have a high visitorship of school-aged children who may benefit more from hands-on interactive technology than reading a label beside an artifact.

==Types==

;Background
There is no definitive standard as to the set types of museums. Additionally, the museum landscape has become so varied, that it may not be sufficient to use traditional categories to comprehend fully the vast variety existing throughout the world. However, it may be useful to categorize museums in different ways under multiple perspectives. Museums can vary based on size, from large institutions, to very small institutions focusing on specific subjects, such as a specific location, a notable person, or a given period of time. Museums also can be based on the main source of funding: central or federal government, provinces, regions, universities; towns and communities; other subsidised; nonsubsidised and private.

It may sometimes be useful to distinguish between museums which interpret the way its subject matter has developed and evolved through time (e.g., Lower East Side Tenement Museum and Diachronic Museum of Larissa), and museums which interpret the way its subject matter existed at a certain point in time (e.g., the Anne Frank House and Colonial Williamsburg). According to University of Florida Professor Eric Kilgerman, &quot;While a museum in which a particular narrative unfolds within its halls is diachronic, those museums that limit their space to a single experience are called synchronic.&quot;

In her book &quot;Civilizing the Museum&quot;, author Elaine Heumann Gurian proposes that there are five categories of museums based on intention and not content: object centered, narrative, client centered, community centered, and national.

Museums can also be categorized into major groups by the type of collections they display, to include: fine arts, applied arts, craft, archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, biography, history, cultural history, science, technology, children&#x27;s museums, natural history, botanical and zoological gardens. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, e.g., museums of modern art, folk art, local history, military history, aviation history, philately, agriculture, or geology. The size of a museum&#x27;s collection typically determines the museum&#x27;s size, whereas its collection reflects the type of museum it is. Many museums normally display a &quot;permanent collection&quot; of important selected objects in its area of specialization, and may periodically display &quot;special collections&quot; on a temporary basis.

===Major types===
The following is a list to give an idea of the major museum types. While comprehensive, it is not a definitive list.

===Legal framework===
====Public vs. private====
Private museums are organized by individuals and managed by a board and museum officers, but public museums are created and managed by federal, state, or local governments. A government can charter a museum through legislative action but the museum can still be private as it is not part of the government. The distinction regulates the ownership and legal accountability for the care of the collections.

====Non-profit vs. for-profit====
Nonprofit means that an organization is classified as a charitable corporation and is exempt from paying most taxes and the money the organization earns is invested in the organization itself. Money made by a private, for-profit museum is paid to the museum&#x27;s owners or shareholders.

The nonprofit museum has a fiduciary responsibility in regards to the public, in essence the museum holds its collections and administers it for the benefit of the public. Collections of for-profit museums are legally corporate assets the museum administers for the benefit of the owners or shareholders.

====Run by trusts vs. corporations====
A trust is a legal instrument where trustees manage the trust&#x27;s assets for the benefit of the museum following the specific wishes of the donor. This provides tax benefits for the donor, and also allows the donor to have control over how assets are distributed.

Corporations are legal entities and may acquire property in a way similar to how an individual can own property. Museums under incorporation are usually organized by a community or group of individuals. While a board of director&#x27;s loyalty is to the corporation, a board of trustee&#x27;s loyalty has to be loyal to the intention of the trust. The ramification is that a trust is far less flexible than a corporation.

==Current challenges==

===Decolonization===
A global movement for the decolonization of museums has been gaining momentum since the late 20th century. Proponents of this movement argue that &quot;museums are a box of things&quot; and do not represent complete stories; instead they show biased narratives based on ideologies, in which certain stories are intentionally disregarded. Through this, people are encouraging others to consider this missing perspective, when looking at museum collections, as every object viewed in such environments was placed by an individual to represent a certain viewpoint, be it historical or cultural.

The 2018 &quot;report on the restitution of African cultural heritage&quot; is a prominent example regarding the decolonization of museums and other collections in France and the claims of African countries to regain artifacts illegally taken from their original cultural settings.

Since 1868, several monolithic human figures known as Moai have been removed from Easter Island and put in display in major Western museums such as the National Museum of Natural History, the British Museum, the Louvre and the Royal Museums of Art and History. Several demands have been made by Easter Island residents for the return of the Moai. The figures are seen as ancestors and family or the soul by the Rapa Nui and hold deep cultural value to their people. Other examples include the Gweagal Shield, thought to be a very significant shield taken from Botany Bay in April 1770 or the Parthenon marble sculptures, which were taken from Greece by Lord Elgin in 1805. Successive Greek governments have unsuccessfully petitioned for the return of the Parthenon marbles. Another example among many others is the so-called Montezuma&#x27;s headdress in the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna, which is a source of dispute between Austria and Mexico.

As well as an argument for the decolonization of museums, there is also the push by some to represent, in both exhibitions and new museums, the marginalized communities within a culture or society. One example of this is the Black Miner&#x27;s Museum in Nottingham, England.

===Labor issues and unionization===

;Background
The past few years has seen a unionizing movement. US museums workers have initiated dialogs about labor and collective organizing in the cultural sector. In 2019 the workers in multiple museums voted to form unions with more protesting to press for a fair contract and against unfair labor practices. During that year over 3,000 cultural workers anonymously started to share their salaries online through a pay transparency spreadsheet.

The Marciano Art Foundation, a museum established by co-founders of Guess clothing, Maurice Marciano and Paul Marciano closed indefinitely in November 2019 after workers attempted to unionize. The Marciano Foundation released a statement a month later that the closure was permanent.

In the country of Georgia 40 employees were fired May 2022 as part of a restructuring. The newly formed union, the Georgian Trade Union of Science, Education, and Culture Workers said in a statement they said the employees were fired illegally and the reorganization was &quot;carried out by the employer in an untransparent and maladministered manner&quot; and that the organization will &quot;definitely fight to the end to protect the rights of employees.&quot; Fired senior curator Maia Pataridze said the new management mentioned her social media posts criticizing the government. Among those fired was union chair, Nikoloz Tsikaridze, a senior researcher and archaeologist who associated the discharging of himself and other museum staff was for forming a union, and said that Thea Tsulukiani, the Georgia Minister of Culture had &quot;punished&quot; them.

;History
In the United States, labor unrest within the arts and cultural sector go back at least nearly a century to 1933 when a New York-based collective of artists eventually known as the Artist&#x27;s Union used collective bargaining for state relief for unemployed artists.
In 1971 administrative staff at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art formed the organization &quot;Professional and Staff Association of the Museum of Modern Art&quot; (PASTA), the first union of professional employees, as opposed to maintenance and service people, at a privately‐financed museum. The contract negotiated would provide a wage increase, protection against termination without cause, and direct access to trustees and policy-making processes at the museum. While there was some interest from workers at other museums at the time, for the next fifty years there was little change in museums adding union representation of their professional employees.

===Sustainability and climate change===

Increasingly museums have responded to the ongoing climate crisis through enacting sustainable museum practices, and exhibitions highlighting the issues surrounding climate change and the Anthropocene.

===Digital culture===
As digital culture has increased in society, museums have needed to respond to these changes in the facilities that they offer online.

<doc id="37586" wikidata="Q2161225" url="?curid=37586" title="U-boot (cocktail)">
<text>A U-boot is a beer cocktail that is made by placing a shot of vodka into a glass of beer, typically a lager. It is popular in Germany, Poland, North Macedonia, and Flanders. In Germany, the liquor korn is sometimes used instead, while in Flanders and the Netherlands, &quot;jonge jenever&quot; is preferred.

It is called a U-boot (German abbreviation of &quot;Unterseeboot&quot;, &quot;submarine&quot;) because the shot glass of vodka sinks to the bottom of the glass of beer. The shot glass then &quot;surfaces&quot; when the cocktail is drank.

== Preparation ==
Place a shot glass on upside down glass and fill it with vodka. Place a pint glass over the two glasses so it sits against the shot glass and flip them over. Fill the pint glass with lager and as the drink is consumed the vodka will leak into drink.

== Other names and variations ==
In Flanders and the Netherlands, it is called a &quot;Duikboot&quot;, literally translated &quot;Submarine&quot;. It is seen as a variant on the &quot;kopstoot&quot; (lit. &quot;headbutt&quot;) in the Netherlands. The &quot;kopstoot&quot; is a shot of jenever followed by a beer as a chaser.

In North Macedonia it is called &quot;Подморница&quot; - &quot;Podmornica&quot;, literally translated &quot;Submarine&quot;. It uses tequila which is being dropped into a big pint.

In southern Germany, U-boot is usually served as a combination of Fanta and cognac instead of beer and vodka.

In Mexico, it is called &quot;Submarino&quot;, Spanish for &quot;Submarine&quot;. Instead of vodka, it uses tequila, and the shot glass must be left inverted inside the beer glass.

In Russia, it is most often called &quot;Глубинная бомба&quot;, Russian for &quot;Depth charge&quot;. Usually any cocktail, mixing vodka and beer called in Russia &quot;Ёрш&quot;, (Yorsh) literally meaning a wire brush. It is also rarely called &quot;Водолаз&quot; - &quot;Vodolaz&quot;, literally translated as &quot;Diver&quot;.

In Sorbia, vodka and orange juice is used.

In Brazil, it is called &quot;Submarino&quot;, Portuguese for &quot;Submarine&quot;. In the south, where it is more easily found, it is common practice to use steinhäger instead of vodka.

In Sweden, it is called &quot;Ubåt&quot;, Swedish for &quot;Submarine&quot;. Jägermeister is used instead of vodka.

In Greece, it is called &quot;υποβρύχιο&quot;, Greek for &quot;Submarine&quot;. Served as a shot glass of Jack Daniels sink into the bottom of a short glass of beer.

<text>Padthaway ( ) is a small town in the Australian state of South Australia located in the state&#x27;s south-east within the Limestone Coast region about south east of the state capital of Adelaide and about south-east of the municipal seat of Bordertown. The name is derived from the Potawurutj, the Aboriginal name word for &quot;cover&quot; or &quot;bury&quot;. Padthaway is in the Tatiara District Council, the state electorate of MacKillop and the federal Division of Barker.

The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Padthaway had a population of 418 people.

==History==
Padthaway was the name of the original pastoral station which was established on Bodaruwitj Aboriginal lands in this area in 1847 by a successful Scottish businessman, Robert Lawson. In 1882 the Padthaway Estate Homestead was built by Eliza and Robert Lawson. The historic Padthaway Estate complex is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

In 1952 Padthaway became the centre of a soldier settlement scheme. The first vineyards were planted here in 1964 and quickly transformed marginal grazing land into a top wine-producing region. White wines, especially, from the region are regular winners of major awards. These wines may be purchased at the local cellar door sales and at wine retailers around Australia. Agriculture is also strong in Padthaway with onion, olives and seeds being grown along with sheep and cattle which are reared for sale.

Padthaway has a cluster of businesses located in the heart of town including a deli, general store, two rural service centres, an auto and engineering centre, a caravan park, and a park with a playground in the main street, Memorial Drive.

Other public amenities include netball and tennis courts, football oval, town hall, sports complex, medical clinic, playground, skate park and rotunda. The toilets are right near the playground. In 2010 a new medical clinic was built.

The Padthaway Conservation Park which is situated on a former coastal dune is located about north-east of the town centre. The conservation park has stands of yellow gum, ribbon gum, brown stringybark, manna gums, many acacias and banksias. It is also home to a variety of animals including koalas, birds, rabbits, kangaroos and many insects. Sometimes the rare fire orchid may be viewed in flower.

==Wine region==

Padthaway is also the name of a wine region surrounding the town. It is home to several large commercial vineyards. The oldest vineyard was established in 1964 by Seppelts, with Lindeman&#x27;s, Hardys and Wynns also establishing vineyards in the 1960s. The wine region is long and wide with over of vineyards. There are only a few cellar doors operating in the region.

== Sports ==
Records for lawn bowls being played in Padthaway go back to 1963. Lawn bowls is played in Padthaway on Saturday during the summer time. Padthaway bowling club plays in the Upper South East association.

The last A grade cricket premiership Padthaway won was in 1993. Padthaway has had a B grade side most years since. Padthaway came fifth in the competition in 2010–2011. In 2011 there was only one competition, an A grade side.

Netball has been played in Padthaway since the mid-late 1960s. In 2011 the Padthaway Netball Club, also called the Lions, has more than seven different teams for netball.

The Padthaway Football Club which commenced in 1967 is known as the &quot;Lions&quot; and is the main club of the town, competing in the Kowree-Naracoorte-Tatiara Football League. The football club won an A grade premiership grand final in 1993 against Bordertown.

The Padthaway Tennis Club dates back to 1962 and 1972 when the club laid new concrete courts. The Padthaway Tennis club won many premierships between the mid-1970s and into the late 1980s. Tennis is currently played as a social competition on Wednesday nights for a six-eight-week season in the summer before Christmas.

The Padthaway golf course is carved out of scrubland. This tight course is a challenge even for the most professional of golfers. The Padthaway golf club was opened in 1988 and has 9 holes with scrapes.

== The community ==
Apex is a community group which operates in Padthaway composed of men between the ages of 18 and 45 who work together to promote social justice and raise awareness of charity causes by fundraising in interesting and creative ways.

Padthaway has an active Women in Agricultural Business group. WAB is a statewide network with branches throughout SA. It is an organisation for women interested in rural, agricultural and business issues. It provides the opportunity for self-development and friendship.

==Schools==
The school was built in 1935 and had its 75-year anniversary in 2010. The event was attended by many past, current and future students and staff and a time capsule was buried on the day. In 2011 Padthaway Primary School had 52 students and 12 staff members. Padthaway Primary School caters for years Reception-7 and also has a Child Parent Centre (CPC). At Padthaway Primary School the Student Representative Council (SRC) organises many fundraising activities for students to participate in.

Padthaway Primary School is a school with many activities for students such as the Come out, SAPSASA, Youth Environmental Forum, pancake day, Student Young Leaders Day and school camp. SAPSASA events include football, netball, cricket, tennis, cross country, athletics running events, swimming, diving, golf, hockey and skiing.

==Climate==
Padthaway has a warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb), with very warm, dry summers (with high diurnal temperature variation) and cool, relatively wet winters. Average maxima range from in January to in July and average minima fluctuate between in January and in July. Mean average annual rainfall is , spread between 140.9 precipitation days. Annually, the town only experiences 41.5 clear days, whilst having 110.6 cloudy days. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 23 June 2019 to on 20 December 2019.

<doc id="37588" wikidata="Q1127343" url="?curid=37588" title="Offa's Dyke">
<text>Offa&#x27;s Dyke () is a large linear earthwork that roughly follows the border between England and Wales. The structure is named after Offa, the Anglo-Saxon king of Mercia from AD 757 until 796, who is traditionally believed to have ordered its construction. Although its precise original purpose is debated, it delineated the border between Anglian Mercia and the Welsh kingdom of Powys.

The earthwork, which was up to wide (including its flanking ditch) and high, traversed low ground, hills and rivers. Today it is protected as a scheduled monument. Some of its route is followed by the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path, a long-distance footpath that runs between Liverpool Bay in the north and the Severn Estuary in the south.

Although the Dyke has conventionally been dated to the Early Middle Ages of Anglo-Saxon England, research in recent decades – using techniques such as radioactive carbon dating – has challenged the conventional historiography and theories about the earthwork and shows that part was started in the early 5th century, during the sub-Roman period.

==History==
===Background===


The generally accepted theory of the earthwork attributes most of its construction to Offa, King of Mercia from 757 to 796. The structure did not represent a mutually agreed boundary between the Mercians and the Kingdom of Powys. It had a ditch on the Welsh (western) side, with the displaced soil piled into a bank on the Mercian (eastern) side. This suggests that Mercians constructed it as a defensive earthwork, or to demonstrate the power and intent of their kingdom.

Throughout its entire length, the Dyke provides an uninterrupted view from Mercia into Wales. Where the earthwork encounters hills or high ground, it passes to the west of them.

Although historians often overlook Offa&#x27;s reign because of limitations in source material, he ranks as one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon rulers – as evidenced in his ability to raise the workforce and resources required to construct Offa&#x27;s Dyke. The construction of the earthwork probably involved a &quot;corvée&quot; system requiring vassals to build certain lengths of the earthwork for Offa in addition to performing their normal services to their king. The Tribal Hidage, a primary document, shows the distribution of land within 8th-century Britain; it shows that peoples were located within specified territories for administration.

===Early scholarship===

The first historians and archaeologists to examine the Dyke seriously compared their conclusions with the late 9th-century writer Asser, who wrote: &quot;there was in Mercia in fairly recent time a certain vigorous king called Offa, who terrified all the neighbouring kings and provinces around him, and who had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea&quot;. In 1955, Sir Cyril Fox published the first major survey of the Dyke. He concurred with Asser that the earthwork ran &#x27;from sea to sea&#x27;, theorising that the Dyke ran from the River Dee estuary in the north to the River Wye in the south: approximately . Although Fox observed that Offa&#x27;s Dyke was not a continuous linear structure, he concluded that earthworks were raised in only those areas where natural barriers did not already exist.

Sir Frank Stenton, the UK&#x27;s most eminent 20th-century scholar on Anglo-Saxon England, accepted Fox&#x27;s conclusions. He wrote the introduction to Fox&#x27;s account of the Dyke. Although Fox&#x27;s work has now been revised to some extent, it still remains a vital record of some stretches of Offa&#x27;s Dyke that still existed between 1926 and 1928, when his three field surveys took place, but have since been destroyed.

===Later research ===
In 1978, Dr Frank Noble challenged some of Fox&#x27;s conclusions, stirring up new academic interest in Offa&#x27;s Dyke. His MPhil thesis entitled &quot;Offa&#x27;s Dyke Reviewed&quot; (1978) raised several questions concerning the accepted historiography of Offa&#x27;s Dyke. Noble postulated that the gaps in the Dyke were not due to the incorporation of natural features as defensive barriers, but instead the gaps were a &quot;ridden boundary&quot;, perhaps incorporating palisades, that left no archaeological trace. Noble also helped establish the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Association, which maintains the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path. This long-distance footpath mostly follows the route of the dyke and is a designated British National Trail.

John Davies wrote of Fox&#x27;s study: &quot;In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon, it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.&quot; And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built &quot;on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent&quot;.

Ongoing research and archaeology on Offa&#x27;s Dyke has been undertaken for many years by the Extra-Mural Department of the University of Manchester. Interviews with Dr David Hill, broadcast in episode 1 of &quot;In Search of the Dark Ages&quot; (aired in 1979), show support for Noble&#x27;s idea. Most recently, Hill and Margaret Worthington have undertaken considerable research on the Dyke. Their work, though far from finished, has demonstrated that there is little evidence for the Dyke stretching from sea to sea. Rather, they claim that it is a shorter structure stretching from Rushock Hill north of the Herefordshire Plain to Llanfynydd, near Mold, Flintshire, some 64 miles (103 km). According to Hill and Worthington, dykes in the far north and south may have different dates, and though they may be connected with Offa&#x27;s Dyke, there is as yet no compelling evidence behind this. However, not all experts accept this view.

===Contrary evidence===
&#x27;Ofer&#x27; means &#x27;border&#x27; or &#x27;edge&#x27; in Old English, giving rise to the possibility of alternative derivations for some border features associated with Offa.

The Roman historian Eutropius in his book &quot;Historiae Romanae Breviarium&quot;, written around 369, mentions the Wall of Severus, a structure built by Septimius Severus, who was Roman Emperor between 193 and 211:

&quot;Novissimum bellum in Britannia habuit, utque receptas provincias omni securitate muniret, vallum per CXXXIII passuum milia a mari ad mare deduxit. Decessit Eboraci admodum senex, imperii anno sexto decimo, mense tertio.&quot; 
He had his most recent war in Britain, and to fortify the conquered provinces with all security, he built a wall for 133 miles from sea to sea. He died at York, a reasonably old man, in the sixteenth year and third month of his reign.

This source is conventionally thought to be referring, in error, to either Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, , or the Antonine Wall, , which were both shorter and built in the 2nd century. Recently, some writers have suggested that Eutropius may have been referring to the earthwork later called Offa&#x27;s Dyke. Most archaeologists reject this theory.

The Venerable Bede also mentions the barrier built by Septimus Severus, but Bede says that the rampart was made of earth and timber, a description which would closer match Offa&#x27;s Dyke than Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, though it would describe the Antonine Wall:

After many great and severe battles, (Severus) thought fit to divide that part of the island, which he had recovered, from the other unconquered nations, not with a wall, as some imagine, but with a rampart. For a wall is made of stones, but a rampart, with which camps are fortified to repel the assaults of enemies, is made of sods, cut out of the earth, and raised high above the ground, like a wall, having in front of it the trench whence the sods were taken, with strong stakes of wood fixed above it. Thus Severus drew a great trench and strong rampart, fortified with several towers, from sea to sea. &quot;Bede’s Ecclesiastical History of England, Bk 1-5&quot;
However, the solution to the problem lies a few chapters later in Bede&#x27;s account. In Book One Chapter Twelve of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, he writes that the Romans &quot;built a strong wall of stone directly from sea to sea in a straight line between the towns that had been built as strong-points, where Severus had built his earthwork ... straight from east to west&quot;. The strong wall of stone cannot refer to the Antonine Wall or Offa&#x27;s Dyke, so it clearly refers to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, especially as Offa&#x27;s Dyke runs from north to south. Also, as Severus&#x27;s earthwork is described as being in the same location as Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, it cannot be Offa&#x27;s Dyke either, so the earth rampart with a great trench that Bede refers to must be the Vallum, the adjoining earthen barrier immediately south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Where Bede got it wrong was in attributing the Vallum to Septimius Severus, and saying that it predated the Wall. In fact the Vallum was the work of Hadrian, and slightly post-dated the Wall.

Evidence has also been found that challenges the accepted date of the construction of Offa&#x27;s Dyke. In December 1999, Shropshire County Council archaeologists uncovered the remains of a hearth or fire on the original ground surface beneath Wat&#x27;s Dyke near Oswestry. Carbon dating analysis of the burnt charcoal and burnt clay &quot;in situ&quot; showed it was covered by earth on or around AD 446. Archaeologists concluded that this part of Wat&#x27;s Dyke, so long thought of as Anglo-Saxon and a mid-8th-century contemporary of Offa&#x27;s Dyke, must have been built 300 years earlier in the post-Roman period.

In 2014, excavations by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust focused on nine samples of the Dyke near Chirk. Radiocarbon dating of redeposited turf resulted in a series of dates. In one section, these ranged from AD 430 to AD 652 and in another section from AD 887 to AD 1019: confirming that the bank is clearly post-Roman, and that at least some rebuilding work took place after Offa&#x27;s reign. It has been suggested that Offa&#x27;s Dyke may have been a long-term project by several Mercian kings. Further excavations by Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust on the Dyke at Chirk Castle found well-preserved remains of the ditch under later parkland; radiocarbon samples were recovered, but the results have not yet been made public.

==Current==
The England–Wales border still mostly passes within a few miles of the course of Offa&#x27;s Dyke through the Welsh Marches. A section of the Dyke which overlooks Tintern Abbey and includes the Devil&#x27;s Pulpit near Chepstow is now managed by English Heritage.

===Statutory protection===
All sections of Offa&#x27;s Dyke that survive as visible earthworks, or as infilled but undeveloped ditch, are designated as a scheduled monument. However, some parts of the Dyke may also remain buried under later development. Some sections are also defined as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, including stretches within the Lower Wye Valley SSSI and the Highbury Wood National Nature Reserve. Parts are located within the Wye Valley and Shropshire Hills Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Most of the line of Offa&#x27;s Dyke is designated as a public right of way, including those sections which form part of the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path.

In August 2013, a section of Dyke, between Chirk and Llangollen, was destroyed by a local landowner. The destruction of the Dyke to build a stable was said to be like &quot;driving a road through Stonehenge&quot;, but the perpetrator escaped punishment.

===Candidate World Heritage Site===
In 2010, the Dyke was proposed by the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Association and local authorities for World Heritage Site status. Part of the proposal stated:

The proposal was rejected in 2011.
===The Offa&#x27;s Dyke Centre===
The Offa&#x27;s Dyke Centre is a purpose-built information centre in the town of Knighton, on Offa&#x27;s Dyke on the border between England (Shropshire) and Wales (Powys). Some of the best remains of the earthworks can be seen within a two-minute walk from the centre.

===Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path===

The Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path (Welsh: &quot;Llwybr Clawdd Offa&quot;) is a long-distance footpath close to the England–Wales border. Although large sections are close to the Dyke itself, the Path is longer, and in some places passes at some distance from the earthworks. Opened on 10 July 1971, the Path is one of Britain&#x27;s longest National Trails, stretching for from the Severn estuary at Sedbury, near Chepstow, to Prestatyn on the north Wales coast. There is a visitor centre at Knighton.

==Cultural importance==
The dyke has a cultural significance symbolising the separation between England and Wales: a symbolism similar to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall between England and Scotland in the Scottish Marches. George Borrow, in his &quot;Wild Wales&quot; (1862), drawn from folklore, claimed that:

<doc id="37589" wikidata="Q23159" url="?curid=37589" title="Dorset">
<text>Dorset ( ; archaically: Dorsetshire , ) is a ceremonial county in South West England. It is bordered by Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north and the north-east, Hampshire to the east, the Isle of Wight across the Solent to the south-east, the English Channel to the south, and Devon to the west. The largest settlement is Bournemouth, and the county town is Dorchester.

The county has an area of and a population of 772,268. Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation, which contains three of the county&#x27;s largest settlements: Bournemouth (183,491), Poole (151,500), and Christchurch (31,372). The remainder of the county is largely rural, and its principal towns are Weymouth (53,427) and Dorchester (21,366). Dorset contains two unitary districts: Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) and Dorset. The county did not historically include Bournemouth and Christchurch, which were part of Hampshire.

Dorset has a varied landscape of chalk downs, steep limestone ridges, and low-lying clay valleys. The majority of its coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance, and features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. The north of the county contains part of Cranborne Chase, a chalk downland. The highest point in Dorset is Lewesdon Hill (), in the southwest.

There is evidence of Neolithic, Celtic, and Roman settlement in Dorset, and during the Early Middle Ages the region was settled by the Saxons; the county developed in the 7th century. The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century, and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348. The county has seen much civil unrest: in the English Civil War an uprising of Clubmen vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis; and the Tolpuddle Martyrs, a group of Dorset farm labourers, were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement. During the Second World War, Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy, and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points. Agriculture was historically the major industry of Dorset, but is now in decline in favour of tourism.

==Toponymy==
Dorset derives its name from the county town of Dorchester. The Romans established the settlement in the 1st century and named it Durnovaria which was a Latinised version of a Common Brittonic word possibly meaning &quot;place with fist-sized pebbles&quot;. The Saxons named the town &quot;Dornwaraceaster&quot; (the suffix being the Old English name for a &quot;Roman town&quot;; cf. Exeter and Gloucester) and &quot;Dornsæte&quot; came into use as the name for the inhabitants of the area from &quot;Dorn&quot; (a reduced form of &quot;Dornwaraceaster&quot;) and the Old English word (meaning &quot;people&quot;). The same ending can also be seen in the neighbouring Somerset. It is first mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in AD 845 and in the 10th century the county&#x27;s archaic name, &quot;Dorseteschyre&quot; (Dorsetshire), was first recorded.

==History==
=== Early history ===
The first human visitors to Dorset were Mesolithic hunters, from around 8000 BC. The first permanent Neolithic settlers appeared around 3000 BC and were responsible for the creation of the Dorset Cursus, a monument for ritual or ceremonial purposes. From 2800 BC onwards Bronze Age farmers cleared Dorset&#x27;s woodlands for agricultural use and Dorset&#x27;s high chalk hills provided a location for numerous round barrows. During the Iron Age, the British tribe known as the Durotriges established a series of hill forts across the county—most notably Maiden Castle which is one of the largest in Europe.

The Romans arrived in Dorset during their conquest of Britain in AD 43. Maiden Castle was captured by the Legio II Augusta under the command of Vespasian, and the Roman settlement of Durnovaria was established nearby. Bokerley Dyke, a large defensive ditch built by the county&#x27;s post-Roman inhabitants near the border with modern-day Hampshire, delayed the advance of the Saxons into Dorset for almost 150 years. It appears to have been re-fortified during this period, with the former Roman Road at Ackling Dyke also being blocked by the Britons, apparently to prevent the West Saxon advance into Dorset.

However, by the end of the 7th century Dorset had fallen under Saxon control and been incorporated into the Kingdom of Wessex. The precise details of this West Saxon conquest and how it took place are not clear, but it appears to have substantially taken place by the start of the reign of Caedwalla in 685. The Saxons established a diocese at Sherborne (later to develop into the Diocese of Salisbury) and Dorset was made a shire—an administrative district of Wessex and predecessor to the English county system—with borders that have changed little since. In 789 the first recorded Viking attack on the British Isles took place in Dorset on the Portland coast, and they continued to raid into the county for the next two centuries.

After the Norman Conquest in 1066, feudal rule was established in Dorset and the bulk of the land was divided between the Crown and ecclesiastical institutions. The Normans consolidated their control over the area by constructing castles at Corfe, Wareham and Dorchester in the early part of the 12th century. Over the next 200 years Dorset&#x27;s population grew substantially and additional land was enclosed for farming to provide the extra food required. The wool trade, the quarrying of Purbeck Marble and the busy ports of Weymouth, Melcombe Regis, Lyme Regis and Bridport brought prosperity to the county. However, Dorset was devastated by the bubonic plague in 1348 which arrived in Melcombe Regis on a ship from Gascony. The disease, more commonly known as the Black Death, created an epidemic that spread rapidly and wiped out a third of the population of the country. Dorset came under the political influence of a number of different nobles during the Middle Ages. During the Wars of the Roses, for instance, Dorset came into the area influenced by Humphrey Stafford, earl of Devon (originally of Hooke, Dorset) whose wider influence stretched from Cornwall to Wiltshire. After 1485, one of the most influential Dorset figures was Henry VII&#x27;s chamberlain Giles Daubeney.

=== Modern history ===
The dissolution of the monasteries (1536–1541) met little resistance in Dorset and many of the county&#x27;s abbeys, including Shaftesbury, Cerne and Milton, were sold to private owners. In 1642, at the commencement of the English Civil War, the Royalists took control of the entire county apart from Poole and Lyme Regis. However, within three years their gains had been almost entirely reversed by the Parliamentarians. An uprising of Clubmen—vigilantes weary of the depredations of the war—took place in Dorset in 1645. Some 2,000 of these rebels offered battle to Lord Fairfax&#x27;s Parliamentary army at Hambledon Hill but they were easily routed. Sherborne Castle was taken by Fairfax that same year and in 1646 Corfe Castle, the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Dorset, was captured after an act of betrayal: both were subsequently slighted. The Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to overthrow James II began when he landed at Lyme Regis in 1685. A series of trials known as the Bloody Assizes took place to punish the rebels. Over a five-day period in Dorchester, Judge Jeffreys presided over 312 cases: 74 of the accused were executed, 175 were sentenced to penal transportation, and nine were publicly whipped. In 1686, at Charborough Park, a meeting took place to plot the downfall of James II of England. This meeting was effectively the start of the Glorious Revolution.

During the 18th century, much smuggling took place along the Dorset coast; its coves, caves and sandy beaches provided opportunities for gangs such as the Hawkhursts to stealthily bring smuggled goods ashore. Poole became Dorset&#x27;s busiest port and established prosperous trade links with the fisheries of Newfoundland which supported cloth, rope and net manufacturing industries in the surrounding towns and villages. However, the Industrial Revolution largely bypassed Dorset which lacked coal resources and as a consequence the county remained predominantly agricultural. Farming has always been central to the economy of Dorset and the county became the birthplace of the modern trade union movement when, in 1834, six farm labourers formed a union to protest against falling wages. The labourers, who are now known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs, were subsequently arrested for administering &quot;unlawful oaths&quot; and sentenced to transportation but they were pardoned following massive protests by the working classes.

The Dorsetshire Regiment were the first British unit to face a gas attack during the First World War (1914–1918) and they sustained particularly heavy losses at the Battle of the Somme. In total some 4,500 Dorset servicemen died in the war and of the county&#x27;s towns and villages, only one, Langton Herring, known as a Thankful Village, had no residents killed. During the Second World War (1939–1945) Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy: beach landing exercises were carried out at Studland and Weymouth and the village of Tyneham was requisitioned for army training. Tens of thousands of troops departed Weymouth, Portland and Poole harbours during the D-Day Normandy landings and gliders from RAF Tarrant Rushton dropped troops near Caen to begin Operation Tonga.

Dorset experienced an increase in holiday-makers after the war. First popularised as a tourist destination by George III&#x27;s frequent visits to Weymouth, the county&#x27;s coastline, seaside resorts and its sparsely populated rural areas attract millions of visitors each year. With farming declining across the country, tourism has edged ahead as the primary revenue-earning sector.

==Settlements==
Dorset is largely rural with many small villages, few large towns and no cities. The only major urban area is the South East Dorset conurbation, which is situated at the south-eastern end of the county and is atypical of the county as a whole. It consists of the seaside resort of Bournemouth, the historic port and borough of Poole, the towns of Christchurch and Ferndown plus many surrounding villages. Bournemouth, the most populous town in the conurbation, was established in the Georgian era when sea bathing became popular. Poole, the second largest settlement (once the largest town in the county), adjoins Bournemouth to the west and contains the suburb of Sandbanks which has some of the highest land values by area in the world.

The other two major settlements in the county are Dorchester, which has been the county town since at least 1305, and Weymouth, a major seaside resort since the 18th century. Blandford Forum, Sherborne, Gillingham, Shaftesbury and Sturminster Newton are historic market towns which serve the farms and villages of the Blackmore Vale in north Dorset. Beaminster and Bridport are situated in the west of the county; Verwood and the historic Saxon market towns of Wareham and Wimborne Minster are located to the east. Lyme Regis and Swanage are small coastal towns popular with tourists. Under construction on the western edge of Dorchester is the experimental new town of Poundbury commissioned and co-designed by Charles III when he was Prince of Wales. The suburb, which is expected to be fully completed by 2025, was designed to integrate residential and retail buildings and counter the growth of dormitory towns and car-oriented development.

==Physical geography==

Dorset covers an area of and contains considerable variety in its underlying geology, which is partly responsible for the diversity of landscape. A large percentage (66%) of the county comprises either chalk, clay or mixed sand and gravels. The remainder is less straightforward and includes Portland and Purbeck stone, other limestones, calcareous clays and shales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Draper 136/137&quot;&gt; Draper (pp. 136–137)&lt;/ref&gt; Portland and Purbeck stone are of national importance as a building material and for restoring some of Britain&#x27;s most famous landmarks. Almost every type of rock known from the Early Jurassic to the Eocene epochs can be found in the county.
Dorset has a number of limestone ridges which are mostly covered in either arable fields or calcareous grassland supporting sheep. These limestone areas include a wide band of Cretaceous chalk which crosses the county as a range of hills from north-east to south-west, incorporating Cranborne Chase and the Dorset Downs, and a narrow band running from south-west to south-east, incorporating the Purbeck Hills. Between the chalk hills are large, wide vales and wide flood plains. These vales are dotted with small villages, farms and coppices, and include the Blackmore Vale (Stour valley) and the Frome valley. The Blackmore Vale is composed of older Jurassic deposits, largely clays interspersed with limestones, and has traditionally been a centre for dairy agriculture. South-east Dorset, including the lower Frome valley and around Poole and Bournemouth, comprises younger Eocene deposits, mainly sands and clays of poor agricultural quality. The soils created from these deposits support a heathland habitat which sustains all six native British reptile species. Most of the Dorset heathland has Site of Special Scientific Interest status, with three areas designated as internationally important Ramsar sites. In the far west of the county and along the coast there are frequent changes in rock strata, which appear in a less obviously sequential way compared to the landscapes of the chalk and the heath. In the west this results in a hilly landscape of diverse character that resembles that of neighbouring county Devon. Marshwood Vale, a valley of Lower Lias clay at the western tip of the county, lies to the south of the two highest points in Dorset: Lewesdon Hill at and Pilsdon Pen at .

A former river valley flooded by rising sea levels 6,000 years ago, Poole Harbour is one of the largest natural harbours in the world.
The harbour is very shallow in places and contains a number of islands, notably Brownsea Island, the birthplace of the Scouting movement and one of the few remaining sanctuaries for indigenous red squirrels in England. The harbour, and the chalk and limestone hills of the Isle of Purbeck to the south, lie atop Western Europe&#x27;s largest onshore oil field. The field, operated by Perenco from Wytch Farm, has the world&#x27;s oldest continuously pumping well at Kimmeridge which has been producing oil since the early 1960s.

Dorset&#x27;s diverse geography ensures it has an assortment of rivers, although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills, means most are typically lowland in nature. Much of the county drains into three rivers, the Frome, Piddle and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south-easterly direction. The Frome and Piddle are chalk streams but the Stour, which rises in Wiltshire to the north, has its origins in clay soil. The River Avon, which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire, enters Dorset towards the end of its journey at Christchurch Harbour. The rivers Axe and Yeo, which principally drain the counties of Devon and Somerset respectively, have their sources in the north-west of the county. In the south-west, a number of small rivers run into the sea along the Dorset coastline; most notable of these are the Char, Brit, Bride and Wey.

Most of Dorset&#x27;s coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site, which stretches for between Studland and Exmouth in Devon. This coast documents the entire Mesozoic era, from Triassic to Cretaceous, and is noted for its geological landforms. The Dorset section has yielded important fossils, including Jurassic trees and the first complete Ichthyosaur, discovered near Lyme Regis in 1811 by Mary Anning. The county features some notable coastal landforms, including examples of a cove (Lulworth Cove), a natural arch (Durdle Door) and chalk stacks (Old Harry Rocks). Jutting out into the English Channel at roughly the midpoint of the Dorset coastline is the Isle of Portland, a limestone island that is connected to the mainland by Chesil Beach, a long shingle barrier beach protecting The Fleet, Britain&#x27;s largest tidal lagoon.

The county has one of the highest proportions of conservation areas in England, and two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) cover 53% of the administrative county. It has two heritage coasts totalling , and Sites of Special Scientific Interest covering . The South West Coast Path, a National Trail, begins at South Haven Point at the entrance to Poole Harbour. There are also substantial areas of green belt surrounding the South East Dorset conurbation, filling in the area between this and the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs AONB.

===Climate===

Dorset&#x27;s climate of warm summers and mild winters is partly due to its position on Britain&#x27;s south coast. The third most southerly county in the UK, Dorset is less affected by the more intense Atlantic winds than Cornwall and Devon. Dorset, along with the entire South West England, has higher winter temperatures, average , than the rest of the United Kingdom. However, Dorset maintains higher summer temperatures than Devon and Cornwall, with average highs of . Excluding hills such as the Dorset Downs, the average annual temperature of the county is .

The south coast counties of Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent enjoy more sunshine than anywhere else in the United Kingdom, receiving 1,541–1,885 hours a year. Average annual rainfall varies across the county—southern and eastern coastal areas receive per year; the Dorset Downs receive between per year; less than much of Devon and Cornwall to the west but more than counties to the east.
==Demography==

The 2021 United Kingdom census records Dorset&#x27;s population as 779,775, of which 51.3% live in the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole district.

Dorset&#x27;s population has a high proportion of older people and a lower than average proportion of young people: According to 2013 mid-year estimates, 23.6% are over 65 years of age, higher than the England and Wales average of 17.4%, and 18.6% are less than 17 years old, lower than the England and Wales average of 21.3%. The working age population (females and males between 16 and 64) is lower than England and Wales average, 60% compared to 64%. Data collected between 2010 and 2012 shows that average life expectancy at birth in the county is 85.3 years for females and 81.2 years for males. This compares favourably with the averages for England and Wales of 82.9 and 79.1 years respectively.

More than 33% of the county&#x27;s population possess a level 4 qualification or above, such as a Higher National Diploma, Degree or a Higher Degree; while nearly 6.3% have no qualifications at all. Almost 43.7% are employed in a professional or technical capacity (Standard Occupational Classification 2010, groups 1–3), just over 10.3% are administrators or secretaries (group 4), around 12.8% have a skilled trade (group 5), over 18% are employed at a low-level in the care, leisure, sales or customer relations sector (groups 6 and 7) and 14.8% are operatives or in elementary occupations (groups 8 and 9).

==Politics==

===Local government===

Local government in Dorset consists of two unitary authorities (UA): Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council, which governs the major conurbation comprising the three towns; and Dorset Council which serves the more rural remainder of the county. For the BCP council, voters choose 76 councillors from 33 wards, with ten wards returning three candidates apiece and 23 wards, two. Dorset elects 82 councillors representing six three-councillor wards, 18 two-councillor wards and 28 single-councillor wards - 52 wards in total. In both authorities, elections for the entire council occur every four years.

The two authorities came into existence on 1 April 2019, when Bournemouth and Poole merged with Christchurch, one of six second-tier districts previously governed by Dorset County Council, leaving the other five districts - Weymouth and Portland, West Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck and East Dorset - to form a second UA.
Dorset County Council was first formed in 1888 by an act of government to govern the newly created administrative county of Dorset which had been based largely on the historic county borders. Dorset became a two-tier non-metropolitan county after a reorganisation of local government in 1974 and its border was extended eastwards to incorporate the former Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England, Bournemouth and Poole each became administratively independent single-tier unitary authorities in 1997.

===National representation===

For representation in Parliament Dorset is divided into eight Parliamentary constituencies—five county constituencies and three borough constituencies. At the 2017 general election, the Conservative Party was dominant, taking all eight seats. The borough constituencies of Bournemouth East, Bournemouth West and Poole were traditionally Conservative safe seats and were all represented by Conservative members of parliament until the 2024 United Kingdom general election when they were all gained by Labour. The county constituencies of North Dorset and Christchurch are also represented by Conservative MPs. Between 1997 and 2019, West Dorset was represented by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin who was the Minister of State at the Cabinet Office in David Cameron&#x27;s government. The seat was won by Edward Morello in the 2024.

The marginal seat of South Dorset is represented by Lloyd Hatton, who gained the seat from Conservative representative, Richard Drax, in 2024. The Mid Dorset and North Poole constituency has been represented by the Liberal Democrat MP, Vikki Slade since 2024.

In the 2024 general election, the Conservatives held two constituencies in Dorset, while the Liberal Democrats gained two and Labour gained four.

==Economy and industry==

In 2003 the gross value added (GVA) for the non-metropolitan county was £4,673 million, with an additional £4,705 million for Poole and Bournemouth. The primary sector produced 2.03% of GVA, the secondary sector produced 22.44% and 75.53% came from the tertiary sector. The average GVA for the 16 regions of South West England was £4,693 million.

The principal industry in Dorset was once agriculture. It has not, however, been the largest employer since the mid 19th century as mechanisation substantially reduced the number of workers required. Agriculture has become less profitable and the industry has declined further. Within the administrative county between 1995 and 2003, GVA for primary industry (largely agriculture, fishing and quarrying) declined from £229 million to £188 million—7.1% to 4.0%. In 2007, of the county was in agricultural use, up from in 1989, although this was due to an increase in permanent grass, and land set aside. By contrast, in the same period, arable land decreased from . Excluding fowl, sheep are the most common animal stock in the county; between 1989 and 2006 their numbers fell from 252,189 to 193,500. Cattle and pig farming has declined similarly; during the same period the number of cattle fell from 240,413 to 170,700, and pigs from 169,636 to 72,700.

In 2009 there were 2,340 armed forces personnel stationed in Dorset including the Royal Armoured Corps at Bovington, Royal Signals at Blandford and the Royal Marines at Poole. The military presence has had a mixed effect on the local economy, bringing additional employment for civilians, but on occasion having a negative impact on the tourist trade, particularly when popular areas are closed for military manoeuvres.

Other major employers in the county include: BAE Systems, Sunseeker International, J.P. Morgan, Cobham plc and Bournemouth University. Dorset&#x27;s three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate a substantial amount of international trade and tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset&#x27;s ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this will continue to have a positive effect on local businesses and tourism.

Tourism has grown in Dorset since the late 18th century and is now the predominant industry. It is estimated that 37,500 people work in Dorset&#x27;s tourism sector. Some 3.2 million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6 million day visitors. The combined spending of both groups was £1,458 million. Towns received 56% of Dorset&#x27;s day trippers, 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was the attractiveness of the county&#x27;s coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.

Manufacturing industry in Dorset provided 10.3% of employment in 2008. This was slightly above the average for Great Britain but below that of the South West region which was at 10.7% for that period. The sector is the county&#x27;s fourth largest employer, but a predicted decline suggests there will be 10,200 fewer jobs in manufacturing by 2026.

==Culture==
As a largely rural county, Dorset has fewer major cultural institutions than larger or more densely populated areas. Major venues for concerts and theatre include the Lighthouse arts centre in Poole; the Bournemouth International Centre, Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy in Bournemouth; and the Pavilion theatre in Weymouth. The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1893, is based in Poole.

Dorset has more than 30 general and specialist museums. The Dorset County Museum (now the Dorset Museum) in Dorchester was founded in 1846 and contains an extensive collection of exhibits covering the county&#x27;s history and environment. The Tank Museum at Bovington contains more than 300 tanks and armoured vehicles from 30 nations. The museum is the largest in Dorset and its collection has been designated of national importance. Other museums which reflect the cultural heritage of the county include The Keep Military Museum in Dorchester, the Russell-Cotes Museum in Bournemouth, the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre, Poole Museum, Portland Museum and Wareham Town Museum.

Dorset contains 190 conservation areas, more than 1,500 scheduled monuments, over 30 registered parks and gardens and 12,850 listed buildings. Grade I listed buildings include: Portland Castle, a coastal fort commissioned by Henry VIII; a castle with more than a 1,000 years of history at Corfe; a Roman ruin described by Historic England as the &quot;only Roman town house visible in Britain&quot;; Athelhampton, a Tudor manor house; Forde Abbey, a stately home and former Cistercian monastery; Christchurch Priory, the longest church in England; and St Edwold&#x27;s church, one of the smallest.
Dorset hosts a number of annual festivals, fairs and events including the Great Dorset Steam Fair near Blandford, one of the largest events of its kind in Europe, and the Bournemouth Air Festival, a free air show that attracted 1.3 million visitors in 2009. The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland. Launched in 2008, the festival features sporting activities, cultural events and local entertainers. The Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1841, is a celebration of Dorset&#x27;s agriculture. The two-day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55,000 people. Inside Out Dorset is an outdoor arts festival that takes place every two years in rural and urban locations across Dorset. In addition to the smaller folk festivals held in towns such as Christchurch and Wimborne, Dorset holds several larger musical events such as Camp Bestival, End of the Road and the Larmer Tree Festival.

Dorset&#x27;s only professional football club is AFC Bournemouth, which plays in the Premier League—the highest division in the English football league system. Non-League semi-professional teams in the county include Southern Premier Division teams Dorchester Town F.C., Poole Town F.C. and Weymouth F.C. Dorset County Cricket Club competes in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship and is based at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth. Poole Stadium hosts regular greyhound racing and is the home to top-flight speedway team Poole Pirates. The county&#x27;s coastline, on the English Channel, is noted for its watersports (particularly sailing, gig racing, windsurfing, power boating and kayaking) which take advantage of the sheltered waters in the bays of Weymouth and Poole, and the harbours of Poole and Portland. Dorset hosted the sailing events at the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics at the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy. The venue was completed in May 2009 and was used by international sailing teams in preparation for the Games. In motorsport, Dorset hosts the Extreme E Jurassic X Prix at Bovington Camp.
Dorset is famed in literature for being the native county of author and poet Thomas Hardy, and many of the places he describes in his novels in the fictional Wessex are in Dorset, which he renamed &quot;South Wessex&quot;. The National Trust owns Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Cottage, in Higher Bockhampton, east of Dorchester; and Max Gate, his former house in Dorchester. Several other writers have called Dorset home, including Douglas Adams, who wrote much of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; while he lived in Stalbridge; John le Carré, author of espionage novels, was born in Poole; Tom Sharpe of &quot;Wilt&quot; fame lived in Bridport; John Fowles (&quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;) lived in Lyme Regis before he died in late 2005; T.F. Powys lived in Chaldon Herring for over 20 years and used it as inspiration for the fictitious village of Folly Down in his novel &quot;Mr. Weston&#x27;s Good Wine&quot;; John Cowper Powys, his elder brother, also set a number of his works in Dorset, such as the novels &quot;Maiden Castle&quot; and &quot;Weymouth Sands&quot;. Children&#x27;s author Enid Blyton drew inspiration for many of her works from Dorset. The 19th-century poet William Barnes was born in Bagber and wrote many poems in his native Dorset dialect. Originating from the ancient Norse and Saxon languages, the dialect was prevalent across the Blackmore Vale but has fallen into disuse.

Dorset&#x27;s flag, which is known as the Dorset Cross or St Wite&#x27;s Cross, was adopted in 2008 following a public competition organised by Dorset County Council. The winning design, which features a white cross with a red border on a golden background, attracted 54% of the vote. All three colours are used in Dorset County Council&#x27;s coat of arms and the red and white was used in recognition of the English flag. The golden colour represents Dorset&#x27;s sandy beaches and the Dorset landmarks of Golden Cap and Gold Hill. It is also a reference to the Wessex Dragon, a symbol of the Saxon Kingdom which Dorset once belonged to, and the gold wreath featured on the badge of the Dorset Regiment.

==Transport==

Dorset is connected to London by two main line railways. The West of England Main Line runs through the north of the county at Gillingham and Sherborne. Running west from London Waterloo to Exeter St Davids in Devon, it provides a service for those who live in the western districts of Dorset. The South West Main Line runs through the south at Bournemouth, Poole, Dorchester and the terminus at Weymouth. Additionally, the Heart of Wessex Line runs north from Weymouth to Bristol and the Swanage Railway, a heritage steam and diesel railway, runs the between Norden and Swanage.

Dorset is one of few English counties not well served by canals and has no motorways. The A303, A35 and A31 trunk roads run through the county. The A303, which connects the West Country to London via the M3, clips the north-west of the county. The A35 crosses the county in a west–east direction from Honiton in Devon, via Bridport, Dorchester, Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch, to Southampton in Hampshire. The A31 connects to the A35 at Bere Regis, and passes east through Wimborne and Ferndown to Hampshire, where it later becomes the M27. Other main roads in the county include the A338, A354, A37 and A350. The A338 heads north from Bournemouth to Ringwood (Hampshire) and on to Salisbury (Wiltshire) and beyond. The A354 also connects to Salisbury after travelling north-east from Weymouth in the south of the county. The A37 travels north-west from Dorchester to Yeovil in Somerset. The A350 also leads north, from Poole through Blandford and Shaftesbury, to Warminster in Wiltshire.

A passenger seaport and an international airport are situated in the county. Brittany Ferries and Condor Ferries operate out of Poole Harbour; Brittany Ferries provide access to Cherbourg in France and Condor Ferries sail a seasonal service to the Channel Islands and St Malo, France. Poole and Portland harbours are capable of taking cruise liners. Bournemouth Airport, on the edge of Hurn village north of Bournemouth, has scheduled and charter flights.

Morebus and Damory provide a county wide bus network with frequent services linking major towns, including Bournemouth, Poole and Wimborne, and a varied service in further rural locations. The First Group operate buses in the Weymouth and Bridport area, including a regular route along the A35 from Weymouth to Axminster, which helps to compensate for the missing rail link west of Dorchester; and the Jurassic Coaster service, which runs along the county&#x27;s coastline. Yellow Buses provided bus services within Bournemouth and outlying areas until they ceased operating in 2022.

==Religious sites==
Unlike all of its neighbouring counties, Dorset does not have a cathedral. Over 95% of the county falls within the Church of England Diocese of Salisbury. A small section to the west comes under the Diocese of Bath and Wells and to the east Christchurch and much of Bournemouth—both historically part of Hampshire—belong to the Diocese of Winchester. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth incorporates most of Dorset with the exception of Christchurch and a portion of Bournemouth which belongs to the Diocese of Portsmouth. Few purpose-built places of worship exist in Dorset for faiths other than Christianity. In 2008 a Hindu temple was constructed in Blandford Forum for the Gurkhas based at the town&#x27;s military camp. Bournemouth, which contains a higher proportion of Jewish residents than the national average, has three synagogues and an Islamic Centre and a mosque for Muslims.

Christianity was introduced to Dorset by the Romans. A 4th century Roman mosaic discovered near Hinton St Mary contains what is generally accepted to be an image of Christ. Christianity became firmly established in the county during the Saxon period although there are few surviving Saxon churches; the most complete is St. Martin&#x27;s in Wareham which has features from the early 11th century. Mediaeval churches are more prevalent in Dorset; most are 15th century and are of a Perpendicular style. Sherborne Abbey, one of the county&#x27;s largest, is noted for its broad fan vaulting added during an extensive 15th century rebuild. Founded in AD 705 by Aldhelm, the Abbey contained the chair of the Bishop of Sherborne and was granted cathedral status until 1075 when the diocese was transferred to Old Sarum. Wimborne Minster features a chained library and a 14th-century astronomical clock; Christchurch Priory is renowned for its miraculous beam which, according to legend, was installed by Christ; and the 15th century roof spanning the nave at St John the Baptist Church in Bere Regis is described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as the &quot;finest timber roof of Dorset&quot;. Saint Wite&#x27;s shrine is located in the north transept of St Candida and Holy Cross at Whitchurch Canonicorum. It is the only church in the country, besides Westminster Abbey, to have a shrine that contains the relics of a saint. 

Monastic foundations were once abundant in Dorset, but all ceased to exist at the Dissolution of the monasteries. The Reformation and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until the turn of the 18th century. Notable examples of Early Georgian churches include the Bastard brothers&#x27; Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Blandford Forum, and St George&#x27;s Church on the Isle of Portland, which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of Christopher Wren. From the late 18th century onwards, churches in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style. A notable exception to this trend, however, is the Church of St Mary in East Lulworth—the first freestanding Roman Catholic church built in England after the Reformation. George III gave permission to erect the building on the condition that it resembled a garden mausoleum rather than a church. It was completed in 1789. Bournemouth, founded in 1810, has a wealth of 19th-century churches including St Peter&#x27;s and St Stephen&#x27;s. St Dunstan&#x27;s (formerly St Osmund&#x27;s) in Poole is one of a small number of 20th-century churches in Dorset. The final major work of Edward Schroeder Prior, it is one of the last examples of the Neo Byzantine style. The Church of St Nicholas and St Magnus in Moreton is noted for its elaborate engraved glass windows designed by Laurence Whistler. Severely damaged by a stray German bomb in 1940, the church subsequently underwent extensive renovation and Whistler had replaced every window by 1984.

==Education==

Responsibility for state schools in Dorset is divided between two local education authorities: Dorset Council, which covers the majority of the county, and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council. Most of the Dorset Council area operates a two-tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend a primary school before completing their education at secondary school but Corfe Mullen, Dorchester, Ferndown and West Moors maintain a three-tier system (first, middle and high school). Bournemouth operates a two-tier system; Poole operates two and three-tier systems. BCP is one of the few local authorities in England to maintain selective education, containing four single-sex grammar schools which select pupils on the basis of an eleven-plus examination. Some of the county&#x27;s schools are academies—self-governing state schools which have become independent of their local education authority and are maintained directly by the Department for Education. In 2017, the Progress 8 score for schools in the Dorset Council area was ranked below average, and 39.6% of pupils gained at least Grade 5 or above in English and maths GCSEs matching the national average of 39.6%. Poole recorded an above average Progress 8 score and 54% of pupils achieved Grade 5 or above in English and maths GCSEs. Bournemouth was ranked as average and 47.8% of pupils achieved Grade 5 or above in English and maths GCSEs.

Dorset contains a range of privately funded independent schools. Many are boarding schools which also take day pupils, such as the co-educational Canford School which is built around a 19th-century Grade I listed manor house; and Sherborne School, a boys&#x27; school founded in the 16th century.

Four of the county&#x27;s five largest towns contain a further education college: Weymouth College, Kingston Maurward College in Dorchester and Bournemouth and Poole College which is one of the largest in the UK. Dorset has two higher education establishments situated in the heart of the county&#x27;s south east conurbation. Bournemouth University has facilities across Bournemouth and Poole and over 17,000 students. Previously named Bournemouth Polytechnic, it was granted university status as a result of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The Arts University Bournemouth is situated between the border of Poole and Bournemouth. It became a higher education institute in 2001 and was given degree-awarding powers in 2008. It was granted full university status in 2012.

<doc id="37591" wikidata="Q207310" url="?curid=37591" title="Cabernet Sauvignon">
<text>Cabernet Sauvignon () is one of the world&#x27;s most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Australia and British Columbia, Canada to Lebanon&#x27;s Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines, where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France and Spain, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California&#x27;s Napa Valley, New Zealand&#x27;s Hawke&#x27;s Bay, South Africa&#x27;s Stellenbosch region, Australia&#x27;s Margaret River, McLaren Vale and Coonawarra regions, and Chile&#x27;s Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world&#x27;s most widely planted premium red-wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.
However, by 2015, Cabernet Sauvignon had once again become the most widely planted wine grape, with a total of under vine worldwide.

Despite its prominence in the industry, the grape is a relatively new variety, the product of a chance crossing between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc during the 17th century in southwestern France. Its popularity is often attributed to its ease of cultivation—the grapes have thick skins and the vines are hardy and naturally low yielding, budding late to avoid frost and resistant to viticulture hazards such as rot and insects—and to its consistent presentation of structure and flavours which express the typical character (&quot;typicity&quot;) of the variety. Familiarity has helped sell Cabernet Sauvignon wines to consumers, even from unfamiliar wine regions. Its widespread popularity has also contributed to criticism of the grape as a &quot;colonizer&quot; that takes over wine regions at the expense of indigenous grape varieties.

The classic profile of Cabernet Sauvignon tends to be full-bodied wines with high tannins and noticeable acidity that contributes to the wine&#x27;s aging potential. In cooler climates, Cabernet Sauvignon produces wines with black-currant notes that can be accompanied by green bell pepper notes, mint and cedar, which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. In more moderate climates, the black currant notes are often seen with black cherry and black olive notes, while in very hot climates, the currant flavours can veer towards the over-ripe and &quot;jammy&quot; side. In parts of Australia, particularly the Coonawarra wine region of South Australia, Cabernet Sauvignon wines tend to have characteristic eucalyptus or menthol notes.

==History and origins==

For many years, the origin of Cabernet Sauvignon was not clearly understood, and many myths and conjectures surrounded it. Until recently, the grape was rumoured to have ancient origins, perhaps even being the &quot;Biturica&quot; grape used to make ancient Roman wine and referenced by Pliny the Elder. This belief was widely held in the 18th century, when the grape was also known as &quot;Petite Vidure&quot; or &quot;Bidure&quot;, apparently a corruption of &quot;Biturica&quot;. There was also a belief that &quot;Vidure&quot; was a reference to the hardwood (French &quot;vigne dure&quot;) of the vine, with a possible relationship to Carménère which was once known as &quot;Grand Vidure&quot;. Another theory was that the grapevine originated in the Rioja region of Spain.

While the period when the name &quot;Cabernet Sauvignon&quot; became more prevalent over &quot;Petite Vidure&quot; is not certain, records indicate that the grape was a popular Bordeaux planting in the 18th century Médoc region. The first estates known to have actively grown the variety (and the likely source of Cabernet vines for other estates) were Château Mouton and Château d&#x27;Armailhac in Pauillac.

The grape&#x27;s true origins were discovered in 1996 with the use of DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology by a team led by Carole Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring of Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Before this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes&#x27; names and the fact that Cabernet Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes—such as the blackcurrant and pencil box aromas of Cabernet franc and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc. In 2016, scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.
===Offspring and White Cabernet===
While not as prolific in mutating as Pinot noir, nor as widely used in the production of offspring, Cabernet Sauvignon has been linked to other grape varieties. In 1961, a cross of Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache produced the French wine grape Marselan. Cygne blanc is a white-berried seedling of Cabernet Sauvignon that was discovered in 1989 growing in a garden in Swan Valley, Western Australia. Cabernet blanc is a crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and an unknown hybrid grape variety that was discovered in Switzerland in the late 20th century.

In 1977 a vine producing &#x27;bronze&#x27; grapes was found in the vineyards of Cleggett Wines in Australia. They propagated this mutant, registered it under the name of Malian, and sold pale red wines under that name. In 1991 one of the Bronze Cabernet vines started producing white grapes. Cleggett registered this &quot;White Cabernet&quot; under the name of Shalistin. Compared to its Cabernet parent, Malian appears to lack anthocyanins in the subepidermal cells but retains them in the epidermis, whereas Shalistin has no anthocyanins in either layer. The team that went on to discover the VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2 genes that control grape colour have suggested that a gene involved in anthocyanin production has been deleted in the subepidermis of Malian, and then subepidermal cells invaded the epidermis to produce Shalistin.

During a series of trials between 1924 and 1930, the pollen of Cabernet Sauvignon was used to fertilize Glera vines (the white wine grape used to make the sparkling wine Prosecco) to create the red Italian wine grape Incrocio Manzoni 2.15.

In 1972, the Australian agency CSIRO crossed Cabernet Sauvignon grapes with the Spanish Sumoll variety to create three new varieties: Cienna, Tyrian and Rubienne.

In 1983, Cabernet Sauvignon was crossed with the white German wine grape Bronner to create the white wine grape Souvignier gris.

==Viticulture==

While Cabernet Sauvignon can grow in a variety of climates, its suitability as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine is one of the last major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc), and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, the climate will be more important than the soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.

The Cabernet grape variety has thrived in a variety of vineyard soil types, making the consideration of soil less of a concern, particularly for New World winemakers. In Bordeaux, the soil aspect of &quot;terroir&quot; was historically an important consideration in determining which of the major Bordeaux grape varieties were planted. While Merlot seemed to thrive in clay- and limestone-based soils (such as those of the Right Bank regions of the Gironde estuary), Cabernet Sauvignon seemed to perform better in the gravel-based soil of the Médoc region on the Left Bank. The gravel soils offered the benefit of being well drained while absorbing and radiating heat to the vines, aiding ripening. Clay- and limestone-based soils are often cooler, allowing less heat to reach the vines, and delaying ripening. In regions where the climate is warmer, there is more emphasis on soil that is less fertile, which promotes less vigour in the vine, which can keep yields low. In the Napa Valley wine regions of Oakville and Rutherford, the soil is more alluvial and dusty. Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon has been often quoted as giving a sense of &quot;terroir&quot; with a taste of &quot;Rutherford dust&quot;. In the South Australian wine region of Coonawarra, Cabernet Sauvignon has produced vastly different results from grape vines planted in the region&#x27;s terra rosa soil – so much so that the red soil is considered the &quot;boundary&quot; of the wine region, with some controversy from wine growers with Cabernet Sauvignon, planted on red soil.

In addition to ripeness levels, the harvest yields can also have a strong influence on the resulting quality and flavours of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavours more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality-conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after &quot;veraison&quot;.

In general, Cabernet Sauvignon has good resistance to most grape diseases, powdery mildew being the most noted exception. It is, however, susceptible to the vine diseases &quot;Eutypella scoparia&quot; and excoriose.

===The &quot;green bell pepper&quot; flavor===

A couple of noted Cabernet Sauvignon flavours are intimately tied to viticultural and climate influences. The herbaceous or green bell pepper flavour is most widely recognised, caused by pyrazines, which are more prevalent in under-ripened grapes. Pyrazine compounds are present in all Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and are gradually destroyed by sunlight as the grape continues to ripen. To the human palate, this compound is detectable in wines with pyrazine levels as low as 2 nanograms (ng) per litre. At the time of &quot;veraison&quot;, when the grapes first start to ripen fully, there is the equivalent pyrazine level of 30 ng/L. In cooler climates, getting Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to ripen fully to the point where pyrazine is not detected is difficult. The green bell pepper flavour is not considered a wine fault, but it may not be desirable to all consumers&#x27; tastes. The California wine region of Monterey was noted in the late 20th century for its very vegetal Cabernet Sauvignon with pronounced green pepper flavour, earning the nickname &quot;Monterey veggies&quot;. In addition to its cool climate, Monterey is also prone to being very windy, which can shut down the grape vines and further inhibit ripeness.

Two other well-known Cabernet Sauvignon flavours are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavours are often associated with wine regions that are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia&#x27;s Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. Some believe that soil could also contribute to the minty notes since the flavour also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from the similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavours tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California&#x27;s Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavour in the wine.

==Winemaking==

In many aspects, Cabernet Sauvignon can reflect the desires and personality of the winemaker while still presenting familiar flavours that express the typical character of the variety. The most pronounced effects are from the use of oak during production. Typically the first winemaking decision is whether or not to produce a varietal or blended wine. The &quot;Bordeaux blend&quot; of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet franc, with potentially some Malbec, Petit Verdot or Carménère, is the classic example of blended Cabernet Sauvignon, emulated in the United States with wines produced under the &quot;Meritage&quot; designation. But Cabernet Sauvignon can be blended with a variety of grapes such as Shiraz, Tempranillo and Sangiovese. The decision to blend is then followed by the decision of when to do the blending—before, during or after fermentation. Due to the different fermentation styles of the grapes, many producers will ferment and age each grape variety separately and blend the wine shortly before bottling.

The Cabernet Sauvignon grape itself is very small, with a thick skin, creating a high 1:12 ratio of seed (pip) to fruit (pulp). From these elements, the high proportions of phenols and tannins can have a stark influence on the structure and flavour of the wine—especially if the must is subjected to long periods of maceration (skin contact) before fermentation. In Bordeaux, the maceration period was traditionally three weeks, which gave the winemaking staff enough time to close down the estate after harvest to take a hunting holiday. These long maceration periods result in very tannic and flavorful wines that require years of ageing. Wine producers wishing to make a wine more approachable within a couple of years will drastically reduce the maceration time to as little as a few days. Following maceration, the Cabernet must be fermented at high temperatures of up to 30 °C (86 °F). The fermentation temperature will play a role in the result, with deeper colours and more flavour components being extracted at higher temperatures while more fruit flavours are maintained at a lower temperature. In Australia, there has been experimentation with carbonic maceration to make softer, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon wines.

The tannic nature of Cabernet Sauvignon is an important winemaking consideration. As the must is exposed to prolonged maceration periods, more tannins are extracted from the skin and will be present in the resulting wine. If winemakers choose not to shorten the period of maceration in favour of maximizing colour and flavour concentrations, there are some methods that they can use to soften tannin levels. A common method is oak ageing, which exposes the wine to gradual levels of oxidation that can mellow the harsh grape tannins as well as introduce softer &quot;wood tannins&quot;. The choice of fining agents can also reduce tannins with gelatin and egg whites being positively-charged proteins that are naturally attracted to the negatively charged tannin molecules. These fining agents will bond with some of the tannins and be removed from the wine during filtration. One additional method is micro-oxygenation, which mimics some of the gradual aeration that occurs with barrel ageing, with the limited exposure to oxygen aiding in the polymerization of the tannins into larger molecules, which are perceived on the palate as being softer.

===Affinity for oak===

One of the most noted traits of Cabernet Sauvignon is its affinity for oak, either during fermentation or in barrel aging. In addition to having a softening effect on the grape&#x27;s naturally high tannins, the unique wood flavours of vanilla and baking spice complement the natural grape flavours of blackcurrant and tobacco. The particular success of Cabernet-based Bordeaux blends in the 225 litres (59 gallons) &quot;barrique&quot; significantly influenced that barrel size one of the most popular worldwide. In winemaking, the decision for the degree of oak influence (as well as which type of oak) will strongly impact the resulting wine. American oak, particularly from new barrels, imparts more robust oak flavours less subtle than those imparted by French oak. Even within the American oak family, the location of the oak source also plays a role, with oak from the state of Oregon having a more pronounced influence on Cabernet Sauvignon than oak from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Winemakers often use a variety of oak barrels from different locations and of different ages and blend the wine as if they are blending different grape varieties.

Winemakers can also control the influence of oak by using alternatives to the standard &quot;barrique&quot; barrels. Larger barrels have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and, therefore, less pronounced oak flavours. Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use barrels made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is &quot;tea bagging&quot; with oak chips or adding oak planks to the wines while fermenting or ageing it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less costly than oak barrels, they create more pronounced oak flavours, which tend not to mellow or integrate with the rest of the wine&#x27;s components, nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel ageing.

==Wine regions==

===Bordeaux===

The Bordeaux wine region is intimately connected with Cabernet Sauvignon, even though wine is rarely made without the blended component of other grape varieties. It is the likely place of origin of the vine, and producers across the globe have invested heavily in trying to reproduce the structure and complexity of Bordeaux wines. While the &quot;Bordeaux blend&quot; of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot created the earliest examples of acclaimed Cabernet Sauvignon wine, Cabernet Sauvignon was first blended in Bordeaux with Syrah (from the Northern Rhone), a pairing that is widely seen in Australia and some &quot;vin de pays&quot; wines from the Languedoc.

The decision to first start blending Cabernet Sauvignon was partly derived from financial necessity. The sometimes temperamental and unpredictable climate of Bordeaux during the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; did not guarantee a successful harvest every year; producers had to insure themselves against the risk of losing an entire vintage by planting a variety of grapes. Over time it was discovered that the unique characteristics of each grape variety could complement each other and enhance the quality of the wine. Cabernet Sauvignon added structure, acidity, tannins and aging potential as a base or backbone of the wine. By itself, particularly when harvested at less than ideal ripeness, it can lack a sense of fruit or &quot;fleshiness&quot; on the palate which can be compensated by adding the rounder flavours of Merlot. Cabernet franc can add more aromas to the bouquet and more fruitiness. In the lighter soils of the Margaux region, Cabernet-based wines can lack colour, which can be achieved by blending in Petit Verdot. Malbec, used today mostly in Fronsac, can add other fruit and floral aromas.

DNA evidence has shown Cabernet Sauvignon is the result of crossing two other Bordeaux grape varieties— Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc— which has led grapevine historians, or &quot;ampelographers&quot;, to believe that the grape originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that the grape was widespread in the Médoc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of the grape provided an excellent resistance to rot in the sometimes wet maritime climate of Bordeaux. The grape continued to grow in popularity until the &quot;Powdery mildew&quot; epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon&#x27;s sensitivity to that grape disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted grape in Bordeaux. As the region&#x27;s winemakers started to understand better the area&#x27;s &quot;terroir&quot; and how the different grape varieties performed in other regions, Cabernet Sauvignon increased in plantings all along the Left Bank region of the Gironde river in the Médoc as well as Graves region, where it became the dominant variety in the wine blends. In the Right bank regions of Saint-Émilion and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot &amp; Cabernet franc.

In the wine regions of the Left Bank, the Cabernet influence of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Estèphe and Pessac-Léognan, the grape develops more mineral flavours. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavours while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavours, though in less intense wines overall. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on &quot;terroir&quot; and the winemakers&#x27; styles as well as the vintage. The First Growth estates of Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentages of Cabernet— often around 75%.

A common factor affecting Bordeaux wines&#x27; flavours is Cabernet Sauvignon&#x27;s harvest yields. Throughout Bordeaux, there is a legal maximum permitted yield of 50 hectoliters (hl) per hectare (ha). With the aid of global warming and vigorous rootstocks, many Bordeaux vineyards can easily surpass 60 hl/ha, with some estates taking advantage of the legal loophole of &quot;plafond limite de classement&quot; (&quot;ceiling limit classification&quot;) that permits higher yields during &quot;exceptional&quot; years. This has had an adverse effect on the quality of production from some producers who regularly use grapes harvested at excessive yields. In recent years there has been more of an emphasis on keeping yields low, particularly for an estate&#x27;s &quot;Grand vin&quot;.

====Other French regions====
The Bordeaux wine region accounts for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon wines are generally lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make rosé wine. In some regions, it is used to add flavour and structure to Carignan while it is blended with Négrette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid-19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in Hérault, with Rhône grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the &quot;vin de pays&quot; of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how Cabernet Sauvignon is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can seem like they are from the New World. Overall, the grape has not exerted its dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers, who give serious consideration to Cabernet Sauvignon, generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.

===Italy===

Cabernet Sauvignon has a long history in Italian wines, being first introduced to the Piedmont region in 1820. In the mid-1970s, the grape earned notoriety and controversy as a component in the so-called &quot;Super Tuscan&quot; wines of Tuscany. Today the grape is permitted in several &quot;Denominazioni di origine controllata&quot; (DOCs) and is used in many &quot;Indicazione Geografica Tipica&quot; (IGT) wines that are made outside DOC perimeters in certain regions. For most of its history, the grape has been viewed with suspicion as a &quot;foreign influence&quot; that distracts from the native grape varieties. After decades of experimentation, the general view of Cabernet Sauvignon has improved as more winemakers find ways to complement their native grape varieties with Cabernet as a blending component.
In Piedmont, the grape was sometimes used as an &quot;illegal&quot; blending partner with Nebbiolo for DOC classified Barolo with the intention of adding colour and more fruit flavours. In the DOCs of Langhe and Monferrato, Cabernet is a permitted blending grape with Nebbiolo as well as Barbera. Wines composed of all three grape varieties are often subjected to considerable oak treatment to add a sense of sweet spiciness to compensate for the high tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon and Nebbiolo, the high acidity of Barbera. There are varietal styles of Cabernet Sauvignon produced in Piedmont, with qualities varying depending on the location. In other regions of northern Italy, such as Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the grape is often blended with Merlot to produce Bordeaux style blends. In the Veneto region, Cabernet Sauvignon is sometimes blended with the main grapes of Valpolicella-Corvina, Molinara and Rondinella. In southern Italy, the grape is mostly used as a blending component with local varieties-such as Carignan in Sardinia, Nero d&#x27;Avola in Sicily, Aglianico in Campania and Gaglioppo in Calabria.

Cabernet Sauvignon has had a controversial history in Tuscan wine, particularly for its role in the arrival of &quot;Super Tuscan&quot; in the mid-1970s. The origin of Super Tuscans is rooted in the restrictive DOC practices of the Chianti zone before the 1990s. During this time, Chianti could be composed of no more than 70% Sangiovese and had to include at least 10% of one of the local white wine grapes. Many Tuscan wine producers thought they could produce better quality wine if they were not hindered by the DOC regulations, particularly if they had the freedom to use Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend and were not required to use white grape varieties. The marchese Piero Antinori was one of the first to create a &quot;Chianti-style&quot; wine that ignored the DOC regulations, releasing a 1971 Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon blend known as &quot;Tignanello&quot; in 1978. Other producers followed suit, and soon the prices for these Super Tuscans were consistently beating the prices of some of the most well-known Chianti. Other Tuscan wine regions followed suit, blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and even making varietal versions of the grape. Gradually the DOC system caught on and began allowing more regions to use the grape in their DOC-designated wines. Cabernet Sauvignon in Tuscany is characterized by ripe black cherry flavours that can give a perception of sweetness as well as strong notes of blackcurrant. The wines typically reach an alcohol level around 14% but can still maintain notable acidity levels. Cabernet Sauvignon can dominate the blend when blended with Sangiovese in significant quantities, with most Tuscan producers aiming to find a particular balance that suits their desired style.

===Other Old World producers===

The introduction of Cabernet Sauvignon to Spain occurred in the Rioja region when the Marqués de Riscal planted cuttings from Bordeaux in the nineteenth century. It was not until the 1960s, however, before cultivation took off. By 2015, it was the sixth most widely planted red wine grape in Spain. Today it is permitted in about half of the Spanish DOPs (&quot;Denominación de Origen Protegida&quot;). The grape is most prominent in the Catalan wine region of Penedès, where its use was revived by the estates of Bodegas Torres and Jean León. There the grape is often blended with Tempranillo. It is also primarily a blending grape in the Ribera del Duero, but producers in Navarra have found some international acclaim for their varietal wines.

In the United Kingdom, English wine producers have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which can create a greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less-than-ideal climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favour of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country&#x27;s wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape performs a similar function for many countries in Central Europe, including Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Eastern Europe, including Moldova, Romania, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria and Ukraine. It can be found in the eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.

===California===

In California, Cabernet Sauvignon has developed its characteristic style and reputation, which is recognizable in the world&#x27;s market. Production and plantings of the grape in California are similar in quantity to those of Bordeaux. The 1976 Judgment of Paris wine tasting event helped to catapult Californian Cabernet Sauvignons onto the international stage when Stag&#x27;s Leap Wine Cellars&#x27; 1973 Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon beat out classified Bordeaux estates like Château Mouton Rothschild, Château Montrose, Château Haut-Brion and Château Léoville-Las Cases in a blind tasting conducted by French wine experts. In the 1980s, a new epidemic of phylloxera hit California, devastating many vineyards, which needed replanting. There was some speculation that ravaged Cabernet vineyards would be replanted with other varietals (such as those emerging from the Rhone Rangers movement), but in fact, California plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon doubled between 1988 and 1998; many wine regions— such as Napa Valley north of Yountville and Sonoma&#x27;s Alexander Valley— were almost entirely dominated by the grape variety. It also started to gain a foothold in Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma Mountain and Mendocino County. Cabernet from Sonoma County has shown a tendency to feature anise and black olive notes while Napa County Cabernets are characterized by their strong black fruit flavours.

In California, the main stylistic difference in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain vineyards and those on flatter terrains like valley floors or some areas of the Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils, which produce smaller berries with more intense flavours, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of ageing to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to be characterized by deep inky colours and strong berry aromas. Throughout California, many wine regions have the potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to full ripeness and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.
The use of oak in California Cabernet has a long history, with many producers favouring the use of new oak barrels heavily composed of American oak. After the early 1980s&#x27; unsuccessful trend to create more &quot;food friendly&quot; wines with less ripeness and less oak influence, winemakers&#x27; focus shifted back to oak influence. Still, producers were more inclined to limit and lighten the use of oak barrels, with many turning to French oak or a combination of new and older oak barrels.

===Washington State===

According to the Washington State Wine Commission, Cabernet Sauvignon is the most widely planted red grape variety in Washington state. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley and parts of the Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.

====Elsewhere in the United States====
In Oregon, there are small quantities of Cabernet Sauvignon planted in the warmer southern regions of the Umpqua and Rogue Valleys.

It has also started to develop a presence in the Arizona, New York, Ohio, Texas and Virginia wine industries, particularly in the Texas Hill Country and North Fork of Long Island AVAs. Cabernet Sauvignon is made in varietal and blended styles throughout the United States. Under the American system, varietal Cabernet Sauvignon can include up to 25% other grapes.

===South America===

Cabernet Sauvignon is grown in nearly every South American country, including Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically limited by the excessively high yields commonplace throughout the country. As producers began to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences that distinguished Chilean Cabernets began to emerge. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the region&#x27;s climate is the most important consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a more significant concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time in the bottle to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavours that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower, and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.

===Argentina===
In Argentina, Cabernet Sauvignon lags behind Malbec as the country&#x27;s main red grape, but its numbers are growing. The varietal versions often have lighter fruit flavours and are meant to be consumed young. Premium examples are often blended with Malbec and produce full, tannic wines with leather and tobacco notes. In recent years, there have been increased plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon in the Uco Valley of the Mendoza Province; the wines coming from vineyards planted at higher altitudes garner some international attention.

===Australia===
In the 1970s, the Coonawarra region first brought international attention to Australian Cabernet Sauvignons with intense fruit flavours and subtle minty notes. The Margaret River region soon followed with tightly structured wines with pronounced black fruit notes. In the 1980s, Australia followed California&#x27;s contemporary trend in producing lighter, more &quot;food friendly&quot; wines with alcohol levels around 11-12% percent; by the early 1990s, the styles changed again to focus on balance and riper fruit flavours. Today Cabernet Sauvignon is the second most widely planted red wine grape in Australia, following Shiraz, with which it is often blended. It can be found in several wine regions, with many large producers using grapes from several states. Notable regional differences characterize Australian Cabernet Sauvignon: in addition to the wine styles of Coonawarra and Margaret River, the Barossa Valley produces big, full-bodied wines while the nearby, cooler Clare Valley produces wines with more concentrated fruit, and wines of the Victorian wine region of the Yarra Valley are noted for their balance in acidity, tannins and fruit flavours.

===Other New World producers===
Since the end of apartheid, the South African wine industry has been working to reestablish itself in the world&#x27;s wine markets, with many regions actively promoting their Cabernet Sauvignon. Today it is the most widely planted red wine grape in South Africa. It is produced in varietal and blended styles; some producers favour a Bordeaux blend, while others follow the Australian example of blending with Syrah. Early examples of South African Cabernet Sauvignon were produced by grapes planted in vineyard locations that were cooler than ideal, creating very herbaceous wines with the distinctive &quot;green bell pepper&quot; notes. In the mid-1990s, there was more emphasis on harvesting at fuller ripeness, and new clones were introduced that produced riper, sweeter fruit. As the vines age and better vineyards locations are identified, regional styles are starting to emerge among South African Cabernet Sauvignons: the Stellenbosch region is noted for heavy, full-bodied wines while Constantia&#x27;s wines are characterized by their herbal and minty flavours.

In New Zealand, the climate has been a challenge in finding wine regions suitable for producing Cabernet Sauvignon. Most of the industry focus has centred on the North Island. The Hawkes Bay region was the first to make a significant effort in producing Cabernet Sauvignon, but the region&#x27;s cool climate, coupled with the high yields and fertile alluvial soils, produced wines that were still marked with aggressive green and vegetal flavours. Added focus on canopy management, which gives the grapes more sunlight to ripen by removing excess foliage, and low vigour rootstock and pruning combine to achieve lower yields and have started to produce better results. The grape is sometimes blended with Merlot to help compensate for climate and &quot;terroir&quot;. Other regions in New Zealand have sprung up with a renewed focus on producing distinctive New Zealand Cabernet Sauvignon: The Gimblett Road and Havelock North regions of Hawkes Bay, with their warm gravel soils, have started to achieve notice as well as Waiheke Island near Auckland. Overall the grape lags far behind Pinot noir in New Zealand&#x27;s red wine grape plantings.

Canada produces cabernet sauvignon varietals and &quot;Bordeaux blends&quot;, and some of its cabernet sauvignon is used to create ice wine.

=== China ===
The first vintage produced by Emma Gao at Silver Heights Winery in Ningxia was praised by Chinese and international winemakers, and two of her red wines are among the best-known produced in China. They are a Cabernet Sauvignon ‘Emma’s Reserve’ and a Bordeaux blend ‘The Summit’.

==Popularity and criticism==
In the past century, Cabernet Sauvignon has enjoyed a swell of popularity as one of the noble grapes in the world of wine. Built partially on its historical success in Bordeaux and New World wine regions like California and Australia, planting the grape is considered a solid choice in any wine region that is warm enough to cultivate it. Among consumers, Cabernet has become a familiar wine which has aided in its accessibility and appeals even from obscure wine regions and producers. In the 1980s, the Bulgarian wine industry was largely driven and introduced to the international wine market by the success of its Cabernet Sauvignon wines. The widespread popularity of Bordeaux has contributed to criticism of the grape variety for its role as a &quot;colonizer&quot; grape, being planted in new and emerging wine regions at the expense of focus on the unique local grape varieties. Some regions, such as Portugal, with its abundance of native grape varieties, have largely ignored Cabernet Sauvignon as it seeks to rejuvenate its wine industry beyond Port production.

==Wine styles==

The grapes&#x27; ripeness strongly influences Cabernet Sauvignon&#x27;s style at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavours. When harvested overripe, the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavours of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants is one of the most distinctive and characteristic elements of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have eucalyptus, mint and tobacco aromas. As the wines age, they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. New World examples generally have more pronounced fruity notes, while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.

===Ability to age===

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Cabernet Sauvignon&#x27;s reputation was built on its ability to age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age, new flavours and aromas can emerge and add to the wines&#x27; complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux, with some premium examples in favourable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after the vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another, decade-sometimes longer, depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop, but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.

While New World Cabernets are considered drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers such as the Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop for two to three decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly, many premium Australian cabernets will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavours even with extended bottle ageing. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavours when they are young, and the best-made examples will keep some of those flavours as they age. South African wines tend to favour more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years of ageing before developing further flavours.

==Pairing with food==

Cabernet Sauvignon is a very bold and assertive wine that has the potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine&#x27;s high tannin content, oak influences, and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages, it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with &quot;steak au poivre&quot; and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.

Fats and proteins reduce the perception of tannins on the palate. When Cabernet Sauvignon is paired with steak or dishes with a heavy butter cream sauce, the tannins are neutralized, allowing the fruits of the wine to be more noticeable. In contrast, starches such as pastas and rice will have little effect on tannins. The bitterness of the tannins can also be counterbalanced by the use of bitter foods, such as radicchio and endive, or with cooking methods that involve charring like grilling. As the wine ages and the tannins lessen, more subtle and less bitter dishes will pair better with Cabernet Sauvignon. The oak influences of the wine can be matched with cooking methods that have similar influences on the food—such as grilling, smoking and plank roasting. Dishes that include oak-influenced flavours and aromas typically found in Cabernet Sauvignon—such as dill weed, brown sugar, nutmeg and vanilla—can also pair well.
The different styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from other regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines like Bordeaux have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavours that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavour influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon has the potential to pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full-flavoured or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavours of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.

==Health benefits==

In late 2006, the &quot;Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology&quot; published the result of studies conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai that showed the beneficial relationship of resveratrol, a compound found in all red wine, in reducing the risk factors associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The study showed that resveratrol found in Cabernet Sauvignon could reduce levels of amyloid beta peptides, which attack brain cells and are part of the of Alzheimer&#x27;s. Resveratrol has also been shown to promote the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides. It has also been shown that non-alcoholic extracts of Cabernet Sauvignon protect hypertensive rats during ischaemia and reperfusion.

<text>Grey matter, or gray matter in American English, is a major component of the central nervous system, consisting of neuronal cell bodies, neuropil (dendrites and unmyelinated axons), glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), synapses, and capillaries. Grey matter is distinguished from white matter in that it contains numerous cell bodies and relatively few myelinated axons, while white matter contains relatively few cell bodies and is composed chiefly of long-range myelinated axons. The colour difference arises mainly from the whiteness of myelin. In living tissue, grey matter actually has a very light grey colour with yellowish or pinkish hues, which come from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies.

== Structure ==
Grey matter refers to unmyelinated neurons and other cells of the central nervous system. It is present in the brain, brainstem and cerebellum, and present throughout the spinal cord.

Grey matter is distributed at the surface of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex) and of the cerebellum (cerebellar cortex), as well as in the depths of the cerebrum (the thalamus; hypothalamus; subthalamus, basal ganglia – putamen, globus pallidus and nucleus accumbens; as well as the septal nuclei), cerebellum (deep cerebellar nuclei – the dentate nuclei, globose nucleus, emboliform nucleus, and fastigial nucleus), and brainstem (the substantia nigra, red nucleus, olivary nuclei, and cranial nerve nuclei).

Grey matter in the spinal cord is known as the grey column which travels down the spinal cord distributed in three grey columns that are presented in an &quot;H&quot; shape. The forward-facing column is the anterior grey column, the rear-facing one is the posterior grey column and the interlinking one is the lateral grey column. The grey matter on the left and right side is connected by the grey commissure. The grey matter in the spinal cord consists of interneurons, as well as the cell bodies of projection neurons.

Grey matter undergoes development and growth throughout childhood and adolescence. Recent studies using cross-sectional neuroimaging have shown that by around the age of 8 the volume of grey matter begins to decrease. However, the density of grey matter appears to increase as a child develops into early adulthood. Males tend to exhibit grey matter of increased volume but lower density than that of females.

== Function ==
Grey matter contains most of the brain&#x27;s neuronal cell bodies. The grey matter includes regions of the brain involved in muscle control, and sensory perception such as seeing and hearing, memory, emotions, speech, decision-making, and self-control.

The grey matter in the spinal cord is split into three grey columns:
* The anterior grey column contains motor neurons. These synapse with interneurons and the axons of cells that have travelled down the pyramidal tract. These cells are responsible for the movement of muscles.
* The posterior grey column contains the points where sensory neurons synapse. These receive sensory information from the body, including fine touch, proprioception, and vibration. This information is sent from receptors of the skin, bones, and joints through sensory neurons whose cell bodies lie in the dorsal root ganglion. This information is then transmitted in axons up the spinal cord in spinal tracts, including the dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract and the spinothalamic tract.
* The lateral grey column is the third column of the spinal cord.

The grey matter of the spinal cord can be divided into different layers, called Rexed laminae. These describe, in general, the purpose of the cells within the grey matter of the spinal cord at a particular location.

==Clinical significance==
High alcohol consumption has been correlated with significant reductions in grey matter volume. Short-term cannabis use (30 days) is not correlated with changes in white or grey matter. However, several cross-sectional studies have shown that repeated long-term cannabis use is associated with smaller grey matter volumes in the hippocampus, amygdala, medial temporal cortex, and prefrontal cortex, with increased grey matter volume in the cerebellum. Long-term cannabis use is also associated with alterations in white matter integrity in an age-dependent manner, with heavy cannabis use during adolescence and early adulthood associated with the greatest amount of change.

Meditation has been shown to change grey matter structure.

Habitual playing of action video games has been reported to promote a reduction of grey matter in the hippocampus while 3D platformer games have been reported to increase grey matter in the hippocampus.

Women and men with equivalent IQ scores have differing proportions of grey to white matter in cortical brain regions associated with intelligence.

Pregnancy renders substantial changes in brain structure, primarily reductions in grey matter volume in regions subserving social cognition. Grey matter reductions endure for at least 2 years post-pregnancy. The profile of brain changes is comparable to that taking place during adolescence, a hormonally similar transitional period of life.

==History==

===Etymology===
In the current edition of the official Latin nomenclature, &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;, &quot;substantia grisea&quot; is used for English &quot;grey matter&quot;. The adjective &quot;grisea&quot; for &quot;grey&quot; is however not attested in classical Latin. The adjective &quot;grisea&quot; is derived from the French word for grey, &quot;gris&quot;. Alternative designations like &quot;substantia cana&quot; and &quot;substantia cinerea&quot; are being used alternatively. The adjective &quot;cana&quot;, attested in classical Latin, can mean &quot;grey&quot;, or &quot;greyish white&quot;. The classical Latin &quot;cinerea&quot; means &quot;ash-coloured&quot;.

<doc id="37595" wikidata="Q28521" url="?curid=37595" title="Weasel">
<text>Weasels are mammals of the genus Mustela of the family Mustelidae. The genus &quot;Mustela&quot; includes the least weasels, polecats, stoats, ferrets, and European mink. Members of this genus are small, active predators, with long and slender bodies and short legs. The family Mustelidae, or mustelids (which also includes badgers, otters, and wolverines), is often referred to as the &quot;weasel family&quot;. In the UK, the term &quot;weasel&quot; usually refers to the smallest species, the least weasel (&quot;M. nivalis&quot;), the smallest carnivoran species.

Least weasels vary in length from , females being smaller than the males, and usually have red or brown upper coats and white bellies; some populations of some species moult to a wholly white coat in winter. They have long, slender bodies, which enable them to follow their prey into burrows. Their tails may be from long.

Weasels feed on small mammals and have from time to time been considered vermin because some species took poultry from farms or rabbits from commercial warrens. They do, on the other hand, eat large numbers of rodents. Their range spans Europe, North America, much of Asia and South America, and small areas in North Africa.

==Terminology==
The English word &quot;weasel&quot; was originally applied to one species of the genus, the European form of the least weasel (&quot;Mustela nivalis&quot;). This usage is retained in British English, where the name is also extended to cover several other small species of the genus. However, in technical discourse and in American usage, the term &quot;weasel&quot; can refer to any member of the genus, the genus as a whole, and even to members of the related genus &quot;Neogale&quot;. Of the 16 extant species currently classified in the genus &quot;Mustela&quot;, 10 have &quot;weasel&quot; in their common names. Among those that do not are the three species of ermine, the polecats, the ferret, and the European mink.

The American mink and the extinct sea mink were commonly included in this genus as &quot;Mustela vison&quot; and &quot;Mustela macrodon&quot;, respectively, but in 1999 they were moved to the genus &quot;Neovison&quot;. In 2021, both &quot;Neovison&quot; species, along with the long-tailed weasel (&quot;Mustela frenata&quot;), Amazon weasel (&quot;Mustela africana&quot;) and Colombian weasel (&quot;Mustela felipei&quot;) were moved to the genus &quot;Neogale&quot;, as the clade containing these five species was found to be fully distinct from &quot;Mustela&quot;.

=== Taxonomy ===
The genus name &quot;Mustela&quot; comes from the Latin word for weasel combining the words &quot;mus&quot; meaning &quot;mouse&quot; and &quot;telum&quot; meaning &quot;javelin&quot; for its long body.

==Species==
The following information is according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System and MammalDiversity.

1 Europe and Northern Asia division excludes China.

==Cultural meanings==

Weasels have been assigned a variety of cultural meanings.

In Greek culture, a weasel near one&#x27;s house is a sign of bad luck, even evil, &quot;especially if there is in the household a girl about to be married&quot;, since the animal (based on its Greek etymology) was thought to be an unhappy bride who was transformed into a weasel and consequently delights in destroying wedding dresses. In Macedonia, however, weasels are generally seen as an omen of good fortune.

In early-modern Mecklenburg, Germany, amulets from weasels were deemed to have strong magic; the period between 15 August and 8 September was specifically designated for the killing of weasels.

In Montagne Noire (France), Ruthenia, and the early medieval culture of the Wends, weasels were not meant to be killed.

According to Daniel Defoe also, meeting a weasel is a bad omen. In English-speaking areas, weasel can be an insult, noun or verb, for someone regarded as sneaky, conniving or untrustworthy. Similarly, &quot;weasel words&quot; is a critical term for words or phrasing that are vague, misleading or equivocal.

===Japanese superstitions===

In Japan, were seen as &quot;yōkai&quot; (causing strange occurrences). According to the encyclopedia &quot;Wakan Sansai Zue&quot; from the Edo period, a pack of weasels would cause conflagrations, and the cry of a weasel was considered a harbinger of misfortune. In the Niigata Prefecture, the sound of a pack of weasels making a rustle resembled six people hulling rice, so was called the &quot;weasel&#x27;s six-person mortar&quot;, and it was an omen for one&#x27;s home to decline or flourish. It is said that when people chase after this sound, the sound stops.

They are also said to shapeshift like the fox (&quot;kitsune&quot;) or &quot;tanuki&quot;, and the &quot;nyūdō-bōzu&quot; told about in legends in the Tōhoku region and the Chūbu region are considered weasels in disguise, and they are also said to shapeshift into &quot;ōnyūdō&quot; and little monks.

In the collection of depictions &quot;Gazu Hyakki Yagyō&quot; by Sekien Toriyama, they were depicted under the title 鼬, but they were read not as &quot;itachi&quot;, but rather as &quot;&quot;ten&quot;&quot;, and &quot;ten&quot; were considered to be weasels that have reached one hundred years of age and became yōkai that possessed supernatural powers. Another theory is that when weasels reach several hundred years of age, they become &quot;mujina&quot; (Japanese badgers).

In Japanese, weasels are called and in the Tōhoku Region and Shinshu, it was believed that there were families that were able to use a certain practice to freely use &quot;kudagitsune&quot; as &quot;iizuna-tsukai&quot; or &quot;kitsune-mochi&quot;. It is said that Mount Iizuna, from the Nagano Prefecture, got its name due to how the gods gave people mastery of this technique from there.

According to the folklorist Mutō Tetsujō, &quot;They are called &quot;izuna&quot; in the Senboku District, Akita Prefecture, and there are also the ichiko (itako) that use them.&quot; Also, in the Kitaakita District, they are called&quot; mōsuke&quot; (猛助), and they are feared as &quot;yōkai&quot; even more than foxes (&quot;kitsune&quot;).

In the Ainu language, ermines are called &quot;upas-čironnup&quot; or &quot;sáčiri&quot;, but since least weasels are also called &quot;sáčiri&quot;, Mashio Chiri surmised that the honorary title &quot;poy-sáčiri-kamuy&quot; (where &quot;poy&quot; means &quot;small&quot;) refers to least weasels.

====&quot;Kamaitachi&quot;====
&quot;Kamaitachi&quot; is a phenomenon wherein one who is idle is suddenly injured as if his or her skin were cut by a scythe. In the past, this was thought to be &quot;the deed of an invisible &quot;yōkai&quot; weasel&quot;. An alternate theory, asserts that &quot;kamaitachi&quot; is derived from , so were not originally related to weasels at all.

<text>Gulo is a genus of carnivoran mammals in the family Mustelidae. It contains one extant species, the wolverine (&quot;G. gulo&quot;), as well as several extinct ones. Fossil evidence suggests that this genus appeared in North America and later spread to Eurasia during the Pliocene. Diagnostic traits include a strongly reduced P2, a robust P4 with three roots, and upper molars smaller than in other gulonines. Overall, the teeth are adapted for hypercarnivory.

<text>Traffic is a 2000 American crime drama film directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Stephen Gaghan. It explores the illegal drug trade from several perspectives: users, enforcers, politicians, and traffickers. Their stories are edited together throughout the film, although some characters do not meet each other. The film is an adaptation of the 1989 British Channel 4 television series &quot;Traffik&quot;. The film stars an international ensemble cast, including Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, Michael Douglas, Erika Christensen, Luis Guzmán, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jacob Vargas, Tomas Milian, Topher Grace, James Brolin, Steven Bauer, and Benjamin Bratt. It features both English and Spanish-language dialogue.

20th Century Fox, the original financiers of the film, demanded that Harrison Ford play a leading role and that significant changes to the screenplay be made. Soderbergh refused and proposed the script to other major Hollywood studios; it was rejected because of the three-hour running time and the subject matter—&quot;Traffic&quot; is more of a political film than most Hollywood productions. USA Films, however, liked the project from the start and offered the filmmakers more money than Fox. Soderbergh operated the camera himself and adopted a distinctive color grade for each story line so that audiences could tell them apart.

&quot;Traffic&quot; was released in the United States on December 27, 2000, and received critical acclaim for Soderbergh&#x27;s direction, the film&#x27;s style, complexity, messages, and the cast&#x27;s performances (particularly del Toro&#x27;s). &quot;Traffic&quot; earned numerous awards, including four Oscars (from five nominations): Best Director for Steven Soderbergh, Best Supporting Actor for Benicio del Toro, Best Adapted Screenplay for Stephen Gaghan and Best Film Editing for Stephen Mirrione. It was also a commercial success with a worldwide box-office revenue total of $207.5 million, well above its estimated $48 million budget.

In 2004, USA Network ran a miniseries—also called &quot;Traffic&quot;—based on the film and the 1989 British television series.

==Plot==
===Mexico story line===
In Mexico, police officers Javier Rodriguez and Manolo Sanchez stop a drug transport. General Salazar, a high-ranking Mexican official, interrupts their arrest to offer Javier a special assignment: apprehending Francisco Flores, a hitman for the Tijuana Cartel, headed by the Obregón brothers.

In Tijuana, under torture, Flores gives Salazar the names of Obregón cartel members, who are arrested. Javier and Salazar&#x27;s efforts cripple the Obregóns&#x27; cocaine outfit, but Javier discovers that Salazar is a pawn of the rival Juárez Cartel; Salazar&#x27;s anti-drug campaign is a charade to wipe out the Juárez Cartel&#x27;s competitors.

Sanchez attempts to sell information about Salazar&#x27;s true affiliation to the Drug Enforcement Administration, but Salazar has him murdered in the desert with Javier forced to watch. Javier arranges a deal with the DEA to testify against Salazar in exchange for electricity in his neighborhood to keep local children from being tempted by street gangs and crime. Salazar&#x27;s secrets are revealed, and he is arrested.

Javier makes a statement to the media about the widespread corruption in the police force and army. Later, Javier watches as children play baseball at night in their new stadium.

===Wakefield story line===
Robert Wakefield, a conservative Ohio judge, is appointed to head the President&#x27;s Office of National Drug Control Policy as drug czar, though he is warned that the War on Drugs is unwinnable. Meanwhile, Robert&#x27;s teenage daughter Caroline has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin, developing a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and their friend Vanessa are arrested when they try to dump an overdosing fellow student at a hospital. Robert and his wife Barbara struggle to deal with Caroline&#x27;s addiction, which Barbara has secretly known about for months.

Robert finds himself caught between his demanding new position and difficult family life. Visiting Mexico, he is encouraged by Salazar&#x27;s successful efforts in hurting the Obregón brothers. Returning to Ohio, Robert learns that Caroline has run away to Cincinnati after stealing money from her parents to pay for drugs.

Dragging Seth along, Robert searches Cincinnati for his daughter. After a drug dealer who is prostituting Caroline refuses to reveal her whereabouts, Robert breaks into a seedy hotel room and finds a semi-conscious Caroline in the company of an older man. In Washington, D.C. to present a &quot;10-point plan&quot; to win the War on Drugs, Robert falters halfway through the speech, and tells the press that the War on Drugs implies a war on one&#x27;s own family, which he cannot endorse. Later, Robert and Barbara attend a Narcotics Anonymous meeting with Caroline, telling the other attendees that they are &quot;here to listen&quot;.

===Ayala/DEA story line===
In San Diego, an undercover DEA investigation led by Montel Gordon and Ray Castro leads to the arrest of Eduardo Ruiz, a dealer posing as a fisherman. Ruiz gives up his boss, drug lord Carl Ayala, the Obregóns&#x27; biggest distributor in the United States. Ayala is indicted by a tough prosecutor, hand-selected by Robert Wakefield to send a message to the cartels.

As Ayala&#x27;s trial begins, his pregnant wife Helena learns of her husband&#x27;s true profession from his associate, Arnie Metzger. Facing the prospect of life imprisonment for her husband and death threats against her child, Helena hires Flores to assassinate Ruiz and end the trial &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;. Flores plants a car bomb, but is killed by a sniper in retaliation for his cooperation with General Salazar, and the bomb meant to kill Ruiz instead kills Agent Castro.

Knowing Ruiz will soon testify, Helena makes a deal with Juan Obregón, who forgives the Ayala family&#x27;s debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, and he deduces that Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate Ayala&#x27;s downfall; Metzger is later visited by armed men. Soon after Ayala&#x27;s release, Gordon bursts into his homecoming celebration and is forced out. Having planted a listening device under Ayala&#x27;s desk, Gordon smiles as he walks away.

==Relationship to actual events==
Some aspects of the plotline are based on actual people and events:
* The character General Arturo Salazar is closely modeled after Mexican General Jesús Gutiérrez Rebollo, who was secretly on the payroll of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, head of the Juarez Cartel.
* The character Porfirio Madrigal is modeled after Fuentes.
* The Obregón brothers are modeled after the Tijuana Cartel&#x27;s Arellano Félix brothers.

At one point in the film, an El Paso Intelligence Center agent tells Robert his position, official in charge of drug control, does not exist in Mexico. As noted in the original script, a Director of the &quot;Instituto Nacional para el Combate a las Drogas&quot; was created by the Attorney General of Mexico in 1996.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Steven Soderbergh had been interested in making a film about the drug wars for some time but did not want to make one about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford obtained the rights to the British television miniseries &quot;Traffik&quot; (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the miniseries in 1990, started looking for a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called &quot;Havoc&quot;, about upper-class white kids in Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film but found he was already developing a film about drugs for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.

&quot;Traffic&quot; was originally going to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, but it was put into turnaround unless actor Harrison Ford agreed to star. Soderbergh began shopping the film to other studios, but when Ford suddenly showed interest in &quot;Traffic&quot;, Fox&#x27;s interest in the film was renewed; the studio took it out of turnaround. Fox CEO Bill Mechanic championed the film, but he departed from the studio by the time the first draft was finished. It went back into turnaround. Mechanic had also wanted to make some changes to the script, but Soderbergh disagreed and decided to shop the film to other major studios. They all turned him down because they were not confident in the prospects of a three-hour film about drugs, according to Gaghan. USA Films, however, had wanted to take on the movie from the first time Soderbergh approached them. They provided the filmmakers with a $46 million budget, a considerable increase from the $25 million which Fox offered.

===Screenplay===
Soderbergh had &quot;conceptual discussions&quot; with Gaghan while he was shooting &quot;The Limey&quot; in October 1998; they finished the outline before he went off to shoot &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;. After Soderbergh was finished with that film, Gaghan had written a first draft in six weeks that was 165 pages long. After the film was approved for production, Soderbergh and Gaghan met two separate times for three days to reformat the script. The draft they shot had 163 pages with 135 speaking parts and featured seven cities. The film shortens the story line of the original miniseries; a significant character arc of a farmer is taken out, and the Pakistani plotline is replaced with one set in Mexico.

===Casting===
Harrison Ford was initially considered for the role of Robert Wakefield in January 2000 but would have had to take a significant cut in his usual $20 million salary. Ford met with Soderbergh to flesh out the character. Gaghan agreed to rework the role, adding several scenes to the screenplay. On February 20, Ford turned down the role, and the filmmakers brought it back to Michael Douglas, who had turned down an earlier draft. He liked the changes and agreed to star, which helped greenlight the project. Gaghan believes Ford turned down the role because he wanted to &quot;reconnect with his action fans&quot;.

The filmmakers sent out letters to many politicians, both Democrat and Republican, asking them to make cameo appearances in the film. Several of the scenes had already been shot using actors in these roles, but the filmmakers went back and reshot those scenes when real politicians agreed to be in the film. Those who agreed, including U.S. Senators Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley, and Don Nickles, and Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, were filmed in a scene that was entirely improvised.

===Pre-production===
The project was obtained from Fox by Initial Entertainment Group and was sold to USA Films by IEG for North American rights only. Steven Soderbergh never approached USA Films, and Initial Entertainment Group fully funded the film.

After Fox dropped the film in early 2000, and before USA Films expressed interest, Soderbergh paid for pre-production with his own money. USA Films agreed to give him the final cut on &quot;Traffic&quot; and also agreed to his term that all the Mexican characters would speak Spanish while talking to each other. This meant that almost all of Benicio del Toro&#x27;s dialogue would be subtitled. Once the studio realized this, they suggested that his scenes be shot in English and Spanish, but Soderbergh and del Toro rejected the suggestion. Del Toro, a native of Puerto Rico, was worried that another actor would be brought in and re-record his dialogue in English after he had worked hard to master Mexican inflections and improve his Spanish vocabulary. Del Toro remembers: &quot;Can you imagine? You do the whole movie, bust your butt to get it as realistic as possible, and someone dubs your voice? I said, &#x27;No way. Over my dead body.&#x27; Steven was like, &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry. It&#x27;s not gonna happen.&#x27;&quot; The director fought for subtitles for the Mexico scenes, arguing that if the characters did not speak Spanish, the film would have no integrity and would not convincingly portray what he described as the &quot;impenetrability of another culture&quot;.

The filmmakers went to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Customs early on with the script; they told them that they were trying to present as detailed and accurate a picture of the current drug war as possible. The DEA and Customs pointed out inaccuracies in the script. In addition, they gave the production team access to the border checkpoint to Mexico, as shown in the film during the scene in which Wakefield and his people talk with border officials. Despite the assistance, the DEA did not try to influence the script&#x27;s content. Soderbergh said &quot;Traffic&quot; had influences from the films of Richard Lester and Jean-Luc Godard. He also spent time analyzing &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;, which, according to the director, had the feeling that the footage was &quot;caught&quot; and not staged. Another inspiration was Alan J. Pakula&#x27;s film &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; because of its ability to tackle serious issues while being entertaining. In the opening credits of the film, Soderbergh tried to replicate the typeface from &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; and the placement on-screen at the bottom left-hand corner. Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for &quot;Traffic&quot;.

===Principal photography===
Half of the first day&#x27;s footage came out overexposed and unusable. Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming would come from the director&#x27;s pocket. Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio, and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget. The director acted as his cinematographer under the pseudonym Peter Andrews and operated the camera himself to &quot;get as close to the movie as I can&quot; and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself. Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of Ken Loach&#x27;s films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, &quot;I noticed that there&#x27;s a space that&#x27;s inviolate, that if you get within something, you cross the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic&quot;. Most of the day was spent shooting because a lot of the film was shot with available light.

For the hand-held camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs that were smaller and lighter than previous cameras and allowed him to move freely. He adopted a distinctive look for each to tell the three stories apart. For Robert Wakefield&#x27;s story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala&#x27;s story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film and overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez&#x27;s story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feeling. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted different looks for each story because the audience had to keep track of many characters and absorb a lot of information, and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.

Benicio del Toro had significant input into certain parts of the film; for example, he suggested a more straightforward, concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene from the screenplay in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter&#x27;s bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed, and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.

Balboa Park, downtown San Diego and La Jolla were utilized as the environment for the film.

===Post-production===
The first cut of &quot;Traffic&quot; ran three hours and ten minutes. Soderbergh cut it to two hours and twenty minutes. Early on, there were concerns that the film might get an NC-17 rating, and he was prepared to release it with that rating, but the MPAA gave it an R.

==Release==
===Home media===
In the United States, the film was released on DVD on May 28, 2002, by The Criterion Collection. In Australia, &quot;Traffic&quot; was released on DVD by Village Roadshow, with an MA15+ rating. Despite the Australian packaging stating the length to be 124 minutes, the actual DVD version is just over 141 minutes long.

==Reception==
===Box office performance===
&quot;Traffic&quot; was given a limited release on December 27, 2000, in four theaters where it grossed on its opening weekend. It was given a wide release on January 5, 2001, in 1,510 theaters, grossing $15.5 million on its opening weekend. The film made $124.1 million in North America and $83.4 million in foreign markets for a worldwide total of $207.5 million, well above its estimated $46 million budget.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 223 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Soderbergh successfully pulls off the highly ambitious &quot;Traffic&quot;, a movie with three different stories and a very large cast. The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has received an average score of 86 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, and wrote: &quot;The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn&#x27;t preach. It is so restrained that at one moment—the judge&#x27;s final speech—I wanted one more sentence, making a point, but the movie lets us supply that thought for ourselves&quot;. Stephen Holden, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;&quot;Traffic&quot; is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, each with its own tense rhythm and explosive payoff&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Andrew Sarris wrote: &quot;&quot;Traffic&quot; marks [Soderbergh] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what he&#x27;s going to do next. The promise of &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot; has been fulfilled&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;A&quot; rating and praised Benicio del Toro&#x27;s performance, which critic Owen Gleiberman called, &quot;haunting in his understatement, [it] becomes the film&#x27;s quietly awakening moral center&quot;. Desson Howe, in his review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, wrote: &quot;Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan, who based this on a British television miniseries of the same name, have created an often exhilarating, soup-to-nuts exposé of the world&#x27;s most lucrative trade&quot;. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers wrote: &quot;The hand-held camerawork – Soderbergh himself did the holding—provides a documentary feel that rivets attention&quot;. However, Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot;, in a rare negative review, finds the film&#x27;s biggest weakness to be that it contains the &quot;cliches of a hundred crime movies&quot; before concluding that &quot;&quot;Traffic&quot;, for all its earnestness, does not work. It leaves one feeling restless and dissatisfied&quot;. In an interview, director Ingmar Bergman lauded the film as &quot;amazing&quot;.

===Accolades===

Steven Soderbergh received dual nominations for Best Director that year for both &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and &quot;Traffic&quot;, winning the award for the latter.

<doc id="37602" wikidata="Q2092297" url="?curid=37602" title="Eagle">
<text>Eagle is the common name for the golden eagle, bald eagle, and other birds of prey in the family of the Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. True eagles comprise the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa. Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—two in North America, nine in Central and South America, and three in Australia.

Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;eagle&quot; is borrowed into English from and , both derived ultimately from (&quot;eagle&quot;). It is cognate with terms such as , and . It is broadly synonymous with the less common English term &quot;erne&quot; or &quot;earn&quot;, deriving from , from , in which it acts as the usual word for the bird. The Old English term is turn derived from and 
is cognate with other synonymous words in Germanic languages such as , and . Through the Proto-Indo-European root, it is further related to words such as (&quot;bird&quot;) and (&quot;eagle&quot;). Although &quot;erne&quot; can be used to refer to any eagle, it is most commonly used for the golden eagle or sea-eagle.

==Description==
Eagles are large, powerfully-built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (&quot;Hieraaetus pennatus&quot;), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;) or red-tailed hawk (&quot;B. jamaicensis&quot;), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight, despite the reduced size of their aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors, apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the Great Nicobar serpent eagle (&quot;Spilornis klossi&quot;), at and . The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons.

The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles&#x27; eyes are extremely powerful. It is estimated that the wedge-tailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical human. This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. Like most diurnal raptors, eagles have little ability to see ultraviolet light. The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.

Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no action to stop the killing.
It is said that eagles fly above clouds but this is not true. Eagles fly during storms and glide from the wind&#x27;s pressure. This saves the bird&#x27;s energy. 
Due to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; and &quot;Icthyophaga&quot; eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera &quot;Circaetus&quot;, &quot;Terathopius&quot;, and &quot;Spilornis&quot; predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich genus &quot;Spizaetus&quot;, live predominantly in woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based on their environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.

The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a mule deer fawn. However, a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to and a martial eagle even killed a duiker, 7–8 times heavier than the preying eagle. Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other North American raptors):

They have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous – but not the Eagles.
Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats. Eagles in the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;, found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.

These lists of the top five eagles are based on weight, length, and wingspan, respectively. Unless otherwise noted by reference, the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide &quot;Raptors of the World&quot; in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed.



== Habitat ==
The eagles are generally distributed in all types of habitats and nearly all parts of the world. The birds can be found in northern tundra to tropical rainforests and deserts. In North America, bald eagles and golden eagles are very common.

==Distribution==
*Australasian
** Australia: wedge-tailed eagle (range extends into southern New Guinea), white-bellied sea-eagle (range extends into Asia), little eagle.
** New Guinea: Papuan eagle, white-bellied sea-eagle, pygmy eagle.
*Nearctic (USA and Canada): golden eagle (also found in Palearctic), bald eagle.
*Neotropical (Central and South America): &quot;Spizaetus&quot; (four species), solitary eagles (two spp.), harpy eagle, crested eagle, black-chested buzzard-eagle.
*Palearctic (Europe, Northern Africa, Asia without South Asia and Southeast Asia)
**Eurasia: Golden eagle, White-tailed eagle.
*Subsaharan Africa: African fish eagle, Martial Eagle, Crowned eagle, Verreaux&#x27;s eagle, Tawny eagle, Long-crested eagle

==Groups==
Eagles are often informally divided into four groups.

The snake eagles are placed in the subfamily Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner &amp; Mindell proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of Accipitridae.

===Fish eagles===
Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion.

Proposed subfamily Haliaeetinae. Genera: &quot;Haliaeetus&quot;, &quot;Icthyophaga&quot;.

Some authors include &quot;Gypohierax angolensis&quot;, the &quot;vulturine fish eagle&quot; (also called the palm-nut vulture) in this group. However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of &quot;Neophron&quot;–&quot;Gypaetus&quot;–&quot;Eutriorchis&quot; (Egyptian vulture, bearded vulture (lammergeier), and Madagascar serpent eagle).

The fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with &quot;Haliastur&quot; and &quot;Milvus&quot;; the whole group is only distantly related to the &quot;Buteo&quot; group.

Fish eagles exist in every continent throughout the world, except for South America.

Although fish eagles can be found in many different places around the world, they have been classified as &quot;Near Threatened&quot;. Reasons such as overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and the use of pesticides have contributed to the species&#x27; rapid population drop.

===Booted eagles===

The booted eagle is a group of eagle that typically migrates across the Sahara Desert to Europe. It usually reaches Europe around the beginning of March and leaves by the end of September. It&#x27;s interesting to note that these types of eagles usually mate with the same partner and return to the same areas years later. Female booted eagles usually lay 1-4 eggs, which promptly hatch after 37 to 40 days. Researchers estimate that there are between 3600 and 6900 pairs of booted eagles in Europe, which are mostly situated in the Iberian Peninsula.

Booted eagles or &quot;true eagles&quot; have feathered tarsi (lower legs).

Tribe Aquililae or proposed subfamily Aquilinae. Genera: &quot;Aquila&quot;, &quot;Hieraaetus&quot;; &quot;Spizaetus&quot;, &quot;Oroaetus&quot;, &quot;Spizastur&quot;; &quot;Nisaetus&quot;; &quot;Ictinaetus&quot;, &quot;Lophoaetus&quot;; &quot;Polemaetus&quot;; and &quot;Stephanoaetus&quot;.

See comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these genera.

===Snake eagles===
Most snake or serpent eagles, as the name suggests, primarily prey on snakes.

* Subfamily Circaetinae. Genera: &quot;Circaetus&quot;, &quot;Spilornis&quot;, &quot;Dryotriorchis&quot;, &quot;Terathopius&quot;.
* &quot;Eutriorchis&quot; (subfamily Gypaetinae or Circaetinae).

Despite filling the niche of a snake eagle, genetic studies suggest that the Madagascar serpent eagle (&quot;Eutriorchis&quot;) is not related to them.

Over several decades, a great deal of research has been done on the  Snake-eagle&#x27;s diet, which is mainly made up of reptiles, especially snakes. When it comes to catching snakes, it is generally accepted that the bird exhibits generalist feeding behavior, which means it does not hunt down specific types of snakes but rather feeds on them depending on their availability in the wild.

===Harpy eagles===
Harpy eagles or &quot;giant forest eagles&quot; are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests. The group contains two to six species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches and have traditionally been grouped, they are not all related: the solitary eagles are related to the black hawks and the Philippine eagle to the snake eagles.

* Harpy eagles (proposed subfamily Harpiinae)
** &quot;Harpia harpyja&quot;, harpy eagle ― Central and South America.
** &quot;Morphnus guianensis&quot;, crested eagle ― Central and South America.
** &quot;Harpyopsis novaeguineae&quot;, Papuan eagle ― New Guinea.
* Philippine eagle
** &quot;Pithecophaga jefferyi&quot;, Philippine eagle ― Philippines.
* Solitary eagles
** Chaco eagle or crowned solitary eagle, &quot;Buteogallus&quot; (formerly &quot;Harpyhaliaetus&quot;) &quot;coronatus&quot; ― South America.
** Solitary eagle or montane solitary eagle, &quot;Buteogallus&quot; (formerly &quot;Harpyhaliaetus&quot;) &quot;solitarius&quot; ― South America.

==Species==


Major new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera &quot;Aquila&quot; and &quot;Hieraaetus&quot; are not composed of nearest relatives, and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place, with some species being moved to &quot;Lophaetus&quot; or &quot;Ictinaetus&quot;.
*Bonelli&#x27;s eagle and the African hawk-eagle have been moved from &quot;Hieraaetus&quot; to &quot;Aquila&quot;.
*Either the greater spotted eagle and lesser spotted eagle should move from &quot;Aquila&quot; to join the long-crested eagle in &quot;Lophaetus&quot;, or, perhaps better, all three of these species should move to &quot;Ictinaetus&quot; with the black eagle.
*The steppe eagle and tawny eagle, once thought to be conspecific, are not even each other&#x27;s nearest relatives.

==In culture==

===Etymology===
The modern English term for the bird is derived from by way of . The origin of is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles.

Old English used the term , related to Scandinavia&#x27;s &quot;/&quot;. It is similar to other Indo-European terms for &quot;bird&quot; or &quot;eagle&quot;, including (), (), and .

In the southern part of Finland, near the Gulf of Finland, is the town of Kotka, which literally means &quot;eagle&quot;, while the town of L&#x27;Aquila in the central part of Italy literally means &quot;the eagle&quot;.
In Britain before 1678, &quot;eagle&quot; referred specifically to the golden eagle, with the other native species, the white-tailed eagle, being known as . The modern name &quot;golden eagle&quot; for &quot;aquila chrysaetos&quot; was introduced by the naturalist John Ray.

The village of Eagle in Lincolnshire, England, has nothing to do with the bird; its name is derived from the Old English words for &quot;oak&quot; and &quot;wood&quot; (compare &quot;Oakley&quot;).

===Religion and spirituality===

In the ancient Sumerian mythology, the mythical king Etana was said to have been carried into heaven by an eagle. Classical writers such as Lucan and Pliny the Elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly at the sun, and that they forced their fledglings to do the same. Those that blinked would be cast from the nest. This belief persisted until the Medieval era.

The eagle is the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology) page.)

Eagles appear metaphorically in many translations of the Old Testament. God is spoken of as carrying Israel on &quot;eagles&#x27; wings&quot; in Exodus 19:4, Isaiah 40:31 compares those who wait on the Lord to flying eagles, and Psalm 103 mentions renewing one&#x27;s youth &quot;as the eagle&quot;. In explaining this rejuvenation, Augustine of Hippo says in his commentary on the Psalms that eagles&#x27; beaks overgrow as they age and that they break them against rocks to restore them. The translation, however, is uncertain: the word in the Hebrew, , can also be translated vulture, and is listed alongside specific kinds of vulture in Leviticus&#x27; discussion of unclean animals.

The eagle is also often used in Christian iconography to represent the Gospel of John, and eagle-shaped lecterns are common in Anglican and some Roman Catholic churches. The eagle was believed to be able to look directly into the sun in the same way that the Gospel of John looks directly at Jesus&#x27; divinity, and the great distances the eagle flies represent the spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth.

The United States eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual reasons. In Canada, the poaching of eagle feathers for the booming U.S. market has sometimes resulted in the arrests of First Nations person for the crime.

The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagles in their art. The golden eagle was sacred to the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli while the harpy eagle was sacred to Quetzalcoatl.

===Heraldry===

Eagles are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry, being considered the &quot;King of Birds&quot; in contrast to the lion, the &quot;King of Beasts&quot;. Whereas the lion (e.g. England) usually represents authority, the eagle is the symbol of power. They are particularly popular in Germanic countries such as Austria, due to their association with the Holy Roman Empire. The eagle of the Holy Roman Empire was two-headed, supposedly representing the two divisions, East and West, of the old Roman Empire. This motif, derived from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire was also adopted by the Russian Empire and is still featured in the Flag of Albania. The Roman eagle was preceded by the eagle of Ptolemaic Egypt and the Achaemenid Empire. In the coat of arms of Kotka, Finland, the eagle is depicted carrying an anchor and the caduceus on its feet.

Heraldic eagles are most often found &quot;displayed&quot;, i.e. with their wings and legs extended. They can also occur &quot;close&quot;, i.e. with their wings folded, or &quot;rising&quot;, i.e. about to take flight. The heads, wings, and legs of eagles can also be found independently.

Eagles symbolize strength, courage, and independence and are commonly found in the heraldry of many nations across the world. Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Dagestan, Egypt, Germany, Ghana, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Montenegro, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Palestine, Panama, Russia, Romania, Serbia, South Sudan, Somaliland, the United States of America, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe are the nations whose coats of arms feature an eagle. The eagle&#x27;s continuing significance and worldwide appeal as a forceful symbol in national identity and imagery is demonstrated by its widespread usage.

<text>are logographic Chinese characters, adapted from Chinese script, used in the writing of Japanese. They were made a major part of the Japanese writing system during the time of Old Japanese and are still used, along with the subsequently-derived syllabic scripts of and . The characters have Japanese pronunciations; most have two, with one based on the Chinese sound. A few characters were invented in Japan by constructing character components derived from other Chinese characters. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan made its own efforts to simplify the characters, now known as , by a process similar to China&#x27;s simplification efforts, with the intention to increase literacy among the general public. Since the 1920s, the Japanese government has published character lists periodically to help direct the education of its citizenry through the myriad Chinese characters that exist. There are nearly 3,000 kanji used in Japanese names and in common communication.

The term in Japanese literally means &quot;Han characters&quot;. Japanese kanji and Chinese () share a common foundation. The significant use of Chinese characters in Japan first began to take hold around the 5th century AD and has since had a profound influence in shaping Japanese culture, language, literature, history, and records. Inkstone artifacts at archaeological sites dating back to the earlier Yayoi period were also found to contain Chinese characters.

Although some characters, as used in Japanese and Chinese, have similar meanings and pronunciations, others have meanings or pronunciations that are unique to one language or the other. For example, means &#x27;honest&#x27; in both languages but is pronounced or in Japanese, and in Standard Mandarin Chinese. Individual kanji characters and multi-kanji words invented in Japan from Chinese morphemes have been borrowed into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese in recent times. These are known as Wasei-kango, or Japanese-made Chinese words. For example, the word for telephone, in Japanese, was derived from the Chinese words for &quot;electric&quot; and &quot;conversation.&quot; It was then calqued as in Mandarin Chinese, in Vietnamese and in Korean. 


==History==

Chinese characters first came to Japan on official seals, letters, swords, coins, mirrors, and other decorative items imported from China. The earliest known instance of such an import was the King of Na gold seal given by Emperor Guangwu of Han to a Wa emissary in 57 AD. Chinese coins as well as inkstones from the first century AD have also been found in Yayoi period archaeological sites. However, the Japanese people of that era probably had little to no comprehension of the script, and they would remain relatively illiterate until the fifth century AD, when writing in Japan became more widespread. According to the and , a semi-legendary scholar called Wani was dispatched to Japan by the Kingdom of Baekje during the reign of Emperor Ōjin in the early fifth century, bringing with him knowledge of Confucianism and Chinese characters. 

The earliest Japanese documents were probably written by bilingual Chinese or Korean officials employed at the Yamato court. For example, the diplomatic correspondence from King Bu of Wa to Emperor Shun of Liu Song in 478 AD has been praised for its skillful use of allusion. Later, groups of people called were organized under the monarch to read and write Classical Chinese. During the reign of Empress Suiko (593–628), the Yamato court began sending full-scale diplomatic missions to China, which resulted in a large increase in Chinese literacy at the Japanese court. 

In ancient times, paper was so rare that people wrote kanji onto thin, rectangular strips of wood, called (). These wooden boards were used for communication between government offices, tags for goods transported between various countries, and the practice of writing. The oldest written kanji in Japan discovered so far were written in ink on wood as a wooden strip dated to the 7th century, a record of trading for cloth and salt.

The Japanese language had no written form at the time Chinese characters were introduced, and texts were written and read only in Chinese. Later, during the Heian period (794–1185), a system known as emerged, which involved using Chinese text with diacritical marks to allow Japanese speakers to read Chinese sentences and restructure them into Japanese on the fly, by changing word order and adding particles and verb endings, in accordance with the rules of Japanese grammar. This was essentially a kind of codified sight translation.

Chinese characters also came to be used to write texts in the vernacular Japanese language, resulting in the modern syllabaries. Around 650 AD, a writing system called (used in the ancient poetry anthology ) evolved that used a number of Chinese characters for their sound, rather than for their meaning. written in cursive style evolved into (literally &quot;fluttering &quot; in reference to the motion of the brush during cursive writing), or , that is, &quot;ladies&#x27; hand&quot;, a writing system that was accessible to women (who were denied higher education). Major works of Heian-era literature by women were written in . (literally &quot;partial &quot;, in reference to the practice of using a part of a kanji character) emerged via a parallel path: monastery students simplified to a single constituent element. Thus the two other writing systems, and , referred to collectively as , are descended from kanji. In contrast with (, literally &quot;borrowed name&quot;, in reference to the character being &quot;borrowed&quot; as a label for its sound), kanji are also called (, literally &quot;true name&quot;, in reference to the character being used as a label for its meaning).

In modern Japanese, kanji are used to write certain words or parts of words (usually content words such as nouns, adjective stems, and verb stems), while are used to write inflected verb and adjective endings, phonetic complements to disambiguate readings (), particles, and miscellaneous words which have no kanji or whose kanji are considered obscure or too difficult to read or remember. are mostly used for representing onomatopoeia, non-Japanese loanwords (except those borrowed from ancient Chinese), the names of plants and animals (with exceptions), and for emphasis on certain words.

==Orthographic reform and lists of kanji==

Since ancient times, there has been a strong opinion in Japan that kanji is the orthodox form of writing, but there were also people who argued against it. Kamo no Mabuchi, a scholar of the Edo period, criticized the large number of characters in kanji. He also appreciated the small number of characters in characters and argued for the limitation of kanji.

After the Meiji Restoration and as Japan entered an era of active exchange with foreign countries, the need for script reform in Japan began to be called for. Some scholars argued for the abolition of kanji and the writing of Japanese using only or Latin characters. However, these views were not so widespread.

However, the need to limit the number of kanji characters was understood, and in May 1923, the Japanese government announced 1,962 kanji characters for regular use. In 1940, the Japanese Army decided on the which limited the number of kanji that could be used for weapons names to 1,235. In 1942, the National Language Council announced the with a total of 2,528 characters, showing the standard for kanji used by ministries and agencies and in general society.

In 1946, after World War II and under the Allied Occupation of Japan, the Japanese government, guided by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, instituted a series of orthographic reforms, to help children learn and to simplify kanji use in literature and periodicals.

The number of characters in circulation was reduced, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established.
Some characters were given simplified glyphs, called . Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged.

These are simply guidelines, so many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used; these are known as .

=== kanji===

The are the 1,026 first kanji characters that Japanese children learn in elementary school, from first grade to sixth grade. The grade-level breakdown is known as the , or the . This list of kanji is maintained by the Japanese Ministry of Education and prescribes which kanji characters and which kanji readings students should learn for each grade.

=== kanji===

The are 2,136 characters consisting of all the kanji, plus 1,110 additional kanji taught in junior high and high school. In publishing, characters outside this category are often given . The kanji were introduced in 1981, replacing an older list of 1,850 characters known as the , introduced in 1946. Originally numbering 1,945 characters, the kanji list was expanded to 2,136 in 2010. Some of the new characters were previously kanji; some are used to write prefecture names: , , , , , , , , , and .

=== kanji===

As of September 25, 2017, the consists of 863 characters. Kanji on this list are mostly used in people&#x27;s names and some are traditional variants of kanji. There were only 92 kanji in the original list published in 1952, but new additions have been made frequently. Sometimes the term kanji refers to all 2,999 kanji from both the and lists combined.

=== kanji===

 are any kanji not contained in the kanji and kanji lists. These are generally written using traditional characters, but extended forms exist.

===Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji===
The Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji and define character code-points for each kanji and , as well as other forms of writing such as the Latin alphabet, Cyrillic script, Greek alphabet, Arabic numerals, etc. for use in information processing. They have had numerous revisions. The current standards are:
*JIS X 0208, the most recent version of the main standard. It has 6,355 kanji.
*JIS X 0212, a supplementary standard containing a further 5,801 kanji. This standard is rarely used, mainly because the common Shift JIS encoding system could not use it. This standard is effectively obsolete.
*JIS X 0213, a further revision which extended the JIS X 0208 set with 3,695 additional kanji, of which 2,743 (all but 952) were in JIS X 0212. The standard is in part designed to be compatible with Shift JIS encoding.
*JIS X 0221:1995, the Japanese version of the ISO 10646/Unicode standard.

====Gaiji====
 are kanji that are not represented in existing Japanese encoding systems. These include variant forms of common kanji that need to be represented alongside the more conventional glyph in reference works and can include non-kanji symbols as well.

 can be either user-defined characters, system-specific characters or third-party add-on products. Both are a problem for information interchange, as the code point used to represent an external character will not be consistent from one computer or operating system to another.

 were nominally prohibited in JIS X 0208-1997 where the available number of code-points was reduced to only 940. JIS X 0213-2000 used the entire range of code-points previously allocated to , making them completely unusable. Most desktop and mobile systems have moved to Unicode negating the need for for most users. Nevertheless, they persist today in Japan&#x27;s three major mobile phone information portals, where they are used for emoji (pictorial characters).

Unicode allows for optional encoding of in private use areas, while Adobe&#x27;s SING (Smart INdependent Glyphlets) technology allows the creation of customized gaiji.

The Text Encoding Initiative uses a element to encode any non-standard character or glyph, including gaiji. The &quot;g&quot; stands for .

==Total number of kanji==
There is no definitive count of kanji characters, just as there is none of Chinese characters generally. The , which is considered to be comprehensive in Japan, contains about 50,000 characters. The , published in 1994 in China, contains about 85,000 characters, but the majority of them are not in common use in any country, and many are obscure variants or archaic forms.

A list of 2,136 kanji is regarded as necessary for functional literacy in Japanese. Approximately a thousand more characters are commonly used and readily understood by the majority in Japan and a few thousand more find occasional use, particularly in specialized fields of study but those may be obscure to most out of context. A total of 13,108 characters can be encoded in various Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji.

==Readings==

Individual kanji may be used to write one or more different words or morphemes, leading to different pronunciations or &quot;readings.&quot; The correct reading may be determined by contextual cues (such as whether the character represents part of a compound word versus an independent word), the exact intended meaning of the word, and its position within the sentence. For example, is mostly read , meaning &quot;today&quot;, but in formal writing it is read , meaning &quot;nowadays&quot;. is used to specify ambiguous readings, such as rare, literary, or otherwise non-standard readings.

Readings are catagorized as either , native Japanese, or , borrowed from Chinese. Most kanji have at least a single reading of each catagory, though some have only one, such as or ; Japanese-coined kanji () often only have readings.

Some common kanji have ten or more possible readings; the most complex common example is , which is read as , , , , , , , , , , , and , totaling eight basic readings (the first two are , while the rest are ), or 12 if related verbs are counted as distinct.

=== (Sino-Japanese reading) ===

The , the Sino-Japanese reading, is the modern descendant of the Japanese approximation of the base Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was introduced. It was often previously referred to as translation reading, as it was recreated readings of the Chinese pronunciation but was not the Chinese pronunciation or reading itself, similar to the English pronunciation of Latin loanwords. There also exist kanji created by the Japanese and given an reading despite not being a Chinese-derived or a Chinese-originating character. Some kanji were introduced from different parts of China at different times, and so have multiple , and often multiple meanings. Kanji invented in Japan () would not normally be expected to have , but there are exceptions, such as the character &quot;to work&quot;, which has the &quot; and the &quot;, and &quot;gland&quot;, which has only the &quot;—in both cases these come from the of the phonetic component, respectively &quot; and &quot;&quot;.

=== (native reading) ===

The , the native reading, is a reading based on the pronunciation of a native Japanese word, or , that closely approximated the meaning of the Chinese character when it was introduced. As with , there can be multiple for the same kanji, and some kanji have no at all.

 are characters used only for their sounds. In this case, pronunciation is still based on a standard reading, or used only for meaning (broadly a form of , narrowly ). Therefore, only the full compound—not the individual character—has a reading. There are also special cases where the reading is completely different, often based on a historical or traditional reading.

The analogous phenomenon occurs to a much lesser degree in Chinese varieties, where there are literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters—borrowed readings and native readings. In Chinese these borrowed readings and native readings are etymologically related, since they are between Chinese varieties (which are related), not from Chinese to Japanese (which are not related). They thus form doublets and are generally similar, analogous to different , reflecting different stages of Chinese borrowings into Japanese.

===Gairaigo===
Longer readings exist for non- characters and non-kanji symbols, where a long gairaigo word may be the reading (this is classed as —see single character gairaigo, below)—the character has the seven reading &quot;centimeter&quot;, though it is generally written as &quot;cm&quot; (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space); another common example is &#x27;%&#x27; (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading .

===Mixed readings ===
There are many kanji compounds that use a mixture of and , known as or words (depending on the order), which are themselves examples of this kind of compound (they are autological words): the first character of is read using , the second (, ). It is the other way around with (, ).

Formally, these are referred to as and . In both these words, the has a long vowel; long vowels in Japanese generally are derived from sound changes common to loans from Chinese, hence distinctive of . These are the Japanese form of hybrid words. Other examples include , and .

 often use mixed readings. For instance, the city of Sapporo (), whose name derives from the Ainu language and has no meaning in Japanese, is written with the compound (which includes as if it were a purely compound).

===Special readings===
 and are readings of kanji combinations that have no direct correspondence to the characters&#x27; individual or . From the point of view of the character, rather than the word, this is known as a , and these are listed in kanji dictionaries under the entry for the character.

 are other readings assigned to a character instead of its standard readings. An example is reading (meaning &quot;cold&quot;) as (&quot;winter&quot;) rather than the standard readings or , and instead of the usual spelling for of . Another example is using (lit. &quot;smoke grass&quot;) with the reading (&quot;tobacco&quot;) rather than the otherwise-expected readings of or . Some of these, such as for , have become lexicalized, but in many cases this kind of use is typically non-standard and employed in specific contexts by individual writers. Aided with , could be used to convey complex literary or poetic effect (especially if the readings contradict the kanji), or clarification if the referent may not be obvious.

 are when the standard kanji for a word are related to the meaning, but not the sound. The word is pronounced as a whole, not corresponding to sounds of individual kanji. For example, (&quot;this morning&quot;) is . This word is not read as , the expected of the characters, and only infrequently as , the of the characters. The most common reading is , a native bisyllabic Japanese word that may be seen as a single morpheme, or as a compound of (“this”, as in , the older reading for , “today”), and , “morning”. Likewise, (&quot;today&quot;) is also , usually read with the native reading ; its , , does occur in certain words and expressions, especially in the broader sense &quot;nowadays&quot; or &quot;current&quot;, such as (&quot;present-day&quot;), although in the phrase (&quot;good day&quot;), is typically spelled wholly with rather than with the kanji .

 are primarily used for some native Japanese words, such as Yamato ( or , the name of the dominant ethnic group of Japan, a former Japanese province as well as ancient name for Japan), and for some old borrowings, such as (, literally &quot;willow leaf fish&quot;) from Ainu, (, literally “smoke grass”) from Portuguese, or (, literally “wheat alcohol”) from Dutch, especially if the word was borrowed before the Meiji period. Words whose kanji are are often usually written as (if native), or (if borrowed); some old borrowed words are also written as , especially Portuguese loanwords such as () from Portuguese &quot; (English “card”) or () from Portuguese &quot; (English “times, season”), as well as ().

Sometimes, can even have more kanji than there are syllables, examples being (, “woodpecker”), (, “silver berry, oleaster”), and (, a surname). This phenomenon is observed in animal names that are shortened and used as suffixes for zoological compound names, for example when , normally read as , is shortened to in , although zoological names are commonly spelled with katakana rather than with kanji. Outside zoology, this type of shortening only occurs on a handful of words, for example , or the historical male name suffix , which was shortened from the word .

The kanji compound for is often idiosyncratic and created for the word, and there is no corresponding Chinese word with that spelling. In other cases, a kanji compound for an existing Chinese word is reused, where the Chinese word and may or may not be used in Japanese. For example, (“reindeer”) is for , from Ainu, but the reading of is also used. In some cases, Japanese coinages have subsequently been borrowed back into Chinese, such as (, “monkfish”).

The underlying word for is a native Japanese word or foreign borrowing, which either does not have an existing kanji spelling (either or ) or for which a new kanji spelling is produced. Most often the word is a noun, which may be a simple noun (not a compound or derived from a verb), or may be a verb form or a fusional pronunciation. For example, the word (, “sumo”) is originally from the verb (, “to vie, to compete”), while (, “today”) is fusional (from older , “this” + , “day”).

In rare cases, is also applied to inflectional words (verbs and adjectives), in which case there is frequently a corresponding Chinese word. The most common example of an inflectional is the adjective (, “cute”), originally ; the word is used in Chinese, but the corresponding is not used in Japanese. By contrast, &quot;appropriate&quot; can be either (, as ) or (, as ). Which reading to use can be discerned by the presence or absence of the ending (). A common example of a verb with is (, “to spread, to be in vogue”), corresponding to (). A sample deverbal (noun derived from a verb form) is (, “extortion”), from (, “to extort”), spelling from (, “extortion”). Note that there are also compound verbs and, less commonly, compound adjectives, and while these may have multiple kanji without intervening characters, they are read using the usual . Examples include (, “interesting”, literally “face + white”) and (, “sly”, “cunning, crafty + clever, smart”).

Typographically, the for are often written so they are centered across the entire word, or for inflectional words over the entire root—corresponding to the reading being related to the entire word—rather than each part of the word being centered over its corresponding character, as is often done for the usual phono-semantic readings.

Broadly speaking, can be considered a form of , though in narrow usage, &quot; refers specifically to using characters for sound and not meaning (sound-spelling), whereas &quot; refers to using characters for their meaning and not sound (meaning-spelling). Many (established meaning-spellings) began as (improvised meaning-spellings). Occasionally, a single word will have many such kanji spellings. An extreme example is , which may be spelt in many ways, including , , , , , , , , , and —many of these variant spellings are particular to haiku poems.

===Single character gairaigo===
In some rare cases, kanji may have a reading borrowed from a modern foreign language (&quot;gairaigo&quot;), though usually &quot;gairaigo&quot; are written in . Notable examples include , , , and . These are classed as , because the character is used for its meaning—the &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; label may sometimes be misleading, since most &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; are native Japanese readings. The readings are also rendered in , unlike the usual for native . Note that most of these characters are for units, particularly SI units, in many cases using new characters () coined during the Meiji period, such as .

Some kanji also have lesser-known readings called , which are mostly used for names (often given names) and, in general, are closely related to the . Place names sometimes also use or, occasionally, unique readings not found elsewhere.

===When to use which reading===
Although there are general rules for when to use and when to use , many kanji have multiple on- or kun-readings, and the language is littered with exceptions; how a character was meant to be read is sometimes ambiguous even to native speakers (this is especially true for names, both of people and places). 

A single kanji followed by ( forming part of a word)—such as the inflectable suffixes forming native verbs and adjectives like 赤い (&quot;akai&quot;; red) and 見る (&quot;miru&quot;; to see)—&quot;always&quot; indicates . can indicate which to use, as in () versus (), both meaning &quot;(to) eat&quot;, but this is not always sufficient, as in , which may be read as or , both meaning &quot;(to) open&quot;.
Kanji compounds (), especially yojijukugo, usually, but not always, use , usually (but not always) . In , 解 is read with its &quot;kan-on&quot; reading instead of its more common &quot;go-on&quot; reading, . Exceptions are common— (; information), for example, is &quot;go-kan&quot;. (; beef) and (; mutton) have readings, but (; pork) and (; poultry) have readings. Examples of fully &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; compounds include (; letter), (; parasol), and the infamous (; divine wind). Some &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; compounds have non-inflective , such as (; Chinese-style fried chicken) and (); many can also be written with the omitted. 

Kanji in isolation are typically read using their ; exceptions include the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; (; love), (), and (; mark, dot). Most of these &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; cases involve kanji that have no . For kanji with multiple common isolated readings, such as , which may be read as (gold) or (money, metal), only context can determine the intended reading. 

The isolated kanji versus compound distinction gives words for similar concepts completely different pronunciations. Alone, (north) and (east) use the and , but (northeast), uses the . Inconsistencies also occur between compounds; is read as in (; teacher) but as in (; one&#x27;s whole life) (both &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;). 

Multiple readings have given rise to a number of homographs, in some cases having different meanings depending on how they are read. One example is , which can be read in three different ways: (skilled), (upper part), or (stage left/house right). In addition, has the reading (skilled). More subtly, has three different readings, all meaning &quot;tomorrow&quot;: (casual), (polite), and (formal).

Conversely, some terms are homophonous but not homographic, and thus ambiguous in speech but not in writing. To remedy this, alternate readings may be used for confusable words. For example, (privately established, esp. school) and (municipal) are both normally pronounced ; in speech these may be distinguished by the alternative pronunciations and . More informally, in legal jargon (preamble) and (full text) are both pronounced , so may be pronounced for clarity, as in &quot;Have you memorized the preamble [not &#x27;whole text&#x27;] of the constitution?&quot;. As in these examples, this is primarily done using a for one character in a normally term.

====Legalese====
Certain words take different readings depending on whether the context concerns legal matters or not. For example:
===Ambiguous readings===
In some instances where even context cannot easily provide clarity for homophones, alternative readings or mixed readings can be used instead of regular readings to avoid ambiguity. For example:
There are also cases where the words are technically heterophones, but they have similar meanings and pronunciations, therefore liable to mishearing and misunderstanding.
===Place names===
Several famous place names, including those of Japan itself ( or sometimes ), those of some cities such as Tokyo ( ) and Kyoto ( ), and those of the main islands Honshu ( ), Kyushu ( ), Shikoku ( ), and Hokkaido ( ) are read with ; however, the majority of Japanese place names are read with : , , . Names often use characters and readings that are not in common use outside of names. When characters are used as abbreviations of place names, their reading may not match that in the original. The Osaka () and Kobe () baseball team, the Hanshin () Tigers, take their name from the of the second kanji of and the first of . The name of the Keisei () railway line—linking Tokyo () and Narita ()—is formed similarly, although the reading of from is , despite already being an in the word .

Japanese family names are also usually read with : , , . Japanese given names often have very irregular readings. Although they are not typically considered or , they often contain mixtures of , and , such as [], []. Being chosen at the discretion of the parents, the readings of given names do not follow any set rules, and it is impossible to know with certainty how to read a person&#x27;s name without independent verification. Parents can be quite creative, and rumours abound of children called (&quot;Earth&quot;) and (&quot;Angel&quot;); neither are common names, and have normal readings and respectively. Some common Japanese names can be written in multiple ways, e.g., Akira can be written as , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and many other characters and kanji combinations not listed, Satoshi can be written as , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , etc., and Haruka can be written as , , , , , , , , and several other possibilities. Common patterns do exist, however, allowing experienced readers to make a good guess for most names. To alleviate any confusion on how to pronounce the names of other Japanese people, most official Japanese documents require Japanese to write their names in both and kanji.

Chinese place names and Chinese personal names appearing in Japanese texts, if spelled in kanji, are almost invariably read with . Especially for older and well-known names, the resulting Japanese pronunciation may differ widely from that used by modern Chinese speakers. For example, Mao Zedong&#x27;s name is pronounced as in Japanese, and the name of the legendary Monkey King, Sun Wukong, is pronounced () in Japanese.

Today, Chinese names that are not well known in Japan are often spelled in instead, in a form much more closely approximating the native Chinese pronunciation. Alternatively, they may be written in kanji with . Many such cities have names that come from non-Chinese languages like Mongolian or Manchu. Examples of such not-well-known Chinese names include:

Internationally renowned Chinese-named cities tend to imitate the older English pronunciations of their names, regardless of the kanji&#x27;s or the Mandarin or Cantonese pronunciation, and can be written in either or kanji. Examples include:
Notes: 
*Guangzhou, the city, is pronounced , while Guangdong, its province, is pronounced , not (in this case, opting for a reading rather than the usual reading).
*Kaohsiung was originally pronounced (or similar) in Hokkien and Japanese. It received this written name (kanji/Chinese) from Japanese, and later its spoken Mandarin name from the corresponding characters. The English name &quot;Kaohsiung&quot; derived from its Mandarin pronunciation. Today it is pronounced either or in Japanese.
*Taipei is generally pronounced in Japanese.

In some cases the same kanji can appear in a given word with different readings. Normally this occurs when a character is duplicated and the reading of the second character has voicing (), as in &quot;people&quot; (more often written with the iteration mark as ), but in rare cases the readings can be unrelated, as in .

===Pronunciation assistance===
Because of the ambiguities involved, kanji sometimes have their pronunciation for the given context spelled out in ruby characters known as , (small written above or to the right of the character, e.g. ) or (small written in-line after the character). This is especially true in texts for children or foreign learners. It is also used in newspapers and for rare or unusual readings, or for situations like the first time a character&#x27;s name is given, and for characters not included in the officially recognized set of essential kanji. Works of fiction sometimes use to create new &quot;words&quot; by giving normal kanji non-standard readings, or to attach a foreign word rendered in as the reading for a kanji or kanji compound of the same or similar meaning.

===Spelling words===
Conversely, specifying a given kanji, or spelling out a kanji word—whether the pronunciation is known or not—can be complicated, due to the fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji (one does not refer to &quot;kanji #237&quot;), and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji—indeed there are many homophonous &quot;words&quot;, not simply individual characters, particularly for (with ). It is easiest to write the word out—either on paper or tracing it in the air—or look it up (given the pronunciation) in a dictionary, particularly an electronic dictionary; when this is not possible, such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available (and tracing in air is too complicated), various techniques can be used. These include giving for characters—these are often unique—using a well-known word with the same character (and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning), and describing the character via its components. For example, one may explain how to spell the word via the words , , and —the first two use the , the third is a well-known compound—saying &quot;, , as in .&quot;

===Dictionaries===
In dictionaries, both words and individual characters have readings glossed, via various conventions. Native words and Sino-Japanese vocabulary are glossed in (for both and readings), while borrowings ()—including modern borrowings from Chinese—are glossed in ; this is the standard writing convention also used in . By contrast, readings for individual characters are conventionally written in for &quot;on&quot; readings, and for &quot;kun&quot; readings. Kun readings may further have a separator to indicate which characters are , and which are considered readings of the character itself. For example, in the entry for , the reading corresponding to the basic verb may be written as (&quot;ta.beru&quot;), to indicate that &quot;ta&quot; is the reading of the character itself. Further, kanji dictionaries often list compounds including irregular readings of a kanji.

==Local developments and divergences from Chinese==
Since kanji are essentially Chinese &quot;hanzi&quot; used to write Japanese, the majority of characters used in modern Japanese still retain their Chinese meaning, physical resemblance with some of their modern traditional Chinese characters counterparts, and a degree of similarity with Classical Chinese pronunciation imported to Japan from the 5th to 9th centuries. Nevertheless, after centuries of development, there is a notable number of kanji used in modern Japanese which have different meaning from &quot;hanzi&quot; used in modern Chinese. Such differences are the result of:
* the use of characters created in Japan,
* characters that have been given different meanings in Japanese, and 
* post-World War II simplifications () of the character.

Likewise, the process of character simplification in mainland China since the 1950s has resulted in the fact that Japanese speakers who have not studied Chinese may not recognize some simplified characters.

In addition to unique Japanese renditions of existing Chinese characters, there also exist kanji that were invented in Japan; these may be referred to as or . They are primarily formed by combining existing components in unique ways, as is typical for Chinese characters. The &quot;Jōyō&quot; list contains about 9 &quot;kokuji&quot;, of which the most commonly used is (&quot;dō&quot;; work) used in the fundamental verb (&quot;hataraku&quot;; to work). It is formed from the &#x27;person&#x27; radical 亻 plus 動 (movement). Some &quot;kokuji&quot;, including 働, have entered the Chinese language.

The term &quot;kokuji&quot; may also refer to Chinese characters coined in other (non-Chinese) countries; the corresponding phenomenon in Korea is called (; national characters); there are however far fewer Korean-coined characters than Japanese-coined ones. Other languages using the Chinese family of scripts sometimes have far more extensive systems of native characters, most significantly Vietnamese , which comprises over 20,000 characters used throughout traditional Vietnamese writing, and Zhuang sawndip, which comprises over 10,000 characters, which are still in use.
In addition to , there are kanji that have been given meanings in Japanese that are different from their original Chinese meanings. These are not considered but are instead called () and include characters such as the following:

==Types of kanji by category==
Han-dynasty scholar Xu Shen, in his 2nd-century dictionary , classified Chinese characters into six categories ( , Japanese: ). The traditional classification is still taught but is problematic and is no longer the focus of modern lexicographic practice, as some categories are not clearly defined, nor are they mutually exclusive: the first four refer to structural composition, while the last two refer to usage.
 (Mandarin: ) characters are pictographic sketches of the object they represent. For example, is an eye, while is a tree. The current forms of the characters are very different from the originals, though their representations are more clear in oracle bone script and seal script. These pictographic characters make up only a small fraction of modern characters.
 (Mandarin: ) characters are ideographs, often called &quot;simple ideographs&quot; or &quot;simple indicatives&quot; to distinguish them and tell the difference from compound ideographs (below). They are usually simple graphically and represent an abstract concept such as &quot;up&quot; or &quot;above&quot; and &quot;down&quot; or &quot;below&quot;. These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.
 (Mandarin: ) characters are compound ideographs, often called &quot;compound indicatives&quot;, &quot;associative compounds&quot;, or just &quot;ideographs&quot;. These are usually a combination of pictographs that combine semantically to present an overall meaning. An example of this type is (rest) from (person radical) and (tree). Another is the (mountain pass) made from (mountain), (up) and (down). These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.
 (Mandarin: ) characters are phono-semantic or radical-phonetic compounds, sometimes called &quot;semantic-phonetic&quot;, &quot;semasio-phonetic&quot;, or &quot;phonetic-ideographic&quot; characters, are by far the largest category, making up about 90% of the characters in the standard lists; however, some of the most frequently used kanji belong to one of the three groups mentioned above, so will usually make up less than 90% of the characters in a text. Typically they are made up of two components, one of which (most commonly, but by no means always, the left or top element) suggests the general category of the meaning or semantic context, and the other (most commonly the right or bottom element) approximates the pronunciation. The pronunciation relates to the original Chinese, and may now only be distantly detectable in the modern Japanese of the kanji; it generally has no relation at all to . The same is true of the semantic context, which may have changed over the centuries or in the transition from Chinese to Japanese. As a result, it is a common error in folk etymology to fail to recognize a phono-semantic compound, typically instead inventing a compound-indicative explanation.
 (Mandarin: ) characters have variously been called &quot;derivative characters&quot;, &quot;derivative cognates&quot;, or translated as &quot;mutually explanatory&quot; or &quot;mutually synonymous&quot; characters; this is the most problematic of the six categories, as it is vaguely defined. It may refer to kanji where the meaning or application has become extended. For example, is used for &#x27;music&#x27; and &#x27;comfort, ease&#x27;, with different pronunciations in Chinese reflected in the two different , &quot;music&quot; and &quot;pleasure&quot;.
 (Mandarin: ) are rebuses, sometimes called &quot;phonetic loans&quot;. The etymology of the characters follows one of the patterns above, but the present-day meaning is completely unrelated to this. A character was appropriated to represent a similar-sounding word. For example, in ancient Chinese was originally a pictograph for &quot;wheat&quot;. Its syllable was homophonous with the verb meaning &quot;to come&quot;, and the character is used for that verb as a result, without any embellishing &quot;meaning&quot; element attached. The character for wheat , originally meant &quot;to come&quot;, being a having &#x27;foot&#x27; at the bottom for its meaning part and &quot;wheat&quot; at the top for sound. The two characters swapped meaning, so today the more common word has the simpler character. This borrowing of sounds has a very long history.

==Related symbols==

The iteration mark () is used to indicate that the preceding kanji is to be repeated, functioning similarly to a ditto mark in English. It is pronounced as though the kanji were written twice in a row, for example and . This mark also appears in personal and place names, as in the surname Sasaki (). This symbol is a simplified version of the kanji , a variant of .

Another abbreviated symbol is , in appearance a small , but actually a simplified version of the kanji , a general counter. It is pronounced when used to indicate quantity (such as , &quot;six months&quot;) or if used as a genitive (as in &quot;Sekigahara&quot;).

The way how these symbols may be produced on a computer depends on the operating system. In macOS, typing will reveal the symbol as well as , and . To produce , type . Under Windows, typing will reveal some of these symbols, while in Google IME, may be used.

==Collation==
Kanji, whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by conventions such as those used for the Latin script, are often collated using the traditional Chinese radical-and-stroke sorting method. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called radicals. Characters are grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. For example, the kanji character , meaning &quot;cherry&quot;, is sorted as a ten-stroke character under the four-stroke primary radical meaning &quot;tree&quot;. When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation.

Other kanji sorting methods, such as the SKIP system, have been devised by various authors.

Modern general-purpose Japanese dictionaries (as opposed to specifically character dictionaries) generally collate all entries, including words written using kanji, according to their representations (reflecting the way they are pronounced). The ordering of is normally used for this purpose.

==Kanji education==
Japanese schoolchildren are expected to learn 1,026 basic kanji, the kanji, before finishing the sixth grade. The order in which these characters are learned is fixed. The kanji list is a subset of a larger list, originally of 1,945 kanji and extended to 2,136 in 2010, known as the kanji required for the level of fluency necessary to read newspapers and literature in Japanese. This larger list of characters is to be mastered by the end of the ninth grade. Schoolchildren learn the characters by repetition and radical.

Students studying Japanese as a foreign language are often required by a curriculum to acquire kanji without having first learned the vocabulary associated with them. Strategies for these learners vary from copying-based methods to mnemonic-based methods such as those used in James Heisig&#x27;s series &quot;Remembering the Kanji&quot;. Other textbooks use methods based on the etymology of the characters, such as Mathias and Habein&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Guide to Everyday Kanji&quot; and Henshall&#x27;s &quot;A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters&quot;. Pictorial mnemonics, as in the text &quot;Kanji Pict-o-graphix&quot; by Michael Rowley, are also seen.

The Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation provides the ( ; &quot;Test of Japanese Kanji Aptitude&quot;), which tests the ability to read and write kanji. The highest level of the tests about six thousand kanji.
