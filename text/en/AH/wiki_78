<text>In mathematical analysis, the Dirac delta function (or distribution), also known as the unit impulse, is a generalized function on the real numbers, whose value is zero everywhere except at zero, and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one. Thus it can be represented heuristically as

formula_1

such that

formula_2

Since there is no function having this property, modelling the delta &quot;function&quot; rigorously involves the use of limits or, as is common in mathematics, measure theory and the theory of distributions.

The delta function was introduced by physicist Paul Dirac, and has since been applied routinely in physics and engineering to model point masses and instantaneous impulses. It is called the delta function because it is a continuous analogue of the Kronecker delta function, which is usually defined on a discrete domain and takes values 0 and 1. The mathematical rigor of the delta function was disputed until Laurent Schwartz developed the theory of distributions, where it is defined as a linear form acting on functions.

== Motivation and overview ==
The graph of the Dirac delta is usually thought of as following the whole &quot;x&quot;-axis and the positive &quot;y&quot;-axis. The Dirac delta is used to model a tall narrow spike function (an &quot;impulse&quot;), and other similar abstractions such as a point charge, point mass or electron point. For example, to calculate the dynamics of a billiard ball being struck, one can approximate the force of the impact by a Dirac delta. In doing so, one not only simplifies the equations, but one also is able to calculate the motion of the ball, by only considering the total impulse of the collision, without a detailed model of all of the elastic energy transfer at subatomic levels (for instance).

To be specific, suppose that a billiard ball is at rest. At time formula_3 it is struck by another ball, imparting it with a momentum , with units kg⋅m⋅s−1. The exchange of momentum is not actually instantaneous, being mediated by elastic processes at the molecular and subatomic level, but for practical purposes it is convenient to consider that energy transfer as effectively instantaneous. The force therefore is ; the units of are s−1.

To model this situation more rigorously, suppose that the force instead is uniformly distributed over a small time interval That is,

formula_4

Then the momentum at any time is found by integration:

formula_5

Now, the model situation of an instantaneous transfer of momentum requires taking the limit as , giving a result everywhere except at :

formula_6

Here the functions formula_7 are thought of as useful approximations to the idea of instantaneous transfer of momentum.

The delta function allows us to construct an idealized limit of these approximations. Unfortunately, the actual limit of the functions (in the sense of pointwise convergence) formula_8 is zero everywhere but a single point, where it is infinite. To make proper sense of the Dirac delta, we should instead insist that the property

formula_9

which holds for all should continue to hold in the limit. So, in the equation it is understood that the limit is always taken .

In applied mathematics, as we have done here, the delta function is often manipulated as a kind of limit (a weak limit) of a sequence of functions, each member of which has a tall spike at the origin: for example, a sequence of Gaussian distributions centered at the origin with variance tending to zero.

The Dirac delta is not truly a function, at least not a usual one with domain and range in real numbers. For example, the objects and are equal everywhere except at yet have integrals that are different. According to Lebesgue integration theory, if and are functions such that almost everywhere, then is integrable if and only if is integrable and the integrals of and are identical. A rigorous approach to regarding the Dirac delta function as a mathematical object in its own right requires measure theory or the theory of distributions.

==History==
In physics, the Dirac delta function was popularized by Paul Dirac in this book &quot;The Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot; published in 1930. However, Oliver Heaviside, 35 years before Dirac, described an impulsive function called the Heaviside step function for purposes and with properties analogous to Dirac&#x27;s work. Even earlier several mathematicians and physicists used limits of sharply peaked functions in derivations.
An infinitesimal formula for an infinitely tall, unit impulse delta function (infinitesimal version of Cauchy distribution) explicitly appears in an 1827 text of Augustin-Louis Cauchy. Siméon Denis Poisson considered the issue in connection with the study of wave propagation as did Gustav Kirchhoff somewhat later. Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz also introduced the unit impulse as a limit of Gaussians, which also corresponded to Lord Kelvin&#x27;s notion of a point heat source. The Dirac delta function as such was introduced by Paul Dirac in his 1927 paper &quot;The Physical Interpretation of the Quantum Dynamics.&quot; He called it the &quot;delta function&quot; since he used it as a continuum analogue of the discrete Kronecker delta.

Mathematicians refer to the same concept as a distribution rather than a function.
Joseph Fourier presented what is now called the Fourier integral theorem in his treatise &quot;Théorie analytique de la chaleur&quot; in the form:

formula_10

which is tantamount to the introduction of the -function in the form:

formula_11

Later, Augustin Cauchy expressed the theorem using exponentials:

formula_12

Cauchy pointed out that in some circumstances the &quot;order&quot; of integration is significant in this result (contrast Fubini&#x27;s theorem).

As justified using the theory of distributions, the Cauchy equation can be rearranged to resemble Fourier&#x27;s original formulation and expose the &quot;δ&quot;-function as

formula_13

where the &quot;δ&quot;-function is expressed as

formula_14

A rigorous interpretation of the exponential form and the various limitations upon the function &quot;f&quot; necessary for its application extended over several centuries. The problems with a classical interpretation are explained as follows:
: The greatest drawback of the classical Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed. Namely, it is necessary that these functions decrease sufficiently rapidly to zero (in the neighborhood of infinity) to ensure the existence of the Fourier integral. For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension of the classical Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.

Further developments included generalization of the Fourier integral, &quot;beginning with Plancherel&#x27;s pathbreaking &quot;L&quot;2-theory (1910), continuing with Wiener&#x27;s and Bochner&#x27;s works (around 1930) and culminating with the amalgamation into L. Schwartz&#x27;s theory of distributions (1945) ...&quot;, and leading to the formal development of the Dirac delta function.

==Definitions==
The Dirac delta function formula_15 can be loosely thought of as a function on the real line which is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is infinite,

formula_16

and which is also constrained to satisfy the identity

formula_17

This is merely a heuristic characterization. The Dirac delta is not a function in the traditional sense as no extended real number valued function defined on the real numbers has these properties.

===As a measure===
One way to rigorously capture the notion of the Dirac delta function is to define a measure, called Dirac measure, which accepts a subset of the real line as an argument, and returns if , and otherwise. If the delta function is conceptualized as modeling an idealized point mass at 0, then represents the mass contained in the set . One may then define the integral against as the integral of a function against this mass distribution. Formally, the Lebesgue integral provides the necessary analytic device. The Lebesgue integral with respect to the measure satisfies

formula_18

for all continuous compactly supported functions . The measure is not absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure—in fact, it is a singular measure. Consequently, the delta measure has no Radon–Nikodym derivative (with respect to Lebesgue measure)—no true function for which the property

formula_19

holds. As a result, the latter notation is a convenient abuse of notation, and not a standard (Riemann or Lebesgue) integral.

As a probability measure on , the delta measure is characterized by its cumulative distribution function, which is the unit step function.

formula_20

This means that is the integral of the cumulative indicator function with respect to the measure ; to wit,

formula_21

the latter being the measure of this interval. Thus in particular the integration of the delta function against a continuous function can be properly understood as a Riemann–Stieltjes integral:

formula_22

All higher moments of are zero. In particular, characteristic function and moment generating function are both equal to one.

===As a distribution===
In the theory of distributions, a generalized function is considered not a function in itself but only through how it affects other functions when &quot;integrated&quot; against them. In keeping with this philosophy, to define the delta function properly, it is enough to say what the &quot;integral&quot; of the delta function is against a sufficiently &quot;good&quot; test function . Test functions are also known as bump functions. If the delta function is already understood as a measure, then the Lebesgue integral of a test function against that measure supplies the necessary integral.

A typical space of test functions consists of all smooth functions on with compact support that have as many derivatives as required. As a distribution, the Dirac delta is a linear functional on the space of test functions and is defined by

for every test function .

For to be properly a distribution, it must be continuous in a suitable topology on the space of test functions. In general, for a linear functional on the space of test functions to define a distribution, it is necessary and sufficient that, for every positive integer there is an integer and a constant such that for every test function , one has the inequality

formula_23

where represents the supremum. With the distribution, one has such an inequality (with with for all . Thus is a distribution of order zero. It is, furthermore, a distribution with compact support (the support being ).

The delta distribution can also be defined in several equivalent ways. For instance, it is the distributional derivative of the Heaviside step function. This means that for every test function , one has

formula_24

Intuitively, if integration by parts were permitted, then the latter integral should simplify to

formula_25

and indeed, a form of integration by parts is permitted for the Stieltjes integral, and in that case, one does have

formula_26

In the context of measure theory, the Dirac measure gives rise to distribution by integration. Conversely, equation () defines a Daniell integral on the space of all compactly supported continuous functions which, by the Riesz representation theorem, can be represented as the Lebesgue integral of with respect to some Radon measure.

Generally, when the term &quot;Dirac delta function&quot; is used, it is in the sense of distributions rather than measures, the Dirac measure being among several terms for the corresponding notion in measure theory. Some sources may also use the term &quot;Dirac delta distribution&quot;.

===Generalizations===
The delta function can be defined in -dimensional Euclidean space as the measure such that

formula_27

for every compactly supported continuous function . As a measure, the -dimensional delta function is the product measure of the 1-dimensional delta functions in each variable separately. Thus, formally, with , one has

The delta function can also be defined in the sense of distributions exactly as above in the one-dimensional case. However, despite widespread use in engineering contexts, () should be manipulated with care, since the product of distributions can only be defined under quite narrow circumstances.

The notion of a Dirac measure makes sense on any set. Thus if is a set, is a marked point, and is any sigma algebra of subsets of , then the measure defined on sets by

formula_28

is the delta measure or unit mass concentrated at .

Another common generalization of the delta function is to a differentiable manifold where most of its properties as a distribution can also be exploited because of the differentiable structure. The delta function on a manifold centered at the point is defined as the following distribution:

for all compactly supported smooth real-valued functions on . A common special case of this construction is a case in which is an open set in the Euclidean space .

On a locally compact Hausdorff space , the Dirac delta measure concentrated at a point is the Radon measure associated with the Daniell integral () on compactly supported continuous functions . At this level of generality, calculus as such is no longer possible, however a variety of techniques from abstract analysis are available. For instance, the mapping formula_29 is a continuous embedding of into the space of finite Radon measures on , equipped with its vague topology. Moreover, the convex hull of the image of under this embedding is dense in the space of probability measures on .

==Properties==

===Scaling and symmetry===
The delta function satisfies the following scaling property for a non-zero scalar :

formula_30

Then is obtained by applying a power of the Laplacian to the integral with respect to the unit sphere measure of for in the unit sphere :
formula_31

The Laplacian here is interpreted as a weak derivative, so that this equation is taken to mean that, for any test function ,
formula_32

The result follows from the formula for the Newtonian potential (the fundamental solution of Poisson&#x27;s equation). This is essentially a form of the inversion formula for the Radon transform because it recovers the value of from its integrals over hyperplanes. For instance, if is odd and , then the integral on the right hand side is
formula_33

where is the Radon transform of :
formula_34

An alternative equivalent expression of the plane wave decomposition is:
formula_35

===Fourier transform===
The delta function is a tempered distribution, and therefore it has a well-defined Fourier transform. Formally, one finds

formula_36

Properly speaking, the Fourier transform of a distribution is defined by imposing self-adjointness of the Fourier transform under the duality pairing formula_37 of tempered distributions with Schwartz functions. Thus formula_38 is defined as the unique tempered distribution satisfying

formula_39

for all Schwartz functions . And indeed it follows from this that formula_40

As a result of this identity, the convolution of the delta function with any other tempered distribution is simply :

formula_41

That is to say that is an identity element for the convolution on tempered distributions, and in fact, the space of compactly supported distributions under convolution is an associative algebra with identity the delta function. This property is fundamental in signal processing, as convolution with a tempered distribution is a linear time-invariant system, and applying the linear time-invariant system measures its impulse response. The impulse response can be computed to any desired degree of accuracy by choosing a suitable approximation for , and once it is known, it characterizes the system completely. See .

The inverse Fourier transform of the tempered distribution is the delta function. Formally, this is expressed as
formula_42
and more rigorously, it follows since
formula_43
for all Schwartz functions .

In these terms, the delta function provides a suggestive statement of the orthogonality property of the Fourier kernel on . Formally, one has
formula_44

This is, of course, shorthand for the assertion that the Fourier transform of the tempered distribution
formula_45
is
formula_46
which again follows by imposing self-adjointness of the Fourier transform.

By analytic continuation of the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of the delta function is found to be
formula_47

====Fourier kernels====

In the study of Fourier series, a major question consists of determining whether and in what sense the Fourier series associated with a periodic function converges to the function. The -th partial sum of the Fourier series of a function of period is defined by convolution (on the interval ) with the Dirichlet kernel:
formula_48
Thus,
formula_49
where
formula_50
A fundamental result of elementary Fourier series states that the Dirichlet kernel restricted to the interval  tends to a multiple of the delta function as . This is interpreted in the distribution sense, that
formula_51
for every compactly supported function . Thus, formally one has
formula_52
on the interval .

Despite this, the result does not hold for all compactly supported functions: that is does not converge weakly in the sense of measures. The lack of convergence of the Fourier series has led to the introduction of a variety of summability methods to produce convergence. The method of Cesàro summation leads to the Fejér kernel

formula_53

The Fejér kernels tend to the delta function in a stronger sense that

formula_54

for every compactly supported function . The implication is that the Fourier series of any continuous function is Cesàro summable to the value of the function at every point.

===Hilbert space theory===
The Dirac delta distribution is a densely defined unbounded linear functional on the Hilbert space L2 of square-integrable functions. Indeed, smooth compactly supported functions are dense in , and the action of the delta distribution on such functions is well-defined. In many applications, it is possible to identify subspaces of and to give a stronger topology on which the delta function defines a bounded linear functional.

====Sobolev spaces====
The Sobolev embedding theorem for Sobolev spaces on the real line implies that any square-integrable function such that

formula_55

is automatically continuous, and satisfies in particular

formula_56

Thus is a bounded linear functional on the Sobolev space . Equivalently is an element of the continuous dual space of . More generally, in dimensions, one has provided .

====Spaces of holomorphic functions====
In complex analysis, the delta function enters via Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula, which asserts that if is a domain in the complex plane with smooth boundary, then

formula_57

for all holomorphic functions in that are continuous on the closure of . As a result, the delta function is represented in this class of holomorphic functions by the Cauchy integral:

formula_58

Moreover, let be the Hardy space consisting of the closure in of all holomorphic functions in continuous up to the boundary of . Then functions in uniquely extend to holomorphic functions in , and the Cauchy integral formula continues to hold. In particular for , the delta function is a continuous linear functional on . This is a special case of the situation in several complex variables in which, for smooth domains , the Szegő kernel plays the role of the Cauchy integral.

Another representation of the delta function in a space of holomorphic functions is on the space formula_59 of square-integrable holomorphic functions in an open set formula_60. This is a closed subspace of formula_61, and therefore is a Hilbert space. On the other hand, the functional that evaluates a holomorphic function in formula_59 at a point formula_63 of formula_64 is a continuous functional, and so by the Riesz representation theorem, is represented by integration against a kernel formula_65, the Bergman kernel. This kernel is the analog of the delta function in this Hilbert space. A Hilbert space having such a kernel is called a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In the special case of the unit disc, one has
formula_66

====Resolutions of the identity====
Given a complete orthonormal basis set of functions in a separable Hilbert space, for example, the normalized eigenvectors of a compact self-adjoint operator, any vector can be expressed as
formula_67
The coefficients {αn} are found as
formula_68
which may be represented by the notation:
formula_69
a form of the bra–ket notation of Dirac. Adopting this notation, the expansion of takes the dyadic form:

formula_70

Letting denote the identity operator on the Hilbert space, the expression

formula_71

is called a resolution of the identity. When the Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable functions on a domain , the quantity:

formula_72

is an integral operator, and the expression for can be rewritten

formula_73

The right-hand side converges to in the sense. It need not hold in a pointwise sense, even when is a continuous function. Nevertheless, it is common to abuse notation and write

formula_74

resulting in the representation of the delta function:

formula_75

With a suitable rigged Hilbert space where contains all compactly supported smooth functions, this summation may converge in , depending on the properties of the basis . In most cases of practical interest, the orthonormal basis comes from an integral or differential operator (e.g. the heat kernel), in which case the series converges in the distribution sense.

===Infinitesimal delta functions===
Cauchy used an infinitesimal to write down a unit impulse, infinitely tall and narrow Dirac-type delta function satisfying formula_76 in a number of articles in 1827. Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in &quot;Cours d&#x27;Analyse&quot; (1827) in terms of a sequence tending to zero. Namely, such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy&#x27;s and Lazare Carnot&#x27;s terminology.

Non-standard analysis allows one to rigorously treat infinitesimals. The article by contains a bibliography on modern Dirac delta functions in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum provided by the hyperreals. Here the Dirac delta can be given by an actual function, having the property that for every real function one has formula_77 as anticipated by Fourier and Cauchy.

==Dirac comb==
A so-called uniform &quot;pulse train&quot; of Dirac delta measures, which is known as a Dirac comb, or as the Sha distribution, creates a sampling function, often used in digital signal processing (DSP) and discrete time signal analysis. The Dirac comb is given as the infinite sum, whose limit is understood in the distribution sense,

formula_78

which is a sequence of point masses at each of the integers.

Up to an overall normalizing constant, the Dirac comb is equal to its own Fourier transform. This is significant because if is any Schwartz function, then the periodization of is given by the convolution
formula_79
In particular,
formula_80
is precisely the Poisson summation formula.
More generally, this formula remains to be true if is a tempered distribution of rapid descent or, equivalently, if formula_81 is a slowly growing, ordinary function within the space of tempered distributions.

==Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem==
The Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem, important in quantum mechanics, relates the delta function to the distribution , the Cauchy principal value of the function , defined by

formula_82

Sokhotsky&#x27;s formula states that

formula_83

Here the limit is understood in the distribution sense, that for all compactly supported smooth functions ,

formula_84

==Relationship to the Kronecker delta==
The Kronecker delta is the quantity defined by

formula_85

for all integers , . This function then satisfies the following analog of the sifting property: if (for in the set of all integers) is any doubly infinite sequence, then

formula_86

Similarly, for any real or complex valued continuous function on , the Dirac delta satisfies the sifting property

formula_87

This exhibits the Kronecker delta function as a discrete analog of the Dirac delta function.

==Applications==

===Probability theory===
In probability theory and statistics, the Dirac delta function is often used to represent a discrete distribution, or a partially discrete, partially continuous distribution, using a probability density function (which is normally used to represent absolutely continuous distributions). For example, the probability density function of a discrete distribution consisting of points , with corresponding probabilities , can be written as

formula_88

As another example, consider a distribution in which 6/10 of the time returns a standard normal distribution, and 4/10 of the time returns exactly the value 3.5 (i.e. a partly continuous, partly discrete mixture distribution). The density function of this distribution can be written as

formula_89

The delta function is also used to represent the resulting probability density function of a random variable that is transformed by continuously differentiable function. If is a continuous differentiable function, then the density of can be written as

formula_90

The delta function is also used in a completely different way to represent the local time of a diffusion process (like Brownian motion). The local time of a stochastic process is given by
formula_91
and represents the amount of time that the process spends at the point in the range of the process. More precisely, in one dimension this integral can be written
formula_92
where formula_93 is the indicator function of the interval formula_94

===Quantum mechanics===
The delta function is expedient in quantum mechanics. The wave function of a particle gives the probability amplitude of finding a particle within a given region of space. Wave functions are assumed to be elements of the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions, and the total probability of finding a particle within a given interval is the integral of the magnitude of the wave function squared over the interval. A set of wave functions is orthonormal if

formula_95

where is the Kronecker delta. A set of orthonormal wave functions is complete in the space of square-integrable functions if any wave function can be expressed as a linear combination of the with complex coefficients:

formula_96

where . Complete orthonormal systems of wave functions appear naturally as the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (of a bound system) in quantum mechanics that measures the energy levels, which are called the eigenvalues. The set of eigenvalues, in this case, is known as the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. In bra–ket notation this equality implies the resolution of the identity:

formula_97

Here the eigenvalues are assumed to be discrete, but the set of eigenvalues of an observable can also be continuous. An example is the position operator, . The spectrum of the position (in one dimension) is the entire real line and is called a continuous spectrum. However, unlike the Hamiltonian, the position operator lacks proper eigenfunctions. The conventional way to overcome this shortcoming is to widen the class of available functions by allowing distributions as well, i.e., to replace the Hilbert space with a rigged Hilbert space. In this context, the position operator has a complete set of &quot;generalized eigenfunctions&quot;, labeled by the points of the real line, given by

formula_98

The generalized eigenfunctions of the position operator are called the &quot;eigenkets&quot; and are denoted by .

Similar considerations apply to any other (unbounded) self-adjoint operator with continuous spectrum and no degenerate eigenvalues, such as the momentum operator . In that case, there is a set of real numbers (the spectrum) and a collection of distributions with such that

formula_99

That is, are the generalized eigenvectors of . If they form an &quot;orthonormal basis&quot; in the distribution sense, that is:

formula_100

then for any test function ,

formula_101

where . That is, there is a resolution of the identity

formula_102

where the operator-valued integral is again understood in the weak sense. If the spectrum of has both continuous and discrete parts, then the resolution of the identity involves a summation over the discrete spectrum and an integral over the continuous spectrum.

The delta function also has many more specialized applications in quantum mechanics, such as the delta potential models for a single and double potential well.

===Structural mechanics===
The delta function can be used in structural mechanics to describe transient loads or point loads acting on structures. The governing equation of a simple mass–spring system excited by a sudden force impulse at time can be written

formula_103

where is the mass, is the deflection, and is the spring constant.

As another example, the equation governing the static deflection of a slender beam is, according to Euler–Bernoulli theory,

formula_104

where is the bending stiffness of the beam, is the deflection, is the spatial coordinate, and is the load distribution. If a beam is loaded by a point force at , the load distribution is written

formula_105

As the integration of the delta function results in the Heaviside step function, it follows that the static deflection of a slender beam subject to multiple point loads is described by a set of piecewise polynomials.

Also, a point moment acting on a beam can be described by delta functions. Consider two opposing point forces at a distance apart. They then produce a moment acting on the beam. Now, let the distance approach the limit zero, while is kept constant. The load distribution, assuming a clockwise moment acting at , is written

formula_106

Point moments can thus be represented by the derivative of the delta function. Integration of the beam equation again results in piecewise polynomial deflection.

<text>A courtesan is a prostitute with a courtly, wealthy, or upper-class clientele. Historically, the term referred to a courtier, a person who attended the court of a monarch or other powerful person.

== History ==

In European feudal society, the court was the centre of government as well as the residence of the monarch, and social and political life were often completely mixed together. Prior to the Renaissance, courtesans served to convey information to visiting dignitaries, when servants could not be trusted. In Renaissance Europe, courtiers played an extremely important role in upper-class society. As it was customary during this time for royal couples to lead separate lives—commonly marrying simply to preserve bloodlines and to secure political alliances—men and women would often seek gratification and companionship from people living at court. In fact, the verb &#x27;to court&#x27; originally meant &quot;to be or reside at court&quot;, and later came to mean &quot;to behave as a courtier&quot; and then &#x27;courtship&#x27;, or &quot;to pay amorous attention to somebody&quot;. The most intimate companion of a ruler was called the &quot;favourite&quot;.

In Renaissance usage, the Italian word &quot;cortigiana&quot;, feminine of &quot;cortigiano&quot; (&quot;courtier&quot;), came to refer to a person who attends the court, and then to a well-educated and independent woman, eventually a trained artist or artisan of dance and singing, especially one associated with wealthy, powerful, or upper-class society who was given luxuries and status in exchange for entertainment and companionship. In English, the word was borrowed from Italian during the 16th century through the French form &quot;courtisane&quot;, especially associated with the meaning of &quot;donna di palazzo&quot;.

A male figure comparable to the courtesan was the Italian &quot;cicisbeo&quot;, the French &quot;chevalier servant&quot;, the Spanish &quot;cortejo&quot; or &quot;estrecho&quot;.

The courtesans of East Asia, particularly those of the Japanese empire, held a different social role than that of their European counterparts. Examples of Japanese courtesans included the oiran class, who were more focused on the aspect of entertainment than European courtesans.

Courtesans or dancers of ancient India known as ganikas were the center of city life. According to historian Sanjay K. Gautam, the courtesan in India was &quot;a symbol of both sexual-erotic and aesthetic pleasure&quot;.

==Categories==

One type of courtesan was known (in Italy) as the &quot;cortigiana onesta&quot;, or the honest courtesan, who was cast as an intellectual. Another was the &quot;cortigiana di lume&quot;, a lower class of courtesan. The former was the sort most often romanticized and treated more-or-less equal to women of the nobility. It is with this type of courtesan that the art of &quot;courtisanerie&quot; is best associated.

The &quot;cortigiane oneste&quot; were usually well-educated and worldly (sometimes even more so than the average upper-class woman), and often held simultaneous careers as performers or artists. They were typically chosen on the basis of their &quot;breeding&quot;—social and conversational skills, intelligence, common sense, and companionship—as well as their physical attributes. It was usually their wit and personality that set them apart from regular women. Sex constituted only a facet of the courtesan&#x27;s array of services. For example, they were well-dressed and ready to engage and participate in a variety of topics ranging from art to music to politics.

In some cases, courtesans were from well-to-do backgrounds, and were even married—but to husbands lower on the social ladder than their clients. In these cases, their relationships with those of high social status had the potential to improve their spouses&#x27; status—and so, more often than not, the husband was aware of his wife&#x27;s profession and dealings.

==Differences in status==

===As primary employment===
Courtesans from non-wealthy backgrounds provided charming companionship for extended periods, no matter what their own feelings or commitments might have been at the time, and sometimes had to be prepared to do so on short notice. They were also subject to lower social status, and often religious disapproval, because of the perceived immoral aspects of their profession and their reliance upon courtisanerie as a primary source of income. In cases like this, a courtesan was solely dependent on her benefactor or benefactors financially, making her vulnerable; Cora Pearl is a good example.

Often, courtesans serving in this capacity began their career as a prostitute, although many came to the profession by other means. It was not uncommon for a courtesan to enter into an arranged long-term liaison by contract with a wealthy benefactor. These contracts were written up by and witnessed by lawyers and were binding. Most included some provision for the financial welfare of the courtesan beyond the end of the relationship in the form of an annuity. Many such women became so powerful socially and financially that they could be particular about the men they associated with; in other words, they chose their paramour as would any other mistress, not the other way around. Wealthy benefactors would go to great lengths to court a courtesan as a prize, the ultimate goal being a long-term contract as a mistress.

Occasionally courtesans were passed from one benefactor to another, thereby resulting in them being viewed in society circles as lower than both their benefactor and those of wealth and power with whom they would socialise. Often, in instances of this sort, if the courtesan had satisfactorily served a benefactor, that benefactor would, when ending the affair, pass her on to another benefactor of wealth as a favour to the courtesan, or set her up in an arranged marriage to a semi-wealthy benefactor. If the courtesan had angered or dissatisfied a benefactor, then she would often find herself cast out of wealthy circles, returning more often than not to street prostitution.

===For social or political benefits===
:&quot;Should not be confused with a royal mistress&quot;
Those from wealthy backgrounds, either by birth or marriage, and who were acting as courtesans only for the social or political advancement of themselves and/or their spouses were generally treated as equals. They were more respected by their extramarital companions, both placing one another&#x27;s family obligations ahead of the relationship and planning their own liaisons or social engagements around the lovers&#x27; marital obligations.

Affairs of this sort would often be short-lived, ending when either the courtesan or the courtesan&#x27;s spouse received the status or political position desired, or when the benefactor chose the company of another courtesan, and compensated the former companion financially. In instances like this, it was often viewed simply as a business agreement by both parties involved. The benefactor was aware of the political or social favors expected by the courtesan, the courtesan was aware of the price expected from them for those favors being carried out, and the two met one another&#x27;s demands.

This was generally a safe affair, as both the benefactor&#x27;s spouse and the courtesan&#x27;s spouse usually were fully aware of the arrangement, and the courtesan was not solely dependent on the benefactor. It, rather, was simply an affair of benefits gained for both those involved. Publicly and socially, affairs of this sort were common during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, as well as the early 20th century, and were generally accepted in wealthy circles.

==Career length==
In later centuries, from the mid-18th century on, courtesans would often find themselves cast aside by their benefactors, but the days of public execution or imprisonment based on their promiscuous lifestyle were over. There are many examples of courtesans who, by remaining discreet and respectful to their benefactors, were able to extend their careers into or past middle age and retire financially secure; Catherine Walters is a good example. By the late 19th century, and for a brief period in the early 20th century, courtesans had reached a level of social acceptance in many circles and settings, often even to the extent of becoming a friend and confidant to the wife of their benefactor.

More often than not, a woman serving as a courtesan would last in that field only as long as she could prove herself useful to her companion, or companions. This, of course, excludes those who served as courtesans but who were already married into high society. When referring to those who made their service as a courtesan as their main source of income, success was based solely on financial management and longevity. Many climbed through the ranks of royalty, serving as mistress to lesser nobles first, eventually reaching the role of (unofficial) mistress to a king or prince.

Pietro Aretino, an Italian Renaissance writer, wrote a series of dialogues (&quot;Capricciosi ragionamenti&quot;) in which a mother teaches her daughter what options are available to women and how to be an effective courtesan. In eighteenth-century French literature, the courtesan tends to be idealised as a beautiful and intellectually refined figure of classical antiquity, who invariably enjoys excellent health and is untouched by the contemporary societal scourge of syphilis (often politely referred to as &quot;smallpox&quot;) and other sexually transmitted diseases. The French novelist Balzac wrote about a courtesan in his &quot;Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes&quot; (1838–47). Émile Zola likewise wrote a novel, &quot;Nana&quot; (1880), about a courtesan in nineteenth-century France.

== Famous courtesans ==
This is a list of some professional courtesans. They are not royal mistresses, unless a professional courtesan was also a royal mistress.

Separately from this list, the term &quot;courtesan&quot; has been used in a political context in an attempt to damage the reputation of a powerful woman or disparage her importance. Because of this, there is still much historical debate over whether certain women in history were courtesans. For example, the title was applied to the Byzantine empress Theodora, who had started life as an erotic actress but later became the wife of the Emperor Justinian and, after her death, an Orthodox saint.

<text>Under U.S. law, a conservatorship results from the appointment of a guardian or a protector by a judge to manage the personal or financial affairs of another person who is incapable of fully managing their own affairs due to age or physical or mental limitations. A person under conservatorship is a &quot;conservatee&quot;, a term that can refer to an adult. A person under guardianship is a &quot;ward&quot;, a term that can also refer to a minor child. Conservatorship may also apply to corporations and organizations.

The conservator may be only of the &quot;estate&quot; (financial affairs) but may be also of the &quot;person&quot;, wherein the conservator takes charge of overseeing the daily activities, such as healthcare or living arrangements of the conservatee. A conservator of the person is more typically called a legal guardian.

==Terminology==

A person appointed to manage affairs is a conservator. A person under conservatorship is a conservatee. Under a guardianship, the appointed person is a guardian and subject person is a ward. When referring to government control of private corporations, conservatorship implies a more temporary control than does nationalisation.

Some jurisdictions, such as California, distinguish between conservatorship of an adult as compared to an unemancipated minor. Within such a jurisdiction, a person who is under what is more typically described as a guardianship may be described as a &quot;conservator of the person&quot;. Other jurisdictions, such as New York, use the term guardianship in both contexts.

A &quot;limited conservatorship&quot; usually refers to the limited legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of an individual who is developmentally disabled, but still capable of making important decisions for themselves. In these cases, the conservatee to whom the limited conservatorship applies can retain more control over their personal affairs than other conservatees can; for example, they may retain their right to decide where they may live.

==Appointment==
Conservatorship is established either by court order (with regard to individuals) or via a statutory or regulatory authority (with regard to organizations such as business entities). In other legal terms, a conservatorship may refer to the legal responsibilities over a person who has a mental illness, including individuals who are psychotic, suicidal, demented, incapacitated, or in some other way unable to make legal, medical or financial decisions on behalf of themselves.

==Role and duties==
Conservatorship is a legal term referring to the legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of a person who has been deemed gravely disabled by the court and unable to meet their basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. They are governed by the state&#x27;s individual laws. Terminology varies, and some states or jurisdictions may refer to a conservator as a guardian of the estate or as a trustee.

Conservatorships are generally put in place for people who are significantly disabled by mental illness, elderly individuals who lack mental capacity due to medical conditions such as dementia, or individuals with developmental disabilities who lack the capacity to manage their own affairs. In typical conservatorship proceedings, an allegedly mentally incapacitated person must be evaluated by a qualified physician or psychiatrist who prepares a report documenting the person&#x27;s mental capacity that is provided to the court and may be used as evidence.

An example of a conservator&#x27;s duties includes: locating and marshalling assets, such as property and money, which belong to the conservatee; using the assets to buy food for the conservatee, secure and pay for placement in a facility which would take care of the conservatee or treat a mental illness, pay bills for the conservatee, manage property by paying for property insurance, mortgage payments or rent, property clean-up, or pay for a property management company to rent the property. An example of a conservator or guardian&#x27;s medical responsibilities would be the court granting medical authority to the conservator or guardian, and the conservator or guardian authorising a physician to place a feeding tube to provide nourishment into the protected person&#x27;s stomach if they are in medical need of it. It is not uncommon for one person to hold both offices and be referred to as the &quot;guardian and conservator&quot; of the conservatee, even though a conservator or guardian can be appointed over the person only, the estate only, or both. Generally, a conservator or guardian over the estate is only appointed if the conservatee has assets that need to be protected, marshalled, and managed. These terms may be found in use in Uniform Probate Code (UPC) jurisdictions, even though the UPC uses the term &quot;protected person&quot; in either case.

In most states, an outside party or agency must review the facts of the case and submit a report, usually required to be in writing, to the court before the court makes a decision on the request to establish a conservatorship or guardianship. Usually the outside party is a local county mental health representative called an investigator. They are often required to be experts in some appropriate field, such as social work, mental health, a medical field, or law. Procedures for conservatorship of an adult are often different from those for minors. 

The court may appoint an attorney to represent the proposed conservatee or ward. If the proposed conservatee or ward is unable to have an attorney-client relationship because of some impairment, the court may appoint a guardian-ad-litem (who is often also an attorney). A guardian-ad-litem does not take instruction from the client, but rather acts on their behalf and tells the court what they think is in the best interests of the proposed conservatee or ward, whether or not that is what the proposed conservatee or ward wants. The conservatee has the right to be represented by an attorney, and if they cannot afford a private attorney, they are appointed a public defender that will represent them free of cost.

=== California ===
In the state of California there are two types of conservatorships: Lanterman–Petris–Short (Lanterman–Petris–Short Act of 1967, referred to as LPS) and Probate conservatorships. These forms of conservatorship are governed by the California Probate Code, and Welfare and Institutions Codes.

LPS conservatorships begin with a temporary 30-day conservatorship, and if the conservatee remains gravely disabled, the conservator is reappointed for a year; the LPS conservatorship can be renewed annually, or terminated if no longer needed. Probate conservatorships are referred to as &quot;general conservatorships&quot;, and typically do not have a temporary period unless an urgent emergency exists that is creating risk to the person or their estate. Probate conservatorship do not automatically expire as LPS conservatorships do if they are not renewed by the conservator.

In an LPS conservatorship, a court-appointed conservator over the person is responsible for managing the conservatee&#x27;s placement, medical decisions, and mental health treatment. A conservator over the estate is responsible for marshalling, protecting, and managing the conservatee&#x27;s assets that remain in their estate. A conservator reports to the court that appointed them, and is monitored by the supervising judicial court in the county in which the conservatee permanently resides.

LPS conservatorships usually begin in the county mental health system and are referred from acute psychiatric hospitals, where Probate conservatorships can result from any referral source if validated with proper medical documentation. Mental Health consumers have the right to a Patient&#x27;s Rights advocate, and are taken through a series of hearings while they are in the acute hospital before they reach the point of needing a conservator.

In 2022, a law was enacted requiring judges in California to document all alternatives to a conservatorship before granting one, giving potential conservatees in California preference in selecting a conservator, and making it easier to end probate conservatorships in California.

===International equivalents===
Conservatorship for individuals is called &quot;deputyship&quot; in England, Wales and in Switzerland (formerly &quot;guardianship&quot;), &quot;guardianship&quot; in Scotland, &quot;controllership&quot; in Northern Ireland, &quot;guardianship&quot; in India and &quot;guardianship and administration&quot; in Australia.

=== South Korea ===
In the Republic of Korea (South Korea) a Conservatorship is called a Guardianship.

Types of Guardians under Korean Guardianship Law

Adult guardian (성년후견인): If an adult chronically lacks the mental competence to manage their own matters due to illness, disability, old age, or other conditions, a Korean court may appoint an adult guardian. This type of guardianship in Korea gives near total power over the ward to the Adult Guardian. 

Limited guardian (한정후견인): A person may also be designated as a &quot;special guardian,&quot; entrusted with restricted authority over the ward&#x27;s interests. For example, a special guardian may be granted the legal authority in Korea to decide how to handle the ward&#x27;s assets without being granted any control over the ward&#x27;s person.

Specified guardian (특정후견인): A specified guardian is a person appointed to represent a person&#x27;s interests in relation to a particular court proceeding or process. 

==== The process of appointing a guardian through Korean courts ====
The Korean Family Courts, typically, has the authority to appoint a guardian in Korea. A general adult guardian is one who is in charge of both the ward&#x27;s financial interests and personal welfare. The Korean family court, or one of its branches, has authority over the ward&#x27;s address and will hear the guardianship case. When the Family Court is not present in the ward&#x27;s address, typically, a district court or a branch court has jurisdiction over the matter. 

Typically, after an evaluation of the ward&#x27;s health by a doctor, the court proceedings begin. The court will often question the ward and hear his/her testimony regarding the guardianship. So that the ward can make the most use of his or her remaining capacity and choose a suitable guardian. The court has the power to decide the beginning of guardianship, the choice of a guardian, change of guardian, cessation of guardianship, the extent of the legal representative&#x27;s authority, etc.

==Conservatorship of organizations==
In the United States, in some states, corporations can be placed under conservatorship, as a less extreme alternative to receivership. Whereas a receiver is expected to terminate the rights of shareholders and managers, a conservator is expected merely to assume those rights, with the prospect that they will be relinquished. Robert Ramsey and John Head, law professors who both specialise in financial issues, suggest that an insolvent bank should go into receivership rather than conservatorship to guard against false hope and moral hazard.

At the federal government level in the United States, in July 2008, the failing IndyMac Bank was taken into administrative receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and its assets and secured liabilities transferred to a specially established bridge bank called IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB which was placed into conservatorship, also by the FDIC.

Again, in the U.S. at the federal level, in September 2008, the chief executive officers and board of directors of Fannie Mae and of Freddie Mac were dismissed. Then, the companies were placed into the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) via the determination of its director James B. Lockhart III, with the support and financial backing of U.S. Treasury via Treasury secretary Hank Paulson&#x27;s commitment to keep the corporations solvent. The intervention leading to the conservatorship of these two entities has become the largest in government history, and was justified as necessary step to prevent the damage to the financial system that would have been caused by their failure. Entities like this are considered &quot;too big to fail&quot;.

An even more ambitious use of the conservatorship model has been proposed by Duke University professors Lawrence Baxter, Bill Brown, and Jim Cox. They suggest that the troubled U.S. banks be placed in conservatorship, that some of their &quot;good assets&quot; be dropped into newly created &quot;good bank&quot; subsidiaries (presumably under new management), and the remaining &quot;bad assets&quot; be left to be managed under the supervision of a conservatorship structure.

<text>The Price Is Right is an American television game show where contestants compete by guessing the prices of merchandise to win cash and prizes. A 1972 revival by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman of their 1956–1965 show of the same name, the new version added many distinctive gameplay elements. Contestants are selected from the studio audience. When the announcer calls their name, they use the show&#x27;s famous catchphrase, &quot;Come on down!&quot;

The program premiered September 4, 1972, on CBS. Bob Barker was the series&#x27;s longest-running host from its debut until his retirement in June 2007, when Drew Carey took over. Barker was accompanied by a series of announcers, beginning with Johnny Olson, followed by Rod Roddy and Rich Fields. In December 2010, George Gray became the announcer. The show has used several models, most notably Anitra Ford, Janice Pennington, Dian Parkinson, Holly Hallstrom, Kathleen Bradley, and Rachel Reynolds.

&quot;The Price Is Right&quot; has aired over 9,000 episodes since its debut. It is the longest-running game show in the United States and is one of the longest-running network series in United States television history. The 53rd season premiered on September 23, 2024, with both a daytime and primetime episode, and its 10,000th episode aired on February 26, 2025.

On March 2, 2022, it was announced that &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; would be inducted into the NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame. Host Drew Carey and executive producer Evelyn Warfel accepted the award at The Achievement in Broadcasting Awards on the NAB Show main stage in Las Vegas on April 24, 2022.

On January 8, 2025, it was announced that &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; would suspend production due to the wildfires in the Southern California region, where Haven Studios, the filming spot for the show, is located.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of the show consists of four distinct competition elements, in which preliminary contestants (nine in most episodes) are eventually narrowed to two finalists who compete in the game&#x27;s final element, the &quot;Showcases&quot;.

===Item Up For Bid===
At the start of the show, four contestants are called from the audience by the announcer to take a spot in the front row behind bidding lecterns. This area is known as &quot;Contestants&#x27; Row&quot; or &quot;Bidders&#x27; Row&quot;. After calling each selected contestant&#x27;s name, the announcer shouts &quot;Come on down!&quot;, a phrase which has become a trademark of the show.

The four contestants in Contestants&#x27; Row compete in a bidding round to determine which contestant will play the next pricing game. (The round is known as &quot;One Bid&quot;, which gets its name and format from one of two types of bidding rounds that existed on the 1950s version of the show.) A prize is shown and each contestant gives a single bid for the item. In the first One Bid game of each episode, bidding begins with the contestant on the viewer&#x27;s left and proceeds right. In subsequent One Bid rounds, the order of bidding still moves from the viewer&#x27;s left-to-right, but begins with the contestant most recently called down to the row. Contestants are instructed to bid in whole dollars since the retail price of the item is rounded to the nearest dollar, and another contestant&#x27;s bid cannot be duplicated. The contestant whose bid is closest to the actual retail price of the prize without going over wins that prize, and gets to play the subsequent pricing game.

If all four contestants&#x27; bids are higher than the actual retail price, all bids are erased, and the contestants are instructed to bid a second time without exceeding the lowest bid of the previous round. Bidding the exact price awards a $500 cash bonus.

After each of the first five pricing games, another contestant is called to &quot;come on down&quot; to fill the spot of the contestant who played the previous pricing game. The newest contestant bids first in each One Bid round. Contestants who fail to win a One Bid round and do not make it onstage to play a pricing game receive consolation prizes, currently $300, often sponsored by companies revealed by the announcer near the end of the show, before the Showcase.

A 1996 study from Stanford University analyzed the bidding behavior of contestants, noting that they rarely attempted to optimize their bidding strategies but that accuracy tended to improve the longer they stayed in Contestants Row. A 2019 study from Harvard University noted that the accuracy of the average bid fell substantially over the course of the show&#x27;s run—from 8% lower than the actual retail price at the series start in 1972 to over 20% by 2010—before stabilizing as Carey&#x27;s hosting tenure progressed; the study concluded that accuracy correlated with inflation and hypothesized that periods of high inflation make people more attentive to prices, while also surmising that increasing e-commerce has made people less attentive to prices overall.

===Pricing games===
After winning the One Bid, the contestant joins the host onstage for the opportunity to win additional prizes or cash by playing a pricing game. After the pricing game ends, a new contestant is selected for Contestants&#x27; Row and the process is repeated.

Six pricing games are played on each hour-long episode, three games per episode were played in the original half-hour format. Pricing game formats vary widely, ranging from simple dilemma games in which a contestant chooses one of two options to win to complex games of chance or skill in which guessing prices increases the odds of winning. On a typical hour-long episode, two games are played for a car, one game is played for a cash prize, and the other three games offer expensive household merchandise or trips. Usually, at least one of the six games involves the pricing of grocery items, while another usually involves smaller prizes that can be used to win a larger prize package.

Originally, five pricing games were in the rotation. Since then, more games have been created and added to the rotation and, starting with the 60-minute expansion in 1975, the rate at which games premiered increased. Some pricing games were eventually discontinued, while others have been a mainstay since the show&#x27;s debut in 1972. As of 2017, the rotation is among 77 games. On the 1994 syndicated version hosted by Doug Davidson, the rules of several games were modified and other aesthetic changes were made. Notably, the grocery products used in some games on the daytime version were replaced by small merchandise prizes, generally valued at less than $100. Beginning in 2008, episodes of &quot;The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular&quot; featured rules changes to some pricing games which rewarded a $1 million bonus to the contestant if specific goals were achieved while playing the pricing game.

===Showcase Showdown===
Since the show&#x27;s expansion to 60 minutes in 1975, each episode features two playings of the Showcase Showdown, occurring after the third and sixth pricing games. Each playing features the three contestants who played the preceding pricing games spinning &quot;The Big Wheel&quot; to determine who advances to the Showcase, the show&#x27;s finale. The contestants play in the order of the value of their winnings thus far (including the One Bid), with the contestant who has won the most spinning last.

The wheel contains 20 sections showing values from 5¢ to $1.00, in increments of five cents. The wheel is positioned on $1.00 prior to the first contestant&#x27;s first spin. Contestants are allowed a maximum of two spins. The first contestant spins the wheel and may choose to stop with his or her score or spin again, adding the value of the second spin to their first. The wheel must go around in a complete circle at least once. The second contestant then spins the wheel and tries to match or beat the leader&#x27;s score; if he or she fails to do so, the contestant must spin again. If the second contestant&#x27;s first spin matches or beats the score of the first contestant, he or she has the option of stopping or spinning again. The third contestant then spins; if his or her score is less than the leader then he or she will be required to spin again. In the event the second or third contestant&#x27;s first spin ties the score of the leader, he or she will be given the option of spinning again as an alternative to entering a &quot;spin-off&quot; as described below.

If the total score of any contestant is less than that of the current leader, is beaten by the score of any subsequent contestant, or is over $1.00, the contestant is eliminated from the game. The contestant whose score is nearest to $1.00 without going over advances to the Showcase at the end of the episode. Any spin that fails to make at least one complete revolution does not count; the contestant is given the opportunity to spin again, and if the contestant has visible difficulty in physically performing the task, the host is allowed to assist him or her.

If the first two contestants both spin twice and go over $1.00, the third advances to the Showcase by default and is given one spin to try to score $1.00. Any contestant whose score equals $1.00 (from either the first spin or the sum of two spins) receives a $1,000 bonus and, since December 1978, is allowed a bonus spin. The contestant wins an additional $10,000 for landing on either 5¢ or 15¢ (which are adjacent to the $1.00 space and painted green), or an additional $25,000 for landing on $1.00. From December 1978 to July 17, 2008, the bonuses were $5,000 and $10,000 for landing on a green section and the $1.00, respectively. If the wheel stops on any other amount or fails to make at least one revolution, the contestant wins no more money. The wheel is positioned on 5¢ prior to the bonus spin so that it cannot land on a winning prize without making a complete revolution. This strategy has been noted by Drew Carey when it is used by contestants, calling it a &quot;finesse spin&quot; when a player intentionally spins the wheel to make one full revolution exactly and then one or two spaces to land exactly on the three bonus sections.

Two or more contestants who are tied with the leading score compete in a &quot;spin-off&quot;. Each contestant is allowed only one additional spin and the contestant with the highest score advances to the Showcase. Multiple spin-offs are played until the tie is broken. Spinners who hit $1.00 on their spin-off spin still get $1,000 and a bonus spin. If two or more contestants tie with a score of $1.00, their bonus spins also determine their spin-off score. Only the spin-off score, not any bonus money won, determines which contestant moves on to the Showcase. For example, a person who wins the $10,000 bonus for landing on 15¢ loses the spin-off if their opponent lands on 20¢ or more. A tie in a bonus spin spin-off means the ensuing second spin-off will be spun with no bonuses available. Each spin must make one complete revolution in order to qualify. If a player&#x27;s bonus spin spin-off does not make a complete revolution (a deliberate strategy by players to aim for bonuses), the contestant must spin again, and the spin will be scored as in a second round of a spin-off (no bonuses).

Beginning with Season 51, both Showcase Showdowns in a particular episode are recorded after all six pricing games have been played, so that the wheel only has to be moved on and off the set once. The final broadcast is edited to insert the first Showcase Showdown after the third pricing game, and the second one after the sixth. The change was made to save time, as the production schedule has called for up to three episodes to be recorded per day as of Season 49.

===Showcase===
At the end of the episode, the two Showcase Showdown winners (or the two highest winners on half-hour-long episodes) advance to the Showcase. A &quot;showcase&quot; of prizes (currently two, three, or sometimes four prizes) is presented and the top winner has the option of placing a bid on the total value of the showcase or passing the showcase to the runner-up, who is then required to bid. A second showcase is then presented and the contestant who had not bid on the first showcase makes their bid. Unlike the One Bid, the contestant bidding on the second showcase may bid the same amount as their opponent on the first showcase, since the two contestants are bidding on different prize packages. The contestant who has bid closer to the actual price of their own showcase without going over wins the prizes in their showcase.

Any contestant who overbids automatically loses regardless of their opponent&#x27;s result. If both contestants overbid, neither wins their showcase. Since 1974, the winning contestant wins both showcases if the bid is within a specified amount from the actual retail price of their own showcase without going over. Until June 1998, the amount was less than $100. In September 1998, it became the current $250 or less. The 2017 documentary &quot;Perfect Bid: The Contestant Who Knew Too Much&quot; tells the story of the only time a contestant bid the exact price of a showcase.

==Personnel==

===Hosts===

Bob Barker began hosting &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; on September 4, 1972, and completed a 35-year tenure on June 15, 2007. Barker was hired as host while still hosting the stunt comedy show &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;. His retirement coincided with his 50th year as a television host. His final show aired on June 15, 2007, and was repeated in primetime, leading into the network&#x27;s coverage of the 34th Daytime Emmy Awards. In addition to hosting, Barker became Executive Producer of the show in March 1988 when Frank Wayne died and continued as such until his retirement, gaining significant creative control over the series between 2000 and his 2007 retirement. He was also responsible for creating several of the show&#x27;s pricing games, as well as launching &quot;The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular&quot; primetime spin-off. Reruns of Barker&#x27;s final season were aired throughout the summer from the Monday after his final show (June 18, 2007) until the Friday before Drew Carey&#x27;s debut as host (October 12, 2007), when the season 35 finale was re-aired. During his time as host, Barker missed only one taping of four episodes. Dennis James, then hosting the syndicated nighttime version of the show, filled in for him on these shows in December 1974. In 1981, shortly after the death of his wife Dorothy Jo, Barker became an animal rights advocate and vegetarian, and began signing off each episode with &quot;Help control the pet population, have your pets spayed or neutered.&quot; After Barker&#x27;s retirement, Carey continued the tradition with the same sign-off.

On October 31, 2006, Barker announced that he would retire from the show at the end of season 35. In March 2007, CBS and FremantleMedia began a search for the next host of the show. Carey, who was hosting &quot;Power of 10&quot; at the time, was chosen and, in a July 23, 2007, interview on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, made the announcement. Carey&#x27;s first show aired October 15, 2007. Barker made three guest appearances after Carey took over as host: on the April 16, 2009 episode to promote his autobiography, &quot;Priceless Memories&quot;, on December 12, 2013, as part of &quot;Pet Adoption Week&quot; that coincided with his 90th birthday, and on the episode which aired on April Fools&#x27; Day in 2015, his final appearance on the show, where he hosted the first One Bid and pricing game as part of April Fool&#x27;s Day.

The 2013 April Fools&#x27; show featured Carey and announcer George Gray modeling the prizes while the show&#x27;s models performed hosting and announcing duties for the day. On the April Fools&#x27; Day episode in 2014, Craig Ferguson, Carey&#x27;s former castmate from &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, and Shadoe Stevens hosted and announced, swapping places with Carey and Gray, who had performed those roles on the previous night&#x27;s episode of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. The 2015 April Fools&#x27; episode featured the last of Barker&#x27;s three post-retirement appearances on the show, where he hosted the first One Bid and pricing game before turning it over to Carey.

===Announcers===

Johnny Olson, the announcer for many Goodson-Todman shows of the era, was the program&#x27;s first announcer until his death in October 1985. Olson was replaced by Rod Roddy in December 1985, who remained with the program until shortly before his death in October 2003. Los Angeles meteorologist Rich Fields took over as the announcer in April 2004 and stayed on until the end of season 38 in August 2010. Following a change of direction and a search for an announcer with more experience in improvisational comedy, George Gray became announcer in December 2010, and was permanently made as the show&#x27;s fourth announcer in April 2011. During periods in which a permanent announcer was not filling the role, a number of announcers auditioned for the position. In addition to Roddy, Gene Wood, Rich Jeffries, and Bob Hilton auditioned to replace Olson. Burton Richardson, Paul Boland and Randy West substituted for Roddy during his illnesses. In addition to West and Richardson, Daniel Rosen, Art Sanders, Roger Rose, Don Bishop, and Jim Thornton also auditioned for the role eventually filled by Fields. Richardson substituted for Fields while he recovered from laryngitis in December 2006. In addition to Gray, JD Roberto, Jeff B. Davis, Brad Sherwood, David H. Lawrence XVII, and Steve White also auditioned for the role.

=== Models ===

To help display its many prizes, the show has featured several models who were known, during Barker&#x27;s time on the show, as &quot;Barker&#x27;s Beauties”. Some longer-tenured Barker&#x27;s Beauties included Kathleen Bradley (1990–2000), Holly Hallstrom (1977–1995), Dian Parkinson (1975–1993), Janice Pennington (1972–2000), and Rachel Reynolds (2003-present). Pennington and Bradley were both dismissed from the program in 2000, allegedly because they had given testimony on Hallstrom&#x27;s behalf in the wrongful termination litigation she pursued against Barker and the show. Following the departures of Nikki Ziering, Heather Kozar, and Claudia Jordan in the 2000s, producers decided to use a rotating cast of models (up to ten) until the middle of season 37, after which the show reverted to a cast of five regular models, increasing to six in 2021. Current models include Rachel Reynolds, Amber Lancaster, Manuela Arbeláez, James O&#x27;Halloran, Devin Goda, and Alexis Gaube. Rachel began her tenure with Barker, and is the second-longest running model in show history, trailing only Pennington.

Carey does not use a collective name for the models, but refers to them by name, hoping that the models will be able to use the show as a &quot;springboard&quot; to further their careers. In a change from previous policy, the models appearing on a given episode are named individually in the show&#x27;s credits and are formally referred as &quot;&quot;The Price Is Right&quot; models&quot; when collectively grouped at events. Since season 37, the show often uses a guest model for certain prizes, often crossing over from another CBS property or come courtesy of the company providing the prize. Some such models have been male, especially for musical instruments, tools, trucks and motorcycles, and used in guest appearances during the Showcase. Owing to the traditionally female demographic of daytime television shows, along with the pregnancies of Rachel and then-model Gwendolyn Osborne, CBS announced that the game show would add a male model for a week during season 41, fitting with other countries with the franchise that have used an occasional male model. The show held an internet search for the man in an online competition that featured Mike Richards, the show&#x27;s executive producer, Reynolds, Lancaster, Osborne and Arbeláez serving as judges and mentors during the web series, narrated by Gray. Viewers selected the winner in October 2012. On October 5, 2012, CBS announced that the winner of the male model online competition was Rob Wilson of Boston, Massachusetts. Wilson appeared as a model on episodes through April 15, 2014. A second male model search was conducted in 2014, with auditions taking place during the FIFA World Cup break between May and July 2014. On December 8, 2014, CBS announced that the winner of the second male model online competition was James O&#x27;Halloran. A third male model, Devin Goda, debuted on the show in 2018.

===Production staff===
The game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show. Goodson-Todman staffer Bob Stewart is credited with creating the original version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. Roger Dobkowitz was the producer from 1984 to 2008, having worked with the program as a production staffer since the show&#x27;s debut after graduating from San Francisco State University. Occasionally, Dobkowitz appeared on-camera when answering a question posed by the host, usually relating to the show&#x27;s history or records. When he left the show at the end of season 36, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that it was unclear whether he was retiring or was fired, although Carey indicated in a later interview with &quot;Esquire&quot; that Dobkowitz was fired. 

As of 2011, the show uses multiple producers, all long-time staffers. Adam Sandler (not to be confused with the actor) is the producer and director of the show. Stan Blits, who joined the show in 1980 and Sue MacIntyre are the co-producers. Stan Blits is also the contestant coordinator for the show. In 2007, he wrote the book &quot;Come on Down&quot; (), that goes behind the scenes of the show. In the book he dispels the myth that contestants are chosen at random, and gives readers an inside look at how shows are planned and produced. Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008; she announced her retirement on October 8, 2010, on the show&#x27;s website, effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings. Her last episode as producer, which aired January 27, 2011, featured a theme in tribute to her. The show&#x27;s official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode. Frank Wayne, a Goodson-Todman staffer since the 1950s, was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show. Barker assumed that role after Wayne&#x27;s death in March 1988. Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert, Barbara Hunter, and Phil Wayne Rossi (Wayne&#x27;s son). Michael Dimich assumed the director&#x27;s chair in June 2011. Marc Breslow, Paul Alter, Bart Eskander, and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director. Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten, as well as technical director Glenn Koch, have directed episodes strictly on a fill-in basis. Sandler began directing episodes in 2012, and became the official director in 2013. 

Aside from Barker, the show&#x27;s production staff remained intact after Carey became host. FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the program&#x27;s new executive producer, with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitz&#x27;s firing. Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007, before Carey was ultimately chosen. Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009–10 season started, with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010. Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show. Richards oversaw a major overhaul of the show, dismissing some personnel who had served under Barker and Dobkowitz in an effort to improve the show&#x27;s performance in key demographics, which continued a change in the demographic of viewers after the movie &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (which featured Barker in a fight). Richards returned to the show for the Barker tribute in August 2023. Richards left the show at the conclusion of the 2018–19 season to join Sony Pictures Television as an executive producer for their game shows. Evelyn Warfel was named executive producer for the 2019–20 season.

==Production==

===Audience and contestant selection===


Prior to changes imposed in Season 49 (October 2020), audience members often arrived early on the day of a taping, some even camping out the night before to secure a spot in line. Most had already received tickets for that day&#x27;s show, although some hoped to get same-day tickets.

Starting in Season 52 with first tapings in July 2023, audience members arrive at Charis Mission Church next door to Haven Studios for a formal process. In the church&#x27;s meeting rooms, audience members are then given the iconic name tags with a temporary identification number, which are also written on the person&#x27;s ticket. A Social Security Number (or some national I.D. number for non-U.S. audience members) is also required to be submitted. Audience members are eventually brought through in groups of twelve for brief interviews with the production staff. 

Contrary to popular belief, contestant names are not chosen at random; in actuality, the interviews determine the nine contestants from a pool of approximately 165 audience members (reduced from 325 when the show moved to Haven Studios in 2023; in Season 50 and 51 (2021–23), it was 50). Since 1988, the minimum age for audience members has been 18 except for family episodes; prior to 1988, teenagers and children were present in the audience. With few exceptions, anyone at least 18 years old who attends a taping of the show has the potential to become a contestant. Those ineligible include current candidates for political office, employees of Paramount Global or its affiliates, RTL Group or any firm involved in offering prizes for the show. Contestants who have appeared on a different game show within the previous year or either two other game shows or any version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; itself within the past ten years are also ineligible. 

The show&#x27;s staff alerts potential contestantsin person, on the show&#x27;s website and on the tickets themselvesto dress in &quot;street clothes&quot; and not to wear costumes, such as those used to attract attention on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, another show that selects contestants from the audience. In June 2008, producers disallowed audience members from wearing fake eyeglasses designed to look similar to those worn by Carey, a restriction that has since been relaxed. Instead, contestants will often wear shirts with hand-decorated slogans. Clothing with logos of the Seattle Sounders FC is restricted, as host Drew Carey is a minority partner in the team, and in accordance with RTL Group Standards and Practices, the show must post disclaimers regarding his ownership stake if a contestant is wearing such logo merchandise. Members of the Armed Forces often attend in uniform, which is mandatory on military-themed special episodes such as Independence Day. 

To ensure fair play, cell phones, electronic devices, backpacks, and price lists are not allowed in the holding room or studio. If an audience member has brought any of these items, they must leave them with production for the duration of the taping. Once they clear protocol, they receive a ticket and access to Haven Studios. At the end of the show, audience members return to the church and check out.

Prospective contestants obtain tickets by contacting a third-party ticketing operator via the show&#x27;s website, which is promoted on-air during the broadcast. Prior to 2011, ticketing was directly through CBS, originally via mail, with online ticket access added in 2005. The mail practice ended after CBS began outsourcing ticketing to the third-party operator.

Occasionally, episodes are taped with special audiences, including active duty and retired military personnel. Similar primetime episodes were taped in 2002 in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and in light of the subsequent war in Afghanistan: one honoring each branch of the United States military and a sixth episode honoring police officers and firefighters. An annual military episode has been taped since season 38 in 2008; such episodes were originally broadcast on Veterans Day, but the airdate was moved to Independence Day during season 41 (2013). These episodes feature an all-military audience, a military band playing the winner&#x27;s service anthem, and contestants being called by rank. The 2008 episode contained a unique rule in which each One Bid featured one contestant from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, and One Bid winners also won a $1,000 gift card. As each contestant won their way onstage, a member of the same branch of service would replace them in Bidder&#x27;s Row. Most civilian attendees were retired or disabled veterans or family members of military personnel. (The 2009 version eliminated this practice.) Additionally, members from the United States Coast Guard were invited to the show.

Since 2009, some episodes have featured special themes with two contestants competing as teams, such as married or engaged couples for Valentine&#x27;s Day and the &quot;Ultimate Wedding Shower&quot; episode. Some episodes feature children who are minors (normally not allowed to compete) teamed with a parent (for Mother&#x27;s Day and Father&#x27;s Day) or grandparent (for Grandparents Day), as well as teen drivers and students for &quot;Ultimate Spring Break&quot; and &quot;Back to School”. In these cases the adult player (not the minor) must make all final decisions in game play, such as when calling numbers or prices.

===Taping===
For the first 51 seasons (1972–2023), except for the 2002 30th Anniversary Special, which was taped at Harrah&#x27;s Rio in Las Vegas, Nevada, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; was taped in Studio 33 at Television City in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles. The studio, which is also used for other television productions, was renamed the Bob Barker Studio in the host&#x27;s honor on the ceremonial 5,000th episode taped in March 1998. When Carey became host, there was talk of the show traveling in the future. The program is usually produced in about an hour, although if there is a guest involved, some tapings will last longer because of question and answer sessions by the audience and the guest, which the host usually moderates. Typically, the show tapes two episodes per day (mid-day and late afternoon tapings) with Monday through Wednesday tapings. The program is taped in advance of its airdate. For example, the show broadcast on February 28, 2008, was taped on January 16, 2008. After resuming tapings in October 2020 following a pandemic-related delay, starting in season 49 (taped behind closed doors with pandemic restrictions with a late start and accelerated taping), three episodes were taped each day, normally with three taping days per week (Sunday through Tuesday, with a morning, midday, and afternoon session). As with many other shows that start production in the summer, the lead time varies during the season, as many as fifteen weeks to as little as one day. The audience is entertained by the announcer before taping begins and in case of guests, the guest will answer questions from the audience. After the taping session, there is a drawing for a door prize.

On some episodes, all members of the audience receive a prize from a sponsor or celebrity guest; those prizes are usually mentioned in the Showcase (such as a complimentary slice of Papa John&#x27;s Pizza, an NHL Winter Classic game puck, a couples&#x27; gift box from Hershey&#x27;s or a book authored by a guest). Television and Internet viewers have also been directed to the show&#x27;s official website to enter a drawing for a similar prize offered to all viewers or another prize related to the special offer (such as the Rock of Ages signed CD). Some episodes are taped &quot;out-of-order&quot; so that a specific episode will air after other episodes have aired. Notably, the Christmas Week episodes are usually taped in early December outside of the regular rotation. An episode may be taped out-of-order if a prize package or episode theme reflects an event that is taking place close to the date that episode will air (primarily with CBS properties such as the NFL, and &quot;NCAA March Madness&quot;). Other episodes may be aired out-of-order because of game-related incidents or situations beyond the network&#x27;s control. Most instances of episodes airing out of order occur when the show is taped far in advance or when a natural disaster recently occurred at a trip venue featured in an episode (the last Barker Studio episode was broadcast one year after it was taped, two months into the subsequent season because of numerous disasters to two trip venues).

On March 8, 2023, it was announced that &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; would relocate from Television City after season 51, due to the $1.25 billion refurbishment and expansion of the facility by its new owner Hackman Capital. The program will move to Haven Studios, a new facility in the Atwater Village neighborhood of Los Angeles. Sister program &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; will also move to Haven. Taping commenced in late July 2023 from the new studio. Barker died at age 99 on August 26, 2023, almost three months before the last episode ever to be filmed in his namesake studio had aired. On the next scheduled taping on August 28, 2023, segments for a tribute to Barker that aired on August 31, 2023, were filmed at Haven Studios on the new set, marking the first time portions of the new studio were seen on broadcast.

====Season 49-51 Changes====
In March 2020, production of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; was suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the September 16, 2020 episode of &quot;The Athletic&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Starkville&quot; podcast, Drew Carey informed the podcast that Fremantle intended to resume taping in October 2020 with only essential personnel, including 27 contestants for a given day (nine contestants per show, three shows a day) of taping in the studio. On October 5, 2020, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; interviewed executive producer Evelyn Warfel about protocol changes for the show. Social media posts from announcer George Gray and model James O&#x27;Halloran confirmed that taping had resumed.

Season 49 episodes had a redesigned set with no audience, and Contestants&#x27; Row changed to use the wider setup when teams are used in order to promote social distancing. For season 50 and 51, the show brought back a limited audience of approximately 50 people seated in pods, similar to &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. 

====Haven Studios Changes====
At Television City, a full audience was about 300 people. The move to Glendale and the new studio, which was implemented in Season 52, led to audience capacity being reduced to 165. Taping days featuring either two or three episodes per day (8:00, 11:30, and 14:00). Episodes are filmed either Monday to Wednesday or Wednesday to Friday per week, but some weeks have featured four days of taping (9-12 episodes a week). Fremantle will do all contestant briefings and interviews at Charis Mission Church next door. The two CBS Daytime game shows alternated usage of the venue during the season.

In compliance with RTL Standards and Practices, producers prohibit audience members from attending multiple shows on the same date in order to prevent cheating, as the same prize from one episode may potentially be reused in another episode taped later in that day. Under this policy, one of the three episodes to be taped that day is designated a &quot;restricted&quot; taping, as it must feature an entirely new audience that did not attend another taping that day. In Season 52, the restricted taping was the late (14:00) taping, where those in the two morning sessions cannot attend the afternoon session. In early Season 53, which began taping in April 2024, the restricted taping is now the early morning session (8:00) where the audience of that session is not permitted to attend either the mid-morning or afternoon session. Currently, the On Camera Audiences Web site will inform prospective attendees which taping session is the prohibited taping.

The contract with RTL Group and Haven Studios, especially with the time to tape the two CBS Daytime game shows, caused officials to attempt in Season 53 with taping four episodes during January 2025, with shows at 6:30, 9:15, 11:45, and 14:45 (sessions would take no more than two hours). That was abandoned because of the wildfires nearby that cancelled all tapings with the experimental format. Those weeks would have featured 12 episodes taped in a week over three days. Instead, when taping resumed after the wildfires were contained, between nine and 12 episodes are taped in a week, three episodes a day, in three or four days.

===Prizes===
Companies donate prizes in exchange for advertising. According to the CBC Radio One series &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, each episode has a script about 30 pages long, consisting primarily of what is essentially advertising copy. The book &quot;Come On Down!: Behind the Big Doors at &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;&quot; by staffer Stan Blits says the prizes require acres of warehouse space to store. Since season 37 (2008), the program purchased certain prizes at outlet stores in an effort to diversify and upscale the prizes being offered on the show, in an effort to aim at younger demographics (such as college-age students, which has been noted as a popular demographic for the program).

===Production company===
The version of the series that began in 1972 was originally &quot;A Mark Goodson–Bill Todman Production&quot; in association with CBS. After Todman died in July 1979, the unit became known as simply Mark Goodson Productions and referred to as such on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; from 1984 to June 2007. Today, the series is produced by Fremantle and copyrighted by The Price Is Right Productions, Inc., a joint venture of RTL Group and CBS. For the sake of tradition and through special permission from RTL&#x27;s subsidiary Fremantle, the show continued to use the Mark Goodson Productions name, logo, and announcement at the end of each episode until Barker&#x27;s retirement, even after Fremantle purchased and absorbed the Goodson-Todman holdings. The show was credited as a FremantleMedia production from 2007 to 2018; after the company&#x27;s name change in 2018, it is now credited simply as a Fremantle production.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;The Price Is Right&quot; premiered on September 4, 1972, at 10:30 a.m. ET (9:30 a.m. CT) on CBS, one of three game shows to debut that day, the other two being &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; at 10:00 a.m. ET and &quot;Gambit&quot; at 11:00 a.m. ET. The show was first billed as &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot; to distinguish itself from the earlier/original version (1956–65) hosted by Bill Cullen, but it proved so popular in its own right that, in June 1973, Goodson-Todman decided to drop the word &quot;New&quot; from its title. On March 26, 1973, CBS moved &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; to 3:00 p.m. ET, pairing it with &quot;Match Game&quot; as part of what became the highest-rated pairing in daytime, it ran a close second to the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. The show remained in that time slot until August 11, 1975, when it permanently returned to the morning lineup at 10:30 a.m. ET. Over the next several years, &quot;Price&quot; would face a variety of game shows on NBC, then, as now, ABC did not program that timeslot, leaving its affiliates to do it themselves.

During the week of September 8–12, 1975, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; experimented with a sixty-minute episode format, during what it called &quot;Anniversary Week&quot; (the third anniversary of its premiere). The Anniversary Week included a prototypical circular Showcase Showdown spinner wheel used only for that week of shows. The Anniversary Week experiment was a ratings success, and quickly led to the announcement on September 30, 1975, of the permanent expansion of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; to sixty minutes, effective November 3, 1975, its start time moved to 10:00 a.m. ET. From March 7, 1977, to November 4, 1977, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; aired at 10:30 a.m. It then returned to 10:00 a.m. for just five weeks. On December 12, 1977, the show moved back to 10:30 a.m. and remained there until April 20, 1979, when it assumed the 11:00 a.m. ET slot where it has remained ever since.

The format of the show has since remained virtually unchanged. New pricing games are generally added each year, while others are retired. In addition, prizes and pricing games have kept pace with inflation, with games originally designed for four-digit prices of prizes (most often cars) adjusted to allow for five-digit prices, such as by providing the first digit of its price for free. While the set has seen numerous redesigns and upgrades over the years, the show has maintained a similar aesthetic element since its premiere in 1972.

In season 36, CBS began offering full episodes of the show available for free viewing on the network&#x27;s website. The show also began broadcasting in high definition with &quot;The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular&quot; primetime specials (the normal daytime version continued to air in 4:3 standard definition). The show made the full transition to HD broadcasts beginning with season 37. During the weeks of September 28, 2009, September 20, 2010, and October 4, 2010, two new episodes aired each weekday on CBS. In 2009, the additional episodes filled a gap between the cancellation of the daytime drama &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and the debut of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. In 2010, the extra episodes aired between the cancellation of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and the debut of &quot;The Talk&quot;. The intervening week offered a second episode of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. The 2009 second episode aired in the timeslot vacated by &quot;Guiding Light&quot; at 10:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m. ET/PT, depending on the affiliate&#x27;s choice. In 2010, the second episode aired in the former &quot;As the World Turns&quot; time slot, at 2:00 p.m. ET/PT. On December 5, 2024, it was announcedthat reruns of &quot;The Price is Right&quot; will temporarily fill in the timeslot of the recently cancelled afternoon daytime talk show &quot;The Talk&quot; (which was cancelled on December 16, 2024) until the new soap opera &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot; arrives on February 24, 2025. However, on January 27, 2025, &quot;Price&quot; reruns were eventually replaced by encore episodes of the rebooted &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;hosted by Nate Burleson until January 31, 2025.

===Syndicated productions===
Three syndicated versions of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; have aired. The first two followed the same format as the half-hour daytime version but were intended to air on most stations in the early evening in the pre-prime time slot, and as such, they were referred to by the announcer as &quot;the nighttime &quot;Price Is Right&quot;.&quot;

====1972–1980====
A weekly syndicated version debuted the week after the daytime premiere and continued to air until September 1980. It was distributed by Viacom Enterprises, which had started as the syndication arm of CBS. When Mark Goodson devised the revival of &quot;Price&quot; for the 1972–73 season, it was intended for a nighttime broadcast only under new rules for early-prime syndication, and Goodson named Dennis James to host the show. When CBS commissioned a new weekday daytime version, Goodson also wanted James to host that show, but CBS wanted Barker, who was still hosting the syndicated &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; at the time, to take it. Barker preferred to host &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, but CBS, again, insisted that he host &quot;Price&quot; instead.

James eventually hosted a taping day (four half-hour episodes) of the daytime show in December 1974 when Barker fell ill; those episodes were broadcast on and around Christmas Day. James did so concurrently with another daytime hosting gig, on the NBC version of &quot;Name That Tune&quot;, another revived format from the 1950s.

The two versions were largely similar at the beginning, as both were called &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot;. Some games had rule differences because of the larger budget and less commercial time on the nighttime show; for example, Double Prices was played for two prizes instead of one.

This version retained the 1972 half-hour format for its entire run and never adopted the daytime show&#x27;s Double Showcase rule or the Showcase Showdown added to the daytime format when it expanded to an hour in 1975. The word &quot;New&quot; was dropped from the program&#x27;s name starting in the second season, being titled simply &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (as the daytime show was by this time as well) from that point onward, and was often referred to on the air by James and Olson as &quot;the nighttime &quot;Price Is Right&quot;.&quot; In most of the U.S., stations carried the syndicated &quot;Price&quot; as one of other programs airing in the timeslot (7:30 p.m. ET) immediately before primetime which was created by the 1971 FCC Prime Time Access Rule.

Though the nighttime version originally had higher ratings than the CBS daytime version, by 1975, the syndicated ratings started to drop. After the fifth nighttime season in 1977, when the contract with NBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations ended, James&#x27;s contract was not renewed. CBS&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations picked the show up and the decision was made to hire Barker, to bring it in line with the daytime version. The series taped its 300th and final episode on March 12, 1980, and was cancelled after weekly syndicated game shows had fallen out of popularity in favor of daily offerings (such as &quot;Family Feud&quot;, which had expanded to daily syndication the same year &quot;The Nighttime Price Is Right&quot; ended). With a run of eight seasons, it was one of the longest-running weekly syndicated game shows of the era and the longest-running regularly-scheduled primetime version of &quot;Price&quot; (the 1957–1964 version aired seven seasons).

====1985–86====
Five years later, veteran host Tom Kennedy starred in a new daily syndicated version, which also used the traditional half-hour format and was syndicated by The Television Program Source. Like the previous syndicated series, this version had a slightly larger budget than its daytime counterpart. A perfect bid during the One-Bids originally won that contestant a $100 bonus (like the daytime show did then), but was later increased to $500. This increased bonus permanently carried over to the daytime show in 1998.

Janice Pennington, Holly Hallstrom, and Dian Parkinson all reprised their roles for this series, as did Johnny Olson until his death. Unlike the daytime series, the syndicated series did not employ guest announcers after Olson died and instead named Gene Wood as his replacement. Wood, in turn, was replaced by Rod Roddy shortly after he was named as Olson&#x27;s successor on the daytime series.

Like its predecessor, this syndicated edition of &quot;Price&quot; was intended to be aired in the Prime Time Access slots on local stations. However, unlike the 1970s, local stations found themselves bombarded with game shows and other series looking for spots on stations in an increasingly crowded market. It often resulted in shows like &quot;Price&quot; airing anywhere that they could be fit into a station&#x27;s programming lineup, such as in the early-morning period or in late-night slots. As a consequence, the show was not able to find its intended audience and the ratings reports reflected that trouble.

&quot;Price&quot; was no exception, as many of the stations who bought the series placed it in those less desirable slots and the show could not find a foothold against the popular shows of the day, such as the runaway success of the syndicated &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Compared to some of the other shows on the market during this period, &quot;Price&quot; was a modest success, but it did not meet the very high expectations stations and Mark Goodson had for the series. As a result, the show was not renewed beyond its first season. A total of 170 episodes were produced, and they aired in first run from September 9, 1985, to May 30, 1986. During the six years it held the rights to &quot;Price&quot;, the Kennedy version is the only one of the three syndicated versions that was rerun by GSN.

====&quot;The New Price Is Right&quot;====
Eight years after the cancellation of Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Price Is Right&quot;, a new syndicated version premiered on September 12, 1994, hosted by Doug Davidson (of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; fame) and distributed by Paramount Domestic Television. This series featured several significant changes: eliminating Contestants&#x27; Row, a different format for the Showcase Showdown, a Showcase featuring only one contestant, a completely different set, and a much larger budget (even when compared to the two previous syndicated runs) that gave contestants the potential to win up to five times what they could win on the daytime show. However, this version had even more trouble finding an audience than the 1985–86 series did and ended its run on January 27, 1995, after only 16 weeks of first-run shows. Several stylistic elements of this series, as well as many of its music cues, were later integrated into both the daytime version and nighttime specials.

===CBS primetime specials and series===
====1986-1996====
CBS attempted to break NBC&#x27;s dominance of Thursday night prime time by &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Family Ties&quot; with a six-episode summer series, &quot;The Price Is Right Special&quot;, beginning in August 1986 that could be produced at a lower cost and promote the daytime game show. While it did not do its intended idea, it was the first of numerous primetime series for the game show. On August 23, 1996, CBS aired an hour-long 25th Anniversary Special, using the half-hour gameplay format and featuring a number of retrospective clips. The 30th Anniversary Special was recorded at Harrah&#x27;s Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and aired on January 31, 2002. This one-time road trip enticed 5,000 potential contestants to line up for 900 available tickets, causing an incident that left one person injured. 

====The Price Is Right Salutes====
A second six-episode primetime series saluting various branches of the United States armed forces, police officers, and firefighters aired during the summer of 2002, as a tribute to the heroes of the September 11 attacks. During the series &quot;The Price Is Right Salutes&quot;, spinning $1.00 in a bonus spin during the Showcase Showdown was worth $100,000 instead of the usual $10,000.

====2003-08: $1,000,000 Spectacular====
The success of the primetime series, which aired mostly in the summer, along with the vogue of big-money game shows, led to CBS launching another primetime series in 2003 that ran until 2008, titled &quot;The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular&quot;. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike and original success in the Nielsen ratings led CBS to commission ten more episodes of the primetime series. This series introduced set changes as the show was broadcast in high definition television for the first time and the set used for these episodes (except for the black floor) was moved to the daytime show in 2008. On the primetime series, larger and more expensive prizes were generally offered than on the daytime show. The Showcase frequently offered multiple or very expensive cars. In the first sixteen &quot;$1,000,000 Spectaculars&quot;, all hosted by Barker, the payoff for landing on the $1.00 during a bonus spin in the Showcase Showdown was increased to $1 million.

The rules for the $1 million bonus spin were later revised to offer the winner of the Showcase a spin if no other contestant had received a bonus spin in either Showcase Showdown. If both contestants overbid, an audience member was chosen at random to spin the wheel. This rule was again changed so that in the event of a double overbid, the contestant who overbid by the least received the bonus spin for a chance at $1 million.

The million-dollar spin was eliminated in 2008, and instead, contestants were given two ways to win the top prize. One pricing game per episode was selected as a &quot;million-dollar game&quot;, with a secondary objective needing to be met in order for the contestant to win the money. Contestants were also awarded the million-dollar bonus if they managed to win both Showcases, and the range the players had to come within was initially increased to $1,000, then reduced to $500. This format lasted one season (2008), which was made as replacement programming for the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike.

====The Price Is Right at Night====
In 2016, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; returned to primetime featuring cast members of CBS programs and hosts of CBS reality show franchises, including &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, and &quot;Survivor&quot;. The episodes featured fans of the three programs playing alongside past participants from them. In 2019, a retitled version called &quot;The Price Is Right at Night&quot; featured episodes with cast members from &quot;SEAL Team&quot; and others with Seth Rogen. Celebrities are paired with civilian contestants competing to win prizes. If there is a celebrity involved, episodes feature charitable donations toward a cause championed by the celebrity guest, with the celebrity joining the civilian contestants during the program. These shows feature a cash equivalent to all prizes won that episode in pricing games donated to the celebrity&#x27;s charity, and during the second Showcase Showdown, making one spin of the Showcase Showdown wheel, with the value multiplied by 10,000 to be donated to the celebrity&#x27;s charity. After the shortened season caused by a six and a half month suspension of production caused by pandemic related shutdowns, Season 49 premiered in October 2020 as a primetime episode, and that season also featured a salute to essential workers in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and the cast of &quot;The Neighborhood&quot; playing as themselves for charity in primetime. The first three episodes of Season 49 were actually primetime episodes that aired weekly before the first daytime episode aired November 16. 

An August 2021 announcement detailed a two-hour primetime special &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; to air on September 30, 2021, in honor of its 50th season. The special featured a retrospective of memorable moments and outtakes from the show&#x27;s history.

As a result of the labor stoppages with the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America, CBS announced on July 17, 2023 new episodes of &quot;The Price Is Right at Night&quot; during the 2023-24 primetime season to add to what is normally scheduled during the season between new seasons of &quot;Survivor&quot;. The first batch of episodes aired in October 2023, with &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal Primetime&quot; airing in November. The first five primetime episodes of season 52 aired on October 2, 9, 13, 20, and 23. On October 18, 2023, the second set of five episodes were announced, featuring Christmas-themed episodes airing in the first week of December (December 4–5 and 7-8, skipping Wednesday because of Survivor and The Amazing Race), and one episode the Monday before Christmas on December 18. The Christmas Week episodes include Office Holiday Party, College Students, Blind Holidate, Holiday Heroes, with the fifth episode being a family-themed episode. A total of 21 episodes were taped in the season, one shy of a normal television primetime season. . As such, the series aired seven episodes in &quot;Survivors time slot, commencing with Jackpot January each Wednesday from January 3 to February 21 until the start of &quot;Survivor&quot; series 46, with additional Jackpot episode on February 2 (a Friday) and except for February 7. Jackpot January&quot;&#x27; added new twists to classic pricing games, with the introduction of a six-digit 3 Strikes using five-digit rules to allow duplication of the first digit, Bullseye played for cash where a player plays with all five grocery products for a doubling cash jackpot each time the contestant makes a correct guess, Money Game where players played for &quot;both&quot; a car and boat, and a playing of Any Number where the cash in the piggy bank was made larger than the traditional car prize. 

The February 7 episode was not Jackpot January, but instead the show&#x27;s quadrennial Super Bowl themed episode featuring Jason and Travis Kelce remotely introducing their mother Donna Kelce, who presented a Showcase, and the episode&#x27;s signature prize package of a Super Bowl tickets and travel to the event. The episode was taped January 3, 2024, before the end of the NFL regular season, before Travis Kelce (KC) would play in the game. Since Carey took over the show in 2007, the show has begun offering a Super Bowl-themed episode in years CBS carries the game, with the -10 season being the first, and except in -21 season because of pandemic restrictions where the Super Bowl travel and tickets trip could not be offered. Starting with the -24 NFL season, the first under new media deals, each of the four major broadcast networks carry the game on a four-year rotation. 

On August 31, 2023, at 8:00 p.m. ET, CBS aired a special one-hour program called &quot;The Price Is Right: A Tribute to Bob Barker&quot; with Carey serving as host. The program was a tribute to the life and career of longtime host Bob Barker, who died from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease the previous Saturday morning at age 99. The program featured Carey introducing several segments highlighting the greatest moments of Barker&#x27;s career, including being introduced as host of &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; in 1956 and the originally named &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot; in 1972 as well as the famous movie &quot;brawl&quot; with Adam Sandler in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; all the way to his final three guest appearances after his retirement. It also focused on Barker&#x27;s advocacy for animal rights and spaying and neutering pets. As of September 2023, this is the only episode to not feature any gameplay, studio audience or other members from the show&#x27;s cast (including announcer George Gray and the models). Season 52 tapings had commenced in late July 2023, a full month prior to Barker&#x27;s death, and the special was filmed after a scheduled Season 52 taping day, becoming the first Price-related programming to air from the new studio. Reruns of the program aired on September 4, 2023 (the show&#x27;s anniversary), and December 12, 2023 (the latter of which would have been Bob Barker&#x27;s 100th birthday), in the show&#x27;s customary 11:00 a.m. ET time slot.

Season 53 premiered with both a daytime and primetime episode on the same day, and with the reduction in episodes for most scripted television shows, the first three weeks of the season started with Monday primetime episodes, each with themes where all six pricing games are played for the same type of prize (cash in the first week, cars in the second week, and trips in the third). The cars and trips episodes featured Further primetime episodes will be broadcast primarily on Wednesdays from December to February between &quot;Survivor&quot; 47 and 48, and additional episodes to be broadcast in May after &quot;Survivor&quot; 48 concludes. The Jackpot January format will be used for the winter episodes. On the December 24, 2024 episode (&quot;Holiday Heroes&quot;), Check-Out featured a $20,000 bonus prize if a player could guess exactly the price of any of the five products in the pricing game.

===Gameshow Marathon===
On May 31, 2006, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; was featured on the series &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot;, one of seven classic game shows hosted by talk show host and actress Ricki Lake and was announced by &quot;Price&quot;&#x27;s then-announcer Rich Fields. This version combined aspects of the Barker and Davidson versions with the celebrity contestants playing three pricing games, followed by a Showcase Showdown where the &quot;two&quot; contestants with the highest scores moved on to the Showcase. The winner of the Showcase also earned a spot in Finalists&#x27; Row. Fields was the announcer for this version which was taped in Studio 46. It also marked the first &quot;Price Is Right&quot; episode directed by DiPirro, who replaced Eskander as the director on the daytime show in January 2009.

===Reruns===

Game Show Network was the first cable channel to carry reruns of the show from December 9, 1996 to April 3, 2000. These reruns mostly consisted of episodes from the early 1980’s along with selected episodes from the show’s first ten seasons, episodes from season 15 (1986-87) and season 20 (1991-92), and the 1985-86 syndicated episodes with Tom Kennedy as host. Episodes from before September 1982 (season 11) had to be screened beforehand to eliminate episodes with fur coat prizes at Barker’s request, a factor that delayed the show from joining the channel two years after its launch.

Paramount-owned Pluto TV and Fremantle-owned Buzzr announced on November 30, 2020, that a new 24-hour channel named &quot;The Price Is Right: The Barker Era&quot; would be added to the Pluto TV lineup starting on December 1, 2020. The channel includes episodes of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; from the 1980s hosted by Barker, with some episodes airing for the first time since their original air dates. As part of the launch, a selection of holiday-themed episodes from the era aired on Christmas Eve 2020. The channel was added to The Roku Channel on February 8, 2022. Episodes from the 1972–73 season were added into the rotation in November 2023.

On June 1, 2023, Pluto TV launched another &quot;Price&quot; channel, which includes episodes from the late 2000s and early 2010s hosted by Carey.

Fremantle had an exclusivity agreement with Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS and Pluto TV, giving Paramount the rights to all episodes of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; from 1972 onward, for this reason, Fremantle could not air &quot;Price&quot; reruns on Buzzr&#x27;s over-the-air affiliates, nor could they license out the show to other networks. On May 28, 2024, this exclusivity agreement was lifted, allowing Buzzr to carry &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; reruns from the Barker era on Buzzr, with episodes culled from the same pool of 1980s episodes as the Pluto TV channel.

In Canada, beginning in September of 2023, Canadian network GameTV began airing episodes from the 1982-83 season, culled from the same pool that aired on Pluto TV channel. In September of 2024, the network began airing the half-hour episodes from the 1972-73 season.

== Scientific research ==
The show has attracted attention from economists, who analyze different elements as a natural experiment on strategic decision making.

Several papers focus on the One Bid game. Jonathan Berk and others show that a rational bidder should cut off an existing bid by bidding $1 above it. Pavel Atanasov and coauthors show that fourth bidders are more likely to cut off opposite-gender opponents than members of their own gender.

Studies of the Showcase Showdown test the game-theoretic notion of subgame perfect equilibrium. In game-theoretic terms, The Showcase Showdown is a sequential game of perfect information for which the equilibrium can be found through backward induction. Several papers have solved the optimal strategy for particular spin outcomes. Rafael Tenorio and Timothy N. Cason studied a set of episodes from 1994 and 1995 and found evidence that players under-spin compared to the equilibrium prediction. Recently, a team of economists analyzed 40 years of data and found the same pattern of under-spinning, but only for the contestant who spins first. They found these mistakes are well explained by limited foresight; a sizeable fraction of contestants appear to myopically consider the next stage of the game. In line with learning, the researchers found the quality of contestants&#x27; choices improves over time.

==Reality web show spinoffs==
===&quot;Road to Price&quot;===
&quot;Road to Price&quot; is a six episode reality documentary show aired on the now-defunct &quot;CBS Innertube&quot; from September 20, 2006, to September 27, 2006. The program featured nine teenage boys driving to Los Angeles in a refurbished mini-school bus as they leave their hometown of Merrimack, New Hampshire in order to be on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. The episode of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; featuring the cast aired September 27, 2006.

===&quot;The Price Is Right Male Model Search&quot;===
Five episodes aired on their official website &quot;priceisright.com&quot; along with its YouTube page from October 27, 2014, to November 11, 2014. The series was created in order to replace the first male &quot;Price&quot; model Rob Wilson as he pursued an acting career in the online version of the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. During the webisode series, hopeful contestants attempt to be selected as the next male model. Judges included Wilson, Mike Richards, Manuela Arbeláez, Amber Lancaster, Gwendolyn Osborne-Smith, Rachel Reynolds, and former Miss America Shanna Moakler. The three finalists appeared on the CBS daytime talk show &quot;The Talk&quot;. Online voting determined the winner, and James O&#x27;Halloran became the newest cast member. He first appeared on the episode which aired on December 15, 2014. He has since been joined by a third male model, former NFL player Devin Goda, who joined the show during season 47.

==Documentary films==
* &quot;Come On Down&quot;, a 1984 BBC produced documentary about American game shows.
* &quot;Come On Down! The Game Show Story&quot;, a 2014 ITV British documentary mini-series presented by Bradley Walsh.
* &quot;Come on Down!&quot;, a 2016 documentary about two friends who venture from Boston to Cali to crack the greatest game show in television history.
* &quot;Perfect Bid: The Contestant Who Knew Too Much&quot; was released on October 13, 2017, and was directed by CJ Wallis and was produced by FortyFPS Productions and MK Ultra Productions. It explores how contestant Ted Slauson became adept at memorizing the prices of the prizes and products on the show since its inception in 1972, culminating in Slauson&#x27;s helping contestant Terry Kniess bid perfectly on a showcase in 2008. It became one of the biggest controversies in game-show history, and was covered by &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, TMZ, and other publications. The film features guest appearances by Bob Barker, Roger Dobkowitz, Kevin Pollak and Drew Carey.

==Prizes==
As of November 2009, the show had given away approximately $250 million in cash and prizes. Furs have not been offered as prizes since Barker&#x27;s tenure as host (although wool and leather are now permitted). Several Barker-imposed prohibitions have been lifted since his departure, such as offering products made of leather or leather seats in vehicles and showing simulated meat props on barbecues and in ovens. The show has also offered couture clothing and accessories, featuring designers such as Coach Inc., Louis Vuitton, and Limited Brands in an attempt to attract a younger demographic, as well as backyard play equipment such as JumpSport Trampolines and electronics such as smartphones, personal computer systems, video game systems and entertainment centers. Other prizes which have frequently appeared on the show since its beginnings include automobiles, furniture, trips and cash. The most expensive prize offered on this version of the show was a Ferrari 458 Italia Spider sports car, priced at $285,716, that appeared on the April 25, 2013, episode during &quot;Big Money Week.&quot; The prize was offered during the 3 Strikes pricing game. Prior to this, the most expensive prize was a Tesla Roadster (2008) (valued at $112,845), featured on the April 22, 2010, episode in the pricing game Golden Road.

Since Carey took over as host, prizes from Ohio-based companies or companies with major Ohio operations have appeared, as Ohio is the home state of Carey and former announcer Fields. They have included Honda (see below), as well as Jeni&#x27;s Splendid Ice Creams, which is based in Columbus, Ohio and got its start in Columbus&#x27;s historic North Market.

===Automobiles===

Since the show&#x27;s debut, automobiles have been a signature prize on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. Most hour-long episodes have two pricing games that are each played for an automobile and in most episodes (although not all), at least one showcase will include an automobile. For special episodes, such as the 5,000th episode, there will often be more cars offered.

From 1991 to 2008, almost all automobiles offered on the show were made by companies based in the United States, specifically Detroit&#x27;s Big Three (although cars made by these companies&#x27; foreign subsidiaries or in a joint-venture with a foreign company were also offered during this era, in all cases badged under an American nameplate). The move was made by Barker, in his capacity as executive producer, as a sign of patriotism during the first Iraq war in 1991 and as a show of support to the American car industry, which was particularly struggling at that time. When Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz in 1998 to form Daimler Chrysler AG (now simply Daimler AG after Chrysler split from the automaker, Chrysler later merged with Italian automaker Fiat to form Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and following another merger with French automaker PSA Group to form the Dutch-based Stellantis), the foreign ownership of Chrysler did not affect carrying any Chrysler-related models.

Since Barker&#x27;s retirement, cars made by foreign companies have been offered, most notably Honda, which has several factories throughout Ohio. Through product placement, certain episodes in 2008 and 2009 featured Honda as the exclusive automobile manufacturer for vehicles offered on that episode. The major European (Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, Fiat, Polestar, and Volvo) and Asian (Hyundai-Kia, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan, Honda, and VinFast) manufacturers have all provided cars on the show since the ban was lifted, with premium foreign cars almost exclusively used for games that generally offer higher-priced cars, such as Golden Road and 3 Strikes. Starting around 2010, vintage and classic cars have occasionally been offered as prizes for games that do not involve pricing them. Among them have been a 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air and a 1964 Bentley S3. These cars are usually offered in games where their prices are irrelevant to gameplay, such as Hole in One and Bonus Game.

===Vacation trips===
Trips were also featured many times on the show as awards. These included both domestic trips across the United States and international trips. Usually, the trips were sponsored by hotel companies and, sometimes, by airlines as well. One frequent trip sponsor during the 1980s was American airline company Western Airlines.

===Winnings records===
The record for the largest individual total in cash and prizes on a daytime episode is held by Michael Strouber. On the October 14, 2019 episode, which aired during Big Money Week, Strouber won $202,000 (one $200,000 chip, one zero, and two $1,000 chips) in cash during a playing of Plinko. During the episode, game rules were modified to offer a top prize of $1,000,000, with each chip worth up to $200,000. Strouber walked away with $262,743 in cash and prizes, including a new car, a diamond tennis bracelet and a trip to Fiji.

The record for winnings on the primetime show is currently held by Adam Rose. On February 22, 2008, the first &quot;The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular&quot; episode since Carey became host, Rose won $20,000 playing Grand Game. By being within $1,000 of the actual retail price of his own showcases, he won both showcases—which included a Cadillac XLR convertible in his showcase and a Ford Escape Hybrid in his opponent&#x27;s—plus a $1 million bonus. Rose&#x27;s total is also the record for winnings on any version of the &quot;Price&quot; franchise worldwide, shattering the previous mark set by Joanne Segeviano on the Australian version in 2005.

Terry Kniess holds the record for the closest bid on a showcase without going over, guessing the exact price of the showcase he was given. Kniess, an avid viewer of the show, recorded and watched every episode for four months prior to when he and his wife had tickets to attend in September 2008. Kniess learned that many prizes were repeatedly used (always at the same price) and began taking notes. Kniess was selected as a contestant on September 22, 2008, lost his pricing game (the only contestant to do so that episode), made it to the final showcase and guessed the exact amount of $23,743 for his showcase. Many show staffers, including Carey, were worried that the show was rigged and that Kniess was cheating. Kniess later explained that he had seen all three items of the showcase before and knew the general prices in the thousands. The 743 he used because it was his PIN, based on his wedding date and his wife&#x27;s birth month. Kniess&#x27; winnings from the show totalled $56,437.

Carey attributed his subdued reaction to the perfect bid by saying, &quot;Everybody thought someone had cheated. We&#x27;d just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. I remember asking, &#x27;Are we ever going to air this?&#x27; And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show was never going to air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. I thought they were going to shut us down, and I thought I was going to be out of a job.&quot; Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the 1980s CBS game show &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence).

Two are tied for second with the next closest bid, $1, and it happened in 1980 &amp; 2024.

==Reception==

===Critical reaction===
&quot;The Price Is Right&quot; has generally been praised and remained a stalwart in television ratings over its long history. In a 2007 article, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named the program the &quot;greatest game show of all time.&quot; The introduction of the program ushered in a new era of game shows—moving away from the knowledge-based quiz show format, creating &quot;a noisy, carnival atmosphere that challenged cultural norms and assumptions represented in previous generations of quiz shows.&quot;

The show&#x27;s early reception was not as universally positive, as critics lamented the show&#x27;s stark departure from the highbrow norms of the Golden Age of Television; original nighttime host Dennis James admitted that even his own housekeeper did not watch the show for that reason, but also defended the series, saying &quot;CBS, who never wanted game shows, just put three game shows on the air, so they know they had better join the fight or lose out, because game shows have a tremendous appeal. The critics will always look down their noses, but you can&#x27;t have &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot; on and still stay in competition. If you want to read books, read books.&quot;

==Lawsuits==
Since the mid-1990s, the program production company and in some cases the executive producer (both Bob Barker and Mike Richards, the executive producer from 2009 to 2019) have been sued by numerous women. Most of the lawsuits involved models and other staff members in cases of sexual harassment, wrongful termination and racial discrimination. Allegations of sexual harassment brought by Dian Parkinson led to Barker calling a press conference to admit a past consensual sexual relationship with her, while denying any harassment, explaining that she was only angry with him for calling off the relationship. Barker was widowed in 1981 following the death of his wife, Dorothy Jo, but was in a separate long-term relationship with Nancy Burnet (one that would continue until his death) during his affair with Parkinson. It has also been alleged that Barker and senior staff created a hostile work environment, particularly to those who testified for the plaintiffs suing Barker. Responding to the controversy just before his retirement, Barker told William Keck of &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;They have been such a problem. I don&#x27;t want to say anything about them. They [were] disgusting, I don&#x27;t want to mention them.&quot; The Barker-era lawsuits, except for one, were settled out of court. After Barker dropped his slander suit against Hallstrom, she eventually countersued and received millions in settlement. Former model Lanisha Cole filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the show&#x27;s producers in 2011; it was settled in 2013.

The lawsuits for &quot;Price&quot; affected the popular syndicated game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, as Mike Richards (who had been named host of the show before resigning in the span of nine days) was executive producer for &quot;Price&quot; from 2008 to 2019. Richards returned to &quot;Price&quot; to assist in producing the Barker tribute in August 2023.

==Merchandise==
&quot;The Price Is Right&quot; has expanded beyond television to home and live stage shows, and casino-based games.

===DVD release===
A four-disc DVD box set, titled &quot;The Best of &quot;The Price Is Right,”&quot; was released on March 25, 2008. The set features four episodes of the 1956–1965 Bill Cullen series, 17 episodes of the Barker 1972–1975 daytime series and the final five daytime episodes hosted by Barker. In accordance with Barker&#x27;s animal-rights wishes, which remain in effect beyond his retirement, any episodes with fur coats as prizes cannot be aired or released onto home media formats. This includes the first three daytime shows recorded in 1972, plus most of the 1970s syndicated run.

===Board games===
Seven board games have been produced. One of them was a variation of a card game, using prizes and price tags from the 1956 version. The second was based more closely on the original version of the show.

Three games were produced during the 1970s by Milton Bradley, with Contestants&#x27; Row, some pricing games, and, in the case of the third version, a spinner for the Big Wheel. In the first two versions, decks of cards had various grocery items, small prizes, and larger prizes. The third version simply had cards for each game that included ten sets of &quot;right&quot; answers, all using the same price choices. The instruction book specified what color cards were necessary for each round.

The 1986 version, again by Milton Bradley, was similar in scope to the earlier version, with new prizes and more games, but lacking the Big Wheel. The instruction book refers to Contestants&#x27; Row as the &quot;Qualifying Round&quot; and the pricing games as &quot;Solo Games.&quot; The book also instructs players to use items priced under $100 as One Bids. The 1998 version of the game, by Endless Games, was virtually identical to the 1986 release, with the same games, prizes, and even the same prices. The only changes were that the number tiles were made of cardboard bits instead of plastic and the cars from the deck of prizes with four-digit prices were removed.

The 2004 version, again by Endless Games, was a complete departure from previous home versions. Instead of different prize cards and games, the game consisted of everything needed to play 45 games and enough materials to create all the games not technically included if the &quot;host&quot; wished to and knew their rules. The Big Wheel spinner was also restored, this time with the numbers in the correct order. Additionally, the prices, instead of being random numbers that could change each time the game was played, were actual prices taken from episodes of the TV show. To fit everything in the box, grocery items and prizes were listed in the instruction book and games were played on dry erase boards. A spinner determined the game to be played next, although its use was not necessarily required if the &quot;host&quot; wished to build his own game lineup, or even use a pricing game not included in the lineup.

===Computer and electronic games===

In 1990, GameTek created a &quot;Price Is Right&quot; video game for MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and other. A handheld Tiger game was made in 1998 with four pricing games. A DVD game with 12 pricing games, live casino show host Todd Newton and video of prizes taken directly from the show was produced by Endless Games in 2005. A 2008 DVD edition, also from Endless Games, featured many changes based on season 36 and included seven new games: Half Off, More or Less, Swap Meet, Secret X, That&#x27;s Too Much, Coming or Going, and Hole in One. It also featured both host Drew Carey and announcer Rich Fields. CBS.com featured an online &quot;Price Is Right&quot;-based game in the late 1990s, which was plugged in the closing credits of each episode. The game consisted of choosing which of the four bidders in Contestant&#x27;s Row was closest to the price of a prize without going over. Additionally, Mobliss provides a suite of pricing games for cellular phones.

On March 26, 2008, Ludia (in connection with Ubisoft) launched &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; video game for Windows. A version for the Wii and Nintendo DS was released in September 2008. A version for the iOS was released in November 2008. The show&#x27;s then-current announcer, Rich Fields, was the host of the computer version. The virtual set in the game resembled the set used in Seasons 31 to 34. Ludia announced that all three platforms will receive a new version of the video game that was previewed at the Target Bullseye Lounge during the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show on June 2–4, 2009. &quot;The Price Is Right 2010 Edition&quot; was released on September 22, 2009. In the fall of 2010, Ludia developed a multi-player version for Facebook. A third Ludia adaptation, &quot;The Price Is Right Decades&quot;, featuring set designs, pricing games and prizes taken from the 1970s through 2000s, was initially released for the Wii in October 2011, with an Xbox 360 and iOS release following in November and December. &quot;The Price Is Right 2010 Edition&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right Decades&quot; have also been released as downloads within the PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 in May 2010 and April 2012, respectively. Irwin Toys released an electronic tabletop version in 2008 featuring Contestant&#x27;s Row, the Big Wheel, a physical Plinko board with chips, Showcases and seven pricing games. Jakks Pacific released a Plug It in and Play version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; in 2009, featuring Carey and Fields.

===Slot machines===

A series of video slot machines were manufactured for North American casinos by International Game Technology. Although gameplay varies by machine, each features themes and motifs from the show, including the Showcase Showdown, with themes used following Carey&#x27;s start as host. Others feature pricing games as gameplay elements, including Plinko, Cliff Hangers, Punch a Bunch, Dice Game, and Money Game.

===Scratch-off tickets===

A scratchcard version of the game is being offered by several U.S. and Canadian state/provincial lotteries, featuring adaptations of Plinko, Cliff Hangers, the Showcase Showdown and the Showcase. The top prize varies with each version.

===&quot;Live&quot; casino game===
After the 30th anniversary episode taped in Las Vegas in 2002, Harrah&#x27;s and RTL Group began producing live licensed shows (dubbed &quot;The Price Is Right Live!&quot;) at their venues, with several performers, including Roger Lodge, Marc Summers (who was one of the finalists to replace Barker), Newton, and Gray hosting, with West, Rosen, and Dave Walls announcing.

===&quot;Come on Down Tour!&quot;===
In 2022, the show launched a coast-to-coast tour of live events celebrating the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Contestants had &quot;a chance to play Plinko, spin the wheel, and compete in a Showcase&quot; to win prizes, and had a chance to win an additional $50,000. The tour visited 50 locations and stopped in Los Angeles, Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Nashville, St. Louis, Cleveland (the hometown of the show&#x27;s current host Drew Carey) and New York. In October 2022, the tour returned as part of a special weekend event along with the celebration of Carey&#x27;s 15th season as host sponsored by the Paley Center for Media called PaleyWKND. In addition, Drew Carey, George Gray, and Devin Goda were scheduled to be there in person.

<text>Frederick Seitz (July 4, 1911 – March 2, 2008) was an American physicist, a pioneer of solid state physics, and climate change denier. Seitz was the 4th president of Rockefeller University from 1968 to 1978, and the 17th president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1962 to 1969. Seitz was the recipient of the National Medal of Science, NASA&#x27;s Distinguished Public Service Award, and other honors.

He founded the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and several other material research laboratories across the United States. Seitz was also the founding chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute.

==Background and personal life==
Seitz was born in San Francisco on July 4, 1911. His mother was also from San Francisco and his father, after whom he was named, was born in Germany. Seitz graduated from Lick-Wilmerding High School in the middle of his senior year, and went on to study physics at Stanford University obtaining his bachelor&#x27;s degree in three years, graduating in 1932. He married Elizabeth K. Marshall on May 18, 1935.

Seitz died March 2, 2008, in New York.
He was survived by a son, three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

==Early career==

Seitz moved to Princeton University to study metals under Eugene Wigner, gaining his PhD in 1934. He and Wigner pioneered one of the first quantum theories of crystals, and developed concepts in solid-state physics such as the Wigner–Seitz unit cell used in the study of crystalline material in solid-state physics.

==Academic career==
After graduate studies, Seitz continued to work on solid state physics, publishing &quot;The Modern Theory of Solids&quot; in 1940, motivated by a desire to &quot;write a cohesive account of the various aspects of solid-state physics in order to give the field the kind of unity it deserved&quot;. &quot;The Modern Theory of Solids&quot; helped unify and understand the relations between the fields of metallurgy, ceramics, and electronics. He was also a consultant on many World War II-related projects in metallurgy, radiation damage to solids and electronics amongst others. He, along with Hillard Huntington, made the first calculation of the energies of formation and migration of vacancies and interstitials in copper, inspiring many works on point defects in metals. The scope of his published work ranged widely, also covering &quot;spectroscopy, luminescence, plastic deformation, irradiation effects, physics of metals, self-diffusion, point defects in metals and insulators, and science policy&quot;.

Early in his academic career, Seitz served on the faculty of the University of Rochester (1935–37) and after an interlude as a research physicist at General Electric Laboratories (1937–39) he was at the University of Pennsylvania (1939–1942) and then the Carnegie Institute of Technology (1942–49).

From 1946 to 1947, Seitz was director of the training program in atomic energy at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He was appointed professor of physics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1949, becoming chairman of the department in 1957 and dean and vice-president for research in 1964. Seitz also served as an advisor to NATO. From 1962 to 1969 Seitz served as president of the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS), in a full-time capacity from 1965. As NAS president he initiated the Universities Research Association, which contracted with the Atomic Energy Commission to construct the world&#x27;s largest particle accelerator at the time, Fermilab.

He was the president of Rockefeller University from 1968 to 1978 during which he helped to launch new research programs in molecular biology, cell biology, and neuroscience as well as creating a joint MD-PhD program with Cornell University. He retired from Rockefeller University in 1979, when he was made President Emeritus.

==Consultancy career==
After Seitz published a paper on the darkening of crystals, DuPont asked him in 1939 for help with a problem they were having with the stability of chrome yellow. He became &quot;deeply involved&quot; in their research efforts. Among other things, he investigated the possible use of non-toxic silicon carbide as a white pigment. Seitz was a director of Texas Instruments (1971–1982) and of Akzona Corporation (1973–1982).

Shortly before his 1979 retirement from Rockefeller University, Seitz began working as a permanent consultant for the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, advising their medical research program until 1988. Reynolds had previously provided &quot;very generous&quot; support for biomedical work at Rockefeller. Seitz later wrote that &quot;The money was all spent on basic science, medical science,&quot; and pointed to Reynolds-funded research on mad cow disease and tuberculosis. Nonetheless, later academic studies of tobacco industry influence concluded that Seitz, who helped allocate $45m of Reynolds&#x27; research funding, &quot;played a key role... in helping the tobacco industry produce uncertainty concerning the health impacts of smoking.&quot; According to a tobacco industry memo from 1989, Seitz was described by an employee of Philip Morris International as &quot;quite elderly and not sufficiently rational to offer advice.&quot;

In 1984 Seitz was the founding chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute, and was its chairman until 2001. The Institute was founded to argue for President Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative, but &quot;in the 1990s it branched out to become one of the leading think tanks trying to debunk the science of climate change.&quot; A 1990 report co-authored with Institute co-founders Robert Jastrow and William Nierenberg &quot;centrally informed the Bush administration&#x27;s position on human-induced climate change&quot;. The Institute also promoted environmental skepticism more generally. In 1994, the Institute published a paper by Seitz titled &quot;Global warming and ozone hole controversies: A challenge to scientific judgment.&quot; Seitz questioned the view that CFCs &quot;are the greatest threat to the ozone layer&quot;. In the same paper, commenting on the dangers of secondary inhalation of tobacco smoke, he concluded &quot;&quot;there is no good scientific evidence that passive inhalation is truly dangerous under normal circumstances.&quot;

Seitz was a central figure amongst global warming deniers. He was the highest-ranking scientist among a band of doubters who, beginning in the early 1990s, resolutely disputed suggestions that global warming was serious threat. Seitz argued that the science behind global warming was inconclusive and &quot;certainly didn&#x27;t warrant imposing mandatory limits on greenhouse-gas emissions&quot;&quot;. In 2001 Seitz and Jastrow questioned whether global warming is anthropogenic.

Seitz signed the 1995 Leipzig Declaration and, in an open letter inviting scientists to sign the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine&#x27;s global warming petition, called for the United States to reject the Kyoto Protocol. The letter was accompanied by a 12-page article on climate change which followed a style and format nearly identical to that of a contribution to Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a scientific journal, even including a date of publication (&quot;October 26&quot;) and volume number (&quot;Vol. 13: 149–164 1999&quot;), but was not actually a publication of the National Academy of Science (NAS). In response the United States National Academy of Sciences took what the &quot;New York Times&quot; called &quot;the extraordinary step of refuting the position of one [of] its former presidents.&quot; The NAS also made it clear that &quot;The petition does not reflect the conclusions of expert reports of the Academy.&quot;

Seitz worked extensively with Fred Singer during his consultancy career for tobacco and oil corporations in matters of health and climate change, respectively.

==Publishing==
Seitz wrote a range of scientific books in his field, including &quot;The Modern Theory of Solids&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Physics of Metals&quot; (1943). Later he co-authored books such as the &quot;Theory of Lattice Dynamics in the Harmonic Approximation&quot; (1971) and &quot;Solid State Physics&quot;. The latter, begun in 1955, with David Turnbull, reached 60 volumes by 2008, with Seitz remaining an active editor until volume 38 in 1984. &quot;Solid State Physics&quot; continues to be published by Elsevier. After his retirement he co-authored a book on global warming, published via the George C. Marshall Institute he chaired. He published his autobiography in 1994. Other works included biographies of American physicist Francis Wheeler Loomis (1991) and Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden (1999), a history of silicon, and a history of the US National Academy of Sciences (2007).

==Criticism==

In the early 1970s, Seitz became unpopular for his support of the Vietnam war, a position which most of his colleagues on the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee did not share. In the late 1970s, Seitz also parted company with his scientific colleagues on questions of nuclear preparedness. Seitz was committed to &quot;a muscular military strengthened by the most technologically advanced weaponry&quot;, while the scientific community generally supported arms limitations talks and treaties. Seitz was also ardently anti-communist and his support for aggressive weapons programs was a reflection of this.

In their book &quot;Merchants of Doubt&quot;, science historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway state that Seitz and a group of other scientists fought the scientific evidence and spread confusion on many of the most important issues of the 20th and 21st centuries like harmfulness of tobacco smoke, acid rain, CFCs, pesticides and global warming. Seitz said that American science had become &quot;rigid&quot;, and his colleagues had become closed-minded and dogmatic. According to Oreskes and Conway, Seitz used normal uncertainties of scientific evidence to spread doubt about the harmfulness of tobacco smoke.

Seitz was also a principal organizer of the infamous Oregon Petition, where numerous signatories claimed that there was no evidence that greenhouse gases were responsible for global warming. Despite Seitz being a past President of the US National Academy of Sciences, the NAS issued a press release stating &quot;The petition project was a deliberate attempt to mislead scientists and to rally them in an attempt to undermine support for the Kyoto Protocol. The petition was not based on a review of the science of global climate change, nor were its signers experts in the field of climate science.&quot; Journalists subsequently found that the identities of the vast majority of signatories could not be verified, because the petition&#x27;s organizers had no process for identity authentication. Further, the supposed scientific article that claimed to refute global warming (and which accompanied the petition) was in fact a non-peer reviewed article from
the &quot;Journal of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons&quot;, which was published by Arthur Robinson, the petition&#x27;s co-organizer. This journal advocates scientifically discredited viewpoints such as claiming that there is no connection between the HIV virus and AIDS, and is not indexed in PubMed.

Oreskes and Conway were critical of Seitz&#x27;s involvement in the tobacco industry. They stated that Seitz stood against the scientific consensus that smoking was dangerous to people&#x27;s health, and helped to create confusion and doubt on this issue.

==Awards and recognition==
Seitz was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1946. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1952, serving as its President from 1962 to 1969. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962. He received the Franklin Medal (1965). In 1973 he was awarded the National Medal of Science &quot;for his contributions to the modern quantum theory of the solid state of matter.&quot; He also received the United States Department of Defense Distinguished Service Award; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s Distinguished Public Service Award; and the Compton Award, the highest honor of the American Institute of Physics. In addition to Rockefeller University, 31 universities in the US and abroad awarded Seitz honorary degrees. He was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Seitz served on a range of boards of charitable institutions, including (as chair) John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1976–1983) and Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, and (as trustee) American Museum of Natural History (from 1975) and Institute of International Education. He was also a board member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Other appointments to a range of national and international agencies included serving on the Defense Science Board and serving as chair of the US delegation to the United Nations Committee on Science and Technology. He also served on the board of trustees of Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1971 to 1974.

In 1981, Seitz became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

<text>The Game of Life, also known as Conway&#x27;s Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

==Rules==
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square &quot;cells&quot;, each of which is in one of two possible states, &quot;live&quot; or &quot;dead&quot; (or &quot;populated&quot; and &quot;unpopulated&quot;, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight &quot;neighbours&quot;, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the &quot;seed&quot; of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, live or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a &quot;tick&quot;. Each generation is a &quot;pure function&quot; of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

==Origins==

Stanisław Ulam, while working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1940s, studied the growth of crystals, using a simple lattice network as his model. At the same time, John von Neumann, Ulam&#x27;s colleague at Los Alamos, was working on the problem of self-replicating systems. Von Neumann&#x27;s initial design was founded upon the notion of one robot building another robot. This design is known as the kinematic model. As he developed this design, von Neumann came to realize the great difficulty of building a self-replicating robot, and of the great cost in providing the robot with a &quot;sea of parts&quot; from which to build its replicant. Neumann wrote a paper entitled &quot;The general and logical theory of automata&quot; for the Hixon Symposium in 1948. Ulam was the one who suggested using a &quot;discrete&quot; system for creating a reductionist model of self-replication. Ulam and von Neumann created a method for calculating liquid motion in the late 1950s. The driving concept of the method was to consider a liquid as a group of discrete units and calculate the motion of each based on its neighbours&#x27; behaviours. Thus was born the first system of cellular automata. Like Ulam&#x27;s lattice network, von Neumann&#x27;s cellular automata are two-dimensional, with his self-replicator implemented algorithmically. The result was a universal copier and constructor working within a cellular automaton with a small neighbourhood (only those cells that touch are neighbours; for von Neumann&#x27;s cellular automata, only orthogonal cells), and with 29 states per cell. Von Neumann gave an existence proof that a particular pattern would make endless copies of itself within the given cellular universe by designing a 200,000 cell configuration that could do so. This design is known as the tessellation model, and is called a von Neumann universal constructor.

Motivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, John Conway began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different two-dimensional cellular automaton rules. Conway&#x27;s initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cellular automaton. According to Martin Gardner, Conway experimented with different rules, aiming for rules that would allow for patterns to &quot;apparently&quot; grow without limit, while keeping it difficult to &quot;prove&quot; that any given pattern would do so. Moreover, some &quot;simple initial patterns&quot; should &quot;grow and change for a considerable period of time&quot; before settling into a static configuration or a repeating loop. Conway later wrote that the basic motivation for Life was to create a &quot;universal&quot; cellular automaton.

The game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, in Martin Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column, which was based on personal conversations with Conway. Theoretically, the Game of Life has the power of a universal Turing machine: anything that can be computed algorithmically can be computed within the Game of Life. Gardner wrote, &quot;Because of Life&#x27;s analogies with the rise, fall, and alterations of a society of living organisms, it belongs to a growing class of what are called &#x27;simulation games&#x27; (games that resemble real-life processes).&quot;

Since its publication, the Game of Life has attracted much interest because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. It provides an example of emergence and self-organization. A version of Life that incorporates random fluctuations has been used in physics to study phase transitions and nonequilibrium dynamics. The game can also serve as a didactic analogy, used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, philosopher Daniel Dennett has used the analogy of the Game of Life &quot;universe&quot; extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as consciousness and free will, from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws which might govern our universe.

The popularity of the Game of Life was helped by its coming into being at the same time as increasingly inexpensive computer access. The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated fractals. For many, the Game of Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, the Game of Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Game of Life board.

==Examples of patterns==
Many different types of patterns occur in the Game of Life, which are classified according to their behaviour. Common pattern types include: &quot;still lifes&quot;, which do not change from one generation to the next; &quot;oscillators&quot;, which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and &quot;spaceships&quot;, which translate themselves across the grid.

The earliest interesting patterns in the Game of Life were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using graph paper, blackboards, and physical game boards, such as those used in Go. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-pentomino failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping gliders; these were the first spaceships ever discovered.

Frequently occurring examples (in that they emerge frequently from a random starting configuration of cells) of the three aforementioned pattern types are shown below, with live cells shown in black and dead cells in white. &quot;Period&quot; refers to the number of ticks a pattern must iterate through before returning to its initial configuration.




The &quot;pulsar&quot; is the most common period-3 oscillator. The great majority of naturally occurring oscillators have a period of 2, like the blinker and the toad, but oscillators of all periods are known to exist, and oscillators of periods 4, 8, 14, 15, 30, and a few others have been seen to arise from random initial conditions. Patterns which evolve for long periods before stabilizing are called &quot;Methuselahs&quot;, the first-discovered of which was the R-pentomino. &quot;Diehard&quot; is a pattern that disappears after 130 generations. Starting patterns of eight or more cells can be made to die after an arbitrarily long time. &quot;Acorn&quot; takes 5,206 generations to generate 633 cells, including 13 escaped gliders.

Conway originally conjectured that no pattern can grow indefinitely—i.e. that for any initial configuration with a finite number of living cells, the population cannot grow beyond some finite upper limit. In the game&#x27;s original appearance in &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;, Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars () to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led by Bill Gosper; the &quot;Gosper glider gun&quot; produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known. In 2015, a gun called the &quot;Simkin glider gun&quot;, which releases a glider every 120th generation, was discovered that has fewer live cells but which is spread out across a larger bounding box at its extremities.
Smaller patterns were later found that also exhibit infinite growth. All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely. The first two create a single &quot;block-laying switch engine&quot;: a configuration that leaves behind two-by-two still life blocks as it translates itself across the game&#x27;s universe. The third configuration creates two such patterns. The first has only ten live cells, which has been proven to be minimal. The second fits in a five-by-five square, and the third is only one cell high.
Later discoveries included other &quot;guns&quot;, which are stationary, and which produce gliders or other spaceships; &quot;puffer trains&quot;, which move along leaving behind a trail of debris; and &quot;rakes&quot;, which move and emit spaceships. Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an asymptotically optimal quadratic growth rate, called a &quot;breeder&quot; or &quot;lobster&quot;, which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.

It is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This &quot;sliding block memory&quot; can be used to simulate a counter. It is possible to construct logic gates such as &quot;AND&quot;, &quot;OR&quot;, and &quot;NOT&quot; using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a finite-state machine connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a universal Turing machine, so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is Turing complete. In fact, several different programmable computer architectures have been implemented in the Game of Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.

===Oblique spaceships===
Until the 2010s, all known spaceships could only move orthogonally or diagonally. Spaceships which move neither orthogonally nor diagonally are commonly referred to as &quot;oblique spaceships&quot;. On May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced the first oblique spaceship, dubbed &quot;Gemini&quot;, that creates a copy of itself on (5,1) further while destroying its parent. This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman–Greene construction arms. These, in turn, create new copies of the pattern, and destroy the previous copy. In December 2015, diagonal versions of the Gemini were built.

A more specific case is a &quot;knightship&quot;, a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a knight in chess), whose existence had been predicted by Elwyn Berlekamp since 1982. The first elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered in 2018 by Adam P. Goucher. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. &quot;Elementary&quot; means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.

===Self-replication===

A pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A &quot;universal constructor&quot; can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself. On November 23, 2013, Dave Greene built the first replicator in the Game of Life that creates a complete copy of itself, including the instruction tape. In October 2018, Adam P. Goucher finished his construction of the 0E0P metacell, a metacell capable of self-replication. This differed from previous metacells, such as the OTCA metapixel by Brice Due, which only worked with already constructed copies near them. The 0E0P metacell works by using construction arms to create copies that simulate the programmed rule. The actual simulation of the Game of Life or other Moore neighbourhood rules is done by simulating an equivalent rule using the von Neumann neighbourhood with more states. The name 0E0P is short for &quot;Zero Encoded by Zero Population&quot;, which indicates that instead of a metacell being in an &quot;off&quot; state simulating empty space, the 0E0P metacell removes itself when the cell enters that state, leaving a blank space.

==Undecidability==
Many patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.

The Game of Life is undecidable, which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. Given that the Game of Life is Turing-complete, this is a corollary of the halting problem: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.

==Iteration==
From most random initial patterns of living cells on the grid, observers will find the population constantly changing as the generations tick by. The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of mathematical beauty. Small isolated subpatterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby subpattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases, the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states; many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the cellular automaton speed of light and denoted &quot;c&quot;.

==Algorithms==
Early patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers to write programs to track the evolution of patterns in the Game of Life. Most of the early algorithms were similar: they represented the patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically, two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells, respectively. A nested for loop considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays may swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration, or one may copy the values of the second array into the first array then update the second array from the first array again.

A variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well, so a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.

To avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an egocentric approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer&#x27;s viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.

To save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a toroidal array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.

In principle, the Game of Life field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a toroidal array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. The Game of Life on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as &quot;Golly&quot;, support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension, or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus, or a Möbius strip.

Alternatively, programmers may abandon the notion of representing the Game of Life field with a two-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.

For exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as Hashlife may be useful. There is also a method for implementation of the Game of Life and other cellular automata using arbitrary asynchronous updates while still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game. Source code examples that implement the basic Game of Life scenario in various programming languages, including C, C++, Java and Python can be found at Rosetta Code.

==Variations==

Since the Game of Life&#x27;s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard Game of Life is symbolized in rule-string notation as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means &quot;a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours&quot;. Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as cellular automata. Another common automaton, Highlife, is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game&#x27;s B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. HighLife is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.

Additional Life-like cellular automata exist. The vast majority of these 218 different rules produce universes that are either too chaotic or too desolate to be of interest, but a large subset do display interesting behaviour. A further generalization produces the &quot;isotropic&quot; rulespace, with 2102 possible cellular automaton rules (the Game of Life again being one of them). These are rules that use the same square grid as the Life-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell&#x27;s future state—not just the total number of those neighbours.

Some variations on the Game of Life modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rules. The above variations can be thought of as a two-dimensional square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as elementary cellular automata, and three-dimensional square variations have been developed, as have two-dimensional hexagonal and triangular variations. A variant using aperiodic tiling grids has also been made.

Conway&#x27;s rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, &quot;live&quot; and &quot;dead&quot;, there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, Mirek&#x27;s Cellebration&#x27;s multi-coloured Rules Table and Weighted Life rule families each include sample rules equivalent to the Game of Life.

Patterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the Sierpinski triangle when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in the Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of an infinitely long single-cell-thick line of live cells, as well as in Highlife, Seeds (B2/S), and Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s Rule 90.

Immigration is a variation that is very similar to the Game of Life, except that there are two &quot;on&quot; states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between spaceships and other objects within the game. Another similar variation, called QuadLife, involves four different on states. When a new cell is born from three different on neighbours, it takes the fourth value, and otherwise, like Immigration, it takes the majority value. Except for the variation among on cells, both of these variations act identically to the Game of Life.

==Music==
Various musical composition techniques use the Game of Life, especially in MIDI sequencing. A variety of programs exist for creating sound from patterns generated in the Game of Life.

==Notable programs==
Computers have been used to follow and simulate the Game of Life since it was first publicized. When John Conway was first investigating how various starting configurations developed, he tracked them by hand using a go board with its black and white stones. This was tedious and prone to errors. The first interactive Game of Life program was written in an early version of ALGOL 68C for the PDP-7 by M. J. T. Guy and S. R. Bourne. The results were published in the October 1970 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, along with the statement: &quot;Without its help, some discoveries about the game would have been difficult to make.&quot;

A color version of the Game of Life was written by Ed Hall in 1976 for Cromemco microcomputers, and a display from that program filled the cover of the June 1976 issue of &quot;Byte&quot;. The advent of microcomputer-based color graphics from Cromemco has been credited with a revival of interest in the game.

Two early implementations of the Game of Life on home computers were by Malcolm Banthorpe written in BBC BASIC. The first was in the January 1984 issue of &quot;Acorn User&quot; magazine, and Banthorpe followed this with a three-dimensional version in the May 1984 issue. Susan Stepney, Professor of Computer Science at the University of York, followed this up in 1988 with Life on the Line, a program that generated one-dimensional cellular automata.

There are now thousands of Game of Life programs online, so a full list will not be provided here. The following is a small selection of programs with some special claim to notability, such as popularity or unusual features. Most of these programs incorporate a graphical user interface for pattern editing and simulation, the capability for simulating multiple rules including the Game of Life, and a large library of interesting patterns in the Game of Life and other cellular automaton rules.
* Golly is a cross-platform (Windows, Macintosh, Linux, iOS, and Android) open-source simulation system for the Game of Life and other cellular automata (including all Life-like cellular automata, the Generations family of cellular automata from Mirek&#x27;s Cellebration, and John von Neumann&#x27;s 29-state cellular automaton) by Andrew Trevorrow and Tomas Rokicki. It includes the Hashlife algorithm for extremely fast generation, and Lua or Python scriptability for both editing and simulation.
* Mirek&#x27;s Cellebration is a freeware one- and two-dimensional cellular automata viewer, explorer, and editor for Windows. It includes powerful facilities for simulating and viewing a wide variety of cellular automaton rules, including the Game of Life, and a scriptable editor.
* Xlife is a cellular-automaton laboratory by Jon Bennett. The standard UNIX X11 Game of Life simulation application for a long time, it has also been ported to Windows. It can handle cellular automaton rules with the same neighbourhood as the Game of Life, and up to eight possible states per cell.
* Dr. Blob&#x27;s Organism is a Shoot &#x27;em up based on Conway&#x27;s Life. In the game, Life continually generates on a group of cells within a &quot;petri dish&quot;. The patterns formed are smoothed and rounded to look like a growing amoeba spewing smaller ones (actually gliders). Special &quot;probes&quot; zap the &quot;blob&quot; to keep it from overflowing the dish while destroying its nucleus.

Google implemented an easter egg of the Game of Life in 2012. Users who search for the term are shown an implementation of the game in the search results page.

The visual novel &quot;Anonymous;Code&quot; includes a basic implementation of the Game of Life in it, which is connected to the plot of the novel. Near the end of &quot;Anonymous;Code&quot;, a certain pattern that appears throughout the game as a tattoo on the heroine Momo Aizaki has to be entered into the Game of Life to complete the game (Kok&#x27;s galaxy, the same pattern used as the logo for the open-source Game of Life program Golly).

<doc id="37037" wikidata="Q257493" url="?curid=37037" title="Veronica Franco">
<text>Veronica Franco (c. 1546–1591) was an Italian poet and courtesan in 16th-century Venice. She is known for her notable clientele, feminist advocacy, literary contributions, and philanthropy. Her humanist education and cultural contributions influenced the roles of courtesans in the late Venetian Renaissance.

In her notable works, &quot;Capitoli in Terze rime and Lettere familiari a diversi (&quot;Familiar Letters to Various People&quot;)&quot;, Franco uses perceived virtue, reason, and fairness to advise male patricians and other associates. She exercised greater autonomy in her authorship than any other traditional Venetian woman due to her established reputation and influence.

== Life==
Veronica Franco was born to a family in the &quot;Cittadino&quot; class. She developed her position in Renaissance Venetian society as a &quot;cortigiana onesta (Honest Courtesan)&quot;, who were intellectual sex workers who derived their position in society from refinement and cultural prowess. They served in contrast to other sex workers such as &quot;cortigiana di lume or meretrice&quot; (&#x27;harlots&#x27;)&quot;,&quot; who were lower-class prostitutes.

Franco received a respectable humanistic education at a young age from her brother&#x27;s tutor, an unusual opportunity for Venetian women. She continued her education by mixing with learned men, writers, and painters. This granted her access to a Domenico Venier, a patron and advisor to women writers. She was able to use her education to contribute considerably to literary and artistic outlets.

Franco learned additional skills from her mother, Paola Fracassa, who had an interest in finding suitable clients for her, as well as marrying her off. While still in her teens, Franco was briefly married to a mature, wealthy physician named Paolo Panizza. She supported her children along with a household of tutors and servants for most of her life.

Franco wrote two volumes of poetry: &quot;Terze rime&quot; in 1575 and &quot;Lettere familiari a diversi&quot; in 1580.

In 1565, when she was about 20 years old, Veronica Franco was listed in the &quot;Catalogo de tutte le principal et più honorate cortigiane di Venetia&quot; (&quot;Catalog of all the Principal and most Honored Courtesans of Venice&quot;), which gave the names, addresses, and fees of Venice&#x27;s most prominent prostitutes; her mother was listed as the person to whom the fee should be paid (her &quot;go-between&quot;). From extant records, we know that, by the time she was 18, Franco had been briefly married and had given birth to her first child; she would eventually have six children, three of whom died in infancy.

She became involved in the 1570s with Domenico Venier&#x27;s renowned literary salon in Venice, who served as a literary adviser not only to male writers but also to many women poets of the Veneto region.

As one of the &quot;più honorate cortigiane&quot; in a wealthy and cosmopolitan city, Franco lived well for much of her working life, but without the automatic protection accorded to &quot;respectable&quot; women, she had to make her own way. She studied and sought patrons among the learned.

In 1575, during the epidemic of plague that ravaged the city, Franco was forced to leave Venice and lost much of her wealth when her house and possessions were looted. Upon her return in 1577, she defended herself against charges of witchcraft before the Inquisition, a crime commonly lodged against courtesans in those days. The charges were dropped. There is evidence that her connections among the Venetian nobility helped in her acquittal.

Her later life is largely obscure, though surviving records suggest that although she won her freedom, she lost all of her material goods and wealth. Eventually, her last major benefactor died and left her with no financial support. There is little information for her life after 1580. Records suggest that she was less prosperous in her later years and is believed to have died in relative poverty.

== Writings ==
In 1575, Franco&#x27;s first volume of poetry was published, her &quot;Terze rime&quot;, containing 18 &quot;capitoli&quot; (verse epistles) by her and 7 by men writing in her praise. That same year saw an outbreak of plague in Venice, one that lasted two years and caused Franco to leave the city and to lose many of her possessions. In 1577, she unsuccessfully proposed to the city council that it should establish a home for poor women, of which she would become the administrator.

In 1580, Franco published her &quot;Lettere familiari a diversi&quot; (&quot;Familiar Letters to Various People&quot;) which included 50 letters, as well as two sonnets addressed to King Henry III of France.

Franco&#x27;s success was not limited to being a coveted courtesan. It was her wittiness and often criticized voice that was immortalized by way of being published that brought forth much recognition. Records indicate that the number of actual publications was limited as they were thought to have been at her own expense or private publications. Her work is known to have been included in an anthology of women poets in the 18th century (1726) that was edited by Luisa Bergalli. 
The embodiment of her role in the public realm was made evermore tangible, amongst the literary circles and the Venetian public during her polemic literary battle with Maffio Venier. The poem referenced above, &quot;Capitolo XVI&quot;, &quot;A Challenge to a Poet Who Has Defamed Her&quot;, is believed to have been one of the many directed to Maffio Venier. These poems are &quot;Capitolo XIII&quot;, &quot;Capitolo XVI&quot;, and &quot;Capitolo XXIII&quot; of her literary publication &quot;Terze Rime&quot;.

==Posthumous reception==
In the 1974 film &quot;Sex Through the Ages&quot; (originally titled &quot;On the Game&quot;), Louise Pajo played the part of Veronica Franca, a 16th century Venetian prostitute. In the film she appears in two scenes. One in which she seduces the homosexual King of France, Henry III; and another in which she is a sufferer of syphilis.

Franco&#x27;s life was recorded in the 1992 book &quot;The Honest Courtesan&quot; by US author Margaret F. Rosenthal.

Catherine McCormack portrayed Veronica Franco in the 1998 movie &quot;Dangerous Beauty,&quot; released as &quot;A Destiny of Her Own&quot; in some countries, based on Rosenthal&#x27;s book.

In the 2000s Franco prompted scholarly inquiries on &quot;what it meant to be a public woman in Cinquecento Venice&quot;. This directly pertained to her duality of both a courtesan and a published poet. Franco is referenced to have been a &quot;living performance of public art—a renowned courtesan whose body was available to a certain exclusive clientele, a published author, and a public presence.&quot;
Franco&#x27;s literary work demonstrates her ability to defend women, as a whole, in a format that can be studied and understood as ahead of her time. Franco&#x27;s work fearlessly embarked on juxtaposed realms such as sexuality and women&#x27;s agency as a whole. In doing so, she challenged and disrupted the patriarchal norms that surrounded her.

Franco is also portrayed in the 2012 Serbian novel named after her () authored by Serbian writer Katarina Brajović.

In 2013, her work was interpreted as adopting &quot;a position of public authority that calls attention to her education, her rhetorical skill, and the solidarity she feels with women.&quot; She embodied in writing a duality, toggling between and addressing both private and public life matters. Her publications have allowed her work and proto-feminist efforts to transcend time.

<text>&quot;Wilhelmus van Nassouwe&quot;, known simply as &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;, is the national anthem of both the Netherlands and its sovereign state, the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It dates back to at least 1572, making it the oldest national anthem in use today, provided that the latter is defined as consisting of both a melody and lyrics. Although &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was not recognized as the official national anthem until 1932, it has always been popular with parts of the Dutch population and resurfaced on several occasions in the course of Dutch history before gaining its present status. It was also the anthem of the Netherlands Antilles from 1954 to 1964.

&quot;Wilhelmus&quot; originated in the Dutch Revolt, the nation&#x27;s struggle to achieve independence from the Spanish Empire. It tells of the Father of the Nation William of Orange who was stadholder in the Netherlands under the King of Spain. In the first person, as if quoting himself, William speaks to the Dutch about both the revolt and his own, personal struggle: to be faithful to the king, without being unfaithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch. In the lyrics, William compares himself with the biblical David who serves under the tyrannical king Saul. As the merciful David defeats the unjust Saul and is rewarded by God with the kingdom of Israel, so too William hopes to be rewarded with a kingdom. Both &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; and the Dutch Revolt should be seen in the light of the 16th century Reformation in Europe
and the resulting persecution of Protestants by the Spanish Inquisition in the Low Countries. Militant music proved very useful not only in lampooning Roman clerks and repressive monarchs but also in generating class-transcending social cohesion. In successfully combining a psalmic character with political relevancy, &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; stands as the pre-eminent example of the genre.

== Inception ==

=== Origins of melody ===
The melody of &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was borrowed from a well-known Roman Catholic French song titled &quot;Autre chanson de la ville de Chartres assiégée par le prince de Condé&quot; (or &quot;Chartres&quot; in short). This song ridiculed the failed Siege of Chartres in 1568 by the Huguenot (Protestant) Prince de Condé during the French Wars of Religion. However, the triumphant contents of &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; differ greatly from the content of the original song, making it subversive at several levels. Thus, the Dutch Protestants had taken over an anti-Protestant song, and adapted it into propaganda for their own agenda. In that way, &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was typical for its time: it was common practice in the 16th century for warring groups to steal each other&#x27;s songs in order to rewrite them.

Even though the melody stems from 1568, the first known written down version of it comes from 1574; at the time the anthem was sung at a much quicker pace. Dutch composer Adriaen Valerius recorded the current melody of &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; in his &quot;Nederlantsche Gedenck-clanck&quot; in 1626, slowing down the melody&#x27;s pace, probably to allow it to be sung in churches.

=== Origins of lyrics ===
The origins of the lyrics are uncertain. &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was first written some time between the start of the Eighty Years&#x27; War in April 1568 and the capture of Brielle on 1 April 1572. Soon after the anthem was finished, it was said that either former Antwerp mayor Philips of Marnix or the politician Dirck Coornhert wrote the lyrics. However, this is disputed as neither Marnix nor Coornhert ever mentioned that they had written the lyrics, even though the song was immensely popular in their time. &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; also has some odd rhymes in it. In some cases the vowels of certain words were altered to allow them to rhyme with other words. Some see this as evidence that neither Marnix or Coornhert wrote the anthem, as they were both experienced poets when &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was written, and it is said they would not have taken these small liberties. Hence some believe that the lyrics of the Dutch national anthem were the creation of someone who just wrote one poem for the occasion and then disappeared from history. A French translation of &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; appeared around 1582.

Recent stylometric research has mentioned Pieter Datheen as a possible author of the text of the Dutch national anthem. By chance, Dutch and Flemish researchers (Meertens Institute, Utrecht University and University of Antwerp) discovered a striking number of similarities between his style and the style of the national anthem.

== Structure and interpretation ==
The complete text comprises fifteen stanzas. The anthem is an acrostic: the first letters of the fifteen stanzas formed the name &quot;Willem van Nassov&quot; (&quot;Nassov&quot; was a contemporary orthographic variant of &quot;Nassau&quot;). In the current Dutch spelling the first words of the 12th and 13th stanzas begin with Z instead of S.

Like many of the songs of the period, it has a complex structure, composed around a thematic chiasmus: the text is symmetrical, in that verses one and 15 resemble one another in meaning, as do verses two and 14, three and 13, etc., until they converge in the 8th verse, the heart of the song: &quot;Oh David, thou soughtest shelter from King Saul&#x27;s tyranny. Even so I fled this welter&quot;, where the comparison is made not only between the biblical David and William of Orange as a merciful and just leader of the Dutch Revolt, but also between the tyrant King Saul and the Spanish crown, and between the promised land of Israel granted by God to David, and a kingdom granted by God to William.

In the first person, as if quoting himself, William speaks about how his disagreement with his king troubles him; he tries to be faithful to his king, but he is above all faithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch people. Therefore, the last two lines of the first stanza indicate that the leader of the Dutch civil war against the Spanish Empire, of which they were part, had no specific quarrel with king Philip II of Spain, but rather with his emissaries in the Low Countries, such as Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. This may have been because at the time (late 16th century) it was uncommon to doubt publicly the divine right of kings, who were accountable to God alone. In 1581 the Netherlands nevertheless rejected the legitimacy of the king of Spain&#x27;s rule over it in the Act of Abjuration.

The word &quot;Duytschen&quot; in the first stanza, generally translated into English as &#x27;Dutch&#x27;, &#x27;native&#x27; or &#x27;Germanic&#x27;, is a reference to William&#x27;s roots; its modern Dutch equivalent, &quot;Duits&quot;, exclusively means &#x27;German&#x27;, and while it may refer to William&#x27;s ancestral house (Nassau, Germany) or to the lands of the Holy Roman Empire it is most probably a reference to an older meaning of the word, which can loosely be translated as &#x27;Germanic&#x27;, and seeks to position William as a person with a personal connection with the Low Countries as opposed to the king of Spain, Philip II, who was commonly portrayed as foreign, disconnected and out of touch. In doing so, William is also implicitly comparing himself with the well liked Charles V (Philip&#x27;s father) who, unlike his son, was born in the Low Countries, spoke Dutch and visited the Low Countries more often than any other part of his realm.

==Performance==
=== History ===
Though only proclaimed the national anthem in 1932, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; already had a centuries-old history. It had been sung on many official occasions and at many important events since the outbreak of the Dutch Revolt in 1568, such as the siege of Haarlem in 1573 and the ceremonial entry of the Prince of Orange into Brussels on 18 September 1578.

It has been claimed that during the gruesome torture of Balthasar Gérard (the assassin of William of Orange) in 1584, the song was sung by the guards who sought to overpower Gérard&#x27;s screams when boiling pigs&#x27; fat was poured over him. Gérard allegedly responded &quot;Sing! Dutch sinners! Sing! But know that soon I shall be sung of!&quot;.

Another legend claims that following the Navigation Act 1651 (an ordinance by Oliver Cromwell requiring all foreign fleets in the North Sea or the Channel to dip their flag in salute) the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was sung (or rather, shouted) by the sailors on the Dutch flagship &quot;Brederode&quot; in response to the first warning shot fired by an English fleet under Robert Blake, when their captain Maarten Tromp refused to lower his flag. At the end of the song, which coincided with the third and last English warning shot, Tromp fired a full broadside, thereby beginning the Battle of Goodwin Sands and the First Anglo-Dutch War.

During the Dutch Golden Age, it was conceived essentially as the anthem of the House of Orange-Nassau and its supporters – which meant, in the politics of the time, the anthem of a specific political faction which was involved in a prolonged struggle with opposing factions (which sometimes became violent, verging on civil war). Therefore, the fortunes of the song paralleled those of the Orangist faction. Trumpets played the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; when Prince Maurits visited Breda, and again when he was received in state in Amsterdam in May 1618. When William V arrived in Schoonhoven in 1787, after the authority of the stadholders had been restored, the church bells are said to have played the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; continuously. After the Batavian Revolution, inspired by the French Revolution, it had come to be called the &quot;Princes&#x27; March&quot; as it was banned during the rule of the Patriots, who did not support the House of Orange-Nassau.

However, at the foundation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1813, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; had fallen out of favour. Having become monarchs with a claim to represent the entire nation and stand above factions, the House of Orange decided to break with the song which served them as heads of a faction, and the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was replaced by Hendrik Tollens&#x27; song &quot;Wien Neêrlands Bloed&quot;, which was the official Dutch anthem from 1815 until 1932. However, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; remained popular and lost its identification as a factional song, and on 10 May 1932, it was decreed that on all official occasions requiring the performance of the national anthem, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was to be played – thereby replacing Tollens&#x27; song.

&quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was also translated into Malay, of which was sung back when Indonesia was under Dutch colonial rule, with the following lyrics:

&lt;poem style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Selamat bagi Ratu yang maha mulia
Aman dan sentosa di atas takhtanya
Umur dan usia dilanjutkan Allah
Rezeki murah lipat berganda-ganda

Bulan yang kedelapan diinilah waktu
Tiga puluh satu bilangan tertentu
Hari lahir Baginda Putri Ratu
Mengucapkan selamat kami sekutu &lt;/poem&gt;

During the German occupation of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the Nazi &quot;Reichskommissar&quot;, banned all the emblems of the Dutch royal family, including the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;. It was then taken up by all factions of the Dutch resistance, even those socialists who had previously taken an anti-monarchist stance. The pro-German Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB), who had sung the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; at their meetings before the occupation, replaced it with &quot;Alle Man van Neerlands Stam&quot; (&quot;All Men of Dutch Origin&quot;). The anthem was drawn to the attention of the English-speaking world by the 1942 British war film &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot;. The film concerns a Royal Air Force bomber crew who are shot down over the occupied Netherlands and are helped to escape by the local inhabitants. The melody is heard during the film as part of the campaign of passive resistance by the population, and it finishes with the coat of arms of the Netherlands on screen while the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; is played.

=== Current ===

The &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; is to be played only once at a ceremony or other event and, if possible, it is to be the last piece of music to be played when receiving a foreign head of state or emissary.

During international sport events, such as the World Cup, UEFA European Football Championship, the Olympic Games and the Dutch Grand Prix, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; is also played. In nearly every case the 1st and 6th stanzas (or repeating the last lines), or the 1st stanza alone, are sung/played rather than the entire song, which would result in about 15 minutes of music.

The &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; is also widely used in Flemish nationalist gatherings as a symbol of cultural unity with the Netherlands. Yearly rallies like the &quot;IJzerbedevaart&quot; and the &quot;Vlaams Nationaal Zangfeest&quot; close with singing the 6th stanza, after which the Flemish national anthem &quot;De Vlaamse Leeuw&quot; is sung.

==Variations==
An important set of variations on the melody of &quot;Wilhelmus van Nassouwe&quot; is that by the blind carillon-player Jacob van Eyck in his mid-17th century collection of variations &quot;Der Fluyten Lust-hof&quot;.

The royal anthem of Luxembourg (called &quot;De Wilhelmus&quot;) is a variation on the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;. The melody was first used in Luxembourg (at the time in personal union with the Kingdom of the United Netherlands) on the occasion of the visit of the Dutch King and Grand Duke of Luxembourg William III in 1883. Later, the anthem was played for Grand Duke Adolph of Luxembourg along with their national anthem. The melody is similar, but not identical to that of the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;; it has been in official use since 1919.

The song „Wenn alle untreu werden“ (&quot;When All Become Unfaithful&quot;), better known as „Das Treuelied“, written by the poet Max von Schenkendorf, used exactly the same melody as the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;. After World War I, this song became popular among German nationalist groups. It became one of the most popular songs of the SS, together with the „Horst-Wessel-Lied“.

The melody is also used in the Swedish folk song &quot;&quot; (&quot;Alas, Gothic Kingdom&quot;), written in 1626, which deals with the liberation struggle of Sweden under Gustav Vasa during the 16th century.

==Lyrics==
The &quot;Wilhelmus&quot; was first printed in a ( &#x27;Beggars&#x27; songbook&#x27;) in 1581. It used the following text as an introduction to the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;:&#x27;

The original text contains 15 stanzas and is written in the form of an acrostic; the first letter in each of the following stanzas, highlighted in bold below, spell out &quot;William of Nassau&quot;.

<doc id="37042" wikidata="Q9240" url="?curid=37042" title="Indonesian language">
<text>Indonesian (; ) is the official and national language of Indonesia. It is a standardized variety of Malay, an Austronesian language that has been used as a lingua franca in the multilingual Indonesian archipelago for centuries. With over 280 million inhabitants, Indonesia ranks as the fourth most populous nation globally. According to the 2020 census, over 97% of Indonesians are fluent in Indonesian, making it the largest language by number of speakers in Southeast Asia and one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. Indonesian vocabulary has been influenced by various native regional languages such as Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau, Balinese, Banjarese, and Buginese, as well as by foreign languages such as Arabic, Dutch, Hokkien, Portuguese, and English. Many borrowed words have been adapted to fit the phonetic and grammatical rules of Indonesian, enriching the language and reflecting Indonesia&#x27;s diverse linguistic heritage.

Most Indonesians, aside from speaking the national language, are fluent in at least one of the more than 700 indigenous local languages; examples include Javanese and Sundanese, which are commonly used at home and within the local community. However, most formal education and nearly all national mass media, governance, administration, and judiciary and other forms of communication are conducted in Indonesian.

Under Indonesian rule from 1976 to 1999, Indonesian was designated as the official language of Timor Leste. It has the status of a working language under the country&#x27;s constitution along with English. In November 2023, the Indonesian language was recognized as one of the official languages of the UNESCO General Conference.

The term &quot;Indonesian&quot; is primarily associated with the national standard dialect (). However, in a looser sense, it also encompasses the various local varieties spoken throughout the Indonesian archipelago. Standard Indonesian is confined mostly to formal situations, existing in a diglossic relationship with vernacular Malay varieties, which are commonly used for daily communication, coexisting with the aforementioned regional languages and with Malay creoles; standard Indonesian is spoken in informal speech as a lingua franca between vernacular Malay dialects, Malay creoles, and regional languages.

The Indonesian name for the language () is also occasionally used in English and other languages. &quot;Bahasa Indonesia&quot; is sometimes improperly reduced to &quot;Bahasa&quot;, which refers to the Indonesian subject (&quot;Bahasa Indonesia&quot;) taught in schools, on the assumption that this is the name of the language. But the word (a loanword from Sanskrit &quot;Bhāṣā&quot;) only means &quot;language.&quot; For example, &quot;French language&quot; is translated as , and the same applies to other languages, such as (English), (Japanese), (Arabic), (Italian), and so on. Indonesians generally may not recognize the name alone when it refers to their national language.

== History ==
=== Early kingdoms era ===

Standard Indonesian is a standard language of &quot;Riau Malay&quot;, which despite its common name is not based on the vernacular Malay dialects of the Riau Islands, but rather represents a form of Classical Malay as used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. Classical Malay had emerged as a literary language in the royal courts along both shores of the Strait of Malacca, including the Johor Sultanate and Malacca Sultanate. Originally spoken in Northeast Sumatra, Malay has been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for half a millennium. It might be attributed to its ancestor, the Old Malay language (which can be traced back to the 7th century). The Kedukan Bukit Inscription is the oldest surviving specimen of Old Malay, the language used by Srivijayan empire. Since the 7th century, the Old Malay language has been used in Nusantara (archipelago) (Indonesian archipelago), evidenced by Srivijaya inscriptions and by other inscriptions from coastal areas of the archipelago, such as Sojomerto inscription.

=== Old Malay as &quot;lingua franca&quot; ===

Trade contacts carried on by various ethnic peoples at the time were the main vehicle for spreading the Old Malay language, which was the main communications medium among the traders. Ultimately, the Old Malay language became a lingua franca and was spoken widely by most people in the archipelago.

Indonesian (in its standard form) has essentially the same material basis as the Malaysian standard of Malay and is therefore considered to be a variety of the pluricentric Malay language. However, it does differ from Malaysian Malay in several respects, with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. These differences are due mainly to the Dutch and Javanese influences on Indonesian. Indonesian was also influenced by the (), which was the lingua franca of the archipelago in colonial times, and thus indirectly by other spoken languages of the islands.

Malaysian Malay claims to be closer to the classical Malay of earlier centuries, even though modern Malaysian has been heavily influenced, in lexicon as well as in syntax, by English. The question of whether High Malay (Court Malay) or Low Malay (Bazaar Malay) was the true parent of the Indonesian language is still in debate. High Malay was the official language used in the court of the Johor Sultanate and continued by the Dutch-administered territory of Riau-Lingga, while Low Malay was commonly used in marketplaces and ports of the archipelago. Some linguists have argued that it was the more common Low Malay that formed the base of the Indonesian language.

=== Colonial era and the birth of Indonesian ===
When the Dutch East India Company (VOC) first arrived in the archipelago at the start of the 1600s, the Malay language was a significant trading and political language due to the influence of the Malaccan Sultanate and later the Portuguese. However, the language had never been dominant among the population of the Indonesian archipelago as it was limited to mercantile activity. The VOC adopted the Malay language as the administrative language of their trading outpost in the east. Following the bankruptcy of the VOC, the Batavian Republic took control of the colony in 1799, and it was only then that education in and promotion of Dutch began in the colony. Even then, Dutch administrators were remarkably reluctant to promote the use of Dutch compared to other colonial regimes. Dutch thus remained the language of a small elite: in 1940, only 2% of the total population could speak Dutch. Nevertheless, it did have a significant influence on the development of Malay in the colony: during the colonial era, the language that would be standardized as Indonesian absorbed a large amount of Dutch vocabulary in the form of loanwords.
The nationalist movement that ultimately brought Indonesian to its national language status rejected Dutch from the outset. However, the rapid disappearance of Dutch was a very unusual case compared with other colonized countries, where the colonial language generally has continued to function as the language of politics, bureaucracy, education, technology, and other fields of importance for a significant time after independence. The Indonesian scholar even goes so far as to say that when compared to the situation in other Asian countries such as India, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, &quot;Indonesian is perhaps the only language that has achieved the status of a national language in its true sense&quot; since it truly dominates in all spheres of Indonesian society. The ease with which Indonesia eliminated the language of its former colonial power can perhaps be explained as much by Dutch policy as by Indonesian nationalism. In marked contrast to the French, Spanish and Portuguese, who pursued an assimilation colonial policy, or even the British, the Dutch did not attempt to spread their language among the indigenous population. In fact, they consciously prevented the language from being spread by refusing to provide education, especially in Dutch, to the native Indonesians so they would not come to see themselves as equals. Moreover, the Dutch wished to prevent the Indonesians from elevating their perceived social status by taking on elements of Dutch culture. Thus, until the 1930s, they maintained a minimalist regime and allowed Malay to spread quickly throughout the archipelago.Dutch dominance at that time covered nearly all aspects, with official forums requiring the use of Dutch, although since the Second Youth Congress (1928) the use of Indonesian as the national language was agreed on as one of the tools in the independence struggle. As of it, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin inveighed actions underestimating Indonesian. After some criticism and protests, the use of Indonesian was allowed since the &quot;Volksraad&quot; sessions held in July 1938. By the time they tried to counter the spread of Malay by teaching Dutch to the natives, it was too late, and in 1942, the Japanese conquered Indonesia. The Japanese mandated that all official business be conducted in Indonesian and quickly outlawed the use of the Dutch language. Three years later, the Indonesians themselves formally abolished the language and established &quot;bahasa Indonesia&quot; as the national language of the new nation. The term &quot;bahasa Indonesia&quot; itself had been proposed by Mohammad Tabrani in 1926, and Tabrani had further proposed the term over calling the language Malay language during the First Youth Congress in 1926.

Several years prior to the congress, Swiss linguist, Renward Brandstetter wrote &quot;&quot; in 4 essays from 1910 to 1915. The essays were translated into English in 1916. By &quot;Indonesia&quot;, he meant the name of the geographical region, and by &quot;Indonesian languages&quot; he meant Malayo-Polynesian languages west of New Guinea, because by that time there was still no notion of Indonesian language.

Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana was a great promoter of the use and development of Indonesian and he was greatly exaggerating the decline of Dutch. Higher education was still in Dutch and many educated Indonesians were writing and speaking in Dutch in many situations (and were still doing so well after independence was achieved). He believed passionately in the need to develop Indonesian so that it could take its place as a fully adequate national language, able to replace Dutch as a means of entry into modern international culture. In 1933, he began the magazine &quot;Pujangga Baru&quot; (New Writer — &quot;Poedjangga Baroe&quot; in the original spelling) with co-editors Amir Hamzah and Armijn Pane. The language of Pujangga Baru came in for criticism from those associated with the more classical School Malay and it was accused of publishing Dutch written with an Indonesian vocabulary. Alisjahbana would no doubt have taken the criticism as a demonstration of his success. To him the language of Pujangga Baru pointed the way to the future, to an elaborated, Westernised language able to express all the concepts of the modern world. As an example, among the many innovations they condemned was use of the word &quot;bisa&quot; instead of &quot;dapat&quot; for &#x27;can&#x27;. In Malay &quot;bisa&quot; meant only &#x27;poison from an animal&#x27;s bite&#x27; and the increasing use of Javanese &quot;bisa&quot; in the new meaning they regarded as one of the many threats to the language&#x27;s purity. Unlike more traditional intellectuals, he did not look to Classical Malay and the past. For him, Indonesian was a new concept; a new beginning was needed and he looked to Western civilisation, with its dynamic society of individuals freed from traditional fetters, as his inspiration.

Once the Japanese overturned Dutch rule, a prohibition on the use of the Dutch language led to an expansion of Indonesian language newspapers and pressure on them to increase the language&#x27;s wordstock. The Japanese agreed to the establishment of the Komisi Bahasa (Language Commission) in October 1942, formally headed by three Japanese but with a number of prominent Indonesian intellectuals playing the major part in its activities. Soewandi, later to be Minister of Education and Culture, was appointed secretary, Alisjahbana was appointed an &#x27;expert secretary&#x27; and other members included the future president and vice-president, Sukarno and Hatta. Journalists, beginning a practice that has continued to the present, did not wait for the &quot;Komisi Bahasa&quot; to provide new words, but actively participated themselves in coining terms. Many of the Komisi Bahasa&#x27;s terms never found public acceptance and after the Japanese period were replaced by the original Dutch forms, including &quot;jantera&quot; (Sanskrit for &#x27;wheel&#x27;), which temporarily replaced &quot;mesin&quot; (machine), &quot;ketua negara&quot; (literally &#x27;chairman of state&#x27;), which had replaced &quot;presiden&quot; (president) and &quot;kilang&quot; (meaning &#x27;mill&#x27;), which had replaced &quot;pabrik&quot; (factory). In a few cases, however, coinings permanently replaced earlier Dutch terms, including &quot;pajak&quot; (earlier meaning &#x27;monopoly&#x27;) instead of &quot;belasting&quot; (tax) and &quot;senam&quot; (meaning &#x27;exercise&#x27;) instead of &quot;gimnastik&quot; (gymnastics). The Komisi Bahasa is said to have coined more than 7000 terms, although few of these gained common acceptance.

=== Adoption as the national language ===
The adoption of Indonesian as the country&#x27;s national language was in contrast to most other post-colonial states. Neither the language with the most native speakers (Javanese) nor the language of the former European colonial power (Dutch) was to be adopted. Instead, a local language with far fewer native speakers than the most widely spoken local language was chosen (nevertheless, Malay was the second most widely spoken language in the colony after Javanese, and had many L2 speakers using it for trade, administration, and education).

In 1945, when Indonesia declared its independence, Indonesian was formally declared the national language, despite being the native language of only about 5% of the population. In contrast, Javanese and Sundanese were the mother tongues of 42–48% and 15% respectively. The combination of nationalistic, political, and practical concerns ultimately led to the successful adoption of Indonesian as a national language.
In 1945, Javanese was easily the most prominent language in Indonesia. It was the native language of nearly half the population, the primary language of politics and economics, and the language of courtly, religious, and literary tradition. What it lacked, however, was the ability to unite the diverse Indonesian population as a whole. With thousands of islands and hundreds of different languages, the newly independent country of Indonesia had to find a national language that could realistically be spoken by the majority of the population and that would not divide the nation by favouring one ethnic group, namely the Javanese, over the others. In 1945, Indonesian was already in widespread use; in fact, it had been for roughly a thousand years. Over that long period, Malay, which would later become standardized as Indonesian, was the primary language of commerce and travel. It was also the language used for the propagation of Islam in the 13th to 17th centuries, as well as the language of instruction used by Portuguese and Dutch missionaries attempting to convert the indigenous people to Christianity. The combination of these factors meant that the language was already known to some degree by most of the population, and it could be more easily adopted as the national language than perhaps any other. Moreover, it was the language of the sultanate of Brunei and of future Malaysia, on which some Indonesian nationalists had claims.

Over the first 53 years of Indonesian independence, the country&#x27;s first two presidents, Sukarno and Suharto, constantly nurtured the sense of national unity embodied by Indonesian, and the language remains an essential component of Indonesian identity. Through a language planning program that made Indonesian the language of politics, education, and nation-building in general, Indonesian became one of the few success stories of an indigenous language effectively overtaking that of a country&#x27;s colonisers to become the &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; official language. Today, Indonesian continues to function as the language of national identity as the Congress of Indonesian Youth envisioned, and also serves as the language of education, literacy, modernization, and social mobility. Despite still being a second language to most Indonesians, it is unquestionably the language of the Indonesian nation as a whole, as it has had unrivalled success as a factor in nation-building and the strengthening of Indonesian identity.

=== Modern and colloquial Indonesian ===

Indonesian is spoken as a mother tongue and national language. Over 200 million people regularly make use of the national language, with varying degrees of proficiency. In a nation that is home to more than 700 native languages and a vast array of ethnic groups, it plays an important unifying and cross-archipelagic role for the country. Use of the national language is abundant in the media, government bodies, schools, universities, workplaces, among members of the upper-class or nobility and also in formal situations, despite the 2010 census showing only 19.94% of over-five-year-olds speak mainly Indonesian at home.

Standard Indonesian is used in books and newspapers and on television/radio news broadcasts. The standard dialect, however, is rarely used in daily conversations, being confined mostly to formal settings. While this is a phenomenon common to most languages in the world (for example, spoken English does not always correspond to its written standards), the proximity of spoken Indonesian (in terms of grammar and vocabulary) to its normative form is noticeably low. This is mostly due to Indonesians combining aspects of their own local languages (e.g., Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese) with Indonesian. This results in various vernacular varieties of Indonesian, the very types that a foreigner is most likely to hear upon arriving in any Indonesian city or town. This phenomenon is amplified by the use of Indonesian slang, particularly in the cities. Unlike the relatively uniform standard variety, Vernacular Indonesian exhibits a high degree of geographical variation, though Colloquial Jakartan Indonesian functions as the &quot;de facto&quot; norm of informal language and is a popular source of influence throughout the archipelago. There is language shift of first language among Indonesian into Indonesian from other language in Indonesia caused by ethnic diversity than urbanicity.

The most common and widely used colloquial Indonesian is heavily influenced by the Betawi language, a Malay-based creole of Jakarta, amplified by its popularity in Indonesian popular culture in mass media and Jakarta&#x27;s status as the national capital. In informal spoken Indonesian, various words are replaced with those of a less formal nature. For example, (no) is often replaced with the Betawi form or the even simpler , while (like, similar to) is often replaced with . or (very), the term to express intensity, is often replaced with the Javanese-influenced . As for pronunciation, the diphthongs &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;au&quot; on the end of base words are typically pronounced as and . In informal writing, the spelling of words is modified to reflect the actual pronunciation in a way that can be produced with less effort. For example, becomes or , becomes , becomes . In verbs, the prefix &quot;me-&quot; is often dropped, although an initial nasal consonant is often retained, as when becomes (the basic word is ). The suffixes &quot;-kan&quot; and &quot;-i&quot; are often replaced by &quot;-in&quot;. For example, becomes , becomes . The latter grammatical aspect is one often closely related to the Indonesian spoken in Jakarta and its surrounding areas.

== Classification and related languages ==

Malay historical linguists agree on the likelihood of the Malay homeland being in western Borneo. A form known as Proto-Malay language was spoken in Borneo at least by 1000 BCE and was, it has been argued, the ancestral language of all subsequent Malayan languages. Its ancestor, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, a descendant of the Proto-Austronesian language, began to break up by at least 2000 BCE, possibly as a result of the southward expansion of Austronesian peoples into Maritime Southeast Asia from the island of Taiwan. Indonesian, which originated from Malay, is a member of the Austronesian family of languages, which includes languages from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean and Madagascar, with a smaller number in continental Asia. It has a degree of mutual intelligibility with the Malaysian standard of Malay, which is officially known there as , despite the numerous lexical differences. However, vernacular varieties spoken in Indonesia and Malaysia share limited intelligibility, which is evidenced by the fact that Malaysians have difficulties understanding Indonesian sinetron (soap opera) aired on Malaysia TV stations, and vice versa.

Malagasy, a geographic outlier spoken in Madagascar in the Indian Ocean; the Philippines national language, Filipino; Formosan in Taiwan&#x27;s aboriginal population; and the native Māori language of New Zealand are also members of this language family. Although each language of the family is mutually unintelligible, their similarities are rather striking. Many roots have come virtually unchanged from their common ancestor, Proto-Austronesian language. There are many cognates found in the languages&#x27; words for kinship, health, body parts and common animals. Numbers, especially, show remarkable similarities.


There are more than 700 local languages in Indonesian islands, such as Javanese, Sundanese, etc. While Malay as the source of Indonesian is the mother tongue of ethnic Malay who lives along the east coast of Sumatra, in the Riau Archipelago, and on the south and west coast of Kalimantan (Borneo). There are several areas, such as Jakarta, Manado, Lesser Sunda islands, and Mollucas which has Malay-based trade languages. Thus, a large proportion of Indonesians use at least two languages daily, including Indonesian and local languages. When two languages are used by the same people in this way, they are likely to influence each other.

Aside from local languages, Dutch made the highest contribution to the Indonesian vocabulary, due to the Dutch colonization over three centuries, from the 16th century until the mid-20th century. Asian languages also influenced the language, with Chinese influencing Indonesian during the 15th and 16th centuries due to the spice trade; Sanskrit, Tamil, Prakrit and Hindi contributing during the flourishing of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms from the 2nd to the 14th century; followed by Arabic after the spread of Islam in the archipelago in the 13th century. Loanwords from Portuguese were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian also receives many English words as a result of globalization and modernization, especially since the 1990s, as far as the Internet&#x27;s emergence and development until the present day. Some Indonesian words correspond to Malay loanwords in English, among them the common words &quot;orangutan&quot;, &quot;gong&quot;, &quot;bamboo&quot;, &quot;rattan&quot;, &quot;sarong&quot;, and the less common words such as &quot;paddy&quot;, &quot;sago&quot; and &quot;kapok&quot;, all of which were inherited in Indonesian from Malay but borrowed from Malay in English. The phrase &quot;to run amok&quot; comes from the Malay verb (to run out of control, to rage).

Indonesian is neither a pidgin nor a creole since its characteristics do not meet any of the criteria for either. It is believed that the Indonesian language was one of the means to achieve independence, but it is opened to receive vocabulary from other foreign languages aside from Malay that it has made contact with since the colonialism era, such as Dutch, English and Arabic among others, as the loan words keep increasing each year.

== Geographical distribution ==

In 2020, Indonesian had 71.9 million native speakers and 176.5 million second-language speakers, who speak it alongside their local mother tongue, giving a total number of speakers in Indonesia of 248.5 million. It is common as a first language in urban areas, and as a second language by those residing in more rural parts of Indonesia.

The VOA and BBC use Indonesian as their standard for broadcasting in Malay. In Australia, Indonesian is one of three Asian target languages, together with Japanese and Mandarin, taught in some schools as part of the Languages Other Than English programme. Indonesian has been taught in Australian schools and universities since the 1950s.

In East Timor, which was occupied by Indonesia between 1975 and 1999, Indonesian is recognized by the constitution as one of the two working languages (the other being English), alongside the official languages of Tetum and Portuguese. It is understood by the Malay people of Australia&#x27;s Cocos Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, also in some parts of the Sulu area of the southern Philippines and traces of it are to be found among people of Malay descent in Sri Lanka, South Africa, and other places.

===Indonesian as a foreign language===
Indonesian is taught as a foreign language in schools, universities and institutions around the world, especially in Australia, the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, Timor-Leste, Vietnam, Taiwan, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

== Official status ==
Indonesian is the official language of Indonesia, and its use is encouraged throughout the Indonesian archipelago. It is regulated in Chapter XV, 1945 Constitution of Indonesia about the flag, official language, coat of arms, and national anthem of Indonesia. Also, in Chapter III, Section 25 to 45, Government regulation No. 24/ 2009 mentions explicitly the status of the Indonesian language.&lt;ref name=&quot;UU No 24/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesian functions as a symbol of national identity and pride, and is a &quot;lingua franca&quot; among the diverse ethnic groups in Indonesia and the speakers of vernacular Malay dialects and Malay creoles. The Indonesian language serves as the national and official language, the language of education, communication, transaction and trade documentation, the development of national culture, science, technology, and mass media. It also serves as a vehicle of communication among the provinces and different regional cultures in the country.
According to Indonesian law, the Indonesian language was proclaimed as the unifying language during the Youth Pledge on 28 October 1928 and developed further to accommodate the dynamics of Indonesian civilization. As mentioned previously, the language was based on Riau Malay, though linguists note that this is not the local dialect of Riau, but the Malaccan dialect that was used in the Riau court. Since its conception in 1928 and its official recognition in the 1945 Constitution, the Indonesian language has been loaded with a nationalist political agenda to unify Indonesia (former Dutch East Indies). This status has made it relatively open to accommodate influences from other Indonesian ethnic languages, most notably Javanese as the majority ethnic group, and Dutch as the previous coloniser. Compared to the indigenous dialects of Malay spoken in Sumatra and Malay peninsula or the normative Malaysian standard, the Indonesian language differs profoundly by a large number of Javanese loanwords incorporated into its already-rich vocabulary. As a result, Indonesian has more extensive sources of loanwords, compared to Malaysian Malay.

The disparate evolution of Indonesian and Malaysian has led to a rift between the two standardized varieties. This has been based more upon political nuance and the history of their standardization than cultural reasons, and as a result, there are asymmetrical views regarding each other&#x27;s variety among Malaysians and Indonesians. Malaysians tend to assert that Malaysian and Indonesian are merely different normative varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate, albeit closely related, languages. Consequently, Indonesians feel little need to harmonise their language with Malaysia and Brunei, whereas Malaysians are keener to coordinate the evolution of the language with Indonesians, although the 1972 Indonesian alphabet reform was seen mainly as a concession of Dutch-based Indonesian to the English-based spelling of Malaysian.

In November 2023, the Indonesian language was recognised as one of the official languages of the UNESCO General Conference. Currently there are 10 official languages of the UNESCO General Conference, consisting of the six United Nations languages, namely English, French, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish, as well as four other languages of UNESCO member countries, namely Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, and Indonesian.

== Official policy ==
As regulated by Indonesian state law UU No 24/2009, other than state official speeches and documents between or issued to Indonesian government, Indonesian language is required by law to be used in:

# Official speeches by the president, vice president, and other state officials delivered within or outside Indonesia
# Agreements involving either government, private institutions, or individuals
# National or international forums held in Indonesia
# Scientific papers and publications in Indonesia
# Geographical names in Indonesia (name of buildings, roads, offices, complexes, institutions)
# Public signs, road signs, public facilities, banners, and other information of public services in public area.
# Information through mass media

However, other languages may be used in dual-language setting to accompany but not to replace Indonesian language in: agreements, information regarding goods / services, scientific papers, information through mass media, geographical names, public signs, road signs, public facilities, banners, and other information of public services in public area.

While there are no sanctions of the uses of other languages, in Indonesian court&#x27;s point of view, any agreements made in Indonesia but not drafted in Indonesian language, is null and void. In any different interpretations in dual-language agreements setting, Indonesian language shall prevail.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
Indonesian has six vowel phonemes as shown in the table below.

In standard Indonesian orthography, the Latin alphabet is used, and five vowels are distinguished: &quot;a, i, u, e, o&quot;. In materials for learners, the mid-front vowel /e/ is sometimes represented with a diacritic as ⟨é⟩ to distinguish it from the mid-central vowel ⟨ê⟩ /ə/. Since 2015, the auxiliary graphemes ⟨é⟩ and ⟨è⟩ are used respectively for phonetic [] and [] in Indonesian, while Standard Malay has rendered both of them as ⟨é⟩.

The phonetic realization of the mid vowels // and // ranges from close-mid (/) to open-mid (/) allophones. Some analyses set up a system which treats the open-mid vowels and as distinct phonemes. Poedjosoedarmo argued the split of the front mid vowels in Indonesian is due to Javanese influence which exhibits a difference between ⟨i⟩ [], ⟨é⟩ [] and è []. Another example of Javanese influence in Indonesian is the split of back mid vowels into two allophones of [] and []. These splits (and loanwords) increase instances of doublets in Indonesian, such as ⟨&quot;satai&quot;⟩ and ⟨&quot;saté&quot;⟩. Javanese words adopted into Indonesian have greatly increased the frequency of Indonesian ⟨é⟩ and ⟨o⟩.

In traditional Malay, high vowels (⟨i⟩, ⟨u⟩) could not appear in a final syllable if a mid-vowel (⟨e⟩, ⟨o⟩) appeared in the previous syllable, and conversely, mid-vowels (⟨e⟩, ⟨o⟩) could not appear in the final syllable if a high vowel (⟨i⟩, ⟨u⟩) appeared in the previous syllable.

Traditional Malay does not allow the mid-central schwa vowel to occur in consonant open or closed word-final syllables. The schwa vowel was introduced in closed syllables under the influence of Javanese and Jakarta Malay, but Dutch borrowings made it more acceptable. Although Alisjahbana argued against it, insisting on writing ⟨a⟩ instead of an ⟨ê⟩ in final syllables such as &quot;koda&quot; (vs &quot;kodə&quot; &#x27;code&#x27;) and nasionalisma (vs &quot;nasionalismə&quot; &#x27;nationalism&#x27;), he was unsuccessful. This spelling convention was instead survived in Balinese orthography.

====Diphthongs====
Indonesian has four diphthong phonemes only in open syllables. They are:
* : &quot;kedai (&#x27;shop&#x27;), &quot;pandai (&#x27;clever&#x27;)
* : &quot;kerbau (&#x27;buffalo&#x27;), &quot;limau (&#x27;lime&#x27;)
* (or in Indonesian): &quot;amboi&quot; (&#x27;wow&#x27;)&quot;, toilet&quot; (&#x27;toilet&#x27;)
* : &quot;survei&quot; (&#x27;survey&#x27;), &quot;geiser&quot; (&#x27;geyser&#x27;)

Some analyses assume that these diphthongs are actually a monophthong followed by an approximant, so represents , represents , and represents . On this basis, there are no phonological diphthongs in Indonesian.

Diphthongs are differentiated from two vowels in two syllables, such as:
* : e.g. &quot;lain&quot; (&#x27;other&#x27;) , &quot;air&quot; (&#x27;water&#x27;) 
* : &quot;bau&quot; (&#x27;smell&#x27;) , &quot;laut&quot; (&#x27;sea&#x27;) 

===Consonants===
The consonants of Indonesian are shown above. Non-native consonants that only occur in borrowed words, principally from Arabic and English, are shown in parentheses. Some analyses list 19 &quot;primary consonants&quot; for Indonesian as the 18 symbols that are not in parentheses in the table as well as the glottal stop . The secondary consonants /f/, /v/, /z/, /ʃ/ and /x/ only appear in loanwords. Only small amounts of speakers pronounce /v/ in loanwords as [v], most of them pronounce them as [f]. Likewise, /x/ is mostly replaced with [h] or [k] by some speakers. /ʃ/ is sometimes replaced with /s/, which was traditionally used as a substitute for /ʃ/ in older borrowings from Sanskrit, and /f/ is rarely replaced, though /p/ was substituted for /f/ in older borrowings such as kopi &quot;coffee&quot; from Dutch koffie. /z/ may occasionally be replaced with /s/ or /d͡ʒ/. [z] can also be an allophone of /s/ before voiced consonants. According to some analyses, postalveolar affricates and are instead palatals and in Indonesian.

The consonants in Indonesian are influenced by other important languages in Indonesian history. The influences included schwa in final closed syllable (e.g. Indonesian pəcəl vs Malay pəcal), initial homorganic nasal stop clusters of ⟨mb⟩, ⟨nd⟩, and ⟨nj⟩ (e.g. Indonesian &quot;mbolos&quot; &#x27;to malinger&#x27;), the consonant-semivowel clusters (e.g. Indonesian &quot;pria&quot; vs Malay &quot;pəria&quot; &#x27;male&#x27;), introduction of consonant clusters ⟨-ry-⟩ and ⟨-ly-⟩ (e.g. Indonesian &quot;gərilya&quot; vs Malay &quot;gərila&quot; &#x27;guerrilla&#x27;), increased usage of initial ⟨w-⟩ (e.g. &quot;warta&quot; and &quot;bərita&quot; &#x27;news&#x27;) and intervocalic ⟨w-⟩, and increase of initial and post-consonant ⟨y⟩ [j]. These changes resulted from influences of local languages in Indonesia, such as Balinese, Madurese, Sundanese and especially Javanese, and foreign languages such as Arabic and Dutch.

Orthographic note:

The sounds are represented orthographically by their symbols as above, except:

* is written .
* is written .
* The glottal stop is written as a final (the use from its being an allophone of /k/ or /ɡ/ in the syllable coda), or it can be unwritten.
* is written .
* is written .
* is written .
* is written .
* is written .

=== Stress ===
Indonesian has light stress that falls on either the final or penultimate syllable, depending on regional variations as well as the presence of the schwa () in a word. It is generally the penultimate syllable that is stressed, unless its vowel is a schwa . If the penult has a schwa, then stress usually moves to the final syllable.

However, there is some disagreement among linguists over whether stress is phonemic (unpredictable), with some analyses suggesting that there is no underlying stress in Indonesian.

=== Rhythm ===
The classification of languages based on rhythm can be problematic. Nevertheless, acoustic measurements suggest that Indonesian has more syllable-based rhythm than British English, even though doubts remain about whether the syllable is the appropriate unit for the study of Malay prosody.

== Grammar ==

Word order in Indonesian is generally subject-verb-object (SVO), similar to that of most modern European languages as well as English. However, considerable flexibility in word ordering exists, in contrast with languages such as Japanese or Korean, for instance, which always end clauses with verbs. Indonesian, while allowing for relatively flexible word orderings, does not mark for grammatical case, nor does it make use of grammatical gender.

=== Affixes ===
Indonesian words are composed of a root or a root plus derivational affixes. The root is the primary lexical unit of a word and is usually bisyllabic, of the shape CV(C)CV(C). Affixes are &quot;glued&quot; onto roots (which are either nouns or verbs) to alter or expand the primary meaning associated with a given root, effectively generating new words, for example, (to cook) may become (cooking), (cook for), (be cooked), (a cook), (a meal, cookery), (accidentally cooked). There are four types of affixes: prefixes (), suffixes (), circumfixes () and infixes (). Affixes are categorized into noun, verb, and adjective affixes. Many initial consonants alternate in the presence of prefixes: (to sweep) becomes (sweeps/sweeping); (to call) becomes (calls/calling), (to sieve) becomes (sieves).

Other examples of the use of affixes to change the meaning of a word can be seen with the word (to teach):
* = to teach
* = to teach (imperative, locative)
* = to teach (jussive, locative)
* = to teach (imperative, causative/applicative)
* = to teach (jussive, causative/applicative)
* = to teach (jussive, active)
* = teachings
* = to learn (intransitive, active)
* = to be taught (intransitive)
* = to be taught (transitive, locative)
* = to be taught (transitive, causative/applicative)
* = to be studied (locative)
* = to be studied (causative/applicative)
* = to study (locative)
* = to study (causative/applicative)
* = to teach (intransitive, active)
* = to teach (transitive, casuative/applicative)
* = to teach (transitive, locative)
* = student
* = to study (imperative, locative)
* = to study (jussive, locative)
* = to study (imperative, causative/applicative)
* = to study (jussive, causative/applicative)
* = teacher, someone who teaches
* = subject, education
* = to study (jussive, locative)
* = to study (jussive, causative/applicative)
* = lesson
* = learning
* = to be taught (accidentally)
* = to be taught (accidentally, locative)
* = to be taught (accidentally, causative/applicative)
* = well-educated, literally &quot;been taught&quot; 
* = been taught (locative)
* = been taught (causative/applicative)
* = is educated, literally &quot;has education&quot;

&quot;-Kan&quot; and &quot;-i&quot; both increase the valency of verbs, but &quot;-i&quot; should be used &quot;if [the verb] is directly followed by an animate object.&quot;

==== Noun affixes ====
Noun affixes are affixes that form nouns upon addition to root words. The following are examples of noun affixes:

The prefix drops its before and frequently before In some words it is ; though formally distinct, these are treated as variants of the same prefix in Indonesian grammar books.

==== Verb affixes ====
Similarly, verb affixes in Indonesian are attached to root words to form verbs. In Indonesian, there are:

==== Adjective affixes ====
Adjective affixes are attached to root words to form adjectives:

In addition to these affixes, Indonesian also has a lot of borrowed affixes from other languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and English. For example, &quot;maha-&quot;, &quot;pasca-&quot;, &quot;eka-&quot;, &quot;bi-&quot;, &quot;anti-&quot;, &quot;pro-&quot; etc.

=== Nouns ===
Common derivational affixes for nouns are peng-/per-/juru- (actor, instrument, or someone characterized by the root), -an (collectivity, similarity, object, place, instrument), ke-...-an (abstractions and qualities, collectivities), per-/peng-...-an (abstraction, place, goal or result).

==== Gender ====
Indonesian does not make use of grammatical gender, and there are only selected words that use natural gender. For instance, the same word is used for &quot;he/him&quot; and &quot;she/her&quot; ( or ) or for &quot;his&quot; and &quot;her&quot; (, or ). No real distinction is made between &quot;girlfriend&quot; and &quot;boyfriend&quot;, both of which can be referred to as (although more colloquial terms as girl/girlfriend and boy/boyfriend can also be found). A majority of Indonesian words that refer to people generally have a form that does not distinguish between the natural genders. However, unlike English, distinction is made between older or younger.

There are some words that have gender: for instance, means &quot;daughter&quot; while means &quot;son&quot;; means &quot;male flight attendant&quot; while means &quot;female flight attendant&quot;. Another example is , which means &quot;sportsman&quot;, versus , meaning &quot;sportswoman&quot;. Often, words like these (or certain suffixes such as &quot;-a&quot; and &quot;-i&quot; or &quot;-wan&quot; and &quot;wati&quot;) are absorbed from other languages (in these cases, from Sanskrit).
In some regions of Indonesia such as Sumatra and Jakarta, (a gender-specific term meaning &quot;older brother&quot;) is commonly used as a form of address for older siblings/males, while (a non-gender specific term meaning &quot;older sibling&quot;) is often used to mean &quot;older sister&quot;. Similarly, more direct influences from other languages, such as Javanese and Chinese, have also seen further use of other gendered words in Indonesian. For example: (&quot;older brother&quot;), (&quot;older sister&quot;), (&quot;older brother&quot;) and (&quot;older sister&quot;).

==== Number ====
Indonesian grammar does not regularly mark plurals. In Indonesian, to change a singular into a plural one either repeats the word or adds before it (the latter for living things only); for example, &quot;students&quot; can be either or . Plurals are rarely used in Indonesian, especially in informal parlance. Reduplication is often mentioned as the formal way to express the plural form of nouns in Indonesian; however, in informal daily discourse, speakers of Indonesian usually use other methods to indicate the concept of something being &quot;more than one&quot;. Reduplication may also indicate the conditions of variety and diversity as well, and not simply plurality.

Reduplication is commonly used to emphasise plurality; however, reduplication has many other functions. For example, means &quot;(all the) people&quot;, but means &quot;scarecrow&quot;. Similarly, while means &quot;heart&quot; or &quot;liver&quot;, is a verb meaning &quot;to be careful&quot;. Also, not all reduplicated words are inherently plural, such as &quot;scarecrow/scarecrows&quot;, &quot;a/some sheep&quot; and &quot;butterfly/butterflies&quot;. Some reduplication is rhyming rather than exact, as in &quot;(all sorts of) vegetables&quot;.

Distributive affixes derive mass nouns that are effectively plural: &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;flora, trees&quot;; &quot;house&quot;, &quot;housing, houses&quot;; &quot;mountain&quot;, &quot;mountain range, mountains&quot;.

Quantity words come before the noun: &quot;a thousand people&quot;, &quot;a series of mountain ranges&quot;, &quot;some butterflies&quot;.

Plural in Indonesian serves just to explicitly mention the number of objects in sentence. For example, (Ani buys one kilogram of mangoes). In this case, &quot;mangoes&quot;, which is plural, is not said as because the plurality is implicit: the amount a kilogram means more than one mango rather than one giant mango. So, as it is logically, one does not change the singular into the plural form, because it is not necessary and considered a pleonasm (in Indonesian often called ).

=== Pronouns ===
Personal pronouns are not a separate part of speech, but a subset of nouns. They are frequently omitted, and there are numerous ways to say &quot;you&quot;. Commonly the person&#x27;s name, title, title with name, or occupation is used (&quot;does Johnny want to go?&quot;, &quot;would Madam like to go?&quot;); kin terms, including fictive kinship, are extremely common. However, there are also dedicated personal pronouns, as well as the demonstrative pronouns &quot;this, the&quot; and &quot;that, the&quot;.

==== Personal pronouns ====
From the perspective of a European language, Indonesian boasts a wide range of different pronouns, especially to refer to the addressee (the so-called second person pronouns). These are used to differentiate several parameters of the person they are referred to, such as the social rank and the relationship between the addressee and the speaker. Indonesian also exhibits pronoun avoidance, often preferring kinship terms and titles over pronouns, particularly for respectful forms of address.
The table below provides an overview of the most commonly and widely used pronouns in the Indonesian language:
* First person pronouns
Notable among the personal-pronoun system is a distinction between two forms of &quot;we&quot;: &quot;kita&quot; (you and me, you and us) and &quot;kami&quot; (us, but not you). The distinction is not always followed in colloquial Indonesian.

&quot;Saya&quot; and &quot;aku&quot; are the two major forms of &quot;I&quot;. &quot;Saya&quot; is the more formal form, whereas &quot;aku&quot; is used with family, friends, and between lovers. Colloquially, &quot;gue&quot; or &quot;gua&quot; (derived from Hokkien) is often used. However, this is only used when talking with close friends, and not used in family context as it is considered not polite. &quot;Sahaya&quot; is an old or literary form of &quot;saya&quot;. &quot;Sa(ha)ya&quot; may also be used for &quot;we&quot;, but in such cases it is usually used with &quot;sekalian&quot; or &quot;semua&quot; &quot;all&quot;; this form is ambiguous as to whether it corresponds with inclusive &quot;kami&quot; or exclusive &quot;kita&quot;. Less common are &quot;hamba&quot; &quot;slave&quot;, &quot;hamba tuan, hamba datuk&quot; (all extremely humble), &quot;beta&quot; (a royal addressing oneselves), &quot;patik&quot; (a commoner addressing a royal), &quot;kami&quot; (royal or editorial &quot;we&quot;), &quot;kita&quot;, &quot;təman&quot;, and &quot;kawan.&quot;

* Second person pronouns
There are three common forms of &quot;you&quot;, &quot;Anda&quot; (polite), &quot;kamu&quot; (familiar), and &quot;kalian&quot; &quot;all&quot; (commonly used as a plural form of you, slightly informal). &quot;Anda&quot; is used with strangers, recent acquaintances, in advertisements, in business, and when you wish to show distance, while &quot;kamu&quot; is used in situations where the speaker would use &quot;aku&quot; for &quot;I&quot;. Colloquially, &quot;lu&quot; (derived from Hokkien) is often used among close friends, just like how &quot;gue&quot; or &quot;gua&quot; is used when referring to &quot;I&quot;. &quot;Anda sekalian&quot; is polite plural. Particularly in conversation, respectful titles like &quot;Bapak/Pak&quot; &quot;father&quot; (used for any older male), &quot;Ibu/Bu&quot; &quot;mother&quot; (any older woman), and &quot;tuan&quot; &quot;sir&quot; are often used instead of pronouns.

&quot;Engkau&quot; (&quot;əngkau&quot;), commonly shortened to &quot;kau&quot;.
* Third person pronouns
The common word for &quot;s/he&quot; and &quot;they&quot; is &quot;ia&quot;, which has the object and emphatic/focused form &quot;dia&quot;. &quot;Bəliau&quot; &quot;his/her Honour&quot; is respectful. As with &quot;you&quot;, names and kin terms are extremely common. &quot;Mereka&quot; &quot;someone&quot;, &quot;mereka itu&quot;, or &quot;orang itu&quot; &quot;those people&quot; are used for &quot;they&quot;.
* Regional varieties
There are a large number of other words for &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, many regional, dialectical, or borrowed from local languages. &quot;Saudara&quot; &quot;you&quot; (male) and &quot;saudari&quot; (female) (plural &quot;saudara-saudara&quot; or &quot;saudari-saudari&quot;) show utmost respect. &quot;Daku&quot; &quot;I&quot; and &quot;dikau&quot; &quot;you&quot; are poetic or romantic. Indonesian &quot;gua&quot; &quot;I&quot; (from Hokkien ) and &quot;lu&quot; &quot;you&quot; () are slang and extremely informal.

The pronouns &quot;aku, kamu, engkau, ia, kami,&quot; and &quot;kita&quot; are indigenous to Indonesian.

==== Possessive pronouns ====
&quot;Aku, kamu, engkau&quot;, and &quot;ia&quot; have short possessive enclitic forms. All others retain their full forms like other nouns, as does emphatic &quot;dia&quot;: &quot;meja saya, meja kita, meja anda, meja dia&quot; &quot;my table, our table, your table, his/her table&quot;.

There are also proclitic forms of &quot;aku&quot;, &quot;ku-&quot; and &quot;kau-&quot;. These are used when there is no emphasis on the pronoun:

:&quot;Kudengar raja itu menderita penyakit kulit. Aku mengetahui ilmu kedokteran. Akulah yang akan mengobati dia.&quot;
:&quot;It has come to my attention that the King has a skin disease. I am skilled in medicine. &quot;I&quot; will cure him.&quot;
Here &quot;ku-&quot;verb is used for a general report, &quot;aku&quot; verb is used for a factual statement, and emphatic &quot;aku-lah meng-&quot;verb (≈ &quot;I am the one who...&quot;) for focus on the pronoun.

The suffix &quot;-nya&quot; is a special case: it can be also used to mark definiteness, or to link two nouns in possession (his genitive). It is also even extended to pronouns and names. However, this usage has been occasionally criticized.

==== Demonstrative pronouns ====
There are two demonstrative pronouns in Indonesian. &quot;Ini&quot; &quot;this, these&quot; is used for a noun which is generally near to the speaker. &quot;Itu&quot; &quot;that, those&quot; is used for a noun which is generally far from the speaker. Either may sometimes be equivalent to English &quot;the&quot;. There is no difference between singular and plural. However, plural can be indicated through duplication of a noun followed by a &quot;ini&quot; or &quot;itu&quot;. The word &quot;yang&quot; &quot;which&quot; is often placed before demonstrative pronouns to give emphasis and a sense of certainty, particularly when making references or enquiries about something/ someone, like English &quot;this one&quot; or &quot;that one&quot;.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs are not inflected for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as &quot;yesterday&quot;) or by other tense indicators, such as &quot;sudah&quot; &quot;already&quot; and &quot;belum&quot; &quot;not yet&quot;. On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote voice or intentional and accidental moods. Some of these affixes are ignored in colloquial speech.

Examples of these are the prefixes &quot;di-&quot; (patient focus, traditionally called &quot;passive voice&quot;, with OVA word order in the third person, and OAV in the first or second persons), &quot;meng-&quot; (agent focus, traditionally called &quot;active voice&quot;, with AVO word order), &quot;memper-&quot; and &quot;diper-&quot; (causative, agent and patient focus), &quot;ber-&quot; (stative or habitual; intransitive VS order), and &quot;ter-&quot; (agentless actions, such as those which are involuntary, sudden, stative or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes &quot;-kan&quot; (causative or benefactive) and &quot;-i&quot; (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes &quot;ber-...-an&quot; (plural subject, diffuse action) and &quot;ke-...-an&quot; (unintentional or potential action or state).

* &quot;duduk&quot; to sit down
* &quot;mendudukkan&quot; to sit someone down, give someone a seat, to appoint
* &quot;menduduki&quot; to sit on, to occupy
* &quot;didudukkan&quot; to be given a seat, to be appointed
* &quot;diduduki&quot; to be sat on, to be occupied
* &quot;terduduk&quot; to sink down, to come to sit
* &quot;kedudukan&quot; to be situated

Forms in &quot;ter-&quot; and &quot;ke-...-an&quot; are often equivalent to adjectives in English.

==== Negation ====
Four words are used for negation in Indonesian, namely &quot;tidak&quot;, &quot;bukan&quot;, &quot;jangan&quot;, and &quot;belum&quot;.

* Tidak (not), often shortened to tak, is used for the negation of verbs and &quot;adjectives&quot;.
* Bukan (be-not) is used in the negation of a noun.
For example:
==== Prohibition ====
For negating imperatives or advising against certain actions in Indonesian, the word &quot;jangan&quot; (do not) is used before the verb. For example,
* Jangan tinggalkan saya di sini!
:Don&#x27;t leave me here!
* Jangan lakukan itu!
:Don&#x27;t do that!
* Jangan! Itu tidak bagus untukmu.
:Don&#x27;t! That&#x27;s not good for you.

=== Adjectives ===
There are grammatical adjectives in Indonesian. Stative verbs are often used for this purpose as well. Adjectives are always placed after the noun that they modify. 
To say that something &quot;is&quot; an adjective, the determiners &quot;itu&quot; and &quot;ini&quot; (&quot;that&quot; and &quot;this&quot;) are often used. For example, in the sentence &quot;anjing itu galak&quot;, the use of &quot;itu&quot; gives a meaning of &quot;the/that dog is ferocious&quot;, while &quot;anjing ini galak&quot;, gives a meaning of &quot;this dog is ferocious&quot;. However, if &quot;itu&quot; or &quot;ini&quot; were not to be used, then &quot;anjing galak&quot; would only mean &quot;ferocious dog&quot;, a plain adjective without any stative implications. The all-purpose determiner, &quot;yang&quot;, is also often used before adjectives, hence &quot;anjing yang galak&quot; also means &quot;ferocious dog&quot; or more literally &quot;dog which is ferocious&quot;; &quot;yang&quot; will often be used for clarity. Hence, in a sentence such as &quot;saya didekati oleh anjing galak&quot; which means &quot;I was approached by a ferocious dog&quot;, the use of the adjective &quot;galak&quot; is not stative at all.

Often the &quot;ber-&quot; intransitive verb prefix, or the &quot;ter-&quot; stative prefix is used to express the meaning of &quot;to be...&quot;. For example, &quot;beda&quot; means &quot;different&quot;, hence &quot;berbeda&quot; means &quot;to be different&quot;; &quot;awan&quot; means &quot;cloud&quot;, hence &quot;berawan&quot; means &quot;cloudy&quot;. Using the &quot;ter-&quot; prefix, implies a state of being. For example, &quot;buka&quot; means &quot;open&quot;, hence &quot;terbuka&quot; means &quot;is opened&quot;; &quot;tutup&quot; means &quot;closed/shut&quot;, hence &quot;tertutup&quot; means &quot;is closed/shut&quot;.

=== Word order ===
Adjectives, demonstrative determiners, and possessive determiners follow the noun they modify.

Indonesian does not have a grammatical subject in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an agent and an object, these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called &quot;passive&quot;, is the basic and most common word order.

Either the agent or object or both may be omitted. This is commonly done to accomplish one of two things:

;1) Adding a sense of politeness and respect to a statement or question

For example, a polite shop assistant in a store may avoid the use of pronouns altogether and ask:

;2) Agent or object is unknown, not important, or understood from context

For example, a friend may enquire as to when you bought your property, to which you may respond:
Ultimately, the choice of voice and therefore word order is a choice between actor and patient and depends quite heavily on the language style and context.

==== Emphasis ====
Word order is frequently modified for focus or emphasis, with the focused word usually placed at the beginning of the clause and followed by a slight pause (a break in intonation):

* &quot;Saya pergi ke pasar kemarin&quot; &quot;I went to the market yesterday&quot; – neutral, or with focus on the subject.
* &quot;Kemarin, saya pergi ke pasar&quot; &quot;Yesterday I went to the market&quot; – emphasis on yesterday.
* &quot;Ke pasar, saya pergi kemarin&quot; &quot;To the market I went yesterday&quot; – emphasis on where I went yesterday.
* &quot;Pergi ke pasar, saya, kemarin&quot; &quot;To the market went I yesterday&quot; – emphasis on the process of going to the market.

The last two are more likely to be encountered in speech than in writing.

=== Measure words ===
Another distinguishing feature of Indonesian is its use of measure words, also called classifiers (&quot;kata penggolong&quot;). In this way, it is similar to many other languages of Asia, including Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, and Bengali.

Measure words are also found in English such as &quot;two head of cattle&quot; or &quot;a loaf of bread&quot;, where &quot;*two cattle&quot; and &quot;a bread&quot; would be ungrammatical. The word &quot;satu&quot; reduces to &quot;se-&quot; , as it does in other compounds:

&quot;Example&quot;:
Measure words are not necessary just to say &quot;a&quot;: &quot;burung&quot; &quot;a bird, birds&quot;. Using &quot;se-&quot; plus a measure word is closer to English &quot;one&quot; or &quot;a certain&quot;:
:&quot;Ada seekor burung yang bisa berbicara&quot;
:&quot;There was a (certain) bird that could talk&quot;

== Writing system ==
Indonesian is written with the Latin script. It was originally based on the Dutch spelling and still bears some similarities to it. Consonants are represented in a way similar to Italian, although is always (like English ), is always (&quot;hard&quot;) and represents as it does in English. In addition, represents the palatal nasal , is used for the velar nasal (which can occur word-initially), for (English ) and for the voiceless velar fricative . Both and are represented with .

Spelling changes in the language that have occurred since Indonesian independence include:
Introduced in 1901, the &quot;van Ophuijsen&quot; system (named from the advisor of the system, Charles Adriaan van Ophuijsen) was the first standardization of romanized spelling. It was most influenced by the then current Dutch spelling system and based on the dialect of Malay spoken in Johor. In 1947, the spelling was changed into &quot;Republican Spelling&quot; or &quot;Soewandi Spelling&quot; (named by at the time Minister of Education, Soewandi). This spelling changed formerly spelled &quot;oe&quot; into &quot;u&quot; (however, the spelling influenced other aspects in orthography, for example writing reduplicated words). All of the other changes were a part of the Perfected Spelling System, an officially mandated spelling reform in 1972. Some of the old spellings (which were derived from Dutch orthography) do survive in proper names; for example, the name of a former president of Indonesia is still sometimes written &quot;Soeharto&quot;, and the central Java city of Yogyakarta is sometimes written &quot;Jogjakarta&quot;. In time, the spelling system is further updated and the latest update of Indonesian spelling system issued on 16 August 2022 by Head of Language Development and Fostering Agency decree No 0424/I/BS.00.01/2022.

=== Letter names and pronunciations ===
The Indonesian alphabet is exactly the same as in ISO basic Latin alphabet.

Indonesian follows the letter names of the Dutch alphabet. Indonesian alphabet has a phonemic orthography; words are spelled the way they are pronounced, with few exceptions. The letters Q, V and X are rarely encountered, being chiefly used for writing loanwords.

In addition, there are digraphs that are not considered separate letters of the alphabet:

== Vocabulary ==

As a modern variety of Malay, Indonesian has been influenced by other languages, including Dutch, English, Greek (where the name of the country, Indonesia, comes from), Arabic, Chinese, Portuguese, Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, and Persian. The vast majority of Indonesian words, however, come from the root lexical stock of Austronesian (including Old Malay).

The study of Indonesian etymology and loan words reveals both its historical and social contexts. Examples are the early Sanskrit borrowings from the 7th century during the trading era, the borrowings from Arabic and Persian during the time of the establishment of Islam in particular, and those from Dutch during the colonial period. Linguistic history and cultural history are clearly linked.

List of loan words of Indonesian language published by the &quot;Badan Pengembangan Bahasa dan Perbukuan&quot; (The Language Center) under the Ministry of Education and Culture:

Note: This list only lists foreign languages, thus omitting numerous local languages of Indonesia that have also been major lexical donors, such as Javanese, Sundanese, Betawi, etc.

=== Loan words of Sanskrit origin ===
The Sanskrit influence came from contacts with India since ancient times. The words were either borrowed directly from India or with the intermediary of the Old Javanese language. Although Hinduism and Buddhism are no longer the major religions of Indonesia, Sanskrit, which was the language vehicle for these religions, is still held in high esteem and is comparable with the status of Latin in English and other Western European languages. Sanskrit is also the main source for neologisms, which are usually formed from Sanskrit roots. The loanwords from Sanskrit cover many aspects of religion, art and everyday life.

From Sanskrit came such words as स्वर्ग &quot;surga&quot; (heaven), भाषा &quot;bahasa&quot; (language), काच &quot;kaca&quot; (glass, mirror), राज- &quot;raja&quot; (king), मनुष्य &quot;manusia&quot; (mankind), चिन्ता &quot;cinta&quot; (love), भूमि &quot;bumi&quot; (earth), भुवन &quot;buana&quot; (world), आगम &quot;agama&quot; (religion), स्त्री &quot;Istri&quot; (wife/woman), जय &quot;Jaya&quot; (victory/victorious), पुर &quot;Pura&quot; (city/temple/place) राक्षस &quot;Raksasa&quot; (giant/monster), धर्म &quot;Dharma&quot; (rule/regulations), मन्त्र &quot;Mantra&quot; (words/poet/spiritual prayers), क्षत्रिय &quot;Satria&quot; (warrior/brave/soldier), विजय &quot;Wijaya&quot; (greatly victorious/great victory), etc. Sanskrit words and sentences are also used in names, titles, and mottos of the Indonesian National Police and Indonesian Armed Forces such as: &quot;Bhayangkara&quot;, &quot;Laksamana&quot;, &quot;Jatayu&quot;, &quot;Garuda&quot;, &quot;Dharmakerta Marga Reksyaka&quot;, &quot;Jalesveva Jayamahe&quot;, &quot;Kartika Eka Paksi&quot;, &quot;Swa Bhuwana Paksa&quot;, &quot;Rastra Sewakottama&quot;, &quot;Yudha Siaga&quot;, etc.

Because Sanskrit has long been known in the Indonesian archipelago, Sanskrit loanwords, unlike those from other languages, have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian to such an extent that, for many, they are no longer perceived to be foreign. Therefore, one could write a short story using mostly Sanskrit-derived words. The short story below consists of approximately 80 words in Indonesian that are all derived from Sanskrit, as well as a few native function words and affixes.

: dii mengkan an , , sang , - peran , - dan /nya, Kean dan , - peran kean, , be kean ber ke kan pean di kan - ber dan ber, ber dan di , lalu ber , dan mekan pe dan yang ber ber ber se dan ber ber, mekan - , yang mekan an mereka me , atas nya ber mengi mereka dan , dan , dan , men dan dari , dan , dan .

=== Loan words of Chinese origin ===

The relationship with China has been going since the 7th century when Chinese merchants traded in some areas of the archipelago such as Riau, West Borneo, East Kalimantan, and North Maluku. As the kingdom of Srivijaya appeared and flourished, China opened diplomatic relations with the kingdom in order to secure trade and seafaring. In 922, Chinese travelers visited Kahuripan in East Java. Since the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants left Mainland China and settled in many parts of Nusantara (now called Indonesia).

The Chinese loanwords are usually concerned with cuisine, trade or often just things exclusively Chinese. Words of Chinese origin (presented here with accompanying Hokkien/ Mandarin pronunciation derivatives as well as traditional and simplified characters) include &quot;loteng&quot;, (樓/層 = lóu/céng – [upper] floor/ level), &quot;mie&quot; (麵 &gt; 面 Hokkien mī – noodles), &quot;lumpia&quot; (潤餅 (Hokkien = lūn-piáⁿ) – springroll), &quot;cawan&quot; (茶碗 cháwǎn – teacup), &quot;teko&quot; (茶壺 &gt; 茶壶 = cháhú [Mandarin], teh-ko [Hokkien] = teapot), 苦力 kuli (= 苦 khu (hard) and 力 li (energy) – coolie) and even the widely used slang terms &quot;gua&quot; and &quot;lu&quot; (from the Hokkien &#x27;goa&#x27; 我 and &#x27;lu/li&#x27; 汝 – meaning &#x27;I/ me&#x27; and &#x27;you&#x27;).

=== Loan words of Arabic origin ===

Many Arabic words were brought and spread by merchants from Arab Peninsula like Arabian, Persian, and from the western part of India, Gujarat where many Muslims lived. As a result, many Indonesian words come from the Arabic language. Especially since the late 12th century, Old Malay was heavily influenced by the language and produced many great literary works such as Syair, Babad, Hikayat, and Suluk. This century is known as &quot;The Golden Age of Indonesian Literature&quot;.

Many loanwords from Arabic are mainly concerned with religion, in particular with Islam, and by extension, with greetings such as the word, &quot;selamat&quot; (from &#x27; = health, soundness) means &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;lucky&quot;. Words of Arabic origin include &quot;dunia&quot; (from &#x27; = the present world), names of days (except &quot;Minggu&quot;), such as &quot;Sabtu&quot; (from &#x27; = Saturday), &quot;iklan&quot; ( &#x27; = advertisement), &quot;kabar&quot; ( &#x27; = news), &quot;Kursi&quot; ( &#x27; = a chair), &quot;ijazah&quot; ( &#x27; = &#x27;permission&#x27;, certificate of authority, e.g. a school diploma certificate), &quot;kitab&quot; ( &#x27; = book), &quot;tertib&quot; ( &#x27; = order/arrangement) and &quot;kamus&quot; ( &#x27; = dictionary). Allah (), as is mostly the case for Arabic speakers, this is the word for God even in Christian Bible translations. Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual Hebrew words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations this practice is discontinued. They now turn to Greek names or use the original Hebrew Word. For example, the name Jesus was initially translated as &quot;&#x27;Isa&quot; (), but is now spelt as &quot;Yesus&quot;. Several ecclesiastical terms derived from Arabic still exist in Indonesian language. Indonesian word for &quot;bishop&quot; is &quot;uskup&quot; (from &#x27; = bishop). This in turn makes the Indonesian term for archbishop &quot;uskup agung&quot; (), which is combining the Arabic word with an Old Javanese word. The term &quot;imam&quot; (from &#x27; = leader, prayer leader) is used to translate a Catholic priest, beside its more common association with an Islamic prayer leader. Some Protestant denominations refer to their congregation &quot;jemaat&quot; (from &#x27; = group, a community). Even the name of the Bible in Indonesian translation is &quot;Alkitab&quot; (from &#x27; = the book), which literally means &quot;the Book&quot;.

=== Loan words of Portuguese origin ===

Alongside Malay, Portuguese was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; for trade throughout the archipelago from the sixteenth century through to the early nineteenth century. The Portuguese were among the first westerners to sail eastwards to the &quot;Spice Islands&quot;. Loanwords from Portuguese were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian words derived from Portuguese include (from = table), (from = bench), (from = closet), (from = doll), (from = window), (from = church), (from = mass), (from = Christmas), (from = Easter), (from = party), (from = dance), (from = cruise), (from = flag), (from = shoes), (from = fork), (from = shirt), (from = chariot), (from = pump), (from = picture), (from = wheel), (from = young woman), (from = school), (from = lantern), (from = priest), (from = Saint), (from = poetry), (from = cheese), (from = butter), (from = soldier), (from = although), (from = room), (from = lagoon), (from = auction), (from = company), (from = passion fruit), (from = lemon), (from = card), (from = English), (from = Saturday), (from = Sunday), etc.

=== Loan words of Dutch origin ===

The former colonial power, the Netherlands, left a sizeable amount of vocabulary that can be seen in words such as (from = police), (from = quality), (from = current), (from = smoking cigarettes), (from = corruption), (from = office), (from = zipper), (from = frontrunner), (from = transmission gear), (from = electricity current), (from = company), (from = pharmacy), (from = towel), (from = clothes iron), (from = movie theater), (from = banner), (from = short circuit), (from = uncle), (from = aunt), (from = treat) and (from = free). These Dutch loanwords, and many other non-Italo-Iberian, European language loanwords that came via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords, having clusters of several consonants, pose difficulties to speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by insertion of the schwa. For example, Dutch &gt; (screw (n.)). One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words are inspired by the Dutch language.

Before the standardization of the language, many Indonesian words follow standard Dutch alphabet and pronunciation such as &quot;oe&quot; for vowel &quot;u&quot; or &quot;dj&quot; for consonant &quot;j&quot; [dʒ]. As a result, Malay words are written with that orthography such as: for the word or for the word , older Indonesian generation tend to have their name written in such order as well.

=== Loan words of English origin ===
Many English words were incorporated into Indonesian through globalization. Many Indonesians, however, mistake words already adopted from Dutch as words borrowed from English. Indonesian adopts English words with standardization. For example: from . However, there are several words that directly borrowed without standardization that have same meanings in English such as: &quot;bus&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;domain&quot;, &quot;detail&quot;, &quot;internet&quot;, &quot;film&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;lift&quot;, &quot;monitor&quot;, &quot;radio&quot;, &quot;radar&quot;, &quot;unit&quot;, &quot;safari&quot;, &quot;sonar&quot;, &quot;video&quot;, and &quot;riil as real&quot;.

=== Other loan words ===
Modern Indonesian draws many of its words from foreign sources; there are many synonyms. For example, Indonesian has three words for &quot;book&quot;, i.e. (from Sanskrit), (from Arabic) and (from Dutch ); however, each has a slightly different meaning. A is often connected with ancient wisdom or sometimes with esoteric knowledge. A derived form, means a library. A is usually a religious scripture or a book containing moral guidance. The Indonesian words for the Bible and Gospel are and , both directly derived from Arabic. The book containing the penal code is also called the . is the most common word for books.

There are direct borrowings from various other languages of the world, such as (from ) from Japanese, and (from ) which means dried shrimp. Many words that originally are adopted through the Dutch language today however often are mistaken as English due to the similarity in the Germanic nature of both languages. In some cases the words are replaced by English language through globalization: although the word () still literally means strawberry in Indonesian, today the usage of the word is more common. Greek words such as (from ), , (both from ), (from ) came through Dutch, Arabic and Portuguese respectively.

It is notable that some of the loanwords that exist in both Indonesian and Malaysian languages are different in spelling and pronunciation mainly due to how they derived their origins: Malaysian utilises words that reflect the English usage (as used by its former colonial power, the British), while Indonesian uses a Latinate form (e.g. (Malaysian) vs. (Indonesian), (Malaysian) vs. (Indonesian)).

===Acronyms and portmanteau===

Since the time of the independence of Indonesia, Indonesian has seen a surge of neologisms which are formed as acronyms (less commonly also initialisms) or blend words.

Common acronyms are (, from &#x27;Indonesian National Armed Forces&#x27;), (, from &#x27;driving licence&#x27;), (, from &#x27;ethnic group, religion, race, inter-group [matters]&#x27;, used when referring to the background of intercommunal conflicts), (, from &#x27;human rights&#x27;).

Blend words/portmanteau are very common in Indonesian, and have become a productive tool of word formation in both formal and colloquial Indonesian. Examples from official usage include departments and officeholders (e.g. &lt; &#x27;Foreign Minister&#x27;, &lt; &#x27;Head of Regional Police&#x27;) or names of provinces and districts ( &lt; &#x27;North Sulawesi&#x27;, &lt; &#x27;West Java&#x27;. Other commonly used portmanteau include &lt; &#x27;community health center&#x27;, &lt; &#x27;basic commodities&#x27; ().

== Literature ==
Indonesia hosts a variety of traditional verbal arts such as poetry, historical narratives, romances, and drama, which are expressed in local languages, but modern genres are expressed mainly in Indonesian. Some of the classic Indonesian stories include &quot;Sitti Nurbaya&quot; by Marah Rusli, &quot;Azab dan Sengsara&quot; by Merari Siregar, and &quot;Sengsara Membawa Nikmat&quot; by Tulis Sutan Sati. Modern literature like novels, short stories, stage plays, and free-form poetry has developed since the late years of the 19th century and has produced figures such as novelist Pramoedya Ananta Toer, dramatist W.S. Rendra, poet Chairil Anwar, and cinematographer Garin Nugroho. Indonesia&#x27;s classic novels themselves offer insight into the local culture and traditions and the historical background before and immediately after the country gained independence. One notable example is &quot;Shackles&quot;, which was written by Armijn Pane in 1940. Originally titled &quot;Belenggu&quot;, it has been translated into many languages, including English and German.

== As speakers of other languages ==
Over the past few years, interest in learning Indonesian has grown among non-Indonesians. Various universities have started to offer courses that emphasise the teaching of the language to non-Indonesians. In addition to national universities, private institutions have also started to offer courses, like the Indonesia Australia Language Foundation and the . As early as 1988, teachers of the language have expressed the importance of a standardized (also called BIPA, literally &quot;Indonesian Language for Foreign Speaker&quot;) materials (mostly books), and this need became more evident during the 4th International Congress on the Teaching of Indonesian to Speakers of Other Languages held in 2001.

Since 2013, the Indonesian embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language courses to 16 batches of Filipino students, as well as training to members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In an interview, Department of Education Secretary Armin Luistro said that the country&#x27;s government should promote Indonesian or Malay, which are related to Filipino. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied.

The Indonesian embassy in Washington, D.C., United States, also began offering free Indonesian language courses at the beginner and intermediate level.

<text>Odoacer ( ; – 15 March 493 AD), also spelled Odovacer or Odovacar, was a barbarian soldier and statesman from the Middle Danube who deposed the Western Roman child emperor Romulus Augustulus and became the ruler of Italy (476–493). Odoacer&#x27;s overthrow of Romulus Augustulus is traditionally understood as marking the end of the Western Roman Empire.

Although he held power over Italy, he also represented himself as the client of the Eastern Roman Emperor in Constantinople, Zeno. He was referred to not only as a king (), but also as commander (), or using the Roman honorific patrician, granted by Zeno. Odoacer himself used the title of king in the only surviving official document that emanated from his chancery, and it was also used by the consul Basilius. He had the support of the Roman Senate and was able to distribute land to his followers without much opposition. Unrest among his warriors led to violence in 477–478, but no such disturbances occurred during the later period of his reign. Although Odoacer was an Arian Christian, he rarely intervened in the affairs of the Trinitarian state church of the Roman Empire.

Before becoming king, Odoacer was a military leader in Italy who led the revolt of Herulian, Rugian, and Scirian soldiers that deposed Romulus Augustulus on 4 September AD 476. Eleven-year-old Augustulus had been declared Western Roman Emperor by his father Orestes, the rebellious general of the army in Italy, less than a year before, but had been unable to gain allegiance or recognition beyond central Italy. With the backing of the Roman Senate, Odoacer thenceforth ruled Italy autonomously, paying lip service to the authority of Julius Nepos, the previous Western emperor, and Zeno. Upon Nepos&#x27;s murder in 480, Odoacer invaded Dalmatia, to punish the murderers. He executed the conspirators, conquered the region and incorporated it into his domain within two years.

When Illus, master of soldiers of the Eastern Empire, asked for Odoacer&#x27;s help in 484 in his struggle to depose Zeno, Odoacer invaded Zeno&#x27;s westernmost provinces. The emperor responded first by inciting the Rugii of present-day Austria to attack Italy. During the winter of 487–488, Odoacer crossed the Danube and defeated the Rugii in their own territory. Zeno eventually appointed the Ostrogoth Theodoric the Great, who had been menacing the Eastern Empire within the Balkans. Theodoric invaded Italy in 489 and by August 490 had captured almost the entire peninsula, forcing Odoacer to take refuge in Ravenna. The city surrendered on 5 March 493. Theodoric invited Odoacer to a banquet of reconciliation, where instead of forging an alliance, Theodoric killed Odoacer, and replaced him as king.

== Origins ==
===Name etymology===
The origin of the name Odoacer, which may give indications as to his tribal affiliation, is debated. It is however traditionally derived from the Germanic components *&quot;auda&quot; (luck, possession, wealth) and *&quot;wakra&quot; (awake, vigilant, lively). It is not clear from which branch of the Germanic language family it is derived. In favour of this etymology, this form has a cognate in another Germanic language, the titular &quot;Eadwacer&quot; of the Old English poem &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot; (where Old English renders the earlier Germanic sound &quot;au-&quot; as &quot;ea-&quot;).

However, historians Robert L. Reynolds and Robert S. Lopez explored the possibility that the name Odoacer was not Germanic, making several arguments that his ethnic background might lie elsewhere. One of these is that his name, &quot;Odoacer&quot;, for which they claimed an etymology in Germanic languages had not been convincingly found, arguing instead that it could be a form of the Turkic &quot;Ot-toghar&quot; (&quot;grass-born&quot; or &quot;fire-born&quot;), or the shorter form &quot;Ot-ghar&quot; (&quot;herder&quot;). There is also debate regarding the etymology of Edeco, the apparent name of Odoacer&#x27;s father. Omeljan Pritsak considered it Turkic; others such as Peter Heather continue to consider it Germanic.

The name of Odoacer&#x27;s apparent brother, Hunulf or Onulf, is generally accepted to be Germanic &quot;Hun wolf&quot;. Reynolds and Lopez emphasized that the first part, &quot;hun&quot;, although the meaning is uncertain, may refer to the Huns. Odoacer&#x27;s son is given two different names in ancient sources, Thelan and Oklan. Reynolds and Lopez compare these to Turkic names: &quot;Thelan resembles the name borne by the khagan of the eastern Turks, Tulan, who reigned from 587 to 600 A.D. Oklan resembles closely the Turkish-Tatar word oghlan, &#x27;youth&#x27; &quot;.

The assumption that the etymology of Odoacer&#x27;s name can be used to determine his ancestry or language has been criticized by historians and philologists such as Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen and Walter Pohl, who have pointed out that Germanic-speakers used Hunnic names in this period and region, and vice versa. As emphasized by Pohl, the same person could be considered Hunnic or Germanic under different circumstances, especially during the upheavals after Attila&#x27;s death, and &quot;the ruling class of Attila&#x27;s empire continued to influence tribal politics even after its collapse&quot;.

=== Father and brother===
In a fragment from a history of Priscus, reproduced in the 7th century by John of Antioch, Odoacer is described as a man of the Sciri, the son of Edeco (&quot;Idiko&quot;), and brother of Hunulf who killed Armatus in the eastern Roman empire. The &quot;Anonymus Valesianus&quot; agrees that his father&#x27;s name was Edeko (&quot;Aediko&quot;), and refers to him leading Sciri and Heruli.

Another record of an Edica—apparently the same person—is found in Jordanes, who identified him as a leader of the Sciri along with a person named Hunuulf (presumably his son), after the fall of Attila. They were defeated by the Ostrogoths at the Battle of Bolia in Pannonia about 469.

An earlier Edeco (&quot;Edekon&quot;) was described by Priscus as a trusted man of Attila, and ambassador to Constantinople. He escorted Priscus and other Imperial dignitaries back to Attila&#x27;s camp. It is not universally accepted that this Edeco is the father of Odoacer. Priscus once calls him a Scythian, and another time a Hun. It has been argued classifications like &quot;Scythian&quot; or &quot;Hun&quot; from this period could refer to social type and lifestyle rather than an exact ethnic origin. Macbain, however, argues that Priscus was careful with such terms, and sees this as evidence that Edeco cannot be the Scirian father of Odoacer.

===Ethnic affiliations===
Except for the fact that he was not considered Roman, Odoacer&#x27;s precise ethnic origins are not known. His origins probably lie in the multi-ethnic empire of Attila, a generation earlier, which included several groups referred to in this period as &quot;Gothic peoples&quot;—the same polyethnic complex which dominated the military forces that he is most famous for leading throughout his later life. On that basis, he is likely at least partly of Germanic descent. Early medieval sources such as Theophanes called him a Goth. Likewise, the 6th century chronicler Marcellinus Comes called him a &quot;king of the Goths&quot; (&quot;Odoacer rex Gothorum&quot;).

One of the most important sources for this topic has been the 6th-century writer Jordanes, who associated him with several of the Gothic peoples who came to the Middle Danube during the time of Attila&#x27;s empire, including the Sciri, Heruli, and Rugii. In several passages, Jordanes also associated Odoacer with the otherwise unknown Turcilingi—who may have been a people or perhaps a dynasty. The Turcilingi are not mentioned in any other historical sources apart from those derived from Jordanes and their ethnic affiliations are unclear, but they may have been Gothic, Hunnic, or even precursors of the Thuringii. While in one passage of &quot;Getica&quot;, Jordanes describes Odoacer as king of the Turcilingi (&quot;Torcilingorum rex&quot;) with Scirian and Heruli followers, in another passage Jordanes mentions Italy being &quot;shaken by the tyranny of the Torcilingi and Rugi&quot; during Odoacer&#x27;s reign. In his &quot;Romana&quot;, the same author defines Odoacer as a descendant of the Rugii, or of a person named Rogus (&quot;Odoacer genere Rogus&quot;), with Turcilingi, Scirian and Heruli followers.

The Scirii and Heruls were among those known to contemporaries such as the historian Procopius as &quot;Gothic peoples&quot;. They both appear to have come to the Danubian area from the direction of what is now Ukraine, as do the Goths, Huns, and Alans. The Rugii, who apparently originated on the south Baltic coast, are known from other sources for their post-Attila kingdom on the Danube. These groups fought on the same side as the Scirii in the battle of Bolia in 468, defeating the Ostrogoths, who were one of the most dominant of the post-Attila groups. It has also been pointed out by Reynolds and Lopez that Attila had an uncle named Rogus and that Jordanes may have been saying Odoacer was his descendant. After the battle of Bolia, the Scirii, Rugii and Heruli made up a large part of the military force Odoacer came to control in Italy, while the Ostrogoths moved into Eastern Roman territory in the Balkans. The near contemporary &quot;Auctorium Havniense&quot; also calls Odoacer a king of Heruli. Many historians, such as medieval scholar Michael Frassetto, accept that Odoacer was of Scirian heritage, because of the apparent family links to Edeko and Hunulf.

On the other hand, scholars are divided about whether Jordanes can be relied upon concerning the &quot;Turcilingi&quot;. It has also been proposed that these are an otherwise unknown Turkic speaking people among the Huns. Whether or not this is accepted, there is also an argument that the Turcilingi mentioned by Jordanes were early Thuringians, who established a kingdom by about this time in what is now central Germany, relatively far to the north of the Danubian kingdoms. In favour of this argument, the 10th century &quot;Suda&quot; identifies Odoacer&#x27;s apparent brother Hunulf as a Thuringian on his father&#x27;s side and Scirian on his mother&#x27;s side. This fragment was most likely written by the contemporary historian Malchus, who was a near contemporary and likely to be well-informed.
Much later, a memorial plate from 1521 found in the catacombe Chapel of St Maximus in Petersfriedhof—the burial site of St Peter&#x27;s Abbey in Salzburg (Austria)—mentions Odoacer as King of &quot;Rhutenes&quot; or &quot;Rhutenians&quot; (), who invaded Noricum in 477. Due to its very late date of 1521 and several anachronistic elements, the content of that plate is considered nothing more than a legend. In spite of that, the plate has become a popular &quot;source&quot; for several theorists that try to connect Odoacer with ancient Celtic Ruthenes, and also with later Slavic Ruthenians. Historian Paul R. Magocsi argues such theories should be regarded as &quot;inventive tales&quot; of &quot;creative&quot; writers and nothing more.

Finally, a passage from Eugippius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Severinus&quot; indicated that Odoacer was so tall that he had to bend down to pass through the doorway, which historian Bruce Macbain considers another strong argument that he was unlikely to have been a Hun, as ancient sources describe the Huns as shorter than Romans.

Historians such as Penny MacGeorge and Macbain avow that Odoacer was likely half-Scirian and half-Thuringian. Macbain&#x27;s sees this as evidence of Odoacer&#x27;s Germanic heritage arguing that &quot;whatever the Skirians may have been [...] no one doubts that the Thuringians were Germans&quot;, and that while the &quot;ancient sources exhibit considerable confusion over Odovacer&#x27;s tribal affiliation&quot; none of them calls Odoacer a Hun. Historian Patrick Amory explains that &quot;Odoacer is called a Scirian, a Rugian, a Goth or a Thuringian in sources; his father is called a Hun, his mother a Scirian. Odoacer&#x27;s father Edeco was associated first with the Huns under Attila, and then with a group called Sciri, an ethnographic name that appears intermittently in fifth-century sources.&quot; This line of reasoning is also picked up on by historian Erik Jensen, who avows that Odoacer was born to a Gothic mother and that his father Edeco was a Hun.

== Before Italy ==
There are two recorded incidents involving military leaders with the name Odoacer preserved in the &quot;History of the Franks&quot; of Gregory of Tours, using two different spellings and involving two different regions. These involve events which were early enough to be Odoacer before his appearance in Italy. Both were during the lifetime of Childeric I, king of the Franks, who died about 481. 
*In the first mention, a confused or confusing report is given of a number of battles in about 463 fought by Childeric, Aegidius, Count Paul, and one &quot;Adovacrius&quot; (with an &quot;a&quot;) who was leading a group of Saxons based at the mouth of the Loire. Though there is no consensus, some historians, such as Reynolds and Lopez, have suggested that this Adovacrius may be the same person as the future king of Italy. Matthias Springer has noted that Odoacer&#x27;s involvement with northern European Saxons in this period would be consistent with the proposal that he had Thuringian ancestry, pointing out that the term Saxon in this period was probably not a distinct ethnic label.
*In a second mention by Gregory of Tours, an Odovacrius (with an &quot;o&quot;) made an alliance with the same Childeric, and together they fought the Alamanni, who had been causing problems in Italy. This Odoacer, with his connection to the region north of Italy, and his &quot;o&quot; spelling, is probably the future king of Italy, before he was king.

Another early recorded event which is more certainly about Odoacer the future king, was shortly before he arrived in Italy. Eugippius, in his &quot;Life of Saint Severinus&quot;, records how a group of barbarians on their way to Italy stopped to pay their respects to the holy man. Odoacer, at the time &quot;a young man, of tall figure, clad in poor clothes&quot;, learned from Severinus that he would one day become famous. Despite the fact that Odoacer was an Arian Christian and Severinus was Catholic, the latter left a deep impression on him. When Odoacer took his leave, Severinus made one final comment which proved prophetic: &quot;Go to Italy, go, now covered with mean hides; soon you will make rich gifts to many.&quot;

== Leader of the &quot;foederati&quot; ==
By 470, Odoacer had become an officer in what remained of the Roman Army. Although Jordanes writes of Odoacer as invading Italy &quot;as leader of the Sciri, the Heruli and allies of various races&quot;, modern writers describe him as being part of the Roman military establishment, based on John of Antioch&#x27;s statement that Odoacer was on the side of Ricimer at the beginning of his battle with the emperor Anthemius in 472. Odoacer is said to have &quot;hastened the emperor&#x27;s downfall&quot;, since he switched sides to join with Ricimer. Procopius describes him as one of the Emperor&#x27;s bodyguards, only agreeing to this position if placed in charge of them.

When Orestes was in 475 appointed &quot;Magister militum&quot; and patrician by the Western Roman Emperor Julius Nepos, Odoacer became head of the barbarian &quot;foederati&quot; military forces of Italy. Under the command of Orestes were significant contingents of Germanic peoples made up mostly of Rugii and Heruli tribesmen. Before the end of that year Orestes had rebelled and driven Nepos from Italy. Orestes then proclaimed his young son Romulus the new emperor as Romulus Augustus, called &quot;Augustulus&quot; (31 October). At this time, Odoacer was a soldier rising through the ranks. However, Nepos reorganized his court in Salona in Dalmatia, and received homage and affirmation from the remaining fragments of the Western Empire beyond Italy and, most importantly, from Constantinople, which refused to accept Augustulus, Zeno having branded him and his father as traitors and usurpers.

About this time, the &quot;foederati&quot;, who had been quartered in Italy all of these years, had grown weary of this arrangement. In the words of J. B. Bury, &quot;They desired to have roof-trees and lands of their own, and they petitioned Orestes to reward them for their services, by granting them lands and settling them permanently in Italy&quot;. Orestes refused their petition, and they turned to Odoacer to lead their revolt against Orestes. Orestes was killed at Placentia along with his brother Paulus outside Ravenna. The Germanic &quot;foederati,&quot; the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, then proclaimed Odoacer &quot;rex&quot; (&quot;king&quot;) on 23 August 476. Odoacer then advanced to Ravenna and captured the city, compelling the young emperor Romulus to abdicate on 4 September. According to the &quot;Anonymus Valesianus&quot;, Odoacer was moved by Romulus&#x27;s youth and his beauty to not only spare his life but give him a pension of 6,000 &quot;solidi&quot; and sent him to Campania to live with his relatives.

Following Romulus Augustus&#x27;s deposition, according to the historian Malchus, upon hearing of the accession of Zeno to the throne, the Senate in Rome sent an embassy to the Eastern Emperor and bestowed upon him the Western imperial insignia. The message was clear: the West no longer required a separate Emperor, for &quot;one monarch sufficed [to rule] the world&quot;. In response, Zeno accepted their gifts and this essentially brought to an end any puppet emperors in the West, with Nepos banished and Anthemius dead. The Eastern Emperor then conferred upon Odoacer the title of Patrician and granted him legal authority to govern Italy in the name of Rome, as &quot;dux Italiae&quot;. Zeno also suggested that Odoacer should receive Nepos back as Emperor in the West, &quot;if he truly wished to act with justice.&quot; Although he accepted the title of Patrician and &quot;Dux&quot; from Zeno, Odoacer did not invite Julius Nepos to return to Rome, and the latter remained in Dalmatia until his death. Odoacer was careful to observe form, however, and made a pretence of acting on Nepos&#x27;s authority, even issuing coins with both his image and that of Zeno. Following Nepos&#x27;s murder in 480, who was killed while waiting in Dalmatia, Zeno became sole Emperor.

Bury, however, disagrees that Odoacer&#x27;s assumption of power marked the fall of the Western Roman Empire:
== King of Italy ==

In 476, Odoacer was proclaimed rex by his soldiers and &quot;dux Italiae&quot; by emperor Zeno, initiating a new administrative era over Roman lands. Odoacer introduced a few important changes to the administrative system of Italy. According to Jordanes, at the beginning of his reign he &quot;slew Count Bracila at Ravenna that he might inspire a fear of himself among the Romans.&quot; He took many military actions to strengthen his control over Italy and its neighbouring areas. He achieved a solid diplomatic coup by inducing the Vandal king Gaiseric to cede Sicily to him. Noting that &quot;Odovacar seized power in August of 476, Gaiseric died in January 477, and the sea usually became closed to navigation around the beginning of November&quot;, F. M. Clover dates this cession to September or October 476. When Julius Nepos was murdered by two of his retainers in his country house near Salona (9 May 480), Odoacer assumed the duty of pursuing and executing the assassins, and at the same time established his own rule in Dalmatia.

As Bury points out, &quot;It is highly important to observe that Odovacar established his political power with the co-operation of the Roman Senate, and this body seems to have given him their loyal support throughout his reign, so far as our meagre sources permit us to draw inferences.&quot; He regularly nominated members of the Senate to the Consulate and other prestigious offices: &quot;Basilius, Decius, Venantius, and Manlius Boethius held the consulship and were either Prefects of Rome or Praetorian Prefects; Symmachus and Sividius were consuls and Prefects of Rome; another senator of old family, Cassiodorus, was appointed a minister of finance.&quot; A. H. M. Jones also notes that under Odoacer the Senate acquired &quot;enhanced prestige and influence&quot; in order to counter any desires for restoration of Imperial rule. As the most tangible example of this renewed prestige, for the first time since the mid-3rd century copper coins were issued with the legend &quot;S(enatus) C(onsulto)&quot;. Jones describes these coins as &quot;fine big copper pieces&quot;, which were &quot;a great improvement on the miserable little hitherto current&quot;, and not only were they copied by the Vandals in Africa, but they formed the basis of the currency reform by Anastasius in the Eastern Empire.

Although Odoacer was an Arian Christian, his relations with the Chalcedonian church hierarchy were remarkably good. As G. M. Cook notes in her introduction to Magnus Felix Ennodius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Epiphanius&quot;, he showed great esteem for Bishop Epiphanius: in response to the bishop&#x27;s petition, Odoacer granted the inhabitants of Liguria a five-year immunity from taxes, and again granted his requests for relief from abuses by the praetorian prefect. The biography of Pope Felix III in the openly states that the pontiff&#x27;s tenure occurred during Odoacer&#x27;s reign without any complaints about the king being registered.

In 487/488, Odoacer led his army to victory against the Rugians in Noricum, taking their king Feletheus into captivity; when word that Feletheus&#x27;s son, Fredericus, had returned to his people, Odoacer sent his brother Onoulphus with an army back to Noricum against him. Onoulphus found it necessary to evacuate the remaining Romans and resettled them in Italy. The remaining Rugians fled and took refuge with the Ostrogoths; the abandoned province was settled by the Lombards by 493.

== Fall and death ==
As Odoacer&#x27;s position improved, Zeno, the Eastern Emperor, increasingly saw him as a rival. Odoacer exchanged messages with Illus, who had been in open revolt against Zeno since 484. Switching allegiances, Zeno subsequently sought to destroy Odoacer and then promised Theodoric the Great and his Ostrogoths the Italian peninsula if they were to defeat and remove Odoacer. As both Herwig Wolfram and Peter Heather point out, Theodoric had his own reasons to agree to this offer: &quot;Theodoric had enough experience to know (or at least suspect) that Zeno would not, in the long term, tolerate his independent power. When Theodoric rebelled in 485, we are told, he had in mind Zeno&#x27;s treatment of Armatus. Armatus defected from Basilicus to Zeno in 476, and was made senior imperial general for life. Within a year, Zeno had him assassinated.&quot;

In 489, Theodoric led the Ostrogoths across the Julian Alps and into Italy. On 28 August, Odoacer met him at the Isonzo, only to be defeated. He withdrew to Verona, reaching its outskirts on 27 September, where he immediately set up a fortified camp. Theodoric followed him and three days later defeated him again. While Odoacer took refuge in Ravenna, Theodoric continued across Italy to Mediolanum, where the majority of Odoacer&#x27;s army, including his chief general Tufa, surrendered to the Ostrogothic king. Theodoric had no reason to doubt Tufa&#x27;s loyalty and dispatched his new general to Ravenna with a band of elite soldiers. Herwig Wolfram observes, &quot;[b]ut Tufa changed sides, the Gothic elite force entrusted to his command was destroyed, and Theodoric suffered his first serious defeat on Italian soil.&quot; Theodoric recoiled by seeking safety in Ticinum. Odoacer emerged from Ravenna and started to besiege his rival. While both were fully engaged, the Burgundians seized the opportunity to plunder and devastated Liguria. Many Romans were taken into captivity and did not regain their freedom until Theodoric ransomed them three years later.

The following summer, the Visigothic king Alaric II demonstrated what Wolfram calls &quot;one of the rare displays of Gothic solidarity&quot; and sent military aid to help his kinsman, forcing Odoacer to raise his siege. Theodoric emerged from Ticinum, and on 11 August 490, the armies of the two kings clashed on the Adda River. Odoacer again was defeated and forced back into Ravenna, where Theodoric besieged him. Ravenna proved to be invulnerable, surrounded by marshes and estuaries and easily supplied by small boats from its hinterlands, as Procopius later pointed out in his &quot;History&quot;. Further, Tufa remained at large in the strategic valley of the Adige near Trent, and received unexpected reinforcements when dissent amongst Theodoric&#x27;s ranks led to sizable desertions. That same year, the Vandals took their turn to strike while both sides were fully engaged and invaded Sicily. While Theodoric was engaged with them, his ally Fredericus, king of the Rugians, began to oppress the inhabitants of Pavia, whom the latter&#x27;s forces had been garrisoned to protect. Once Theodoric intervened in person in late August 491, his punitive acts drove Fredericus to desert with his followers to Tufa.

By this time, however, Odoacer appeared to have lost all hope of victory. A large-scale sortie he sent out of Ravenna on the night of 9/10 July 491 ended in failure, during which his commander-in-chief, Livilia, along with the best of his Herulian soldiers, was killed. On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at Rimini to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theodoric and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theodoric entered the city on 5 March. Odoacer died ten days later, slain by Theodoric while they shared a meal. Theodoric had plotted to have a group of his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of Honorius &quot;Ad Laurentum&quot; (&quot;At the Laurel Grove&quot;); when this plan went astray, Theodoric drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone. In response to Odoacer&#x27;s dying question, &quot;Where is God?&quot; Theodoric cried, &quot;This is what you did to my friends.&quot; Theodoric was said to have stood over the body of his dead rival and exclaimed, &quot;The man has no bones in his body.&quot;

Not only did Theodoric slay Odoacer, he thereafter had the betrayed king&#x27;s loyal followers hunted down and killed as well, an event which left him as the master of Italy. Odoacer&#x27;s wife Sunigilda was stoned to death, and his brother Onoulphus was killed by archers while seeking refuge in a church. Theodoric exiled Odoacer&#x27;s son Thela to Gaul, but when he attempted to return to Italy Theodoric had him killed. Despite the tragic ending of his domain, followers, and family, Odoacer left an important legacy, in that, he had laid the foundations of a great kingdom in Italy that benefited Theodoric the Great.

== Later portrayals ==
* The Old High German mentions Odoacer (as &quot;Otacher&quot;) as the person who drove Hildebrand from his home.
* The Old English poem &quot;Wulf and Eadwacer&quot; has been thought to be a legendary retelling of part of Odoacer&#x27;s story.

<text>The Heruli (also Eluri, Eruli, Herules, Herulians) were one of the smaller Germanic peoples of Late Antiquity, known from records in the third to sixth centuries AD. 
The best recorded group of Heruli established a kingdom north of the Middle Danube, probably including the area north of present day Vienna. This kingdom was a neighbour to several other small and short-lived kingdoms in the late 5th century AD and early 6th century, including those of the Sciri, Rugii, Danubian Suebi, and Gepids. After the conquest of this Heruli kingdom by the Lombards in 508, splinter groups moved to Sweden, Ostrogothic Italy, and present-day Serbia, which was under Eastern Roman control. 

The Danubian Heruli are generally equated to the &quot;Elouri&quot; who lived near the Sea of Azov during the late 3rd or early 4th century, and are believed to have migrated westwards. In 267-270 these Elouri took part together with Goths and other eastern European peoples in two massive raids into Roman provinces in the Balkans and Aegean Sea, attacking not only by land, but notably also by sea. The equation of these &quot;ELuRi&quot; with the &quot;ERuLi&quot; was made by several Byzantine authors, and is still widely accepted although some scholars such as Ellegård consider this equation uncertain, and propose that the Heruli homeland lay elsewhere. For example, because a group of 6th century Heruli moved from the Danube to Scandinavia, some scholars believe that the Heruli had their earliest origins in Scandinavia. There are also proposals that there were Heruli kingdoms in several parts of Europe, already in the 3rd and 4th century, perhaps with common origins in the north. One proposal, based upon indirect evidence, is that there was a &quot;Western Heruli&quot; settlement based near the Lower Rhine, because in 286 AD, only a few years after the eastern raids, the Heruli were defeated in an attack on Roman Gaul.

Like their sometime allies the Goths, soon after first being noted in contemporary records as Eastern European raiders, Heruli also began entering the Roman empire and serving in its military, where they developed a particularly notable reputation already in the 4th century, at first mainly in the Western Roman Empire. A new Heruli unit was stationed in northern Italy. On the other hand, Heruli living near the Roman frontiers were also among the many groups which caused disruption to the empire in this period. The Heruli probably already settled north of the Danube in the 4th century. In 409 AD Heruli were among the &quot;ferocious&quot; nations, mostly from the Danubian area, that Saint Jerome described as occupying all of Roman Gaul. An important influence upon the movements of such peoples in this period was that the Huns were moving west. Eventually Attila&#x27;s empire was based in the Danubian region. The Danubian Heruli kingdom known from later records probably already existed in some form within his empire, as did the kingdoms of the Ostrogoths, Sciri, and Gepids.

After the death of Attila in 453, the Danubian Heruli fought in the Battle of Nedao in 454, although it is not certain which side they took among his various former allies. They also participated in successive conquests of Italy by Odoacer (476), Theoderic the Great (493), Narses (554), and probably also the Lombards (starting in 568). Under Roman command the Heruli played important military roles in Balkan, African, and Italian conflicts. With their last known kingdom in the Balkans eventually dominated by Rome however, and smaller groups integrated into larger political entities such as the Gepids and Lombards, the Heruli disappear from history around the time of the conquest of Italy by the Lombards. In this period the Middle Danube was coming under the control of the Pannonian Avars.

==Classification==
When first mentioned by Roman authors in the 3rd century AD, the &quot;Elouri&quot; were referred to as &quot;Scythians&quot;, as were the Goths and other allied tribes. The use of this term for Heruli and Goths probably began as early as Dexippus, most of whose work is now lost. The use of this term does not give us any clear linguistic classification.

In late antiquity, the Gepids, Vandals, Rugii, Sciri, the non-Germanic Alans, and not only the Goths themselves, were all classified by Roman ethnographers as &quot;Gothic&quot; (or &quot;Getic&quot;) peoples, and modern historians generally consider the Heruli to be one of these. While historians such as Walter Goffart have pointed out that the Herules are never included in the lists of &quot;Gothic peoples&quot; of Procopius, Mihail Zahariade has pointed out that Zonaras (12.24.20) stated that the Heruli were of Gothic stock, and he suggests this might be why Latin authors did not distinguish the early Heruli from the Goths as carefully as Greek authors did.

None of these eastern peoples were considered &quot;Germanic&quot; by Roman ethnographers at the time. However, in modern scholarship the Heruli, like other peoples presumed to have spoken a Germanic language, are usually classified as a Germanic people. On account of having likely spoken an East Germanic language, such as Gothic, the Heruli are often more specifically classified as an East Germanic people.
===Name===
In English, the plural &quot;Heruli&quot; can also be spelled as Heruls, Herules, or Herulians. The name can be written without &quot;h&quot; in Greek (Ἔρουλοι, &#x27;Erouloi&#x27;), Latin (&quot;Eruli&quot;), and English. Whether or not the h-sound was an organic sound is uncertain.

In the earliest mentions of them in 4th century records, they were called Eluri (&#x27;Ερουλοι), with the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot; reversed compared to later records. This has led to doubts about whether these first &quot;Erouli&quot; from the Sea of Azov were the same people as the later Eruli from the Danube. Dexippus whose writings about these early &quot;Eluri&quot; only survive in fragments, gave their name a Greek etymology, claiming that they were named after the swamps (ἕλη, &quot;hélē&quot;) of their Azov homeland.

According to modern scholars the etymology of the name is uncertain but it is thought to be Germanic. More speculatively, it is possibly related to the English word &quot;earl&quot; (see erilaz) implying that it was an honorific military title. (This etymology is associated with the speculation that the Heruli were not a normal tribal group but a brotherhood of mobile warriors, though there is no consensus for this old proposal, which is based only on the name etymology and the reputation of Heruli as soldiers.) 

There have been proposals which connected this etymology with Germanic words found in runic inscriptions in Scandinavia signifying a pronunciation &quot;erilaR&quot;, and there have also been proposals that the word is connected to Germanic words for werewolves and beings with magic powers. None of these proposals can be verified.

===Language===
The Heruli are believed to have spoken a Germanic language. Personal names are one of the only direct sources of evidence for this. Some attested Heruli names are almost certainly Germanic, and similar to Gothic names, but a large number are not easily attributed to any specific language family.

Given their association with the Goths, the Heruli may have spoken an East Germanic language, related to the Gothic language. Alternatively however, given their proposed connections to Scandinavia, it has also been proposed that they spoke a North Germanic language.

==History==
===Possible Scandinavian origins===

Although contemporary records locate the Heruli first near the Sea of Azov, and later on the Middle Danube, their ultimate origins are traditionally sought in Scandinavia. The Heruli are thus commonly believed to have migrated from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea before the 3rd century AD. In line with this, their Black Sea neighbours the Goths, and their Danubian neighbours Rugii, are both believed to have had their origins on the southern Baltic shore, and there are proposals that their ultimate origins were in Scandinavia. The idea that they came from regions near the Baltic is consistent with the fact that many of these peoples, such as the Goths, spoke Germanic languages, and these originated near the Baltic.

The source of the idea that such peoples specifically came from Scandinavia is the 6th century historian Jordanes, who was based in Constantinople. He believed that the Goths and Gepids both came from Scandinavia many centuries before his time, which he described as &quot;like a workshop or even better the womb of nations&quot; (&quot;quasi officina gentium aut certe velut vagina nationum&quot;). This narrative was extremely influential for later writers. Jordanes also made specific remarks concerning the Heruli, but these have been more difficult to interpret. He said that the Heruli had been driven out of their own settlements in Scandinavia by the Danes (&quot;Herulos propriis sedibus expulerunt&quot;). This is interpreted by various scholars in at least two different ways.
*The expulsion happened centuries before Jordanes, and the Heruli origins are ultimately in present-day Denmark or southern Sweden. 
*This expulsion from Scandinavia was not long before Jordanes, and at least some of the expelled Heruli were themselves recent immigrants to Scandinavia, from the Danube. (Historians also note that Jordanes also mentions Rugii in the same passage about Scandinavia. The Rugii on the Danube, old neighbours of the Heruli, had also been recently lost their kingdom there to the Lombards.) This possibility still leaves debate open about whether the ultimate origins of the Heruli were in Scandinavia.
The evidence for this second possibility is that Procopius, a contemporary of Jordanes, recounted a migration by sixth-century Heruli noblemen to Scandinavia (&quot;Thule&quot;) from the Middle Danube, where their kingdom had been destroyed by the Lombards. Apparently aligning with the story of Jordanes, when other expatriates from the Danubian kingdom established themselves to the south, in the Balkans and needed a king, they sent embassy to the Scandinavian Heruli and returned with one. 

While a migration to Scandinavia can itself be seen as evidence of an old and continuous connection between the Heruli and Scandinavia, some scholars are sceptical of this interpretation, noting that Procopius specifically says that the Heruli who moved to Scandinavia left the &quot;home of their ancestors&quot;. In contrast, in 2021 Prostko-Prostyński argued that there is &quot;no doubt&quot; about Scandinavian origins. Even though Procopius does not explicitly mention it, &quot;it is hard to assume they ventured so far north without a reason of such nature&quot;. In his review of Prostko-Prostyński, Roland Steinacher asserts that this is debatable.

Ellegård, one of the scholars who argued that the expulsion involved immigrants whose real homeland was on the Danube, wrote that &quot;the only thing we can say with reasonable certainty is that a small group of Eruli lived there [in Scandinavia] for some 38-40 years in the first half of the 6th century AD&quot;. 

More controversially, Ellegård proposed that the evidence makes it most likely that the Heruli were &quot;a loose group of Germanic warriors which came into being in the late 3rd century in the region north of the Danube limes that extends roughly from Passau to Vienna&quot;. This proposal has not been widely accepted.

===On the Pontic-Caspian steppe===
In 267/268 and 269/270 Graeco-Roman writers described two major campaigns by the &quot;Eluri&quot; into the Balkans and Aegean, which were among the last and biggest such seaborne raids from the northern Black Sea coast starting in the 250s. They are normally equated to the later Danubian Heruli. Although doubts have been raised about this link, the &quot;Augustan History&quot; written in the late 4th century, Jordanes in the 6th century, and George Syncellus around 800 all equated them with the Heruli known in later times.

During these raids, Goths, Eluri, and other &quot;Scythian&quot; peoples took control of Black Sea Greek cities, and gained a fleet that they used to launch raids starting in the Black Sea itself, and going as far as Greece and Asia Minor. Although some historians in the past doubted whether there were really two invasions so close together, these invasions began in the reign of Gallienus (260-268 AD), and continued until at least 269 during the reign of Marcus Aurelius Claudius, who subsequently took up the title &quot;Gothicus&quot; due to his victory.

In 267, a Heruli fleet departed from the Sea of Azov, past the Danube delta, and into the straits of the Bosphorus. They took control of Byzantion and Chrysopolis before retreating to the Black Sea. Emerging to raid Cyzicus, they subsequently entered the Aegean Sea, where they troubled Lemnos, Skyros and Imbros, before landing in the Peloponnese. There they plundered not only Sparta, the closest city to their landing site, but also Corinth, Argos, and the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. Still within 267 they reached Athens, where local militias had to defend the city. It seems to have been the Heruli specifically who sacked Athens despite the construction of a new wall, during Valerian’s reign only a generation earlier. This was the occasion for a famous defense made by Dexippus, whose writings were a source for later historians.

Further north, in 268, Gallienus defeated Heruli at the river Nestos using a new mobile cavalry, but as part of the surrender a Herulian chief named Naulobatus became the first barbarian known from written records to receive imperial insignia from the Romans, gaining the rank of a Roman consul. It is highly likely that these defeated Heruli were then made part of the Roman military.

Recent researchers such as Steinacher now have increased confidence that there was a distinct second campaign which began in 269, and ended in 270. Later Roman writers reported that thousands of ships left from the mouth of the Dnieper, manned by a large force of various different &quot;Scythian&quot; peoples, including Peuci, Greutungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi, Gepids, &quot;Celts&quot;, and Heruli. These forces divided into two parts in the Hellespont. One force attacked Thessaloniki, and against this group the Romans, led by Claudius now, had a major victory at the Battle of Naissus (Niš, Serbia) in 269. This was apparently a distinct battle from that at the Nessos. A Herulian chieftain named Andonnoballus is said to have switched to the Roman side, and this was once again a case where Heruli appear to have joined the Roman military. The second group sailed south and raided Rhodes, Crete, and Cyprus and many Goths and Heruli managed to return safely to harbor in the Crimea. Lesser attacks continued until 276.

The Heruli are believed to have formed part of the Chernyakhov culture, which, although dominated by the Goths and other Germanic peoples, also included Bastarnae, Dacians and Carpi. The Heruli are thus archaeologically indistinguishable from the Goths.

Jordanes reports that these Heruli of the Azov area in the late 4th century AD were conquered by Ermanaric, king of the Greuthungi Goths. Ermanaric&#x27;s realm may also have included Finns, Slavs, Alans and Sarmatians. Before being conquered by Ermanaric, Jordanes says that the Heruli were led by a king named Alaric. Herwig Wolfram has suggested that the future Visigothic king Alaric I may have been named after this Herulian king.

===The &quot;western&quot; Heruli of the 4th century===
As with their neighbours the Goths, Heruli were already seen in western Europe before the empire of Attila, both as raiders and as soldiers working under Roman authority. They first appear at the time of their first ambitious campaigns in the east. In 286 Claudius Mamertinus reported the victory of Maximian over a group of Heruli and Chaibones (known only from this one report) attacking Gaul. Further reports of the Heruli in the west continue in the 4th century and based on this there is a proposal that there was a distinct Western kingdom of Heruli living near the Lower Rhine, who were not descended from the Heruli who lived in the Black Sea. 

Already before the time of Attila the Romans established a Herulian auxiliary unit in the Western Roman Empire, and it has been argued that this implies that they were already settled somewhere within the empire. The &quot;Heruli seniores&quot; were stationed in northern Italy. This &quot;numerus Erulorum&quot; was a lightly-equipped unit often associated with the Batavian &quot;Batavi seniores&quot;. If there was ever a regiment called &quot;Heruli iuniores&quot;, then it is possible it was based in the Eastern Roman empire and it may have been one of the units which ceased to exist after the Battle of Adrianople in 378.
*In about 314, the Heruli (like the Sciri and Rugii) were already listed in the &quot;Laterculus Veronensis&quot; as one of the barbarian peoples living within the Roman empire. Ellegård argues that this and other 4th century sources indicate that several of Attila&#x27;s future allies in the Middle Danube were already established in the 4th century. He proposes that the Heruli were already based somewhere between Passau and Vienna. Liccardo has however criticized Ellegård&#x27;s interpretation of the evidence, noting that they are placed (together with the Rugii) between the northern British Barbarians and the tribes of the Lower Rhine.
*In 360, Constantius II ordered the future emperor Julian the Apostate, who then had command of forces in Gaul, to send some of his best units including the Heruli, Batavi, and others, for fighting against the Parthians in the Middle East.The records about this imply that the Heruli were a unit who had left their homes east of the Rhine, which Ellegård thinks is consistent with a base near Passau, while Liccardo emphasizes that it implies that they now lived west of the Rhine. 
*In 366 the Batavian and Heruli units fought against the Alamanni near the Rhine, under the leadership of Charietto, who died in the battle, and then against Picts and Scoti in Britain. They were subsequently sent to fight Parthians in the east.
*In 405 or 406, a large number of barbarian groups crossed the Rhine, entering Roman Gaul, and the Heruli appear in the list of peoples given by the historian Jerome. However, this list is sometimes thought to have drawn on historical lists for literary effect. Furthermore the list included many of the Middle Danubian peoples from the East, including Roman provincials from Pannonia, and was already in the period where the Huns were causing major movements of such peoples.
*In 435 the Heruli are mentioned by Sidonius Apollinaris (Letter 7, lines 23-240) among the troops which Aëtius, who had spent time in exile with the Danubian Huns, used to defend Gallia Belgica, a Roman province, from Burgundians. (At least some of his troops such as the Sarmatians apparently came from Eastern Europe.)

Ellegård argues that the association with the Batavi in this period should be seen not as a connection to the Lower Rhine, the original home of the Batavi unit centuries earlier, but to their quarters in this period which were at Passau (&quot;Castra Batava&quot;) on the Danube, not far from where the Heruli would later have their kingdom. Liccardo argues that even though &quot;units were moved around and over time tended to lose any ethnic or geographical homogeneity&quot; they could still give hints about the origins of ethnic groups.

At least two much later mentions of Heruli in southwestern Europe, after the Heruli were established on the Middle Danube, and in parts of Italy, can be connected to the Visigoths who had been granted a kingdom by the Romans in what is now southwestern France, but have also been taken to imply the existence of Heruli based on the North Sea coast, for example near the Lower Rhine. Firstly, two sea raids were made by Heruli around coastal Spain in the 450s, as reported by Hydatius. Secondly, shortly after 475 Sidonius Apollinaris reported the presence of Heruli at the Visigothic court of Euric in Bordeaux. They are listed in a poetic way together with other barbarians, from places as distant as Parthia, who Sidonius found looking for protection and patronage.
Particularly striking in this passage is the implication that the Heruli homeland is on the &quot;Ocean&quot;. More generally the connection of these Heruli with the sea, so far to the west, is sometimes taken as evidence that these Heruli were not from the Danube or Black Sea. Steinacher, on the other hand, argues that the poetic references of Sidonius linking the Heruli to the sea might be &quot;nothing more than a bookish reference to 3rd-century accounts of Herules&quot; who attacked from the Black Sea. Steinacher, along with fellow scholar Halsall, has pointed out that this evidence of Heruli in Visigothic territory is consistent with the conflicts within the Roman empire during this period; Halsall writes that it &quot;must at least be a possibility&quot; that the Herulian raids in Spain during this period &quot;constituted part of a Romano-Visigothic offensive against the Sueves&quot;. These Suebi, themselves from central Europe, had recently established a kingdom on the northern coast of Spain, and the Visigoths coordinated with Rome against them. On the other hand, other scholars, such as Liccardo, emphasize that Sidonius lists the Herulians with Saxons, Franks and Burgundians—i.e., as if they were subjects or supplicants from Gaul.

The 6th century correspondence of Theoderic the Great, preserved in of Cassiodorus, does not give any information about the location of the homeland of the Heruli. This leaves open the possibility that the recipient of the letter was the Middle Danubian kingdom of the Heruli. Proponents of a distinct Western Herulian kingdom near the Rhine note that the letter was also sent to the kings of the Thuringians and Warini—quite far to the north of the Danube, and more directly threatened by the Franks who are discussed in the letter; opponents emphasize that Theoderic was clearly concerned with a large part of central Europe, and that the Franks did in reality quickly make inroads towards the Middle Danubian region whence Italy could be threatened.

===Kingdom on the Middle Danube===

As already mentioned, the &quot;Laterculus Veronensis&quot; shows that Heruli and Rugii were already present somewhere in western Europe in about 314. Similar listings from later in the 4th century, the &quot;Cosmographia&quot; of Julius Honorius, and probably also the &quot;Liber Generationis&quot;, both listed the Heruli near the Marcomanni and Quadi who are known from many records to have lived until the 4th century in the region north of the Danube, where the Herule kingdom would later be found.

In the late 4th century, large groups of Eastern European peoples including most notably the Goths and Alans, crossed the Lower Danube into the Roman empire, while others entered the Middle Danubian region, between the Carpathians and the Roman empire. The Huns and their allies also moved east and began established themselves near the Danube around 400. The Roman military was weakened and increased reliant upon barbarian forces. They were also internally divided with a rebel emperor in Gaul, Constantine III, and open conflict between the Western and Eastern empires in the Balkans. In 405/6, large numbers of &quot;ferocious&quot; peoples including the Heruli, Quadi, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alans, Gepids, Saxons, Burgundians, and Alemanni, together with provincial inhabitants of Roman Pannonia, are reported by Saint Jerome to have crossed the Rhine and occupied all parts of Roman Gaul. Several of these such as the Vandals, Alans, Saxons and Burgundians are known to have permanently settled in different parts of Roman Gaul and Iberia. Also in 405/6, the Gothic king Radagaisus invaded Italy itself from Pannonia, occupying Roman forces there. 

By 450 AD, the Heruli and the other peoples still in the Middle Danube area, including Gepids, Rugi, Sciri and many Goths, Alans and Sarmatians, were firmly part of the Hunnic empire of Attila. Although they were not specifically listed by Sidonius or Jordanes, Heruli are believed to have been among the peoples who fought at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains between the Romans and Attila, possibly on both sides. As indirect evidence, centuries later Pauls Diaconus listed the subject peoples who Attila could call upon in addition to the better known Goths and Gepids: &quot;Marcomanni, Suebi, Quadi, and alongside them the Herules, Thuringi and Rugii&quot;.

After the death of Attila in 453, his sons lost power over the various peoples of his empire after the Battle of Nedao in 454. Heruli who were possibly on the winning side with the Gepids, were subsequently among the several peoples now able to consolidate a kingdom on the Danube. It lay north of modern Vienna and Bratislava, near the Morava river, and possibly extending as far east as the Little Carpathians. They ruled over a mixed population including Suevi, Huns and Alans. Compared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms in this period, Peter Heather has described this Heruli kingdom as &quot;middle-sized&quot;, similar to the Rugian one, but &quot;clearly not as militarily powerful, say, as the Gothic, Lombard, or Gepid confederations which generated much longer-lived political entities, and into which elements of the Rugi and Heruli were eventually absorbed&quot;.

From this region the life story of Severinus of Noricum reports that the Heruli attacked Ioviaco near Passau in 480. The Heruli are listed by Jordanes as having fought at the Battle of Nedao, but we do not know if they took the Gepid or Ostrogothic side. However, they benefited from the subsequent downfall of Odoacer&#x27;s people the Sciri, and were able established control on the Roman (south) side of the Danube, north of Lake Balaton in modern Hungary when they were apparently able to take over the kingdoms of the Suevi and Sciri, who had been under pressure from the Ostrogoths, who continued to press their old allies from the south.

Odoacer, the commander of the Imperial &quot;foederati&quot; troops who deposed the last Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustus in 476 AD came to be seen as king over several of the Danubian peoples including the Heruli, and the Heruli were strongly associated with his Italian kingdom. The Heruli on the Danube also took control of the Rugian territories, as they had become competitors to Odoacer and been defeated by him in 488. However Heruli suffered badly in Italy, as loyalists of Odoacer, when he was defeated by the Ostrogoth Theoderic.

By 500 the Herulian kingdom on the Danube, apparently by now under a king named Rodulph, had made peace with Theoderic and become his allies. Paul the Deacon also mentions Heruli living in Italy under Ostrogothic rule. Peter Heather estimates that the Herulian kingdom could muster an army of 5,000-10,000 men.
Theoderic&#x27;s efforts to build a system of alliances in Western Europe were made difficult both by counter diplomacy, for example between Merovingian Franks and the Byzantine empire, and also the arrival of a new Germanic people into the Danubian region, the Lombards who were initially under Herule hegemony. The Herulian king Rodulph lost his kingdom to the Lombards at some point between 494 and 508.

===Later history===
After the Middle Danubian Herulian kingdom was destroyed by the Lombards in or before 508, Herulian fortunes waned. According to Procopius, in 512 a group including royalty went north and settled in Thule, which for Procopius meant Scandinavia. Procopius noted that these Heruli first traversed the lands of the Slavs, then empty lands, and then the lands of the Danes, until finally settling down nearby the Geats. Peter Heather considers this account to be &quot;entirely plausible&quot; although he notes that others have labelled it a &quot;fairy story&quot;, and given that it only appears in one source it is possible to deny its validity.

Another Heruli group were assigned civil and military offices by Theoderic the Great in Pavia in north Italy.

What happened to the main part of the Danubian Heruli has been difficult to reconstruct from Procopius, but according to Steinacher they first moved downstream on the Danube to an area where the Rugii had sought refuge in 488. Here they suffered famine. They sought refuge among the Gepids, but wanting to avoid being mistreated by them crossed the Danube came under East Roman authority.

Anastasius Caesar allowed them to resettle depopulated &quot;lands and cities&quot; in the empire in 512. Modern scholars debate whether they were moved then to Singidunum (modern Belgrade), or first to Bassianae, and to Singidunum some decades later, by Justinian. This area had been re-acquired by the empire from the Goths, who now ruled Italy from Ravenna. Justinian integrated them into the empire as a buffer between the Romans and the more independent Lombards and Gepids to the north. Under his encouragement, the Herule king Grepes converted to Orthodox Christianity in 528 together with some nobles and twelve relatives. Procopius who felt that this made them somewhat gentler, also showed in his account of the wars against the African Vandals, that some of them were Arian Christians.

The Heruli were often mentioned during the times of Justinian, who used them in his extensive military campaigns in many countries including Italy, Syria, and North Africa. Pharas was a notable Herulian commander during this period. Several thousand Heruli served in the personal guard of Belisarius throughout the campaigns, and Narses also recruited from them. They were a participant in the Byzantine-Sasanian wars.

Grepes and most of his family had apparently died by the early 540s, possibly in the Plague of Justinian (541-542). Procopius related that in the 540s the Heruli who had been settled in the Roman Balkans killed their own king Ochus and, not wanting the one assigned by the emperor, Suartuas, they made contact with the Heruli who had gone to Thule decades earlier, seeking a new king. Their first choice fell sick and died when they had come to the country of the Dani, and a second choice was made. The new king Datius arrived with his brother Aordus and 200 young men. The Heruli who were sent against Suartuas defected with him and were supported by the empire. The supporters of Datius, two thirds of the Heruli, submitted to the Gepids. This period of rebellion against Rome lasted approximately 545–548, the period immediately before conflict between their larger neighbours the Gepids and Lombards broke out, but this rebellion was repressed by Justinian.
In 549, when the Gepids fought the Romans, and Heruli fought on both sides. In any case after one generation in the Belgrade area, the Herulian federate polity in the Balkans disappears from the surviving historical records, apparently replaced by the incoming Avars.

Peter Heather has written that: 
Sarantis however shows that the Belgrade-region Heruli continued to be recruited, and to play a role in local conflicts involving the Gepids and Lombards, into the 550s. Suartas, a Herule general for the Romans, led Herule forces against the Gepids in 552 for example. However it appears that by this period the semi-independent Heruli near Belgrade became Roman provincials.

In 566, Sinduald, a Herule military leader under Narses, was declared a king of Heruli in Trentino in northern Italy, but he was executed by Narses. Sinduald was said to be a descendant of the Herules who had already entered Italy under Odoacer.

Paul the Deacon writes that many Heruli joined the Lombard king Alboin in their eventual conquest of Italy from the empire in the late 6th century AD.

Along with the Rugii and Sciri, the Heruli may have contributed to the formation of the Bavarii.

==Culture==
===Political culture===
While there is very little detailed information available, historical sources name six kings of the Danubian Herules, from the first half of the 6th century. Unlike their neighbours the Goths and Gepids, they appear to have had a limited role, and some of the military leaders who fought under the Romans are better known. Based mainly on the remarks of Procopius it appears they did not necessarily make all decisions, but they were expected to play a partly symbolic role in leading their people in battle, and representing them in dealings with other peoples and empires. Procopius suggests that the Herulian kings were often challenged and could be deposed if they failed to meet the expectations of their people.

===Religion===
The early religion of the Heruli is vividly described by Procopius in his &quot;History of the Wars&quot;. He describes them as a polytheistic society known to practice human sacrifice. The Heruli appear to have been worshippers of Odin, and might have been responsible for the spread of such worship to Northern Europe.

By the time of Justinian, Procopius reports that many Heruli were Arian Christians. In any case, Justinian appears to have pursued a policy of converting them to orthodox Chalcedonian Christianity.

===Society===
Procopius writes that the Heruli practiced a form of senicide, having a non-relative kill the sick and elderly and burning the remains on a wooden pyre. Procopius also states that, following the death of their husbands, Herulian women were expected to commit suicide by hanging.

Furthermore, Procopius claims that the Heruli practiced homosexuality or bestiality, depending on the interpretation:
The translated &quot;especially men with asses&quot; is from the original Greek text (provided next to Dewing&#x27;s translation) &quot;ἂλλας τε καί ἀνδρῶν καί ὄνων&quot; where &quot;ὄνων&quot; is genitive plural of &quot;ὄνος&quot;, meaning &quot;donkeys&quot;.

It appears that Procopius disliked the Heruli and wanted to present them in as negative light as possible. His description of bestiality among the Heruli is almost certainly untrue.

===Warfare===
The Heruli were famous for the quality of their infantry, who were recruited as mercenaries by all other peoples. They were known particularly for their speed, and were perhaps used for the stabbing cavalry. Procopius described the Heruli in the Battle of Anglon against Persians, carrying no protective armor save a shield and thick jacket. This form of warfare has been compared to that of the berserkers of the Viking Age.

Herulian slaves are known to have accompanied the Herules into combat. Slaves were forbidden from donning a shield until having proven themselves brave on the battlefield. This practice might be a relic of ancient Indo-European tradition. Steinacher has pointed out that, while this remark has reasonably been seen as evidence of an &quot;initiation rite&quot;, initiation rites are so common that caution is required:
===Material culture===
The tumuli of the Heruli on the Middle Danube in the early 6th century are very similar to contemporary tumuli built in southern Sweden. At this time, the Heruli appears to have had close trade relations with peoples living near the Baltic Sea.

==Physical appearance==
In &quot;Getica&quot;, Jordanes writes that the Heruli claimed to be the tallest people of Scandza. Jordanes further writes that all the peoples of Scandza &quot;surpassed the Germans in size and spirit&quot;. Sidonius Apollinaris wrote that the Heruli had blue-grey eyes.

==The negative excursus of Procopius==
Scholars remark that the historian Procopius had a notable fascination with the Herules, which colors his descriptions of them. As Steinacher remarks, &quot;Procopius&#x27;s Herul excursus [...] is full of stereotypes and negative attitudes towards this primitive people and its archaic conventions&quot;. This means that caution is required when using his descriptions as evidence. In the words of Walter Goffart:

Although Procopius praised the Herule named Pharas who brought about the surrender of the north African Vandal king Gelimer, he noted that &quot;despite&quot; being born a Herule, he did not drink excessively and was not unreliable.

<doc id="37047" wikidata="Q1994694" url="?curid=37047" title="Akasha">
<text>Akasha (Sanskrit &quot;&quot; ) means aether in traditional Hindu cosmology. The term has also been adopted in Western occultism and spiritualism in the late 19th century CE. In many modern Indo-Aryan languages and Dravidian languages the corresponding word retains a generic meaning of &quot;aether&quot;. The Hindu god of Akasha is Dyaus.

==Etymology and meaning==
The word in Sanskrit is derived from a root meaning &quot;to be&quot;. It appears as a masculine noun in Vedic Sanskrit with a generic meaning of &quot;aether&quot;. In Classical Sanskrit, the noun acquires the neuter gender and may express the concept of &quot;aether&quot; (Manusmriti, Shatapatha Brahmana). In Vedantic philosophy, the word acquires its technical meaning of &quot;an ethereal fluid imagined as pervading the cosmos&quot;.

Indian philosophy classify Akasha into three categories. The first category, represented by the &quot;Nyaya,&quot; &quot;Vaisheshika&quot;, Purva Mimamsa, and Jain traditions, considers Akasha to be an independent, all-pervading, and eternal substance essential to the structure of the universe. The second category encompassing the Samkhya-Yoga and Vedanta, views Akasha as an evolute of something else. The third category regards Akasha as a mental concept, a view particularly reflected in later Buddhist systems.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, &quot;akasha&quot; means the basis and essence of all things in the material world; the first element created. A Hindu mantra &quot;pṛthivyāpastejovāyurākāśāta&quot; indicates the sequence of initial appearance of the five basic gross elements. Thus, first appeared aether, from which appeared air, from that fire, from which water, and therefrom the earth. It is one of the &quot;Panchamahabhuta&quot;, or &quot;five gross elements&quot;; its main characteristic is &quot;Shabda&quot; (sound). The direct translation of &quot;akasha&quot; is the word meaning &#x27;aether&#x27; in Hinduism.

The &quot;Nyaya&quot; and &quot;Vaisheshika&quot; schools of Hindu philosophy state that &quot;akasha&quot; (aether) is the fifth physical substance, which is the substratum of the quality of sound. It is the one, eternal, and all-pervading physical substance, which is imperceptible.

According to the &quot;Samkhya&quot; school, &quot;akasha&quot; is one of the five &quot;Mahābhūtas&quot; (grand physical elements) having the specific property of sound.

In the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, it identifies &quot;akasha&quot; as having &quot;the only attribute of sound&quot;.

In the &quot;Linga Purana&quot; (Volume I, Chapter 65), &quot;akasha&quot; is translated as &quot;aether&quot; and listed as one of the 1000 names of Shiva.

==Jainism==
Akasha is space in the Jain conception of the cosmos. Akasha is one of the six &quot;dravyas&quot; (substances) and it accommodates the other five, namely sentient beings or souls (&quot;jīva&quot;), non-sentient substance or matter (&quot;pudgala&quot;), principle of motion (&quot;dharma&quot;), the principle of rest (&quot;adharma&quot;), and the principle of time (&quot;kāla&quot;).

It falls into the &quot;Ajiva&quot; category, divided into two parts: &quot;Loakasa&quot; (the part occupied by the material world) and &quot;Aloakasa&quot; (the space beyond it which is absolutely void and empty). In &quot;Loakasa&quot; the universe forms only a part. Akasha is that which gives space and makes room for the existence of all extended substances.

At the summit of the &quot;lokākāśa&quot; is the &quot;Siddhashila&quot; (abode of the liberated souls).

==Buddhism==
In Buddhist phenomenology, &quot;akasha&quot; is divided into limited space (ākāsa-dhātu) and endless space (ajatākasā). The Vaibhāṣika, an early school of Buddhist philosophy, hold the existence of &quot;akasha&quot; to be real. Ākāsa is identified as the first arūpa jhāna, but usually translates as &quot;infinite space.&quot;

Ākāśa (Sanskrit: &quot;space&quot;) holds two primary meanings in Abhidharma analysis: 

# Spatiality: Ākāśa is defined as the absence that delimits forms. Like the empty space within a door frame, it is an emptiness that is shaped and defined by the material surrounding it.
# Vast Space: Ākāśa is also described as the absence of obstruction, categorized as one of the &quot;nityadharmas&quot; (permanent phenomena) because it remains unchanged over time. In this sense, it is likened to the Western concept of ether—an immaterial, luminous fluid that supports the four material elements (&quot;mahābhūta&quot;). Its radiant quality often serves as a metaphor for buddhahood, which is described as shining like the sun or space.

In meditation, &quot;ākāśa&quot; is significant in the context of the sphere of infinite space (&quot;ākāśānantyāyatana&quot;), the first of the four immaterial absorptions (&quot;arupa&quot;-&quot;dhyānas&quot;). 

Philosophically, &quot;ākāśa&quot; is considered one of the uncompounded phenomena (&quot;asaṃskṛtadharmas&quot;) in six Buddhist schools, including the &quot;Sarvāstivāda&quot;, &quot;Mahāsāṃghika&quot;, and later &quot;Yogācāra&quot;. However, three schools, including the &quot;Theravāda&quot;, reject this interpretation.

<text>The Maunder Minimum, also known as the &quot;prolonged sunspot minimum&quot;, was a period around 1645 to 1715 during which sunspots became exceedingly rare. During the 28-year period 1672–1699 within the minimum, observations revealed fewer than 50 sunspots. This contrasts with the typical 40,000–50,000 sunspots seen in modern times over a similar timespan.

The Maunder Minimum was first noted by Gustav Spörer in publications in 1887 and 1889, work that was relayed to the Royal Astronomical Society in London, and then expanded on, by solar astronomers Edward Walter Maunder (1851–1928), and his wife Annie Russell Maunder (1868–1947), who also studied how sunspot latitudes changed with time. Two papers were published in Edward Maunder&#x27;s name in 1890 and 1894, and he cited the two earlier papers written by Gustav Spörer. Because Annie Maunder had not received a university degree, restrictions at the time caused her contribution not to be publicly recognized. The term &quot;Maunder Minimum&quot; was popularised by John A. Eddy, who published a landmark paper in &quot;Science&quot; in 1976.

The Maunder Minimum occurred within the Little Ice Age, a long period () of lower-than-average European temperatures. The reduced solar activity may have contributed to the climatic cooling, although the cooling began before the solar minimum and its primary cause is believed to be volcanic activity.

==Sunspot observations==
The Maunder Minimum occurred between 1645 and 1715 when very few sunspots were observed. That was not because of a lack of observations, as during the 17th century, Giovanni Domenico Cassini carried out a systematic program of solar observations at the Paris Observatory, thanks to the astronomers Jean Picard and Philippe de La Hire. Johannes Hevelius also performed observations on his own. Here is the total of sunspots recorded, by example, in the decennial years (omitting Wolf numbers):

During the Maunder Minimum enough sunspots were sighted that 11-year cycles could be determined from the count. The maxima occurred in 1676–1677, 1684, 1695, 1705 and 1718. Sunspot activity was then concentrated in the southern hemisphere of the Sun, except for the last cycle when the sunspots appeared in the northern hemisphere. According to Spörer&#x27;s law, spots appear at high latitudes at the start of a cycle, subsequently moving to lower latitudes until they average about latitude 15° at solar maximum. The average then continues to drift lower to about 7° and after that, while spots of the old cycle fade, new cycle spots start appearing again at high latitudes. The visibility of these spots is also affected by the velocity of the Sun&#x27;s surface rotation at various latitudes:

Visibility is somewhat affected by observations being done from the ecliptic. The ecliptic is inclined 7° from the plane of the Sun&#x27;s equator (latitude 0°).

==Eclipses during the Maunder minimum==
In his highly influential paper, John A. Eddy discussed solar eclipses during the Maunder Minimum. From text of eye-witness reports of events in 1652, 1706 and 1715, he concluded that the solar corona was weak in intensity and unstructured during the Maunder Minimum. However, no graphical evidence of these events was available to him. A few representations of these events were available in political cartoons and on coins and medals but these were, almost certainly, not drawn by observers who had actually witnessed the events. There were two prints made by witnesses of the 1706 event but these were made for commercial reasons and not by trained astronomers. Then in 2012 Markus Heinz of the Berlin State Library discovered two paintings of the 1706 eclipse that were known to have existed but were thought lost. They were painted by a trained and skilful astronomer and observer, Maria Clara Eimmart, the daughter of the director of an observatory housed on a bastion of the walls of Nürnberg castle. The paintings were in excellent agreement with detailed text description of the event by Johann Philipp Wurzelbau (also in Nürnberg) and by French mathematician and cartographer Jean de Clapiès and astronomer François de Plantade who observed the same event from the Babote Tower in Montpellier. This confirmed Eddy&#x27;s conclusion about a weak and structureless corona during the Maunder minimum and agreed with simulations of the structureless F-corona, with no detected K-corona that is ordered by the magnetic field, as has been modelled for low coronal magnetic flux. A full discussion of these observations of the Maunder minimum corona and how the K-corona had partially returned by the time of the 1715 event is given by Hayakawa et al. (2020).

==Little Ice Age==
The Maunder Minimum roughly coincided with the middle part of the Little Ice Age, during which Europe and North America experienced colder than average temperatures. Whether there is a causal relationship, however, is still under evaluation. The current best hypothesis for the cause of the Little Ice Age is that it was the result of volcanic action. The onset of the Little Ice Age also occurred well before the beginning of the Maunder Minimum, and northern-hemisphere temperatures during the Maunder Minimum were not significantly different from the previous 80 years, suggesting a decline in solar activity was not the main causal driver of the Little Ice Age.

The correlation between low sunspot activity and cold winters in England has been analyzed using the longest existing surface temperature record, the Central England Temperature record. A potential explanation of this has been offered by observations by NASA&#x27;s Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment, which suggest that solar ultraviolet light output is more variable over the course of the solar cycle than scientists had previously thought. A 2011 study found that low solar activity was linked to jet stream behavior, resulting in mild winters in some places (southern Europe and Canada/Greenland) and colder winters in others (northern Europe and the United States). In Europe, examples of very cold winters are 1683–84, 1694–95, and the winter of 1708–09.

==Other observations==

Past solar activity may be recorded by various proxies, including carbon-14 and beryllium-10. These indicate lower solar activity during the Maunder Minimum. The scale of changes resulting in the production of carbon-14 in one cycle is small (about one percent of medium abundance) and can be taken into account when radiocarbon dating is used to determine the age of archaeological artifacts. The interpretation of the beryllium-10 and carbon-14 cosmogenic isotope abundance records stored in terrestrial reservoirs such as ice sheets and tree rings has been greatly aided by reconstructions of solar and heliospheric magnetic fields based on historic data on geomagnetic storm activity, which bridge the time gap between the end of the usable cosmogenic isotope data and the start of modern spacecraft data.

Other historical sunspot minima have been detected either directly or by the analysis of the cosmogenic isotopes; these include the Spörer Minimum (1450–1540), and less markedly the Dalton Minimum (1790–1820). In a 2012 study, sunspot minima have been detected by analysis of carbon-14 in lake sediments. In total, there seem to have been 18 periods of sunspot minima in the last 8,000 years, and studies indicate that the Sun currently spends up to a quarter of its time in these minima.

A paper based on an analysis of a drawing by John Flamsteed suggests that the Sun&#x27;s surface rotation slowed in the deep Maunder Minimum (1684).

During the Maunder Minimum aurorae had been observed seemingly normally, with a regular decadal-scale cycle. This is somewhat surprising because the later, and less deep, Dalton sunspot minimum is clearly seen in auroral occurrence frequency, at least at lower geomagnetic latitudes. Because geomagnetic latitude is an important factor in auroral occurrence, (lower-latitude aurorae requiring higher levels of solar-terrestrial activity) it becomes important to allow for population migration and other factors that may have influenced the number of reliable auroral observers at a given magnetic latitude for the earlier dates. Decadal-scale cycles during the Maunder Minimum can also be seen in the abundances of the beryllium-10 cosmogenic isotope (which unlike carbon-14 can be studied with annual resolution) but these appear to be in antiphase with any remnant sunspot activity. An explanation in terms of solar cycles in loss of solar magnetic flux was proposed in 2012.

The fundamental papers on the Maunder Minimum have been published in &quot;Case studies on the Spörer, Maunder and Dalton Minima&quot;.

<text>The sexual revolution, also known as the sexual liberation, was a social movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and interpersonal relationships throughout the developed Western world from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of sexual intercourse outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships, primarily marriage. The legalization of the pill as well as other forms of contraception, public nudity, pornography, premarital sex, homosexuality, masturbation, alternative forms of sexuality, and abortion all followed.

==Origins==
===First sexual revolution===

Several other periods in Western culture have been called the &quot;first sexual revolution&quot;, to which the 1960s revolution would be the second (or later). The term &quot;sexual revolution&quot; itself has been used since at least the late 1920s. The term appeared as early as 1929; the book &quot;Is Sex Necessary? Or, Why You Feel the Way You Do&quot; by James Thurber and E. B. White, has a chapter titled &quot;The Sexual Revolution: Being a Rather Complete Survey of the Entire Sexual Scene&quot;. According to Konstantin Dushenko, the term was in use in Soviet Russia in 1925.

When speaking of the sexual revolution, historians make a distinction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution (1870–1910), Victorian morality lost its universal appeal. However, it did not lead to the rise of a &quot;permissive society&quot;. Exemplary for this period is the rise and differentiation in forms of regulating sexuality.

Classics professor Kyle Harper uses the phrase &quot;first sexual revolution&quot; to refer to the displacement of the norms of sexuality in Ancient Rome with those of Christianity as it was adopted throughout the Roman Empire. Romans accepted and legalized prostitution, bisexuality, and pederasty. Male promiscuity was considered normal and healthy as long as masculinity was maintained, associated with being the penetrating partner. In contrast, female chastity was required for respectable women, to ensure the integrity of family bloodlines. These attitudes were replaced by Christian prohibitions on homosexual acts and any sex outside marriage, including with slaves and prostitutes.

History professor Faramerz Dabhoiwala cites the Age of Enlightenment—approximately the 18th century—as a major period of transition in the United Kingdom. During this time, the philosophy of liberalism developed and was popularized, and migration to cities increased opportunities for sex and made enforcement of rules more difficult than in small villages. Sexual misconduct in the Catholic Church undermined the credibility of religious authorities, and the rise of urban police forces helped distinguish crime from sin. Overall, toleration increased for heterosexual sex outside marriage, including prostitution, mistresses, and pre-marital sex. Though these acts were still condemned by many as libertine, infidelity became more often a civil matter than a criminal offense receiving capital punishment. Masturbation, homosexuality, and rape were generally less tolerated. Women went from being considered as lustful as men to passive partners, whose purity was important to reputation.

Commentators such as history professor Kevin F. White have used the phrase &quot;first sexual revolution&quot; to refer to the Roaring Twenties. Victorian Era attitudes were somewhat destabilized by World War I and alcohol prohibition in the United States. At the same time the women&#x27;s suffrage movement obtained voting rights, the subculture of the flapper girl included pre-marital sex and &quot;petting parties&quot;.

===Formation===
Indicators of non-traditional sexual behavior (e.g., gonorrhea incidence, births out of wedlock, and births to adolescents) began to rise dramatically in the mid-to-late 1950s. It brought about profound shifts in attitudes toward women&#x27;s sexuality, homosexuality, pre-marital sexuality, and the freedom of sexual expression.

Psychologists and scientists such as Wilhelm Reich and Alfred Kinsey influenced the changes. As well, changing mores were both stimulated by and reflected in literature and films, and by the social movements of the period, including the counterculture, the women&#x27;s movement, and the gay rights movement. The counterculture contributed to the awareness of radical cultural change that was the social matrix of the sexual revolution.

The sexual revolution was initiated by those who shared a belief in the detrimental impact of sexual repression, a view that had previously been argued by Wilhelm Reich, D. H. Lawrence, Sigmund Freud, and the Surrealist movement.

The counterculture wanted to explore the body and mind, and free the personal self from the moral and legal sexual confines of traditional American values. The sexual revolution sprung from a conviction that the erotic should be celebrated as a normal part of life, dodging religion, family, industrialized moral codes, and the state.

The development of the birth control pill in 1960 gave women access to easy and more reliable contraception. Another likely cause was a vast improvement in obstetrics, greatly reducing the number of women who died due to childbearing, thus increasing the life expectancy of women. A third, more indirect cause was the large number of children born in the 1940s and throughout the 1950s all over the Western world, as the &quot;Baby Boom Generation&quot;, many of whom would grow up in relatively prosperous and safe conditions, within a middle class on the rise and with better access to education and entertainment than ever before. By their demographic weight and their social and educational background, they came to trigger a shift in society towards more permissive and informalized attitudes.

The discovery of penicillin led to significant reductions in syphilis mortality, which, in turn, spurred an increase in non-traditional sex during the mid-to-late 1950s.

There was an increase in sexual encounters between unmarried adults. Divorce rates were dramatically increasing and marriage rates were significantly decreasing in this time period. The number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 4.3 million in 1960 to 9.7 million in 1976. Men and women sought to reshape marriage by experimenting with new practices consisting of open marriage, mate swapping, swinging, and communal sex. 

==Academic influences==
===Freudian school===
Sigmund Freud of Vienna believed human behavior was motivated by unconscious drives, primarily by the libido or &quot;Sexual Energy&quot;. Freud proposed to study how these unconscious drives were repressed and found expression through other cultural outlets. He called this therapy &quot;psychoanalysis&quot;.

While Freud&#x27;s ideas were sometimes ignored or provoked resistance within Viennese society, his ideas soon entered the discussions and working methods of anthropologists, artists and writers all over Europe, and from the 1920s in the United States. His conception of a primary sexual drive that would not be ultimately curbed by law, education or standards of decorum spelled a serious challenge to Victorian prudishness, and his theory of psychosexual development proposed a model for the development of sexual orientations and desires; children emerged from the Oedipus complex, a sexual desire towards their parent of the opposite sex. The idea of children having their parents as their early sexual targets was particularly shocking to Victorian and early 20th-century society.

According to Freud&#x27;s theory, in the earliest stage of a child&#x27;s psychosexual development, the oral stage, the mother&#x27;s breast became the formative source of all later erotic sensation. Much of his research remains widely contested by professionals in the field, though it has spurred critical developments in the humanities.

Two anarchist and Marxist proponents of Freud, Otto Gross and Wilhelm Reich (who famously coined the phrase &quot;Sexual Revolution&quot;), developed a sociology of sex in the 1910s through the 1930s in which the animal-like competitive reproductive behavior was seen as a legacy of ancestral human evolution reflecting in every social relation, as per the Freudian interpretation. Hence, the liberation of sexual behavior was considered by them to be a means to social revolution.

===Mead&#x27;s &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot;===

The 1928 publication of anthropologist Margaret Mead&#x27;s &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot; brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Mead&#x27;s ethnography focused on the psychosexual development of adolescents in Samoa. She recorded that their adolescence was not, in fact, a time of &quot;storm and stress&quot; as Erikson&#x27;s stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood.

Mead&#x27;s findings were later criticized by anthropologist Derek Freeman, who investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society.

===Unwin&#x27;s &quot;Sex and Culture&quot;===
===Kinsey and Masters and Johnson===

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Alfred C. Kinsey published two surveys of modern sexual behavior. In 1948 Kinsey published the book &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot;. He followed this five years later with &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot;. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.

Kinsey based his findings in both these books on interviews that he and his team of researchers conducted with thousands of Americans, beginning in the 1930s. The interviews were extensive and could last for several hours; they were supplemented by diaries and other documents that the interviewees were willing to have copied, and sometimes film of them masturbation or having sex with others, if they volunteered and it was practical. Kinsey found in the course of these interviews that many sexual behaviors which had previously been seen as marginal or &quot;abnormal&quot; were in fact more common than previously recognized and were part of the normal spectrum of human sexual behavior; for instance, he is the source of the widely quoted statistic that 4% of the male population is primarily homosexual. He advocated using this information to reform sex-related laws, which at the time were often draconian (for example two men having consensual sex in private was considered a crime).

Kinsey&#x27;s books became bestsellers when published, and laid the groundwork for researchers William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson to study the nature and scope of sexual practices among young Americans. Their books, &quot;Human Sexual Response&quot; and &quot;Human Sexual Inadequacy&quot;, published in 1966 and 1970 respectively, were also best-sellers, and are now considered classic texts in the field.

==Popular culture==

===Erotic novels===

In the United States in the years 1959 through 1966, bans on three books with explicit erotic content were challenged and overturned. This also occurred in the United Kingdom starting with the 1959 Obscene Publications Act and reaching a peak with the &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; court case.

Prior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, the United States Customs Service banned James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; by refusing to allow it to be imported into the United States. The Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston&#x27;s Watch and Ward Society, a largely Protestant creation inspired by Anthony Comstock, made &quot;banned in Boston&quot; a national by-word.

In 1959 Grove Press published an unexpurgated version of the 1928 novel &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; by D. H. Lawrence. The U.S.  Post Office confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer Charles Rembar sued the New York City Postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal.

Henry Miller&#x27;s 1934 novel, &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the Obelisk Press in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. In 1961 Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and dozens of booksellers were sued for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the U.S.  Supreme Court&#x27;s 1964 decision in &quot;Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein&quot;.

In 1963 Putnam published John Cleland&#x27;s 1750 novel &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;. Charles Rembar appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S.  Supreme Court and won. In &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot;, 383  U.S. 413, the court ruled that sex was &quot;a great and mysterious motive force in human life&quot;, and that its expression in literature was protected by the First Amendment.

By permitting the publication of &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;, the U.S.  Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966  decision &quot;the end of obscenity&quot;. Only books primarily appealing to &quot;prurient interest&quot; could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is &quot;utterly without redeeming social importance&quot;—meaning that a work with any redeeming social importance or literary merit was arguably not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could &quot;deprave and corrupt&quot; some readers.

===Explicit sex on screen and stage===

Swedish filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Vilgot Sjöman contributed to sexual liberation with sexually themed films that challenged conservative international standards. The 1951 film &quot;Hon dansade en sommar&quot; (&quot;She Danced One Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness&quot;) displayed explicit nudity, including bathing in a lake.

This film, as well as Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Sommaren med Monika&quot; (&quot;The Summer with Monika&quot;, 1951) and &quot;Tystnaden (The Silence&quot;, 1963), caused an international uproar, not least in the United States, where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sjöman&#x27;s film &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot;, also was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, &quot;491&quot;, highlighted homosexuality. &quot;Kärlekens språk&quot; (&quot;The Language of Love&quot;) was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film.

From these films, the myth of &quot;Swedish sin&quot; (licentiousness and seductive nudity) arose. The image of &quot;hot love and cold people&quot; emerged, with sexual liberalism seen as part of the modernization process that, by breaking down traditional borders, would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires. In Sweden and nearby countries at the time, these films, by virtue of being made by directors who had established themselves as leading names in their generation, helped delegitimize the idea of habitually demanding that films should avoid overtly sexual subject matter. The films eventually progressed the public&#x27;s attitude toward sex, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others.

===Fashion===

The monokini, also known as a &quot;topless bikini&quot; or &quot;unikini&quot;, was designed by Rudi Gernreich in 1964, consisting of only a brief, close-fitting bottom and two thin straps; it was the first women&#x27;s topless swimsuit. Gernreich&#x27;s revolutionary and controversial design included a bottom that &quot;extended from the midriff to the upper thigh&quot; and was &quot;held up by shoestring laces that make a halter around the neck.&quot; Some credit Gernreich&#x27;s design with initiating, or describe it as a symbol of, the 1960s sexual revolution.

===Nonfiction===
The court decisions that legalized the publication of &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear more often. These books were factual and in fact, educational, made available in mainstream bookstores and mail-order book clubs to a mainstream readership, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. Earlier books such as &quot;What Every Girl Should Know&quot; (Margaret Sanger, 1920) and &quot;A Marriage Manual&quot; (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the silence and, by the 1950s, in the United States, it had become rare for women to go into their wedding nights not knowing what to expect.

The open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was revolutionary. There were practices that some had heard of, but many adults did not know if they were realities or fantasies found only in pornographic books. The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980 book by Irene Kassorla, that &quot;Nice Girls Do – And Now You Can Too&quot;.

In 1962, Helen Gurley Brown published &quot;Sex and the Single Girl: The Unmarried Woman&#x27;s Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.&quot;

In 1969 Joan Garrity, identifying herself only as &quot;J.&quot;, published &quot;The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman&quot;, with information on exercises to improve the dexterity of one&#x27;s tongue and how to have anal sex.

The same year saw the appearance of David Reuben&#x27;s book &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot;. Despite the dignity of Reuben&#x27;s medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone.

In 1970 the Boston Women&#x27;s Health Collective published &quot;Women and Their Bodies&quot;, reissued a year later as &quot;Our Bodies, Ourselves&quot;). Though not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.

Alex Comfort&#x27;s &quot;The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making&quot; appeared in 1972. In later editions, Comfort&#x27;s exuberance was tamed in response to AIDS.

In 1975 Will McBride&#x27;s &quot;Zeig Mal!&quot; (Show Me!), written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescent sexual discovery and exploration, it scandalized others and was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. The book was followed in 1989 by &quot;Zeig Mal Mehr!&quot; (&quot;Show Me More!&quot;).

===New emergence of pornography===

The somewhat more open and commercial circulation of pornography was a new phenomenon. Pornography operated as a form of &quot;cultural critique&quot; insofar as it transgresses societal conventions. Manuel Castells claims that the online communities, which emerged (from the 1980s) around early bulletin-board systems, originated from the ranks of those who had been part of the counterculture movements and alternative way of life emerging out of the sexual revolution.

Lynn Hunt points out that early modern &quot;pornography&quot; (18th century) is marked by a &quot;preponderance of female narrators&quot;, that the women were portrayed as independent, determined, financially successful (though not always socially successful and recognized) and scornful of the new ideals of female virtue and domesticity, and not objectification of women&#x27;s bodies as many view pornography today. The sexual revolution was not unprecedented in identifying sex as a site of political potential and social culture. It was suggested that the interchangeability of bodies within pornography had radical implications for the meaning of gender differences, roles and norms.

In 1971 &quot;Playboy&quot; stopped airbrushing pubic hair out of its centerfold picture spreads as part of a &quot;daring antitheistic stunt&quot;, causing the magazine to hit its all-time peak circulation of more than seven million copies in 1972 and men started having more choices when it came to magazines.

In 1972 &quot;Deep Throat&quot; became a popular movie for heterosexual couples. The movie played all over America and was the first porn movie to earn a gross of a million dollars.

Pornography was less stigmatized by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted sexual intercourse as entertainment. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazines, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures felt safe expressing their fantasies.

Some figures in the feminist movement, such as Andrea Dworkin, challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic or &quot;urban men&#x27;s&quot; magazines. Other feminists such as Betty Dodson went on to found the pro-sex feminist movement in response to anti-pornography campaigns.

In India, an organization named Indians For Sexual Liberties is advocating the legalization of the porn business in India. The organization&#x27;s founder, Laxman Singh, questioned the reasoning behind deeming as illegal the depiction of legal acts.

===The &quot;Playboy&quot; culture===
In 1953, Chicago resident Hugh Hefner founded &quot;Playboy&quot;, a magazine which aimed to target males between the ages of 21 and 45. The coverpage and nude centerfold in the first edition featured Marilyn Monroe, then a rising sex symbol. Featuring cartoons, interviews, short fiction, Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy Philosophy&quot; and unclothed female &quot;Playmates&quot; posing provocatively, the magazine became immensely successful.

In 1960, Hefner expanded Playboy Enterprises, opening the first Playboy Club in Chicago, which grew to a chain of nightclubs and resorts. The private clubs offered relaxation for members, who were waited on by Playboy Bunnies.

While Hefner claimed his company contributed to America&#x27;s more liberal attitude towards sex, others believe he simply exploited it.

===Pornographic film===
In 1969, &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, directed by Andy Warhol, was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. The film helped inaugurate the &quot;porno chic&quot; phenomenon in modern American culture. According to Warhol, &quot;Blue Movie&quot; was a major influence in the making of &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after &quot;Blue Movie&quot; was made.

In 1970, &quot;Mona the Virgin Nymph&quot; became the second film to gain wide release. The third, &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, despite being rudimentary by the standards of mainstream filmmaking, achieved major box office success, following mentions by Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and Bob Hope on television as well. In 1973, the far-more-accomplished (though still low-budget) &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; was the seventh-most-successful film of the year, and was well received by major media, including a favorable review by film critic Roger Ebert.

In 1976, &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; (based on the play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; by George Bernard Shaw) was released theatrically and is considered by Toni Bentley the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of &quot;the golden age of porn.&quot;

By the mid-1970s and through the 1980s, new sexual liberties were being exploited by big businesses looking to capitalize on an increasingly polarized society, with the advent of public and hardcore pornography. 

==Modern revolutions==

The Industrial Revolution during the nineteenth century and the growth of science and technology, medicine and health care, resulted in better contraceptives being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of rubber made possible the design and production of condoms that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent pregnancy at little cost. Advances in chemistry, pharmacology, and biology, and human physiology led to the discovery and perfection of the first oral contraceptives, popularly known as &quot;the Pill.&quot;

All these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in the world literacy and a decline in religious observance. Old values such as the biblical notion of &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the lifestyles of progressive modernizing cultures.

Another contribution that helped bring about this modern revolution of sexual freedom were the writings of Herbert Marcuse and Wilhelm Reich, who took the philosophy of Karl Marx and similar philosophers.

&quot;No-fault&quot; unilateral divorce became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

The women&#x27;s movement redefined sexuality, not in terms of simply pleasing men but recognizing women&#x27;s sexual satisfaction and sexual desire. &quot;The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm&quot; (1970) by Anne Koedt illustrates an understanding of a women&#x27;s sexual anatomy including evidence for the clitoral orgasm, arguing against Freud&#x27;s &quot;assumptions of women as inferior appendage to man, and her consequent social and psychological role.&quot; The women&#x27;s movement was able to develop lesbian feminism, freedom from heterosexual act, and freedom from reproduction. Feminist Betty Friedan published the &quot;Feminine Mystique&quot; in 1963, concerning the many frustrations women had with their lives and with separate spheres which established a pattern of inequality.
The Gay Rights Movement started when the Stonewall riots of 1969 crystallized a broad grass-roots mobilization. New gay liberationist gave political meaning to &quot;coming out&quot; by extending the psychological-personal process into public life. During the 1950s the most feared thing of the homosexual culture was &quot;coming out&quot;, the homosexual culture of the 1950s did everything they could to help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s research on homosexuality alleged that 39% of the unmarried male population had had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age.

==Feminism and sexual liberation==
Since the beginning of the sexual liberation movement in the Western world, which coincided with second-wave feminism and the women&#x27;s liberation movement initiated in the early 1960s, new religious movements and alternative spiritualities such as Modern Paganism and the New Age began to grow and spread across the globe alongside their intersection with the sexual liberation movement and the counterculture of the 1960s, and exhibited characteristic features, such as the embrace of alternative lifestyles, unconventional dress, rejection of Abrahamic religions and their conservative social mores, use of cannabis and other recreational drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humble or self-imposed poverty, and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; sexual behavior. The sexual liberation movement was aided by feminist ideologues in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding female sexuality, male sexuality, and queer sexuality. Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women, as well as support for women&#x27;s right to choose their sexual partners free of outside interference or societal judgment, were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective. Since during the early stages of feminism, women&#x27;s liberation was often equated with sexual liberation rather than associated with it. Many feminist thinkers believed that assertion of the primacy of sexuality would be a major step towards the ultimate goal of women&#x27;s liberation, thus women were urged to initiate sexual advances, enjoy sex and experiment with new forms of sexuality.

The feminist movements insisted and focused on the sexual liberation for women, both physical and psychological. The pursuit of sexual pleasure for women was the core ideology, which subsequently was to set the foundation for female independence. Although whether or not sexual freedom should be a feminist issue is currently a much-debated topic, the feminist movement overtly defines itself as the movement for social, political, and economic equality of men and women. Feminist movements are also involved the fight against sexism and since sexism is a highly complex notion, it is difficult to separate the feminist critique toward sexism from its fight against sexual oppression.

The feminist movement has helped create a social climate in which LGBT people and women are increasingly able to be open and free with their sexuality, which enabled a spiritual liberation of sorts with regards to sex. Rather than being forced to hide their sexual desires or feelings, women and LGBT people have gained and continue to gain increased freedom in this area. Consequently, the feminist movement to end sexual oppression has and continues to directly contribute to the sexual liberation movement.

==Contraception==
As birth control became widely accessible, men and women began to have more choice in the matter of having children than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable latex condoms for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the Comstock laws in 1936 set the stage for the promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the diaphragm and cervical cap; the 1960s introduction of the IUD and oral contraceptives for women gave a sense of freedom from barrier contraception. The Catholic Church under Pope Paul VI (1968) published &quot;Humanae vitae&quot; (Of Human Life), which was a declaration that banned the use of artificial contraception. Churches allowed for the rhythm method, which was a method of regulating fertility that pushed men and women to take advantage of the &quot;natural cycles&quot; of female fertility, during which women were &quot;naturally infertile.&quot; The opposition of Churches (e.g. &quot;Humanae vitae&quot;) led people who felt alienated from or not represented by religion to form parallel movements of secularization and exile from religion. Women gained much greater access to birth control in the &quot;Griswold&quot; &quot;girls world&quot; decision in 1965.

The 1965 Supreme Court case &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; ruled that the prohibition of contraception was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated peoples&#x27; rights to marital privacy. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s, the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments. The &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; case and subsequent birth control movements created a precedent for later cases granting rights to birth control for unmarried couples &quot;(Eisenstadt v. Baird), 1972)&quot;, rights to abortion for any woman (&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, 1973), and the right to contraception for juveniles (Carey v. Population Services International, 1977). The Griswold case was also influential in and cited as precedent for landmark cases dealing with the right to homosexual relations (&quot;Lawrence v. Texas,&quot; 2003) and the right to same-sex marriage (&quot;Obergefell v. Hodges,&quot; 2015).

==Free love==

Free love is a social movement that accepts all forms of love. The movement&#x27;s initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, birth control, and adultery. It stated that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.

Free love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations faced increased pushback in the mid-1980s, when the public first became aware of AIDS, a deadly sexually-transmitted disease.

==Non-marital sex==
Premarital sex, heavily stigmatized for some time, became more widely accepted. The increased availability of birth control (and the legalization of abortion in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children. By the mid-1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.

Central to the change was the development of relationships between unmarried adults, which resulted in earlier sexual experimentation reinforced by a later age of marriage. On average, Americans were gaining sexual experience before entering into monogamous relationships. The increasing divorce rate and the decreasing stigma attached to divorce during this era also contributed to sexual experimentation. By 1971, more than 75% of Americans thought that premarital sex was acceptable, a threefold increase from the 1950s, and the number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 1960 to 1976. Americans were becoming less and less interested in getting married and settling down and as well less interested in monogamous relationships. In 1971, 35% of the country said they thought marriage was obsolete.

The idea of marriage being outdated came from the development of casual sex between Americans. With the development of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion in 1973, there was little threat of unwanted children out of wedlock. Also, during this time every known sexually transmitted disease was readily treatable.

Swinger clubs were organizing in places ranging from the informal suburban home to disco-sized emporiums that offered a range of sexual possibilities with multiple partners. In New York City in 1977, Larry Levenson opened Plato&#x27;s Retreat, which eventually shut down in 1985 under regular close scrutiny by public health authorities.

==Legacy==
Fraenkel (1992) believes that the &quot;sexual revolution&quot;, which the West supposedly experienced in the late 1960s, is a misconception/misnomer, and that sex is never actually enjoyed freely as such, being rather &quot;observed&quot; in all fields of culture: a stance adopted toward human behavior referable to the concept of &quot;repressive desublimation&quot;. According to this concept or interpretation (first evolved by Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse), the &#x27;sexual revolution&#x27; would be an instance of a conservative force masquerading under the guise of liberation – a force sapping energies (here sexual) which would otherwise be available for a true social critique of a given behavior – and thus an impediment to any real political change which might emancipate the individual from &quot;totalitarian democracy&quot;. (See also Bread and circuses, False consciousness and Frankfurt School.) Put baldly, the pursuit of &quot;sexual freedom&quot; may be construed as a distraction from the pursuit of &quot;actual&quot; freedom.

Allyn argues that the sexual optimism of the 1960s waned with the economic crises of the 1970s, the massive commercialization of sex, increasing reports of child exploitation, disillusionment with the counter-culture and the New Left, and a combined left-right backlash against sexual liberation as an ideal. The discovery of herpes escalated anxieties rapidly and set the stage for the nation&#x27;s panicked response to AIDS.

Among radical feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on monogamy, had been largely gained by men at women&#x27;s expense. In &quot;Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution&quot;, Sheila Jeffreys asserted that the sexual revolution on men&#x27;s terms contributed less to women&#x27;s freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, feminist sex wars broke out due to disagreements on pornography, on prostitution, and on BDSM, as well as sexuality in general.

Although the rate of teenage sexual activity is hard to record, the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in Western countries such as Canada and the UK have seen a steady decline since the 1990s. For example, in 1991 there were 61.8 children born per 1,000 teenage girls in the United States. By 2013, this number had declined to 26.6 births per 1,000 teenage girls.

Women and men who lived with each other without marriage sought &quot;palimony&quot; equal to the alimony. Teenagers assumed their right to a sexual life with whomever they pleased, and bathers fought to be topless or nude at beaches.

<text>The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), whose members are nicknamed &quot;Wobblies&quot;, is an international labor union founded in Chicago in 1905. The nickname&#x27;s origin is uncertain. Its ideology combines general unionism with industrial unionism, as it is a general union, subdivided between the various industries which employ its members. The philosophy and tactics of the IWW are described as &quot;revolutionary industrial unionism&quot;, with ties to socialist, syndicalist, and anarchist labor movements.

In the 1910s and early 1920s, the IWW achieved many of its short-term goals, particularly in the American West, and cut across traditional guild and union lines to organize workers in a variety of trades and industries. At their peak in August 1917, IWW membership was estimated at more than 150,000, with active wings in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. However, the extremely high rate of IWW membership turnover during this era (estimated at 133% between 1905 and 1915) makes it difficult for historians to state membership totals with any certainty, as workers tended to join the IWW in large numbers for relatively short periods (&quot;e.g.&quot;, during labor strikes and periods of generalized economic distress).

Membership declined dramatically in the late 1910s and 1920s. There were conflicts with other labor groups, particularly the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which regarded the IWW as too radical, while the IWW regarded the AFL as too conservative and opposed their decision to divide workers on the basis of their trades. Membership also declined due to government crackdowns on radical, anarchist, and socialist groups during the First Red Scare after World War I. In Canada, the IWW was outlawed by the federal government by an Order in Council on September 24, 1918.

Likely the most decisive factor in the decline in IWW membership and influence was a 1924 schism in the organization, from which the IWW never fully recovered. During the 1950s, the IWW faced near-extinction due to persecution under the Second Red Scare, although the union would later experience a resurgence in the context of the New Left in the 1960s and 1970s.

The IWW promotes the concept of &quot;One Big Union&quot;, and contends that all workers should be united as a social class to supplant capitalism and wage labor with industrial democracy. It is known for the Wobbly Shop model of workplace democracy, through which workers elect their own managers and other forms of grassroots democracy (self-management) are implemented. The IWW does not require its members to work in a represented workplace, nor does it exclude membership in another labor union.

==United States==
===1905–1950===
====Foundation====
The first meeting to plan the IWW was held in Chicago in 1904. The seven attendees were Clarence Smith and Thomas J. Hagerty of the American Labor Union, George Estes and W. L. Hall of the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees, Isaac Cowan of the U.S. branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, William E. Trautmann of the United Brewery Workmen and Julian E. Bagley WW1 veteran and author. Eugene Debs, formerly of the American Railway Union, and Charles O. Sherman of the United Metal Workers were involved but did not attend the meeting.

The IWW was officially founded in Chicago, Illinois in June 1905. A convention was held of 200 socialists, anarchists, Marxists (primarily members of the Socialist Party of America and Socialist Labor Party of America), and radical trade unionists from all over the United States (mainly the Western Federation of Miners) who strongly opposed the policies of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The IWW opposed the AFL&#x27;s acceptance of capitalism and its refusal to include unskilled workers in craft unions.

The convention had taken place on June 27, 1905, and was referred to as the &quot;Industrial Congress&quot; or the &quot;Industrial Union Convention&quot;. It was later known as the First Annual Convention of the IWW.

The IWW&#x27;s founders included William D. (&quot;Big Bill&quot;) Haywood, James Connolly, Daniel De Leon, Eugene V. Debs, Thomas Hagerty, Lucy Parsons, Mary Harris &quot;Mother&quot; Jones, Frank Bohn, William Trautmann, Vincent Saint John, Ralph Chaplin, and many others.

The IWW aimed to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class; its motto was &quot;an injury to one is an injury to all&quot;. They saw this as an improvement upon the Knights of Labor&#x27;s creed, &quot;an injury to one is the concern of all&quot; which the Knights had spoken out in the 1880s. In particular, the IWW was organized because of the belief among many unionists, socialists, anarchists, Marxists, and radicals that the AFL not only had failed to effectively organize the U.S. working class, but it was causing separation rather than unity within groups of workers by organizing according to narrow craft principles. The Wobblies believed that all workers should organize as a class, a philosophy that is still reflected in the Preamble to the current IWW Constitution:

The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.

Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.

We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the ever growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers.

These conditions can be changed and the interest of the working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus making an injury to one an injury to all.

Instead of the conservative motto, &quot;A fair day&#x27;s wage for a fair day&#x27;s work,&quot; we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, &quot;Abolition of the wage system.&quot;

It is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must be organized, not only for everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old.

One of the IWW&#x27;s most important contributions to the labor movement and broader push of social justice was that, when founded, it was the only American union to welcome all workers, including women, immigrants, African Americans and Asians, into the same organization. Many of its early members were immigrants, and some, such as Carlo Tresca, Joe Hill and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, rose to prominence in the leadership. Finns formed a sizable portion of the immigrant IWW membership. &quot;Conceivably, the number of Finns belonging to the I.W.W. was somewhere between five and ten thousand.&quot; The Finnish-language newspaper of the IWW, &quot;Industrialisti&quot;, published in Duluth, Minnesota, a center of the mining industry, was the union&#x27;s only daily paper. At its peak, it ran 10,000 copies per issue. Another Finnish-language Wobbly publication was the monthly &quot;Tie Vapauteen&quot; (&quot;Road to Freedom&quot;). Also of note was the Finnish IWW educational institute, the Work People&#x27;s College in Duluth, and the Finnish Labour Temple in Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada, which served as the IWW Canadian administration for several years. Further, many Swedish immigrants, particularly those blacklisted after the 1909 Swedish General Strike, joined the IWW and set up similar cultural institutions around the Scandinavian Socialist Clubs. This in turn exerted a political influence on the Swedish labor movement&#x27;s left, that in 1910 formed the Syndicalist union SAC which soon contained a minority seeking to mimick the tactics and strategies of the IWW.

====Organization====


The IWW first attracted attention in Goldfield, Nevada, in 1906 and during the Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909.

By 1912, the organization had around 25,000 members.

====Geography====
In its first decades, the IWW created more than 900 unions located in more than 350 cities and towns in 38 states and territories of the United States and five Canadian provinces. Throughout the country, there were 90 newspapers and periodicals affiliated with the IWW, published in 19 different languages. Cartoons were a major part of IWW publications. Produced by unpaid rank and file members they satirised the union&#x27;s opponents and helped spread its messages in various forms, including &#x27;stickerettes&#x27;. The most well-known IWW cartoon character, Mr Block, was created by Ernest Riebe and was made the subject of a Joe Hill song. Members of the IWW were active throughout the country and were involved in the Seattle General Strike of 1919, were arrested or killed in the Everett Massacre, organized among Mexican workers in the Southwest, and became a large and powerful longshoremen&#x27;s union in Philadelphia.

====IWW versus AFL Carpenters, Goldfield, Nevada, 1906-1907====
Resisting IWW domination in the gold mining boom town of Goldfield, Nevada was the AFL-affiliated Carpenters Union. In March 1907, the IWW demanded that the mines deny employment to AFL Carpenters, which led mine owners to challenge the IWW. The mine owners banded together and pledged not to employ any IWW members. The mine and business owners of Goldfield staged a lockout, vowing to remain shut until they had broken the power of the IWW. The lockout prompted a split within the Goldfield workforce, between conservative and radical union members.

====Haywood trial and Western Federation of Miners exit====
Leaders of the Western Federation of Miners such as Bill Haywood and Vincent St. John were instrumental in forming the IWW, and the WFM affiliated with the new union organization shortly after the IWW was formed. The WFM became the IWW&#x27;s &quot;mining section&quot;. Many in the rank and file of the WFM were uncomfortable with the open radicalism of the IWW and wanted the WFM to maintain its independence. Schisms between the WFM and IWW had emerged at the annual IWW convention in 1906, when a majority of WFM delegates walked out.

When WFM executives Bill Haywood, George Pettibone, and Charles Moyer were accused of complicity in the murder of former Idaho governor Frank Steunenberg, the IWW used the case to raise funds and support and paid for the legal defense. Even the not guilty verdicts worked against the IWW, because the IWW was deprived of martyrs, and at the same time, a large portion of the public remained convinced of the guilt of the accused.

Bill Haywood for a time remained a member of both organizations. His murder trial had made Haywood a celebrity, and he was in demand as a speaker for the WFM. His increasingly radical speeches became more at odds with the WFM, and in April 1908, the WFM announced that the union had ended Haywood&#x27;s role as a union representative. Haywood left the WFM and devoted all his time to organizing for the IWW.

Historian Vernon H. Jensen has asserted that the IWW had a &quot;rule or ruin&quot; policy, under which it attempted to wreck local unions which it could not control. From 1908 to 1921, Jensen and others have written, the IWW attempted to win power in WFM locals which had once formed the federation&#x27;s backbone. When it could not do so, IWW agitators undermined WFM locals, which caused the national union to shed nearly half its membership.

====IWW versus the Western Federation of Miners====
The Western Federation of Miners left the IWW in 1907, but the IWW wanted the WFM back. The WFM had made up about a third of the IWW membership, and the western miners were tough union men, and good allies in a labor dispute. In 1908, Vincent St. John tried to organize a stealth takeover of the WFM. He wrote to WFM organizer Albert Ryan, encouraging him to find reliable IWW sympathizers at each WFM local, and have them appointed delegates to the annual convention by pretending to share whatever opinions of that local needed to become a delegate. Once at the convention, they could vote in a pro-IWW slate. St. Vincent promised: &quot;once we can control the officers of the WFM for the IWW, the big bulk of the membership will go with them.&quot; But the takeover did not succeed.

According to several historians, the 1913 El Paso smelters&#x27; strike marked one of the first instances of direct competition between the IWW and the WFM, as the two unions competed to organize workers on strike against the American Smelting and Refining Company&#x27;s local smelter. In 1914, Butte, Montana, erupted into a series of riots as miners dissatisfied with the Western Federation of Miners local at Butte formed a new union, and demanded that all miners join the new union, or be subject to beatings or worse. Although the new rival union had no affiliation with the IWW, it was widely seen as IWW-inspired. The leadership of the new union contained many who were members of the IWW or agreed with the IWW&#x27;s methods and objectives. The new union failed to supplant the WFM, and the ongoing fight between the two resulted in the copper mines of Butte, longtime union strongholds for the WFM, becoming open shops, and the mine owners recognized no union from 1914 until 1934.

====Versus United Mine Workers, Scranton, Pennsylvania, 1916====
The IWW clashed with the United Mine Workers union in April 1916, when the IWW picketed the anthracite mines around Scranton, Pennsylvania, intending, by persuasion or force, to keep UMWA members from going to work. The IWW considered the UMWA too reactionary, because the United Mine Workers negotiated contracts with the mine owners for fixed time periods; the IWW considered that contracts hindered their revolutionary goals. In what a contemporary writer pointed out was a complete reversal of their usual policy, UMWA officials called for police to protect United Mine Workers members who wished to cross the picket lines. The Pennsylvania State Police arrived in force, prevented picket line violence, and allowed the UMWA members to peacefully pass through the IWW picket lines.

====Bisbee Deportation====
In November 1916, the 10th convention of the IWW authorized an organizing drive in the Arizona copper mines. Copper was a vital war commodity, so mines were working day and night. During the first months of 1917, thousands joined the Metal Mine Workers&#x27; Union #800. The focus of the organizing drive was Bisbee, Arizona, a small town near the Mexican border. Nearly 5000 miners worked in Bisbee&#x27;s mines. On June 27, 1917, Bisbee&#x27;s miners went on strike. The strike was effective and non-violent. Demands included the doubling of pay for surface workers, most of them recent immigrants from Mexico, as well as changes in working conditions to make the mines safer. The six-hour day was raised agitationally but held in abeyance. In the early hours of July 12, hundreds of armed vigilantes rounded up nearly two thousand strikers, of whom 1186 were deported in cattle cars and dumped in the desert of New Mexico. In the following days, hundreds more were ordered to leave. The strike was broken at gunpoint.

====Other organizing drives====

Between 1915 and 1917, the IWW&#x27;s Agricultural Workers Organization (AWO) organized more than a hundred thousand migratory farm workers throughout the Midwest and western United States.

Building on the success of the AWO, the IWW&#x27;s Lumber Workers Industrial Union (LWIU) used similar tactics to organize lumberjacks and other timber workers, both in the deep South and the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada, between 1917 and 1924. The IWW lumber strike of 1917 led to the eight-hour day and vastly improved working conditions in the Pacific Northwest. Though mid-century historians credited the US Government and &quot;forward thinking lumber magnates&quot; for agreeing to such reforms, an IWW strike forced these concessions.

Where the IWW did win strikes, such as in Lawrence, they often found it hard to hold onto their gains. The IWW of 1912 disdained collective bargaining agreements and preached instead the need for constant struggle against the boss on the shop floor. It proved difficult to maintain that sort of revolutionary enthusiasm against employers. In Lawrence, the IWW lost nearly all of its membership in the years after the strike, as the employers wore down their employees&#x27; resistance and eliminated many of the strongest union supporters. In 1938, the IWW voted to allow contracts with employers.

====Government suppression====

The IWW&#x27;s efforts were met with &quot;unparalleled&quot; resistance from Federal, state and local governments in America; from company management and labor spies, and from groups of citizens functioning as vigilantes. In 1914, Wobbly Joe Hill (born Joel Hägglund) was accused of murder in Utah and, on what many regarded as limited and insufficient evidence, was executed in 1915. On November 5, 1916, at Everett, Washington, a group of deputized businessmen led by Sheriff Donald McRae attacked Wobblies on the steamer &quot;Verona&quot;, killing at least five union members (six more were never accounted for and probably were lost in Puget Sound). Two members of the police force—one a regular officer and another a deputized citizen from the National Guard Reserve—were killed, probably by &quot;friendly fire&quot;. At least five Everett civilians were wounded.

Many IWW members opposed United States participation in World War I. The organization passed a resolution against the war at its convention in November 1916. This echoed the view, expressed at the IWW&#x27;s founding convention, that war represents struggles among capitalists in which the rich become richer, and the working poor all too often die at the hands of other workers.

An IWW newspaper, the &quot;Industrial Worker&quot;, wrote just before the U.S. declaration of war: &quot;Capitalists of America, we will fight against you, not for you! There is not a power in the world that can make the working class fight if they refuse.&quot; Yet when a declaration of war was passed by the U.S. Congress in April 1917, the IWW&#x27;s general secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood became determined that the organization should adopt a low profile in order to avoid perceived threats to its existence. The printing of anti-war stickers was discontinued, stockpiles of existing anti-war documents were put into storage, and anti-war propagandizing ceased as official union policy. After much debate on the General Executive Board, with Haywood advocating a low profile and GEB member Frank Little championing continued agitation, Ralph Chaplin brokered a compromise agreement. A statement was issued that denounced the war, but IWW members were advised to channel their opposition through the legal mechanisms of conscription. They were advised to register for the draft, marking their claims for exemption &quot;IWW, opposed to war.&quot;

During World War I, the U.S. government moved strongly against the IWW. On September 5, 1917, U.S. Department of Justice agents made simultaneous raids on dozens of IWW meeting halls across the country. Minutes books, correspondence, mailing lists, and publications were seized, with the U.S. Department of Justice removing five tons of material from the IWW&#x27;s General Office in Chicago alone.

Based in large measure on the documents seized September 5, one hundred and sixty-six IWW leaders were indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in Chicago for conspiring to hinder the draft, encourage desertion, and intimidate others in connection with labor disputes, under the new Espionage Act. One hundred and one went on trial en masse before Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis in 1918. Their lawyer was George Vanderveer of Seattle.

In 1917, during an incident known as the Tulsa Outrage, a group of black-robed Knights of Liberty tarred and feathered seventeen members of the IWW in Oklahoma. The attack was cited as revenge for the Green Corn Rebellion, a preemptive attack caused by fear of an impending attack on the oil fields and as punishment for not supporting the war effort. The IWW members had been turned over to the Knights of Liberty by local authorities after they were beaten, arrested at their headquarters and convicted of the crime of vagrancy. Five other men who testified in defense of the Wobblies were also fined by the court and subjected to the same torture and humiliations at the hands of the Knights of Liberty.

In 1919, an Armistice Day parade by the American Legion in Centralia, Washington, turned into a fight between legionnaires and IWW members in which four legionnaires were shot. Which side initiated the violence of the Centralia massacre is disputed, though there had been previous attacks on the IWW hall and businessmen&#x27;s association had made threats against union members. A number of IWWs were arrested, one of whom, Wesley Everest, was lynched by a mob that night.

A bronze plaque honoring the IWW members imprisoned and lynched following the Centralia Tragedy was dedicated in the city&#x27;s George Washington Park on November 11, 2023. A request was delivered to Washington Governor Inslee requesting posthumous pardons for the eight IWW members who were convicted. A rededication was held in June 2024 after the plaque was installed on a granite block base. The color and carved style was an intentional match of the base of the American Legion memorial, The Sentinel. The $20,000 funding for the overall project, and the labor involved, was done mostly by union organizations or workers.

====Organizational schism and aftermath====
IWW quickly recovered from the setbacks of 1919 and 1920, with membership peaking in 1923 (58,300 estimated by dues paid per capita, though membership was likely somewhat higher as the union tolerated delinquent members). But recurring internal debates, especially between those who sought either to centralize or decentralize the organization, ultimately brought about the IWW&#x27;s 1924 schism.

The twenties witnessed the defection of hundreds of Wobbly leaders (including Harrison George, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, John Reed, George Hardy, Charles Ashleigh, Earl Browder and, in his Soviet exile, Bill Haywood) and, following a path recounted by Fred Beal, thousands of Wobbly rank-and-filers to the Communists and Communist organizations.

At the beginning of the 1949 Smith Act trials, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was disappointed when prosecutors indicted fewer CPUSA members than he had hoped, and—recalling the arrests and convictions of over one hundred IWW leaders in 1917—complained to the Justice Department, stating, &quot;the IWW as a subversive menace was crushed and has never revived. Similar action at this time would have been as effective against the Communist Party and its subsidiary organizations.&quot;

===1950–2000===
====Taft–Hartley Act====
After the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1946 by Congress, which called for the removal of Communist union leadership, the IWW experienced a loss of membership as differences of opinion occurred over how to respond to the challenge. In 1949, US Attorney General Tom C. Clark placed the IWW on the Attorney General&#x27;s List of Subversive Organizations in the category of &quot;organizations seeking to change the government by unconstitutional means&quot; under Executive Order 9835, which offered no means of appeal, and which excluded all IWW members from Federal employment and federally subsidized housing programs (this order was revoked by Executive Order 10450 in 1953).

At this time, the Cleveland local of the Metal and Machinery Workers Industrial Union (MMWIU) was the strongest IWW branch in the United States. Leading figures such as Frank Cedervall, who had helped build the branch up for over ten years, were concerned about the possibility of raiding from AFL-CIO unions if the IWW had its legal status as a union revoked. In 1950, Cedervall led the 1500-member MMWIU national organization to split from the IWW, as the Lumber Workers Industrial Union had almost 30 years earlier. This act did not save the MMWIU. Despite its brief affiliation with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, it was raided by the AFL and CIO and defunct by the late 1950s, less than ten years after separating from the IWW.

The loss of the MMWIU, at the time the IWW&#x27;s largest industrial union, was almost a deathblow to the IWW. The union&#x27;s membership fell to its lowest level in the 1950s during the Second Red Scare, and by 1955, the union&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary, it was near extinction, though it still appeared on government lists of Communist-led groups.

====1960s rejuvenation====

The 1960s civil rights movement, anti-war protests, and various university student movements brought new life to the IWW, albeit with many fewer new members than the great organizing drives of the early part of the 20th century.

The first signs of new life for the IWW in the 1960s were organizing efforts among students in San Francisco and Berkeley, which were hotbeds of student radicalism at the time. This targeting of students resulted in a Bay Area branch of the union with over a hundred members in 1964, almost as many as the union&#x27;s total membership in 1961. Wobblies old and new united for one more &quot;free speech fight&quot;: Berkeley&#x27;s Free Speech Movement. Riding on this high, the decision in 1967 to allow college and university students to join the Education Workers Industrial Union (IU 620) as full members spurred campaigns in 1968 at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The IWW sent representatives to Students for a Democratic Society conventions in 1967, 1968, and 1969, and as the SDS collapsed into infighting, the IWW gained members fleeing this discord. These changes had a profound effect on the union, which by 1972 had 67% of members under the age of 30, with a total of nearly 500 members.

The IWW&#x27;s links to the 1960s counterculture led to organizing campaigns at counterculture businesses, as well as a wave of over two dozen co-ops affiliating with the IWW under its Wobbly Shop model in the 1960s to 1980s. These businesses were primarily in printing, publishing, and food distribution, from underground newspapers and radical print shops to community co-op grocery stores. Some of the printing and publishing industry co-ops and job shops included Black &amp; Red (Detroit), Glad Day Press (New York), RPM Press (Michigan), New Media Graphics (Ohio), Babylon Print (Wisconsin), Hill Press (Illinois), Lakeside (Madison, Wisconsin), Harbinger (Columbia, South Carolina), Eastown Printing in Grand Rapids, Michigan (where the IWW negotiated a contract in 1978), and (Montreal). This close affiliation with radical publishers and printing houses sometimes led to legal difficulties for the union, such as when was shut down in 1970 by provincial police for publishing pro-FLQ materials, which were banned at the time under an official censorship law. Also in 1970, the San Diego, California, &quot;street journal&quot; became an official IWW shop. In 1971 its office was attacked by an organization calling itself the Minutemen, and IWW member Ricardo Gonzalves was indicted for criminal syndicalism along with two members of the Brown Berets.

====Return to workplace campaigns====
Invigorated by the arrival of enthusiastic new members, the IWW began a wave of organizing drives. These largely took a regional form and they, as well as the union&#x27;s overall membership, concentrated in Portland, Chicago, Ann Arbor, and throughout the state of California, which when combined accounted for over half of union drives from 1970 to 1979. In Portland, Oregon, the IWW led campaigns at Winter Products (a brass plating plant) in 1972, at a local Winchell&#x27;s Donuts (where a strike was waged and lost), at the Albina Day Care (where key union demands were won, including the firing of the director of the day care), of healthcare workers at West Side School and the Portland Medical Center, and of agricultural workers in 1974. The latter effort led to the opening of an IWW union hall in Portland to compete with extortionate hiring halls and day labor agencies. Organizing efforts led to a growth in membership, but repeated loss of strikes and organizing campaigns anticipated the decline of the Portland branch after the mid-1970s, a stagnancy period lasting until the 1990s.

In California, union activities were based in Santa Cruz, where in 1977 the IWW engaged in one of its most ambitious campaigns of the 1970s: an attempt in 1977 to organize 3,000 workers hired under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) in Santa Cruz County. The campaign led to pay raises, the implementation of a grievance procedure, and medical and dental coverage, but the union failed to maintain its foothold, and in 1982 the CETA program was replaced by the Job Training Partnership Act. The IWW won some lasting victories in Santa Cruz, such as campaigns at the Janus Alcohol Recovery Center, the Santa Cruz Law Center, Project Hope, and the Santa Cruz Community Switchboard.

Elsewhere in California, the IWW was active in Long Beach in 1972, where it organized workers at International Wood Products and Park International Corporation (a manufacturer of plastic swimming pool filters) and went on strike after the firing of one worker for union-related activities. Finally, in San Francisco, the IWW ran campaigns for radio station and food service workers.

In Chicago, the IWW was an early opponent of so-called urban renewal programs and supported the creation of the &quot;Chicago People&#x27;s Park&quot; in 1969. The Chicago branch also ran citywide campaigns for healthcare, food service, entertainment, construction, and metal workers, and its success with the latter led to an attempt to revive the national Metal and Machinery Workers Industrial Union, which twenty years earlier had been a major component of the union. Metalworker organizing mostly ended in 1978 after a failed strike at Mid-American Metal in Virden, Illinois. The IWW also became one of the first unions to try to organize fast food workers, with an organizing campaign at a local McDonald&#x27;s in 1973.

The IWW also built on its existing presence in Ann Arbor, which had existed since student organizing began at the University of Michigan, to launch an organizing campaign at the University Cellar, a college bookstore. The union won National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification there in 1979 following a strike, and the store became a strong job shop for the union until it was closed in 1986. The union launched a similar campaign at another local bookstore, Charing Cross Books, but was unable to maintain its foothold there despite reaching a settlement with management.

In the late 1970s, the IWW came to regional prominence in entertainment industry organizing, with an Entertainment Workers Organizing Committee being founded in Chicago in 1976, followed by campaigns organizing musicians in Cleveland in 1977 and Ann Arbor in 1978. The Chicago committee published a model contract which was distributed to musicians in the hopes of raising industry standards, as well as maintaining an active phone line for booking information. IWW musicians such as Utah Phillips, Faith Petric, Bob Bovee, and Jim Ringer also toured and promoted the union, and in 1987 an anthology album, &quot;Rebel Voices&quot;, was released.

Other IWW organizing campaigns of the 1970s included a ShopRite supermarket in Milwaukee, at Coronet Foods in Wheeling, West Virginia, chemical and fast food workers (including KFC and Roy Rogers) in State College, Pennsylvania, and hospital workers in Boston, all in 1973; shipyards in Houston, Texas, and restaurant workers in Pittsburgh in 1974; unsuccessful campaigns at the Prospect Nursing Home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a Pizza Hut in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, in 1975; and a construction workers organizing drive in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1978.

====1990s====

In 1996, the IWW launched an organizing drive against Borders Books in Philadelphia. In March, the union lost an NLRB certification vote by a narrow margin but continued to organize. In June, IWW member Miriam Fried was fired on trumped-up charges and a national boycott of Borders was launched in response. IWW members picketed at Borders stores nationwide, including Ann Arbor, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco, California; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Palo Alto, California; Portland, Oregon; Portland, Maine; Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Albany, New York; Richmond, Virginia; St. Louis, Missouri; Los Angeles, California; and other cities. This was followed up with a National Day of Action in 1997, where Borders stores were again picketed nationwide, and a second organizing campaign in London, England.

Also in 1996, the IWW began organizing at Wherehouse Music in El Cerrito, California. The campaign continued until 1997, when management fired two organizers and laid off over half the employees, as well as reducing the hours of known union members. This directly affected the NLRB certification vote which followed, where the IWW lost over 2:1.

In 1998, the IWW chartered a San Francisco branch of the Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union (MTWIU), which trained hundreds of waterfront workers in health and safety techniques and attempted to institutionalize these safety practices on the San Francisco waterfront.

===2000–present===
In 2004, an IWW union was organized in a New York City Starbucks. In 2006, the IWW continued efforts at Starbucks by organizing several Chicago area shops.

In New York City, the IWW has organized immigrant foodstuffs workers since 2005. That summer, workers from Handyfat Trading joined the IWW, and were soon followed by workers from four more warehouses.

In May 2007, the NYC warehouse workers came together with the Starbucks Workers Union to form The Food and Allied Workers Union IU 460/640. In the summer of 2007, the IWW organized workers at two new warehouses: Flaum Appetizing, a Kosher food distributor, and Wild Edibles, a seafood company. Over the course of 2007–08, workers at both shops were illegally terminated for their union activity. In 2008, the workers at Wild Edibles actively fought to get their jobs back and to secure overtime pay owed to them by the boss. In a workplace justice campaign called Focus on the Food Chain, carried out jointly with Brandworkers International, the IWW workers won settlements against employers including Pur Pac, Flaum Appetizing and Wild Edibles.

The Portland, Oregon General Membership Branch is one of the largest and most active branches of the IWW. The branch holds three contracts currently, two with Janus Youth Programs and one with Portland Women&#x27;s Crisis Line. There has been some debate within the branch about whether or not union contracts such as this are desirable in the long run, with some members favoring solidarity unionism as opposed to contract unionism and some members believing there is room for both strategies for organizing. The branch has successfully supported workers wrongfully fired from several different workplaces in the last two years. Due to picketing by Wobblies, these workers have received significant compensation from their former employers. Branch membership has been increasing, as has shop organizing. As of 2005, the 100th anniversary of its founding, the IWW had around 5,000 members, compared to 13 million members in the AFL-CIO.

====2011 Wisconsin general strike====

In early 2011, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker announced a budget bill which the IWW held would effectively outlaw unions for state or municipal workers. In response, there was an emergency meeting of the Midwestern IWW member organizations. IWW members presented a proposal at a meeting of South-Central Federation of Labor (SCFL) which endorsed a general strike and create an ad hoc Committee to instruct affiliated locals in preparations for the general strike. The IWW proposal passed nearly unanimously. The Madison branch made an international appeal translating various materials concerning the strike into Arabic, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. An appeal was made to European unions (CNT – Spain, CGT – Spain and CGT – France) to send organizers to Madison who could present their experience of general strikes at union meetings and help organize the strike in other ways. The CNT (France) sent letters of solidarity to the IWW. This was considered the largest and most successful intervention in a working-class struggle that the IWW has undertaken since the 1930s. In the aftermath, the strike was said by some to be &quot;the general strike that didn&#x27;t happen&quot; because eventually ongoing efforts at industrial action were &quot;completely overwhelmed by the recall effort&quot; against the governor during the crisis.

====Late 2010s====

In the mid-2010s, Wobblies in the United States were focused on campaigns to organize the multinational coffeehouse chain Starbucks, the franchised sandwich fast food restaurant chain Jimmy John&#x27;s, and the multinational supermarket chain Whole Foods Market. The union had about 3,000 members. The IWW moved its headquarters to 2036 West Montrose, Chicago, in 2012.

The IWW waged an organizing campaign at Chicago-Lake Liquors in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2013. The store, which advertises itself as the highest-volume liquor store in Minnesota, had a wage cap of $10.50 per hour, but in the face of IWW demands for the wage cap to be lifted, store management fired five organizers. On April 6, the Twin Cities branch of the union responded with a picket around the store informing customers of the situation. This was followed by a second picket on May 4, a day which customarily had heavy business at the store. The union claimed to have made &quot;what should have been an extremely busy Saturday into a quiet afternoon inside the store&quot;. After several months, the National Labor Relations Board announced that it found merit in the union&#x27;s unfair dismissal complaint. As a result, the union and store management agreed to a $32,000 settlement as a form of compensation to the fired workers and the campaign officially ended.

Workers at the Paulo Freire Social Justice Charter School in Holyoke, Massachusetts were organized with the IWW in 2015, hoping to address the &quot;authoritarian leadership&quot; of the school administration and perceived racial bias in hiring.

On September 14, 2015, after a year-long organizing campaign, workers at Sound Stage Production in North Haven Connecticut declared their membership in the IWW.

The IWW announced the Burgerville Workers Union (BVWU) in April 2016, which focuses on workers at the Oregon regional fast food chain, Burgerville. A subsidiary of the IWW, the BVWU went public on April 26 at a rally of workers and supporters outside a Portland, Oregon Burgerville location. Upon going public, the BVWU was endorsed by a number of local Oregon community organizations, including union locals, the Portland Solidarity Network, and food and racial justice organizations. It was also endorsed by then-Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders. The union received pushback with a letter from Burgerville&#x27;s CEO, Jeff Harvey, being distributed to workers discouraging them from joining the union. In June 2017, Burgerville paid a settlement of $10,000 after an investigation by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, which found that the company had violated state-mandated break periods for workers. In April and May 2018 the IWW won NLRB elections in 2 Burgerville Locations.

In August 2016, workers at Ellen&#x27;s Stardust Diner in Manhattan formed Stardust Family United (SFU) under the IWW, driven by the firing of thirty employees, as well as an unpopular new scheduling system. After going public, the union accused Stardust management of retaliatory firings and posting anti-union materials in the restaurant.

On September 9, 2016, the 45th anniversary of the Attica Prison Riots, 900 incarcerated workers organized by the IWW and many other prisoners participated in the 9/9 National Prison Strike declared by the IWW&#x27;s Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee. Supported by a number of anti-incarceration and prisoners&#x27; organizations such as the Free Alabama Movement, the strike focused on the poor conditions in many American prisons and the low rates of prisoner pay for maintaining prisons and engaging in commercial production of goods for third-party companies. The strike affected an estimated twenty prisons in eleven states and was strongest at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Alabama. Estimates of the number of inmates affected range from 20,000, to 50,000, to as high as 72,000, with David Fathi of the ACLU National Prison Project judging it to be the &quot;largest prisoner strike in recent memory&quot;. Initial media coverage was slow, with strike organizers complaining of a &quot;mainstream-media blackout&quot;, which could be attributed to the difficulty in communicating with prisoners, as many prisons went on lockdown either in response to prisoner strike activity or in anticipation of it.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====

The IWW also organized workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In May 2020 the IWW established the Voodoo Doughnut Workers Union (DWU) in Portland. The newly formed union delivered a letter to management announcing the formation of a union and demanding higher wages, safety improvements and severance packages for employees laid off because of the coronavirus and Oregon&#x27;s ongoing &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; order. In February 2021, after months of organizing, DWU workers officially filed for a union certification election with the National Labor Relations Board.

The IWW also publicly announced the Second Staff (2S) workers&#x27; union in May 2020 at the Faison school, a private school serving students on the autism spectrum in Richmond, Virginia, in response to what the union called a &quot;reckless endangerment of staff and students&quot; in trying to force the school to open too soon. March 2021 saw a rash of organizing with the IWW. On March 9, workers at Moe&#x27;s Books, an independent used bookstore in Berkeley, California, announced that they received voluntary recognition from Moe&#x27;s Books management, officially unionizing with the IWW.

Shortly after, on March 13, the IWW announced that it was organizing workers at the Socialist Rifle Association (SRA). The union was voluntarily recognized by the SRA the following day. Two days later, on March 16, staff at the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition (OVEC) announced their intent to unionize with the IWW, and requested voluntary recognition from management. In organizing, the OVEC workers seek to gain &quot;a standardized pay scale, an equitable discipline policy, and the right to union representation at any meeting wherein matters affecting staff pay, hours, benefits, advancement, or layoffs may be discussed or voted on&quot;.

The IWW is the first union in the United States to ratify a union contract for fast food workers. Five Oregon locations of Burgerville are unionized, as well as one location of Voodoo Doughnut in downtown Portland.

==Australia==
Australia encountered the IWW tradition early. In part, this was due to the local De Leonist Socialist Labor Party following the industrial turn of the US SLP. The SLP formed an IWW Club in Sydney in October 1907. Members of other socialist groups also joined it, and the relationship with the SLP soon proved to be a problem. The 1908 split between the Chicago and Detroit factions in the United States was echoed by internal unrest in the Australian IWW from late 1908, resulting in the formation of a pro-Chicago local in Adelaide in May 1911 and another in Sydney six months later. By mid-1913 the &quot;Chicago&quot; IWW was flourishing and the SLP-associated pro-Detroit IWW Club in decline. In 1916 the &quot;Detroit&quot; IWW in Australia followed the lead of the US body and renamed itself the Workers&#x27; International Industrial Union.

The IWW opposed the First World War from 1914 onward and in many ways fought against Australian conscription. A narrow majority of Australians voted against conscription in a very bitter hard-fought referendum in October 1916, and then again in December 1917, Australia being the only belligerent in World War One without conscription. In very significant part this was due to the agitation of the IWW, a group which never had as many as 500 members in Australia at its peak. The IWW founded the Anti-Conscription League (ACL) in which members worked with the broader labor and peace movement, and also carried on an aggressive propaganda campaign in its own name; leading to the imprisonment of Tom Barker (1887–1970) the editor of the IWW paper &quot;Direct Action&quot;, sentenced to twelve months in March 1916. A series of arson attacks on commercial properties in Sydney was widely attributed to the IWW campaign to have Tom Barker released. He was released in August 1916, but twelve mostly prominent IWW activists, the so-called Sydney Twelve were arrested in NSW in September 1916 for arson and other offenses. Their trial and eventual imprisonment became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; of the Australian labor movement, which saw no convincing evidence of their involvement. A number of other scandals were associated with the IWW; a five-pound note forgery scandal, the so-called Tottenham tragedy in which the murder of a police officer was blamed on the IWW, and above all it was blamed for the defeat of the October 1916 conscription referendum. In December 1916, the Commonwealth government led by Labour Party renegade Billy Hughes declared the IWW an illegal organization under the Unlawful Associations Act. Eighty six members immediately defied the law and were sentenced to six months imprisonment. &quot;Direct Action&quot; was suppressed, its circulation was at its peak of something over 12,000. During the war over 100 members Australia-wide were sentenced to imprisonment on political charges, including the veteran activist Monty Miller.

By the early 1930s, most Australian IWW branches had dispersed as the Communist Party grew in influence.

The Australian IWW has grown since the 1940s, but have been unsuccessful in securing union representation. As an extreme example of the integration of ex-IWW militants into the mainstream labor movement one might instance the career of Donald Grant, one of the Sydney Twelve sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for conspiracy to commit arson and other crimes. Released from prison in August 1920, he soon broke with the IWW over its antipolitical stand, standing for the NSW Parliament for the Industrial Socialist Labour Party unsuccessfully in 1922 and then in 1925 for the mainstream Australian Labor Party (ALP) also unsuccessfully. This reconciliation with the ALP and the electoral system did not prevent him being imprisoned again in 1927 for street demonstrations supporting Sacco and Vanzetti. He eventually represented the ALP in the NSW Legislative Council in 1931–1940 and the Australian Senate 1943–1956.

&quot;Bump Me Into Parliament&quot; is the most notable Australian IWW song, and is still current. It was written by ship&#x27;s fireman William &quot;Bill&quot; Casey, later Secretary of the Seaman&#x27;s Union in Queensland.

==New Zealand==
Australian influence was strong in early 20th century left-wing groups, and several founders of the New Zealand Labour Party (e.g. Bob Semple) were from Australia. The trans-Tasman interchange was two-way, particularly for miners. Several Tasmanian Labour &quot;groupings&quot; in the 1890s cited their earlier New Zealand experience of activism e.g. later premier Robert Cosgrove, and also Chris Watson from New South Wales.

&quot;Wobbly&quot; activists in New Zealand pre-WWI were John Benjamin King and H. M. Fitzgerald (an adherent of the De Leon school) from Canada. Another was Robert Rivers La Monte from America, who was (briefly) an organizer for the New Zealand Socialist Party (as was Fitzgerald). IWW strongholds were Auckland &quot;a city with the demographic characteristics of a frontier town&quot;; Wellington where a branch survived briefly and in mining towns, on the wharves and among laborers.

==Canada==

The IWW was active in Canada from a very early point in the organization&#x27;s history, especially in Western Canada, primarily in British Columbia. The union was active in organizing large swaths of the lumber and mining industry along the coast, in the Interior of British Columbia, and Vancouver Island. Joe Hill wrote the song &quot;Where the Fraser River Flows&quot; during this period when the IWW was organizing in British Columbia. Some members of the IWW had relatively close links with the Socialist Party of Canada. Canadians who went to Australia and New Zealand before WWI included John Benjamin King and H. M. Fitzgerald (an adherent of the De Leon school).

Despite the IWW being banned as a subversive organization in Canada during the First World War, the organization rebounded swiftly after being unbanned after the war, reaching a post-WWI high of 5600 Canadian members in 1923. The union entered a short &quot;golden age&quot; in Canada with an official Canadian Administration located at the Finnish Labour Temple in Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay, Ontario) and a strong base among immigrant laborers in Northern Ontario and Manitoba, especially Finns, which included harvest workers, lumberjacks, and miners. During this period, the IWW competed for members with a number of other radical and socialist organizations such as the Finnish Organization of Canada (FOC), with the IWW&#x27;s &quot;Industrialisti&quot; newspaper competing with the FOC&#x27;s &quot;Vapaus&quot; for attention and readership. During this period. Membership slowly decreased during the 1920s and 30s despite continued organizing and strike activity as the IWW lost ground to the One Big Union and Communist Party-controlled organizations such as the Workers&#x27; Unity League (WUL). Despite this competition, the IWW and WUL cooperated during strikes, such as at the Abitibi Pulp &amp; Paper Company near Sault Ste. Marie in 1933, where the Finnish workers in the IWW and WUL faced discrimination and violence from the Anglo citizens of the town. The IWW also successfully unionized Ritchie&#x27;s Dairy in Toronto and formed a fishery workers&#x27; branch in MacDiarmid (now Greenstone, Ontario).

In 1936, the IWW in Canada supported the Spanish Revolution and began to recruit for the militia of the anarcho-syndicalist (CNT), in direct conflict with Communist Party recruiters for the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, a conflict which resulted in a number of violent clashes at recruitment rallies in Northern Ontario. Several Canadian IWW members were killed in the Spanish Civil War and the CNT&#x27;s ensuing defeat at the hands of both Fascist and Republican forces. 

In 2009, after Starbucks established policies that meant demotions and loss of salary for some workers, the Quebec branches of Montreal and Sherbrooke helped found the Starbucks Workers&#x27; Union (STTS) which made a breakthrough in Quebec City at an establishment in Sainte-Foy. Leaders Simon Gosselin, Dominic Dupont and Andrew Fletcher were harassed in the months following unionization, and union efforts were defeated by law firm Heenan Blaike in the series of hearings before Quebec Labor Relations Board.

Today the IWW remains active in the country with branches in Vancouver, Vancouver Island, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa/Outaouais, Toronto, Windsor, Sherbrooke, Québec City and Montréal. In August 2009, Canadian members voted to ratify the constitution of the Canadian Regional Organizing Committee (CanROC) to improve inter-branch coordination and communication. Affiliated branches are Winnipeg, Ottawa-Outaouais, Toronto, Windsor, Sherbrooke, Montréal, and Québec City. Each branch elects a representative to make decisions on the Canadian board. There were originally three officers, the Secretary-Treasurer, Organizing Department Liaison, and Editor of the Canadian Organizing Bulletin. In 2016, CanROC members voted to split the Secretary-Treasurer role into separate Regional Secretary and Regional Treasurer positions.

There are currently five job shops in Canada: Libra Knowledge and Information Services Co-op in Toronto, ParIT Workers Cooperative in Winnipeg, the Windsor Button Collective, the Ottawa Panhandlers&#x27; Union, and the Street Labourers of Windsor (SLOW). The Ottawa Panhandlers&#x27; Union continues a tradition in the IWW of expanding the definition of worker. The union members include anyone who makes their living in the street, including buskers, street vendors, the homeless, scrappers, and panhandlers. In the summer of 2004, the Union led a strike by the homeless (the Homeless Action Strike) in Ottawa. The strike resulted in the city agreeing to fund a newspaper created and sold by the homeless on the street. On May 1, 2006, the Union took over the Elgin Street Police Station for a day. A similar IWW organization, the Street Labourers of Windsor (SLOW), has garnered local, provincial, and national news coverage for its organizing efforts in 2015.

==Europe==

=== Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria ===
The IWW started to organize in Germany following the First World War. Fritz Wolffheim played a significant role in establishing the IWW in Hamburg. A German Language Membership Regional Organizing Committee (GLAMROC) was founded in December 2006 in Cologne. It encompasses the German-language area of Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland with branches or contacts in 16 cities.

=== Great Britain and Ireland ===

The regional body of the union in the United Kingdom and Ireland is the Wales, Ireland, Scotland, England Regional Administration (WISERA). Formerly known as the Britain and Ireland Regional Administration (BIRA), its name was changed as a result of a referendum vote by WISERA members.

The IWW was present, to varying extents, in many of the struggles of the early decades of the 20th century, including the UK general strike of 1926 and the dockers&#x27; strike of 1947. During the Spanish Civil War, a Wobbly from Neath, who had been active in Mexico, trained volunteers in preparation for the journey to Spain, where they joined the International Brigades to fight against Franco.

Overall, membership has increased rapidly; in 2014, the union reported a total UK membership of 750, which increased to 1000 by April 2015.

Also in 2007, IWW branches in Glasgow and Dumfries were a key driving force in a successful campaign to prevent the closure of one of Glasgow University&#x27;s campuses (The Crichton) in Dumfries.

The Edinburgh General Membership Branch of the IWW along with other branches of the IWW&#x27;s Scottish section voted in 2014 to become a signatory to the &quot;From Yes to Action Statement&quot; produced by the Autonomous Centre of Edinburgh. In 2015, along with similar groups such as the Edinburgh Coalition Against Poverty and Edinburgh Anarchist Federation, they joined the Scottish Action Against Austerity network.

In 2016, WISERA promoted a campaign targeting couriers working for companies such as Deliveroo.

===Iceland and Greece===

An Iceland Regional Organizing Committee (IceROC) was chartered in 2015. The union has become a trailblazer in supporting sex workers in Iceland, who lack access to services which do not automatically treat them as victims of abuse.

Also in 2015, a Greek Regional Organizing Committee (GreROC) was chartered. In July of that year, it released a statement condemning the Greek government&#x27;s response to the results of the 2015 Greek bailout referendum, saying that &quot;despite the Left tone of dignity that the Left governmental administrators use, this is a one-way blackmail. We need a radical change of shift, not in words but in action.&quot;

==Folk music and protest songs==

One Wobbly characteristic since their inception has been a penchant for song. To counteract management sending in the Salvation Army band to cover up the Wobbly speakers, Joe Hill wrote parodies of Christian hymns so that union members could sing along with the Salvation Army band, but with their own purposes. For example, &quot;In the Sweet By and By&quot; became &quot;There&#x27;ll Be Pie in the Sky When You Die (That&#x27;s a Lie)&quot;. From that start in exigency, Wobbly song writing became common because they &quot;articulated the frustrations, hostilities, and humor of the homeless and the dispossessed.&quot;

==Literature==

Karl Marlantes&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;Deep River&quot; explores labor issues in the early 1900s in the US and the consequences for an immigrant Finnish family. The book focuses on a female family member who becomes an organizer for the IWW in the dangerous logging industry. Both pro- and anti-labor viewpoints are examined, with special attention given to IWW strikes and the backlash against the labor movement during World War I.

==Lingo==

Wobbly lingo is a collection of technical language, jargon, and historic slang used by the Wobblies, for more than a century. Many Wobbly terms derive from or are coextensive with hobo expressions used through the 1940s. The origin of the name &quot;Wobbly&quot; itself is uncertain. For several decades, many hobos in the United States were members of, or were sympathetic to, the IWW. Because of this, some of the terms describe the life of a hobo such as &quot;riding the rails&quot;, living in &quot;jungles&quot;, dodging the &quot;bulls&quot;. The IWW&#x27;s efforts to organize all trades allowed the lingo to expand to include terms relating to mining camps, timber work, and farming.

Some words and phrases believed to have originated within Wobbly lingo have gained cultural significance outside of the IWW. For example, from Joe Hill&#x27;s song &quot;The Preacher and the Slave&quot;, the expression has passed into common usage, referring to a &quot;preposterously optimistic goal&quot;.

==Notable members==
Former lieutenant governor of Colorado David C. Coates was a labor militant, and was present at the founding convention, although it is unknown if he became a member. It has long been rumored, but not proven, that baseball legend Honus Wagner was also a Wobbly. Senator Joseph McCarthy accused Edward R. Murrow of having been an IWW member, which Murrow denied.

<doc id="37064" wikidata="Q4775331" url="?curid=37064" title="Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996">
<text>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), , was introduced to the United States Congress in April 1995 as a Senate Bill (). The bill was passed with broad bipartisan support by Congress in response to the bombings of the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City. It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.

Controversial for its changes to the law of habeas corpus in the United States, the AEDPA also contained a number of provisions to &quot;deter terrorism, provide justice for victims, provide for an effective death penalty, and for other purposes.&quot;

== Background ==
On February 10, 1995, Senator Joe Biden introduced the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 to the United States Senate. Just as with its successor, the omnibus bill was introduced on behalf of the Clinton Administration. In the two months that the bill was debated in the Senate, little progress was made towards passage.

Following the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, a new antiterrorism bill was introduced to the Senate by Republican Senate Majority leader Bob Dole. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 was introduced on April 27, 1995. Although the bill was promoted as an urgent measure, it remained stalled in Congress between December 1995 until March of 1996. It would not see further Congressional activity until March of 1996.

The act was codified in sections of Title 8, Title 18 and Title 28. The law amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow US citizens to file civil lawsuits against some foreign countries when Americans were killed in terrorist attacks. It authorized the State Department to designate foreign terrorist organizations.

But terrorism provisions were only part of the story. The Oklahoma City bombing had presented the Republican-controlled Congress an opportunity to push through federal habeas corpus reform. Within days of the AEDPA being introduced, there were disagreements between Republican and Democratic leadership over combining federal habeas corpus reform with the anti-terrorism law. Republicans refused to hold hearings, consult with habeas experts or negotiate with congressional Democrats. They fast-tracked the bill without a report. The changes to the federal habeas statute mostly applied to reviewing state convictions in federal court, a type of post-conviction relief not available for federal prisoners like McVeigh. Even if he had qualified, McVeigh did little to contest the death sentence imposed on him by what he saw as a hostile, oppressive government.

Legal analysts note that these circumstances have obscured the statute&#x27;s legislative history. Some of AEDPA&#x27;s habeas provisions were based on the ad hoc Powell Committee&#x27;s recommendations including restricting &quot;de novo&quot; review-based federal evidentiary hearings. In 1998 Antonin Scalia commented on the legislative intent:

The purpose of AEDPA is not obscure. It was to eliminate the interminable delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences and ... to streamline and simplify [habeas corpus]

President Clinton acknowledged that &quot;it should not take eight or nine years and three trips to the Supreme Court to finalize whether a person, in fact, was properly convicted or not&quot; but he did not want the anti-terrorism bill to stall over the divisive proposal.

AEDPA eventually passed with bipartisan support. The final vote in Senate was 91-8 and in the House of Representatives 293-133. It was signed into law on April 24, 1996.

==Provisions==
=== Title I - Habeas Corpus Reform ===
Changes filing deadlines and limits appeals for death penalty cases. For more see Habeas Corpus.

=== Title II - Justice for Victims ===
This section provides for mandatory victim restitution, alters jurisdiction for lawsuits against terrorist states, and expands assistance for victims of terrorism.

=== Title III - International Terrorism Prohibitions ===
One of the sections included in the bill as originally introduced, this section received broad bipartisan support from the beginning. It prohibits international terrorist fundraising, gives authority to the Secretary of State to designate foreign organizations as terrorist organizations, allows criminal prosecution of anyone found to be providing funding to any organization linked to a designated terrorist organization. Prohibits assistance to terrorist states, including military aid and assistance from international financial institutions.

=== Title IV - Terrorist and Criminal Alien Removal and Exclusion ===
Provides for the removal of alien terrorists, the exclusion of members and representatives of terrorist organizations, modifies asylum procedures to allow denial of asylum to members of terrorist organizations, and alters criminal procedures for aliens.

In altering the criminal procedures for aliens, the law created a new system of secret evidence which allows the government to introduce classified information as evidence without disclosing the specifics of the evidence to the alien or their legal counsel. It also expands the criteria for deportation for crimes of moral turpitude.

=== Title V - Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons Restrictions ===
Defines and expands restrictions on certain types of nuclear materials, biological weapons, and chemical weapons.

=== Title VI - Implementation of Plastic Explosives Convention ===
Codifies the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives requirement that all plastic explosives be equipped with detection agents and creates criminal sanctions for failure to comply. 

=== Title VII - Criminal Law Modifications to Counter Terrorism ===
Changes to criminal law involving terrorist (or explosives) offenses, including increased penalties and criminal procedure changes. Commissioning a study to determine the constitutionality of restrictions on bomb-making materials.

=== Title VIII - Assistance to Law Enforcement ===
Provides additional resources and training for law enforcement including overseas training activities, additional requirements to preserve record evidence, and a commissioned study and report of electronic surveillance. Directed resources towards combatting international counterfeiting of U.S. currency, compiling statistics relating to the intimidation of government employees, and assessing and reducing the threat to law enforcement officers from the criminal use of firearms and ammunition. Also created the Commission on the Advancement of Federal Law Enforcement (Subtitle A).

Increased funding authorizations for law enforcement including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and more.

=== Title IX - Miscellaneous ===
Expanded the territorial sea, changed proof of citizenship requirements, and limited legal representation fees and expenses in capital cases.

==Habeas corpus==

AEDPA had a significant impact on the law of habeas corpus. Section 104(d) limits the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief to state prisoners unless the state court&#x27;s adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was 
#contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the US Supreme Court; or
#based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.

In addition to the modifications that pertain to all habeas corpus cases, AEDPA enacted special review provisions for capital cases from states that enacted quality controls for the performance of counsel in the state courts in the post-conviction phase. States that enacted the quality controls would see strict time limitations enforced against their death-row inmates in federal habeas proceedings coupled with extremely deferential review to the determinations of their courts regarding issues of federal law. Arizona became the first state to successfully opt-in to this provision in 2020.

Other provisions of AEDPA created entirely new statutory law. For example, the judicially-created abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, established in &quot;McCleskey v. Zant&quot; (1991), had restricted the presentation of new claims through subsequent habeas petitions. AEDPA replaced this doctrine with a stricter bar on &quot;second or successive petitions&quot; (sec. 106).

Petitioners in federal habeas proceedings that have already been decided in a previous habeas petition would find the claims barred. Additionally, petitioners who had already filed a federal habeas petition were required to first secure authorization from the appropriate federal court of appeals. Furthermore, AEDPA took away from the Supreme Court the power to review a court of appeals&#x27;s denial of that permission, thus placing final authority for the filing of second petitions in the hands of the federal courts of appeals.

The unanimous 8-0 Supreme Court decision &quot;Harrington v. Richter&quot; held that petitioners attempting to overcome the §2254(d) bar to federal review must show that the decision to deny habeas is unreasonable even when the state court provides only a summary ruling. &quot;Cullen v. Pinholster&quot;, held that federal courts reviewing &quot;&quot;Strickland&quot; claims&quot; under AEDPA were limited to deciding whether the state decision was reasonable based on the record.

==Court cases==
Soon after it was enacted, AEDPA endured a critical test in the Supreme Court. The basis of the challenge was that the provisions limiting the ability of persons to file successive habeas petitions violated Article I, Section 9, Clause 2, of the United States Constitution, the Suspension Clause. The Supreme Court held unanimously, in &quot;Felker v. Turpin&quot;, , that the limitations did not unconstitutionally suspend the writ.

In 2005, the Ninth Circuit indicated that it was willing to consider a challenge to the constitutionality of AEDPA on separation of powers grounds under &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot; and &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, but it has since decided that the issue had been settled by circuit precedent.

Basketball player and later coach Steve Kerr and his siblings and mother sued the Iranian government under the Act for the 1984 killing of Kerr&#x27;s father, Malcolm H. Kerr, in Beirut, Lebanon.

On June 21, 2022, the Supreme Court reinforced in &quot;Shoop v. Twyford&quot; that the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus is restricted by AEDPA.

==Reception==
While the act has several titles and provisions, the majority of criticism stems from the act&#x27;s tightening of habeas corpus laws. Those in favor of the bill say that the act prevents those convicted of crimes from being able to &quot;thwart justice and avoid just punishment by filing frivolous appeals for years on end&quot;, while critics argue that the inability to make multiple appeals increases the risk of an innocent person being killed.

Title IV also received criticism following the enactment of the AEDPA. The section allowing a single Immigration and Naturalization officer to decide whether to offer asylum to an individual who claims persecution but does not have identification was specifically targeted. The provision extending the ability of officers to deport anyone who illegally entered the country at any point in time without a hearing before a judge was also criticized.

Other, more recent criticism centers on the deference that the law requires of federal judges in considering habeas petitions. In &quot;Sessoms v. Grounds&quot; (Ninth Circuit), the majority of the judges believed that the state erred in not throwing out testimony made in the absence of the defendant&#x27;s attorney after he had requested counsel, but they were required to overturn his appeal. The dissenting opinion said that federal courts can only grant habeas relief if &quot;there is no possibility fair-minded jurists could disagree that the state court&#x27;s decision conflicts with [the Supreme] Court&#x27;s precedents&quot;.

Lara Bazelon argues this lack of power for judicial relief (from the AEDPA and its judicial affirmations) has sometimes led to federal appellate judges to instead publicly shame state prosecutors during oral arguments, which are streamed online.

On &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; on March 6, 2022, John Oliver called for the abolition of AEDPA because of the increased difficulty in appealing convictions and noting cases of wrongful convictions. He cited in particular Melissa Lucio, who first won her federal habeas corpus appeal for a new trial, but the appeal itself was then reversed by the same court citing the AEDPA.

<text>Peter Joseph William Debye ( ; born Petrus Josephus Wilhelmus Debije, ; March 24, 1884 – November 2, 1966) was a Dutch-American physicist and physical chemist, and Nobel laureate in Chemistry.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Maastricht, Netherlands, Debye enrolled in the Aachen University of Technology in 1901. In 1905, he completed his first degree in electrical engineering. He published his first paper, a mathematically elegant solution of a problem involving eddy currents, in 1907. At Aachen, he studied under the theoretical physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, who later claimed that his most important discovery was Peter Debye.

In 1906, Sommerfeld received an appointment at Munich, Bavaria, and took Debye with him as his assistant. Debye got his Ph.D. with a dissertation on radiation pressure in 1908. In 1910, he derived the Planck radiation formula using a method which Max Planck agreed was simpler than his own.

In 1911, when Albert Einstein took an appointment as a professor at Prague, Bohemia, Debye took his old professorship at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. This was followed by moves to Utrecht in 1912, to Göttingen in 1913, to ETH Zurich in 1920, to University of Leipzig in 1927, and in 1934 to Berlin, where, succeeding Einstein, he became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics (now named the Max-Planck-Institut) whose facilities were built only during Debye&#x27;s era. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1935. From 1937 to 1939 he was the president of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

In May 1914 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and in December of the same year he became foreign member.

===Family and personal life===
Peter Debye was described as a martinet when it came to scientific principles, yet he was always approachable and made time for his students. His personal philosophy emphasized a fulfillment of purpose and enjoyment in one&#x27;s work. Debye was an avid trout fisherman and gardener, collector of cacti, and was &quot;always known to enjoy a nice cigar&quot;.

While in Berlin as an assistant to Arnold Sommerfeld, Debye became acquainted with Mathilde Alberer. Mathilde was the daughter of the proprietor of the boarding house in which Debye was staying. Mathilde would soon change her citizenship and in 1913, Debye married Mathilde Alberer. Debye would enjoy working in his rose garden with Mathilde Alberer late into his years. They had a son, Peter P. Debye (1916–2012), and a daughter, Mathilde Maria (1921–1991). Peter became a physicist and collaborated with Debye in some of his research, and had a son who was also a chemist.

Debye was a faithful Catholic who insisted his family go to church.

===Scientific contributions===
His first major scientific contribution was the application of the concept of dipole moment to the charge distribution in asymmetric molecules in 1912, developing equations relating dipole moments to temperature and dielectric constant. In consequence, the units of molecular dipole moments are termed &quot;debyes&quot; in his honor. Also in 1912, he extended Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of specific heat to lower temperatures by including contributions from low-frequency phonons. See Debye model.

In 1913, he extended Niels Bohr&#x27;s theory of atomic structure, introducing elliptical orbits, a concept also introduced by Arnold Sommerfeld. In 1914–1915, Debye calculated the effect of temperature on X-ray diffraction patterns of crystalline solids with Paul Scherrer (the &quot;Debye–Waller factor&quot;).
In 1923, together with his assistant Erich Hückel, he developed an improvement of Svante Arrhenius&#x27; theory of electrical conductivity in electrolyte solutions. Although an improvement was made to the Debye–Hückel equation in 1926 by Lars Onsager, the theory is still regarded as a major forward step in our understanding of electrolytic solutions. Also in 1923, Debye developed a theory to explain the Compton effect, the shifting of the frequency of X-rays when they interact with electrons.

===Later work===
From 1934 to 1939 Debye was director of the physics section of the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. From 1936 onwards he was also professor of Theoretical Physics at the Frederick William University of Berlin. These positions were held during the Nazi Germany in Germany and, from 1938 onward, Austria.

In 1939 Debye traveled to the United States to deliver the Baker Lectures at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. After leaving Germany in early 1940, Debye became a professor at Cornell, chaired the chemistry department for 10 years, and became a member of Alpha Chi Sigma. In 1946 he became an American citizen. Unlike the European phase of his life, where he moved from city to city every few years, in the United States Debye remained at Cornell for the remainder of his career. He retired in 1952, but continued research until his death.

Much of Debye&#x27;s work at Cornell concerned the use of light-scattering techniques (derived from his X-ray scattering work of years earlier) to determine the size and molecular weight of polymer molecules. This started as a result of his research during World War II on synthetic rubber, but was extended to proteins and other macromolecules.

In April 1966, Debye suffered a heart attack, and in November of that year a second one proved fatal. He is buried in the Pleasant Grove Cemetery (Ithaca, New York, US).

==War activities and controversies==

===2006 controversy===
In January 2006, a book (in Dutch) appeared in The Netherlands, written by Sybe Rispens, entitled &quot;Einstein in the Netherlands.&quot; One chapter of this book discusses the relationship between Albert Einstein and Debye. Rispens discovered documents that, as he believed, were new and proved that, during his directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, Debye was actively involved in cleansing German science institutions of Jewish and other &quot;non-Aryan elements&quot;. Rispens records that on December 9, 1938, Debye wrote in his capacity as chairman of the &quot;Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft&quot; (DPG) to all the members of the DPG:

&quot;In light of the current situation, membership by German Jews as stipulated by the Nuremberg laws, of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft cannot be continued. According to the wishes of the board, I ask of all members to whom these definitions apply to report to me their resignation. Heil Hitler!&quot;

Many biographies published before Rispens&#x27; work, state that Debye moved to the US because he refused to accept German citizenship forced on to him by the Nazis. He planned his departure from Germany during a visit with his mother in Maastricht in late 1939, boarded a ship in Genoa in January 1940 and arrived in New York in early February 1940. He immediately sought a permanent position in the US and accepted such an offer from Cornell in June 1940. That month, he crossed the US border into Canada and returned within days on an immigration visa. He was able to get his wife out of Germany and to the US by December 1940. Although his son already was in the US before he departed, Peter Debye&#x27;s 19-year-old daughter and his sister-in-law did not leave. They lived in his official residence in Berlin and were supported by Debye&#x27;s official Berlin wages (he carefully maintained an official leave of absence for this purpose).

Further, Rispens alleges that Albert Einstein in the first half of 1940 tried to prevent Debye from being appointed in the United States at Cornell. Einstein allegedly wrote to his American colleagues: &quot;I know from a reliable source that Peter Debye is still in close contact with the German (Nazi) leaders&quot; and, according to Rispens, called upon his colleagues to do &quot;what they consider their duty as American citizens&quot;. To support this, Rispens refers to a well-known letter from Debye to Einstein and Einstein&#x27;s response to it. Van Ginkel investigated 1940 FBI reports on this matter and traced the &quot;reliable source&quot; to a single letter directed to Einstein and written by someone whose name is lost. This person was not known personally to Einstein and, according to Einstein, probably did not know Debye personally either. Moreover, this accusatory letter did not reach Einstein directly but was intercepted by British censors who showed it to Einstein. Einstein sent the British agent with the letter to Cornell, and the Cornell authorities told Debye about the affair. Thereupon Debye wrote his well-known 1940 letter to Einstein to which Einstein answered. The latter two letters can be found in the published Einstein correspondence.

Rispens alleges that Debye sent a telegram to Berlin on 23 June 1941 informing his previous employers that he was able and willing to resume his responsibilities at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut, presumably to maintain his leave of absence and keep the Berlin house and wages available for his daughter. A copy of this telegram has not been recovered thus far. In summer 1941, Debye filed his intent to become a US citizen and was quickly recruited in the US to participate in Allied war research.

It has been well documented in many biographies, and also in Rispens&#x27; book, that Debye and Dutch colleagues helped his Jewish colleague Lise Meitner in 1938–1939 (at great risk to himself and his family) cross the Dutch-German border to escape Nazi persecution and eventually obtain a position in Sweden.

Predating Rispens&#x27; work, and in contrast to it, an article by Rechenberg appeared 18 years earlier concerning Debye&#x27;s letter. The article describes Debye&#x27;s missive in more detail and presents a very favorable picture of Debye in his efforts to resist Nazi activists. Moreover, this article points out that Max von Laue, well known for his anti-Nazi views, gave his approval to the letter from the DPG chairman.

===International response===
Debye&#x27;s son, Peter P. Debye, interviewed in 2006 at age 89 recollects that his father was completely apolitical and that in the privacy of their home politics were never discussed. According to his son, Debye just wanted to do his job at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and as long as the Nazis did not bother him was able to do so. He recalls that his mother urged him (the son) to stay in the US in the event of war. Debye&#x27;s son had come to the US on a planned 2-month vacation during the summer of 1939 and never returned to Germany because war broke out.

In an opinion article published on the Debye Institute website, Dr. Gijs van Ginkel, until April 2007 Senior Managing Director of the VM Debye Instituut in Utrecht deplored the decision to rename the institute. In his article he cites scholars who point out that the DPG was able to retain their threatened staff as long as could be expected under increasing pressure from the Nazis. He also puts forward the important argument that when Debye in 1950 received the Max Planck medal of the DPG, nobody objected, not even the known opponent of the national socialists Max von Laue, who would have been in a position to object. Also Einstein, with his enormous prestige, was still alive, as were other Jewish scientists such as Lise Meitner and James Franck who both knew Debye intimately. None of them protested against Debye&#x27;s receiving the highest German scientific distinction. In fact, Albert Einstein, after many years of not participating in the voting for the Max Planck Medal nominees, joined the process again to vote for Debye.
Maastricht University also announced that it was reconsidering its position on the &quot;Peter Debye Prijs voor natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek&quot; (Peter Debye Prize for scientific research).

In a reply on the DPG website, Dieter Hoffmann and Mark Walker also conclude that Debye was not a Nazi activist. They remark that Max von Laue also was required and obliged (as a civil servant) to sign letters with &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. They also state that the DPG was one of the last scientific societies to purge the Jewish members and only very reluctantly. They quote the response of the &quot;Reich University Teachers League&quot; (a National Socialist organization) to the Debye letter:

&quot;Obviously the German Physical Society is still very backward and still clings tightly to their dear Jews. It is in fact remarkable that only &quot;because of circumstances beyond our control&quot; the membership of Jews can no longer be maintained&quot;
In May 2006, the Dutch Nobel Prize winner Martinus Veltman who had written the foreword to the Rispen book, renounced the book&#x27;s description of Peter Debye, withdrew his foreword, and asked the Board of Directors of Utrecht University to rescind their decision to rename the Debye Institute.

Various historical investigations, both in The Netherlands and in the US, have been carried out subsequent to the actions of the University of Maastricht. The earliest of these investigations, carried out by the Cornell University&#x27;s department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology released a report on 31 May 2006, which states that:

&quot;Based on the information to-date, we have not found evidence supporting the accusations that Debye was a Nazi sympathizer or collaborator or that he held anti-Semitic views. It is important that this be stated clearly since these are the most serious allegations.&quot;

It goes on to declare:

&quot;Thus, based on the information, evidence and historical record known to date, we believe that any action that dissociates Debye&#x27;s name from the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell is unwarranted.&quot;

In June 2006, it was reported that the scientific director of the (formerly) Debye Institute had been reprimanded by the board of directors of the University of Utrecht for a new publication on Debye&#x27;s war years on the grounds that it was too personally biased with respect to the Institute&#x27;s naming dispute. According to the board, the book should have been published not as a Debye Institute publication, but as a personal one. The book was banned by the University of Utrecht and both Directors of the (former) Debye Institute were forbidden to have any further contact with the press. A dozen professors of the Physics Faculty, amongst whom Cees Andriesse, openly protested against the interventions of the Board and the censorship of their protest by the university.

In May 2007, the universities of Utrecht and Maastricht announced that a new committee headed by Jan Terlouw would advise them regarding the name change. Also, in the beginning of 2007 an official report was announced, to be published by the NIOD and authorized by the Dutch Education Ministry (then scheduled for fall 2007).

===2007 NIOD report===

The report describes Rispens&#x27; presentation of Debye, as an opportunist who had no objection to the Nazis, as a caricature.

&quot;[I]t can be stated that Debye was rightly called an opportunist after his arrival in the United States. We have seen that he showed himself to be loyal to the dominant political system, first in the Third Reich and then in the United States, while at the same time keeping the back door open: in the Third Reich by retaining his Dutch nationality, in the United States by attempting to secretly maintain some contacts with Nazi Germany via the Foreign Office.&quot;

It concludes that Debye&#x27;s actions in 1933–45 were based on the nineteenth-century positivist view of science which saw research in physics as generating blessings for humankind. The report states that, by his contemporaries, Debye was considered an opportunist by some and as a man of highest character by others. The report asserts that Debye was not coerced by the Nazis into writing the infamous DPG &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; letter and that he also did not follow the lead of other societies in doing so but, rather, other societies followed his lead. The NIOD report also concludes that Debye felt obliged to send the letter and that it was, for him, simply a confirmation of an existing situation. The report argues that Debye, in the Third Reich, developed a survival method of ambiguity which allowed him to pursue his scientific career despite the political turmoil. Crucial to this survival method was the need to keep ready an escape hatch, for example in his secret dealings with the Nazis in 1941, if needed.

Yet, the report also states that the picture of Debye should not be oversimplified as Debye&#x27;s actions were also motivated by his loyalty to his daughter, who had remained in Berlin. In general, Debye developed a survival method of ambiguity, that &quot;could pull the wool over people&#x27;s eyes&quot;.

===2008 Terlouw report===
In January 2008 the Terlouw Commission advised &quot;the Boards of Utrecht and Maastricht Universities to continue to use Peter Debye’s name for the chemistry and physics institute in Utrecht, and to continue awarding the science prize in Maastricht&quot;. The Commission concluded that Debye was not a party member, was not an anti-semite, did not further Nazi propaganda, did not cooperate with the Nazi war machine, was not a collaborator, and yet also was not a resistance hero. He was a rather pragmatic, flexible, and brilliant scientist, idealistic with respect to the pursuit of science, but only superficially oriented in politics. With respect to sending out the DPG letter, the Commission concluded that Debye found the situation inescapable. The Commission pointed out that the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences also took away Albert Einstein&#x27;s honorary membership, emphasizing the circumstances in which these decisions had been taken. The Commission stated that now, seventy years later, no judgment can be made concerning the decision of Debye to sign this letter in the exceptionally difficult circumstances in which he then found himself. Nevertheless, the Commission describes the DPG letter as an extraordinarily unpleasant fact, forming a dark page in his life history. Finally, the Commission concluded that based on the NIOD report &quot;since no bad faith on Debye’s part has been demonstrated, his good faith must be assumed&quot; and recommended that the University of Utrecht retain the name of the Debye Institute of NanoMaterials Science and that the University of Maastricht continue to associate itself with the Peter Debye Prize. Utrecht University accepted the recommendation, Maastricht University did not. But in February 2008, the Hustinx Foundation (Maastricht), originator and sponsor of the Peter Debye Prize, announced that it will continue to have the prize awarded. The City of Maastricht, Debye&#x27;s birthplace, declared that it sees no reason to change the names of Debye Street and Debye Square.

===Debye the spy===
In a 2010 publication Jurrie Reiding asserts that Debye may have been an MI6 spy. Reiding discovered that Debye was befriended by the well-documented spy Paul Rosbaud. They first met around 1930 when they were both working as editors for two scientific journals. They collaborated in the escape of Lise Meitner in 1938. According to Reiding, Debye was well connected in German scientific and industrial circles and could have provided MI6 with valuable information. For example, as board member of the German Academy for Aviation Research he was acquainted with Hermann Göring. Reiding also offers an explanation for Debye&#x27;s hasty departure on 16 January 1940 for the United States: the date coincided with the planned (but later delayed) German invasion of the Netherlands a day later, information possibly provided to him by Rosbaud.

This hypothesis is contested by Philip Ball, as he notes that friendship with Rosbaud is no gauge of Debye&#x27;s political stance. Rosbaud was well-connected with many people and Debye, while he was a friend of Rosbaud&#x27;s, seems to have also felt regard for geologist Friedrich Drescher-Kaden, an ardent Nazi.

<text>The War Game is a 1966 British pseudo-documentary film that depicts a nuclear war and its aftermath. Written, directed and produced by Peter Watkins for the BBC, it caused dismay within the BBC and within government, and was withdrawn before the provisional screening date of 6 October 1965. The corporation said that &quot;the effect of the film has been judged by the BBC to be too horrifying for the medium of broadcasting. It will, however, be shown to invited audiences...&quot;

The film premiered at the National Film Theatre in London, on 13 April 1966, where it ran until 3 May. It was then shown abroad at several film festivals, including Venice where it won the Special Prize. It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1967.

The film was eventually televised in Great Britain on 31 July 1985, during the week before the fortieth anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, the day before a repeat screening of &quot;Threads&quot;.

==Synopsis==

The film begins by describing Britain&#x27;s nuclear deterrence policy of threatening would-be aggressors with devastation from the Royal Air Force&#x27;s nuclear-armed V bombers. Due to the number of V bomber bases (particularly in a crisis situation that would see them dispersed throughout Britain), as well as major civilian targets in cities, Britain is described as having more potential nuclear weapon targets per acre than any other country.

On 15 September, American forces in South Vietnam are authorised to use tactical nuclear weapons in response to an ongoing Chinese invasion. The Soviet Union and East Germany threaten to invade West Berlin if America does not change course. The next day, the British government declares a state of emergency and transfers responsibility for Britain&#x27;s day-to-day running to a body of regional commissioners. The first task of newly established emergency committees is the mass evacuation of children, mothers, and the infirm to various safe areas including Kent. Under threat of imprisonment, homeowners accommodate the evacuees, while unoccupied properties are requisitioned by the government. Rationing is implemented, booklets on how to prepare for nuclear attack are distributed, and emergency sirens are tested, with these being estimated to provide around three minutes&#x27; warning until impact, or under thirty seconds in the case of submarine attack. There are no government-built shelters, while efforts to build private ones are soon frustrated by a shortage of construction supplies.

On 18 September, the Soviets and East Germans invade West Berlin as previously threatened. NATO launches a counterattack, that is quickly overrun, resulting in the use of American tactical nuclear weapons. The Soviets immediately launch their own nuclear weapons at strategic targets, as their above-ground liquid-fuelled missiles are highly vulnerable to a NATO first strike.

In Kent, a one-megaton warhead air burst six miles from Canterbury devastates the city and its surrounding areas. At one house, a defence worker and a boy in the yard are struck by the heat wave, causing their eyeballs to melt. Furniture inside the house is ignited, and the building is then demolished by the shockwave. At another house, another boy suffers flash blindness as a consequence of looking directly at an explosion 27 miles away; his father carries him inside, and hides with the rest of his family under a table as the house is shaken by the distant shockwaves of successive explosions. In Rochester, an airburst causes a firestorm which sets the town ablaze. Meanwhile, British V bombers enter Soviet airspace to inflict similar devastation.

The attack overwhelms Kent&#x27;s emergency services, with each surviving doctor being faced with at least 350 casualties. The worst-affected victims are left to die alone or shot by police as a form of mercy killing. Cases of PTSD occur among the survivors of the attacks. Dead bodies are disposed of by being burned; to prevent relatives from interfering, destroyed areas are sealed off, and police are routinely armed. Radiation sickness is rampant, while essential supplies and utilities are non-existent or severely limited.

The majority of Britain&#x27;s remaining food supplies are reserved for those maintaining law and order, causing riots to break out over access to food and other resources. The riots soon turn into armed skirmishes between the authorities and desperate civilians; the latter are shown seizing a truck carrying a shipment of weapons and a food warehouse. Elsewhere, individuals convicted of causing civil disturbance or obstructing government officers are executed by police firing squads, with the father of the blinded boy from earlier in the film being among those shot. Due to food shortages, scurvy re-emerges as a consequence of a lack of easily-available vitamin C.

On Christmas Day in a Dover refugee facility, children orphaned in the attack are asked what they want to be when they grow up; they either &quot;don&#x27;t want to be nothing&quot; or simply remain silent. Another child is described as only having seven bedridden years to live before dying from a chronic illness resembling leukemia, while an expectant mother who was exposed to radiation is unsure if she will suffer stillbirth. In closing, the real-world press is described as saying nothing about the dangers of nuclear weaponry.

==Style==
The story is told in the style of a news magazine programme. It wavers between a pseudo-documentary and a drama film, with characters acknowledging the presence of the camera crew in some segments and others (in particular the nuclear attack) filmed as if the camera was not present. The combination of elements also qualifies it as a mondo film. It features several different strands that alternate throughout, including a documentary-style chronology of the main events, featuring reportage-like images of the war, the nuclear strikes, and their effects on civilians; brief contemporary interviews, in which passers-by are interviewed about what turns out to be their general lack of knowledge of nuclear war issues; optimistic commentary from public figures that clashes with the other images in the film; and fictional interviews with key figures as the war unfolds.

The film features a voice-over narration that describes the events depicted as plausible occurrences during and after a nuclear war. The narrator seeks to convince the viewing audience that the civil defence policies of 1965 have not realistically prepared the public for such events, particularly suggesting that the policies neglected the possibility of panic buying that would occur for building materials to construct improvised fallout shelters.

The public are generally depicted as lacking all understanding of nuclear matters with the exception of a character with a double-barrelled shotgun who successfully implemented the contemporary civil defence advice, and heavily sandbagged his home. The film does not focus on individual experiences, but rather the collective British population, who rely on government preparations and are not fully convinced of the dangers of nuclear war until the final hours before the attack.

The film often invokes historical mass casualty situations in relation to its portrayal of a post-attack situation; for example, the collection of wedding rings from dead bodies to aid their later identification is explicitly linked to a similar practice seen after the 1945 bombing of Dresden, while the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are regularly cited when discussing the physical and mental decline of survivors.

Of his intent, Watkins said:

 ... Interwoven among scenes of &quot;reality&quot; were stylized interviews with a series of &quot;establishment figures&quot; – an Anglican Bishop, a nuclear strategist, etc. The outrageous statements by some of these people (including the Bishop) – in favour of nuclear weapons, even nuclear war – were actually based on genuine quotations. Other interviews with a doctor, a psychiatrist, etc. were more sober, and gave details of the effects of nuclear weapons on the human body and mind. In this film I was interested in breaking the illusion of media-produced &quot;reality&quot;. My question was – &quot;Where is &#x27;reality&#x27;? ... in the madness of statements by these artificially-lit establishment figures quoting the official doctrine of the day, or in the madness of the staged and fictional scenes from the rest of my film, which presented the consequences of their utterances?

To this end, the docudrama employs juxtaposition by, for example, quickly cutting from the scenes of horror after an immediate escalation from military to city nuclear attacks to a snippet of a recording of a calm lecture by a person resembling Herman Kahn, a renowned RAND strategist, hypothesising that a third world war would not necessarily escalate to a stage involving &quot;the ultimate destruction of cities&quot; and, indeed, that stopping the conflict before then would give the belligerents around ten years of post-war recovery in which to prepare for the next five world wars. The effect of this juxtaposition is to make the speaker appear out of touch with the &quot;reality&quot; of rapid escalation and of the likelihood of cities being utterly destroyed as depicted immediately before his contribution. Similarly, the film briefly cuts away from the destruction inflicted on Canterbury to show a textual statement by two bishops from the Vatican&#x27;s ecumenical council who argue that the faithful &quot;should learn to live with, though need not love, the nuclear bomb, provided that it is &#x27;clean&#x27; and of a good family&quot;, before then cutting back to Canterbury&#x27;s fate, while a spoken statement by an Anglican bishop about his continued belief in &quot;a system of necessary law and order [and] in the war of the just&quot; is immediately followed by a scene of a family burning to death in their car during the Rochester firestorm.

==Production==
The film was shot in the Kent towns of Tonbridge, Gravesend, Chatham and Dover. The cast was almost entirely made up of amateur and non-actors, as was Watkins&#x27; preference, casting having taken place via a series of public meetings several months earlier; over 350 actors would ultimately take part in the production. Much of the filming of the post-strike devastation was shot at the Grand Shaft Barracks, Dover. The narration was provided by Peter Graham with Michael Aspel reading the quotations from source material.

==Release==
&quot;The War Game&quot; itself finally saw television broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC2 on 31 July 1985, as part of a special season of programming entitled &quot;After the Bomb&quot; (which had been Watkins&#x27;s original working title for &quot;The War Game&quot;). &quot;After the Bomb&quot; commemorated the 40th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The broadcast was preceded by an introduction from Ludovic Kennedy.

On 27 August 1968, nearly 250 people at a peace rally in the Edwin Lewis Quadrangle in Philadelphia, attended the screening of the film sponsored by the Pennsylvania Coalition. Like the United Kingdom, the film was also banned from National Educational Television in the United States due to its theme.

== Reception and legacy ==
The film holds a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 93% based on 14 reviews, with an average score of 8.46/10.

Roger Ebert gave the film a perfect score, calling it &quot;[o]ne of the most skillful documentary films ever made.&quot; He praised the &quot;remarkable authenticity&quot; of the firestorm sequence and describes its portrayal of bombing&#x27;s aftermath as &quot;certainly the most horrifying ever put on film (although, to be sure, greater suffering has taken place in real life, and is taking place today).&quot; &quot;They should string up bedsheets between the trees and show &quot;The War Game&quot; in every public park&quot; he concludes, &quot;It should be shown on television, perhaps right after one of those half-witted war series in which none of the stars ever gets killed.&quot; David Cornelius of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; called it &quot;one of the most disturbing, overwhelming, and downright important films ever produced.&quot; He writes that the film finds Watkins &quot;at his very best, angry and provocative and desperate to tell the truth, yet not once dipping below anything but sheer greatness from a filmmaking perspective [...] an unquestionable masterpiece of raw journalism, political commentary, and unrestrained terror.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film won the 1967 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;The War Game&quot; was placed 27th. &quot;The War Game&quot; was also voted 74th in Channel Four&#x27;s 100 Greatest Scary Moments.

<text>Civil and political rights are a class of rights that protect individuals&#x27; freedom from infringement by governments, social organizations, and private individuals. They ensure one&#x27;s entitlement to participate in the civil and political life of society and the state.

Civil rights generally include ensuring peoples&#x27; physical and mental integrity, life, and safety, protection from discrimination, the right to privacy, the freedom of thought, speech, religion, press, assembly, and movement.

Political rights include natural justice (procedural fairness) in law, such as the rights of the accused, including the right to a fair trial; due process; the right to seek redress or a legal remedy; and rights of participation in civil society and politics such as freedom of association, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right of self-defense, and the right to vote. These rights also must follow the legal norm as in they must have the force of law and fit into the system of administrative justice. A key feature in modern society is that the more a state can guarantee political rights of citizens the better the states relations are with its citizens.

Civil and political rights form the original and main part of international human rights. They comprise the first portion of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (with economic, social, and cultural rights comprising the second portion). The theory of three generations of human rights considers this group of rights to be &quot;first-generation rights&quot;, and the theory of negative and positive rights considers them to be generally negative rights.

==History==
The phrase &quot;civil rights&quot; is a translation of Latin &quot;jus civis&quot; (right of the citizen). Roman citizens could be either free (&quot;libertas&quot;) or servile (&quot;servitus&quot;), but they all had rights in law. After the Edict of Milan in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion; however, in 380, the Edict of Thessalonica required all subjects of the Roman Empire to profess Nicene Christianity. Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on Christian doctrine. According to the leaders of Kett&#x27;s Rebellion (1549), &quot;all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious blood-shedding.&quot;

In the 17th century, English common law judge Sir Edward Coke revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed such rights. The Parliament of England adopted the English Bill of Rights in 1689. It was one of the influences drawn on by George Mason and James Madison when drafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776. The Virginia declaration heavily influenced the U.S. Bill of Rights (1789).

The removal by legislation of a civil right constitutes a &quot;civil disability&quot;. In early 19th century Britain, the phrase &quot;civil rights&quot; most commonly referred to the issue of such legal discrimination against Catholics. In the House of Commons, support for civil rights was divided, with many politicians agreeing with the existing civil disabilities of Catholics. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 restored their civil rights.

In the United States, the term civil rights has been associated with the civil rights movement (1954–1968), which fought against racism. The movement also fought segregation and Jim Crow laws and this fight took place in the streets, in public places, in government, and in the courts including the Supreme Court. The civil rights movement was also not the only movement fighting for civil rights as The Black Panthers were also a group focused on fighting racism and Jim Crow.

Other things that civil rights have been associated with are not just race but also rights of Transgender and other LGBTQ individuals. These have been fights over sexuality instead of race and focused around whether these individuals may access certain spaces like bathrooms according to their sexual identity or biological sex. Gavin Grimm&#x27;s fight in Virginia over whether he could use the bathroom of his choice is a well known case in these civil right fights.

Another issue in civil rights has been the issue with police brutality in certain communities especially minority communities. This has been seen as another way for minority groups to be oppressed and their rights infringed upon. Outrage has also been a massive result of incidents caught on tape of police abusing and in some cases causing the deaths of people from minority groups such as African Americans. That is why to address the issue has been accountability to police engaging in such conduct as a way to deter other officers from committing similar actions.

==Protection of rights==
T. H. Marshall notes that civil rights were among the first to be recognized and codified, followed later by political rights and still later by social rights. In many countries, they are constitutional rights and are included in a bill of rights or similar document. They are also defined in international human rights instruments, such as the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Civil and political rights need not be codified to be protected. However, most democracies worldwide do have formal written guarantees of civil and political rights. Civil rights are considered to be natural rights. Thomas Jefferson wrote in his &quot;A Summary View of the Rights of British America&quot; that &quot;a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate.&quot;

The question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy. Although in many countries citizens are considered to have greater protections against infringement of rights than non-citizens, civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all persons. One thing to mention is that if individuals have fewer political rights than are they more likely to commit political violence such as in countries where individual rights are highly restricted. That is why it is important for countries to protect the political rights of all citizens including minority groups. This extends to racial, ethnic, tribal, and religious groups. By granting them the same rights it helps reduce the risk of political violence breaking out.

According to political scientist Salvador Santino F. Regilme Jr., analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the Global South should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors—an important perspective that has usually been systematically neglected in the social science literature.

==Other rights==
Custom also plays a role. Implied or unenumerated rights are rights that courts may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom; one example is the right to privacy in the United States, and the Ninth Amendment explicitly shows that other rights are also protected.

The United States Declaration of Independence states that people have unalienable rights including &quot;Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness&quot;. It is considered by some that the sole purpose of government is the protection of life, liberty , and property.

Some thinkers have argued that the concepts of self-ownership and cognitive liberty affirm rights to choose the food one eats, the medicine one takes, and the habit one indulges.

==Social movements for civil rights==

Civil rights guarantee equal protection under the law. When civil and political rights are not guaranteed to all as part of equal protection of laws, or when such guarantees exist on paper but are not respected in practice, opposition, legal action and even social unrest may ensue.

Civil rights movements in the United States gathered steam by 1848 with such documents as the Declaration of Sentiment. Consciously modeled after the Declaration of Independence, the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments became the founding document of the American women&#x27;s movement, and it was adopted at the Seneca Falls Convention, July 19 and 20, 1848.

Worldwide, several political movements for equality before the law occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980. These movements had a legal and constitutional aspect, and resulted in much law-making at both national and international levels. They also had an activist side, particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread. Movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included:
* the civil rights movement in the United States, where rights of black citizens had been violated;
* the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, formed in 1967 following failures in this province of the United Kingdom to respect the Roman Catholic minority&#x27;s rights; and
* movements in many Communist countries, such as the Prague Spring and Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and the uprisings in Hungary.

Most civil rights movements relied on the technique of civil resistance, using nonviolent methods to achieve their aims. In some countries, struggles for civil rights were accompanied, or followed, by civil unrest and even armed rebellion. While civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights, the process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

==Problems and analysis==

Questions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged. For example, to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other individuals, or from corporations—e.g., in what way should employment discrimination in the private sector be dealt with?

Political theory deals with civil and political rights. Robert Nozick and John Rawls expressed competing visions in Nozick&#x27;s &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; and Rawls&#x27; &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;. Other influential authors in the area include Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, and Jean Edward Smith.

==First-generation rights==
First-generation rights, often called &quot;blue&quot; rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature, as well as strongly individualistic: They serve negatively to protect the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, (in some countries) the right to keep and bear arms, freedom of religion, freedom from discrimination, and voting rights. They were pioneered in the seventeenth and eighteenth-century during the Age of Enlightenment. Political theories associated with the English, American, and French revolutions were codified in the English Bill of Rights in 1689 (a restatement of Rights of Englishmen, some dating back to Magna Carta in 1215) and more fully in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789 and the United States Bill of Rights in 1791.

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in international law first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and later in the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In Europe, they were enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights in 1953.

== Civil and political rights organizations ==

There are current organizations that exist to protect people&#x27;s civil and political rights in case they are infringed upon. The ACLU, founded in 1920, is a well-known non-profit organization that helps to preserve freedom of speech and works to change policy. Another organization is the NAACP, founded in 1909, which focuses on protecting the civil rights of minorities. The NRA is a civil rights group founded in 1871 that primarily focuses on protecting the right to bear arms. These organizations serve a variety of causes, one being the AFL–CIO, which is America&#x27;s union that represent the working-class people nationwide.

<doc id="37072" wikidata="Q201045" url="?curid=37072" title="Russian roulette">
<text>Russian roulette () is a potentially lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against the head or body (of the opponent or themselves), and pulls the trigger. If the loaded chamber aligns with the barrel, the weapon fires.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Russian roulette&quot; was possibly first used in a 1937 short story of the same name by Georges Surdez, published in the January 30, 1937, edition of &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine:
References to the term in the context of the &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; story appeared in some newspapers during 1937. The first independent appearances of the term in newspapers began in 1938 with the reports of young men being killed while playing it. The earliest instance appears to have been the death of a 21-year-old former journalism student in Austin, Texas, appearing in &quot;The Austin Statesman&quot; and some other Texas newspapers on January 8, 1938. At least four other deaths were attributed to Russian roulette during the year: a 34-year-old policeman in Peoria, Illinois, a 20-year-old in Houston, an 18-year-old in Saratoga Springs, New York, and a 16-year-old in Los Angeles.

The term has become a metaphor for taking foolhardy risks, and its usage steadily increased in reportage of diplomacy, politics, economics, medicine and sports.

== Origin ==
An early example of Russian roulette can be found in the short story &quot;The Fatalist&quot; within the 1840 novel &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot; written by Russian poet and writer Mikhail Lermontov. In the story, which is set in a Cossack village, the protagonist, Grigory Alexandrovich Pechorin, claims that there is no predestination and proposes a bet in order to prove it, laying about fifty gold pieces onto a table. A lieutenant of the dragoons of the Tsar, Vulič, a man of Serbian origins with a passion for gambling, accepts the challenge and randomly takes one of a number of pistols of various calibres from its nail, cocks it and pours gunpowder onto the pan. Nobody knows if the pistol is loaded or not. &quot;Gentlemen! Who will pay 20 gold pieces for me?&quot;, Vulič asks, putting the muzzle of the pistol to his forehead. He then asks Grigory to throw a playing card in the air, and when the card lands, he pulls the trigger. The weapon fails to fire, but when Vulič cocks the pistol again and aims it at a service cap hanging over the window, a shot rings out and smoke fills the room.

== Incidents ==
* William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor and winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics, claimed he attempted suicide by playing a solo game of Russian roulette.
* In a 1946 U.S. legal case, &quot;Commonwealth v. Malone&quot;, 47 A.2d 445 (1946), a Pennsylvania teenager&#x27;s conviction for murder in the second degree as a result of shooting a friend was upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In this case, the teenagers involved played a modified version of Russian roulette, called Russian poker, in which they took turns aiming and pulling the trigger of the revolver at each other, rather than at their own heads. The court ruled that &quot;When an individual commits an act of gross recklessness without regard to the probability that death to another is likely to result, that individual exhibits the state of mind required to uphold a conviction of manslaughter even if the individual did not intend for death to ensue.&quot;
* On 25 December 1954, American blues musician Johnny Ace killed himself in Texas, after a gun he pointed at his own head discharged.

== Lethality ==

Calculations in this section are based on the use of a six-shot revolver with a single chamber loaded. Abnormal factors, such as the possibility of a dud round, are not included.

=== Chamber respun after each trigger pull ===
With this variant, turn order is essential, because the probability of losing decreases the later one&#x27;s turn is.

Given a six-shot revolver, for any given single trial (pull), the probability of losing is formula_1. However, since all players only come into the game if and when each of the players before them has caught an empty chamber, the all-game loss probability for player formula_2 (starting from 0) is reduced to formula_3. The all-game loss probabilities for each of the six players are hence, in order, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9 to one decimal place. More generally, for a revolver with formula_10 chambers, player formula_2&#x27;s all-game loss probability is formula_12.

The probability of the revolver having fired after six pulls is formula_13, or about formula_14. More generally, for a revolver with formula_10 chambers, the probability of the revolver having fired after formula_2 pulls is formula_17, as this would be an instance of a geometric distribution where the success probability is formula_18.

The average number of pulls for the gun to fire is formula_10 in this variant (six pulls, for a six-shot revolver).

=== Chamber only spun once ===
With this variant, turn order has no effect on the all-game loss probability, which remains the same for all players, but influences the single-pull probability, which increases with each pull.

Given a six-shot revolver, at pull formula_2 (starting from 0), the fact that all formula_2 previously tested chambers were empty reduces the total number of possible locations of the bullet to formula_22, and the loss probability is therefore formula_23. The single-pull loss probabilities for each of the six players are hence, in order, formula_4, formula_25, formula_26, formula_27, formula_28, and formula_29 to 1 decimal place. More generally, for a revolver with formula_10 chambers, the loss probability at pull formula_2 (starting from 0) is formula_32.

However, since, like in the re-spinning variant, all players only come into the game if and when each of the players before them has caught an empty chamber, the all-game loss probability for player formula_2 is

formula_34

for formula_35 and formula_36 for formula_37. Hence, the all-game loss probability for all players is formula_4 to 1 decimal place.

The probability of the revolver having fired after six pulls is formula_39 or formula_29 in this variant (meaning the revolver &quot;will&quot; fire within six trigger pulls). And, more generally, after formula_2 pulls, it is formula_42.

The average number of pulls for the gun to fire is formula_43 in this variant (3.5 pulls, for a six-shot revolver).

<text>Civil disobedience is the active and professed refusal of a citizen to obey certain laws, demands, orders, or commands of a government (or any other authority). By some definitions, civil disobedience has to be nonviolent to be called &quot;civil&quot;. Hence, civil disobedience is sometimes equated with peaceful protests or nonviolent resistance. Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s essay &quot;Resistance to Civil Government&quot;, first published in 1849 and then published posthumously in 1866 as &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;, popularized the term in the US, although the concept itself was practiced long before this work. 

Various forms of civil disobedience have been used by prominent activists, such as American women&#x27;s suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony in the late 19th century, Egyptian nationalist Saad Zaghloul during the 1910s, and Indian nationalist Mahatma Gandhi in 1920s British India as part of his leadership of the Indian independence movement. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s and James Bevel&#x27;s peaceful nonviolent protests during the civil rights movement in the 1960s United States sometimes contained important aspects of civil disobedience. Although civil disobedience is rarely justifiable in court, King regarded civil disobedience to be a display and practice of reverence for law: &quot;Any man who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community on the injustice of the law is at that moment expressing the very highest respect for the law.&quot;

==History==
An early depiction of civil disobedience is in Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Antigone&quot;, in which Antigone, one of the daughters of former King of Thebes, Oedipus, defies Creon, the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial. She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law. She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.

Conrad Grebel and Anabaptists advocated civil disobedience to oppression. Étienne de La Boétie&#x27;s thought developed in his work &quot;Discours de la servitude volontaire ou le Contr&#x27;un&quot; (1552) was also taken up by many movements of civil disobedience, which drew from the concept of rebellion to voluntary servitude the foundation of its instrument of struggle. Étienne de La Boétie was one of the first to theorize and propose the strategy of non-cooperation, and thus a form of nonviolent disobedience, as a really effective weapon.

In the lead-up to the Glorious Revolution in Britain—when the 1689 Bill of Rights was documented, the last Catholic monarch was deposed, and male and female joint-co-monarchs elevated—the English Midland Enlightenment developed a manner of voicing objection to a law viewed as illegitimate and then taking the consequences of the law. (For example, they might refuse to swear allegiance to the king, and, as a consequence, accept the prison sentence legally and normally meted out to people who refused to take this oath.) This was focused on the illegitimacy of laws claimed to be &quot;divine&quot; in origin, both the &quot;divine rights of kings&quot; and &quot;divine rights of man&quot;, and the legitimacy of laws acknowledged to be made by human beings.

Following the Peterloo massacre of 1819, the poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem &quot;The Mask of Anarchy&quot; later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action. According to Ashton Nichols, it is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;, and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of &quot;Satyagraha&quot;. Gandhi&#x27;s Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley&#x27;s nonviolence in protest and political action. In particular, it is known that Gandhi often quoted Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Mask of Anarchy&quot; to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.

Thoreau&#x27;s 1849 essay &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;, originally titled &quot;Resistance to Civil Government&quot;, has had a wide influence on many later practitioners of civil disobedience. The driving idea behind the essay is that citizens are morally responsible for their support of aggressors, even when such support is required by law. In the essay, Thoreau explained his reasons for having refused to pay taxes as an act of protest against slavery and against the Mexican–American War. He writes,

If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man&#x27;s shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, &quot;I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico;—see if I would go;&quot; and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute.

By the 1850s, a range of minority groups in the United States: African Americans, Jews, Seventh Day Baptists, Catholics, anti-prohibitionists, racial egalitarians, and others—employed civil disobedience to combat a range of legal measures and public practices that to them promoted ethnic, religious, and racial discrimination. Pro Public and typically peaceful resistance to political power remained an integral tactic in modern American minority rights politics.

In Ireland starting from 1879 the Irish &quot;Land War&quot; intensified when Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell, in a speech in Ennis proposed that when dealing with tenants who take farms where another tenant was evicted, rather than resorting to violence, everyone in the locality should shun them. Following this Captain Charles Boycott, the land agent of an absentee landlord in County Mayo, Ireland, was subject to social ostracism organized by the Irish Land League in 1880. Boycott attempted to evict eleven tenants from his land. While Parnell&#x27;s speech did not refer to land agents or landlords, the tactic was applied to Boycott when the alarm was raised about the evictions. Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolated – his workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as in his house. Local businessmen stopped trading with him, and the local postman refused to deliver mail. The movement spread throughout Ireland and gave rise to the term to Boycott, and eventually led to legal reform and support for Irish independence.

Egypt saw a massive implementation on a nation-wide movement starting 1914 and peaking in 1919 as the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. This was then adopted by other peoples who campaigned against European colonial rule from 1920 onwards. Zaghloul Pasha, considered the mastermind behind this massive civil disobedience, was a native middle-class, Azhar graduate, political activist, judge, parliamentary and ex-cabinet minister whose leadership brought Christian and Muslim communities together as well as women into the massive protests. Along with his companions of Wafd Party, who have achieved an independence of Egypt and a first constitution in 1923.
Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have revolted against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India (Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s campaigns for independence from the British Empire), in Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Velvet Revolution, in early stages of the Bangladeshi independence movement against Pakistani colonialism and in East Germany to oust their Stalinist government. In South Africa during the leftist campaign against the far-right Apartheid regime, in the American civil rights movement against Jim Crow laws, in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union, and more recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2013–2014 Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine, the 2016–2017 Candlelight Revolution in South Korea, and the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests, among many other various movements worldwide.

== Etymology ==
Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s 1849 essay &quot;Resistance to Civil Government&quot; was eventually renamed &quot;Essay on Civil Disobedience&quot;. After his landmark lectures were published in 1866, the term began to appear in numerous sermons and lectures relating to slavery and the war in Mexico. Thus, by the time Thoreau&#x27;s lectures were first published under the title &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;, in 1866, four years after his death, the term had achieved fairly widespread usage.

It has been argued that the term &quot;civil disobedience&quot; has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased. Marshall Cohen notes, &quot;It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official. Indeed, for Vice President Spiro Agnew it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins.&quot;

LeGrande writes that

He encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience.

In a letter to P. K. Rao, dated 10 September 1935, Gandhi disputes that his idea of civil disobedience was derived from the writings of Thoreau:

The statement that I had derived my idea of Civil Disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong. The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay ... When I saw the title of Thoreau&#x27;s great essay, I began to use his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers. But I found that even &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase &quot;Civil Resistance.&quot;

== Theories ==
In seeking an active form of civil disobedience, one may choose to deliberately break certain laws, such as by forming a peaceful blockade or occupying a facility illegally, though sometimes violence has been known to occur. Often there is an expectation to be attacked or even beaten by the authorities. Protesters often undergo training in advance on how to react to arrest or to attack.

Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen&#x27;s relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional impasse, in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, conflict. For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country&#x27;s highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would act in his or her capacity as public official rather than private citizen.

This definition is disputed by Thoreau&#x27;s political philosophy on the conscience vs. the collective. The person is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only people act, only a person can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is a person in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau&#x27;s imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, &quot;Resign&quot;. If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. He admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is &quot;liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it&quot;. If a government did express the voice of most people, this would not compel the obedience of those who disagree with what is said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right.

In his 1971 book, &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, John Rawls described civil disobedience as &quot;a public, non-violent, conscientious yet political act contrary to law usually done with the aim of bringing about change in the law or policies of the government&quot;.

Ronald Dworkin held that there are three types of civil disobedience:
* &quot;Integrity-based&quot; civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys a law they feel is immoral, as in the case of abolitionists disobeying the fugitive slave laws by refusing to turn over escaped slaves to authorities.
* &quot;Justice-based&quot; civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys laws to lay claim to some right denied to them, as when Black people illegally protested during the civil rights movement.
* &quot;Policy-based&quot; civil disobedience occurs when a person breaks the law to change a policy they believe is dangerously wrong.

Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects &quot;a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken&quot;. The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments.

It is usually recognized that lawbreaking, if it is not done publicly, at least must be publicly announced to constitute civil disobedience. But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing their natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations. The Fully Informed Jury Association&#x27;s publication &quot;A Primer for Prospective Jurors&quot; notes, &quot;Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler&#x27;s secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.&quot; By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it. (Exodus 1: 15–19)

===Violent vs. nonviolent===
There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; includes nonviolence in its definition of civil disobedience. Christian Bay&#x27;s encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires &quot;carefully chosen and legitimate means&quot;, but holds that they do not have to be non-violent. It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedient&#x27;s use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest. Civil disobedients&#x27; refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society&#x27;s tolerance of civil disobedience.

The philosopher H. J. McCloskey argues that &quot;if violent, intimidatory, coercive disobedience is more effective, it is, other things being equal, more justified than less effective, nonviolent disobedience.&quot; In his best-selling &quot;Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order&quot;, Howard Zinn takes a similar position; Zinn states that while the goals of civil disobedience are generally nonviolent,

Zinn rejects any &quot;easy and righteous dismissal of violence&quot;, noting that Thoreau, the popularizer of the term civil disobedience, approved of the armed insurrection of John Brown. He also notes that some major civil disobedience campaigns which have been classified as non-violent, such as the Birmingham campaign, have actually included elements of violence.

===Revolutionary vs. non-revolutionary===
Non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged &quot;wrong&quot; by a person&#x27;s conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one&#x27;s political wishes on some other issue. Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs or religious beliefs). Revolution does not have to be political, i.e. &quot;cultural revolution&quot;, it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric. Gandhi&#x27;s acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience. It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc Deák directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government. Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing &quot;peaceable revolution&quot;. Howard Zinn, Harvey Wheeler, and others have identified the right espoused in the US Declaration of Independence to &quot;alter or abolish&quot; an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience.

===Collective vs. solitary===
The earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the Roman Empire. Unarmed Jews gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem. In modern times, some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met, such as favourable bail conditions, or the release of all the activists. This is a form of jail solidarity. There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience, such as that committed by Thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed. Thoreau, at the time of his arrest, was not yet a well-known author, and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened. The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office, and Thoreau&#x27;s essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.

== Choices ==
===Action===
Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Hugo A. Bedau writes,

Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the US government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law. Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna, a -tall, 600-year-old California Redwood tree for 738 days, preventing its felling.

In cases where the criminalized behaviour is pure speech, civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech. An example is WBAI&#x27;s broadcasting of the bit &quot;Filthy Words&quot; from a George Carlin comedy album, which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of &quot;FCC v. Pacifica Foundation&quot;. Threatening government officials is a way to express defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies. For example, a supporter of some tax deniers in New Hampshire, Edward and Elaine Brown, was arrested for allegedly telling the local city councillors to &quot;Wise up or die.&quot;

More generally, protesters of particular victimless crimes often see fit to openly commit that crime. Laws against public nudity, for instance, have been protested by going naked in public, and laws against cannabis consumption have been protested by openly possessing it and using it at cannabis rallies.

Some forms of civil disobedience, such as illegal boycotts, refusals to pay taxes, draft dodging, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and sit-ins, make it more difficult for a system to function. In this way, they might be considered coercive; coercive disobedience has the effect of exposing the enforcement of laws and policies, and it has even operated as an aesthetic strategy in contemporary art practice. Brownlee notes that &quot;although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue, nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion to get their issue onto the table&quot;. The Plowshares organization temporarily closed GCSB Waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes.

Electronic civil disobedience can include web site defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft and data leaks, illegal web site parodies, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage. It is distinct from other kinds of hacktivism in that the perpetrator openly reveals his identity. Virtual actions rarely succeed in completely shutting down their targets, but they often generate media attention.

Dilemma actions are designed to create a &quot;response dilemma&quot; for public authorities &quot;by forcing them to either concede some public space to protesters or make themselves look absurd or heavy-handed by acting against the protest.&quot;

===Response to punishment ===
As civil disobedience is intentionally breaking the law, people engaging in civil disobedience can expect to be arrested, criminally charged, tried, and legally punished for breaking the law. Protestors have to make choices about how to respond to each of these results. 

Al Sharpton, a civil rights and social justice activist, says that civil disobedients &quot;must be prepared to say the cause is more important than my freedom&quot; and not incorrectly believe themselves to have legal immunity or feel a sense of entitlement to break laws without being subject to the ordinary legal punishments for breaking those laws. 

==== Arrest strategies ====

Some disciplines of civil disobedience hold that the protester must submit to arrest and cooperate with the authorities. Others advocate falling limp or resisting arrest, especially when it will hinder the police from effectively responding to a mass protest.

Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether to grant a consent search of his property and whether to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect&#x27;s talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose and may be harmful. Some civil disobedients are compelled to respond to investigators&#x27; questions, sometimes by a misunderstanding of the legal ramifications or a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote,
==== Trial strategies ====
Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract, which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established, or else suffer the penalties set out in the law. Other civil disobedients who favour the existence of government still do not believe in the legitimacy of their particular government or do not believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted. Anarchistic civil disobedients do not believe in the legitimacy of any government, so see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law.

===== Pleading guilty =====
An important decision for civil disobedients is whether to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient&#x27;s duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT UP&#x27;s Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, &quot;Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don&#x27;t deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged&quot;, but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, &quot;Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I, therefore, plead not guilty.&quot; A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, &quot;I plead for the beauty that surrounds us&quot;; this is known as a &quot;creative plea&quot;, and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.

When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest. At an announced time, one by one they crossed a line and were immediately arrested. They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon. A civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the accused, advising them to plead &quot;nolo contendere&quot; rather than guilty or not guilty. They were found guilty and given suspended sentences, conditional on not reentering the test site.

Howard Zinn writes,
Sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients, as in the case of the Camden 28, in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanour count and receive no jail time. In some mass arrest situations, the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone. 

But some activists have opted to enter a blind plea, pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place. Mahatma Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court, &quot;I am here to ... submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.&quot;

===== Allocution =====
Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in allocution. In &quot;U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar&quot;, a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on US Navy property argued to the court in allocution that &quot;the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy&quot;. As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions. Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.

Tim DeChristopher gave an allocution statement to the court describing the US as &quot;a place where the rule of law was created through acts of civil disobedience&quot; and arguing, &quot;Since those bedrock acts of civil disobedience by our founding fathers, the rule of law in this country has continued to grow closer to our shared higher moral code through the civil disobedience that drew attention to legalized injustice.&quot;

===== Trial strategies =====
Steven Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty, &quot;they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience.&quot; A technical defence may enhance the chances for acquittal but increase the possibility of additional proceedings and of reduced press coverage. During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defence, but Benjamin Spock used a technical defence. In countries such as the United States, whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as &quot;Sparf v. United States&quot;, which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and &quot;United States v. Dougherty&quot;, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.

==== Choices made by the legal system ====
British judge Lord Hoffman writes that &quot;In deciding whether or not to impose punishment, the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good. This means that the objector has no right not to be punished. It is a matter for the state (including the judges) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not.&quot; Hoffman also asserted that while the &quot;rules of the game&quot; for civil disobedients were to remain non-violent while breaking the law, the authorities must recognize that demonstrators are acting out of their conscience in pursuit of democracy. &quot;When it comes to punishment, the court should take into account their personal convictions&quot;, he said.

=== Choices made by society ===
In addition to legal action, civil disobedients may be affected socially. For example, student protesters may be suspended or expelled from school. Civil disobedients may be disowned by or become estranged from their families. Some employers may prefer to hire people who did not engage in civil disobedience or fire employees who do. 

== Legal theory ==
Governments have generally not recognized the legitimacy of civil disobedience or viewed political objectives as an excuse for breaking the law. Specifically, the law usually distinguishes between criminal motive and criminal intent; the offender&#x27;s motives or purposes may be admirable and praiseworthy, but his intent may still be criminal. For example, a protester may be &quot;motivated by&quot; a desire to increase awareness about an injustice and &quot;intend&quot; to block traffic on a street, and it is the intention, rather than the motivation, that is criminally significant. Hence the saying that &quot;if there is any possible justification of civil disobedience, it must come from outside the legal system.&quot;

One theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it undermines the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished. 

Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: &quot;Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.&quot; 

During the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question. The necessity defence has sometimes been used as a shadow defence by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. Court cases such as &quot;United States v. Schoon&quot; have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defence. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance&#x27;s 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defence, and he was found guilty. Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to the association, many of them have escaped prosecution because &quot;prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter&#x27;s own jury as evidence.&quot;

Along with giving the offender his just deserts, achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment. Brownlee says &quot;Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law&#x27;s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law.&quot; 

== Actions that are outside of civil disobedience ==
Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience. 

Breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience. Likewise, a protester who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally not called a civil disobedient.

<text>Phrack is an e-zine written by and for hackers, first published November 17, 1985. It had a wide circulation which included both hackers and computer security professionals.

Originally covering subjects related to phreaking, anarchy and cracking, its articles also cover a wide range of topics including computer and physical security, hacking, cryptography, counter culture and international news.

&quot;Phrack&quot; has been described as having &quot;had its finger on the pulse of hacker culture&quot;, and being &quot;hugely influential in the early days of hacker culture&quot;.

==Publications==
===E-Zine Releases===
Issues of &quot;Phrack&quot; are divided in volumes, covering 1 or more years of publication.
===Hardcover Releases===
There were 3 hardcover releases. Each hardcover release contained most (but not all) articles of the e-zine release. Both the hardcover and e-zine were released simultaneously.

==History==
&quot;Phrack&quot;, first released on November 17, 1985, takes its name from the words &quot;phreak&quot; and &quot;hack&quot;. The founding editors of the magazine, known by the pseudonyms &quot;Taran King&quot; and &quot;Knight Lightning&quot;, edited most of the first 30 editions. Editions were originally released onto the &quot;Metal Shop&quot; bulletin board system, where Taran King was a sysop, and widely mirrored by other boards. Its headquarters was in Austin, Texas.

During its first 10 years of publication, &quot;Phrack&quot; was largely associated with telecommunications fraud, providing material for phreakers and information about arrests in the community through its Phrack World News feature articles. Along with the release of articles such as &quot;Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit&quot; and the editorship of daemon9/route in 1996, &quot;Phrack&quot;&#x27;s orientation shifted toward computer security and its focus drew closer to the current definition of hacking.

===Arrest of Knight Lightning===

The 24th issue of &quot;Phrack&quot;, released February 1989, included a document relating to the workings of Enhanced 911 emergency response systems. This document was an administrative document describing which parts of the organization are responsible for what parts of the E911 system. It had been copied from a BellSouth computer and played a major part in a series of Secret Service raids called Operation Sundevil and featured in Bruce Sterling&#x27;s book &quot;The Hacker Crackdown&quot;. &quot;Phrack&quot;&#x27;s editor, Knight Lightning, was arrested and charged with access device fraud and transportation of stolen property. The proceedings which ensued are known formally as &quot;United States v. Riggs&quot;, named for Knight Lightning&#x27;s co-defendant Robert Riggs.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed an amicus brief supporting Knight Lightning, and helped to get the case dropped by introducing a witness who showed that Bellcore was selling more detailed documentation to the E911 system for as little as $13 to anyone who asked. The E911 document had initially been valued by the prosecution at almost $80,000. The case was then dropped.

===Pre-2000===
After the arrest of Knight Lightning, and the shutdown of &quot;Phrack&quot; by the US Secret Service in late December 1989 a few weeks after issue #30 was released, some attempts were made to resurrect &quot;Phrack&quot; under the editorship of Doc Holiday and Crimson Death. However, the lack of consent from the original editor to accept this &quot;Phrack Classic&quot; led to a new editorship for issue #33 by Dispater under the name &quot;Diet Phrack&quot; until issue #41.

Issue #42 was released under the editorship of Erik Bloodaxe in 1992. In September 1994, the first &quot;Phrack&quot; website appeared with release #46, containing all the files from the previous issues.

With the growing use of the internet and interest in computer security, from 1996 &quot;Phrack&quot; became increasingly oriented toward computer security. The editorship was handed to route along with voyager until 2000 (release #56). During this period, the &quot;Phrack&quot; website was defaced several times and the magazine was often unavailable.

===Continuation after 2000===
Since 2001 Phrack has been edited under the alias Phrackstaff.

In 2005, it was announced that &quot;Phrack&quot; was to come to an end, with the 63rd issue as its last. To commemorate &quot;Phrack&quot;&#x27;s final appearance, the issue was to be a hardback edition, released simultaneously at the DEF CON and What the Hack conventions on July 29. An e-zine version of the release followed on August 1. The European printer for the hardcopies of &quot;Phrack&quot; to be distributed at Defcon refused to fulfil the order once they realized that they were printing a hacking book. Two University of Arizona students filled the gap and printed between 100 and 200 copies of &quot;Phrack&quot; 63 in time for release at Defcon 13. The copies of &quot;Phrack&quot; 63 distributed at Defcon 13 are each stamped with a &quot;serial&quot; number on the inside of the last page. It is believed that there are 100 numbered copies of &quot;Phrack&quot; 63 distributed at Defcon. All copies were hand cut and bound; unnumbered copies may be unreleased &quot;extras&quot;, or may have cutting errors that meant they were deemed them unfit for distribution.

Issue 63 told readers to &quot;expect a new release&quot;, and on May 27, 2007, issue 64 was released by a new board of editors referring to themselves as &quot;The Circle of Lost Hackers&quot; (TCLH). TCLH released issue #65 of &quot;Phrack&quot; on April 11, 2008 and issue #66 on June 11, 2009 and so on upto latest release of #71 on 2024-08-19 by Phrack Staff.
==Content==
&quot;Phrack&quot; issues are released irregularly, and issues are grouped into volumes. Each issue comprises a number of Philes: stand-alone text files of technical or counter-cultural content. Philes are submitted by members of the hacker underground community, and are reviewed by the editors.

In addition to technical articles, &quot;Phrack&quot; also provided a focus for news and gossip among the hacker community.

In the 1990 National Computer Security Conference, Sheldon Zenner and Dorothy Denning suggested that &quot;Phrack&quot; articles contained the same factual content in computer and security magazines, but differed in tone.

===Notable articles===
&quot;Phrack&quot; is especially popular due to the general high standard of the releases compared to other underground zines, but has made its reputation from a number of high-quality articles.
* &quot;\/\The Conscience of a Hacker/\/ (aka the Hacker Manifesto)&quot; by The Mentor has been an inspiration to young hackers since the 1980s, having been published in the 7th issue of &quot;Phrack&quot;.
* &quot;Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit&quot; by Aleph One, published in issue 49, is the &quot;classic paper&quot; on stack buffer overflows, partly responsible for popularizing the vulnerability.
* &quot;The Art of Scanning&quot; by Fyodor, published September 1, 1997 in Issue 51 introduced the nmap Internet scanning tool.

===Regular features===
Several regular columns are present in most issues of &quot;Phrack&quot;, such as:
* Prophile - a profile of an influential individual from the hacking underground.
* Loopback - answers to emails received by the phrack staff.
* Phrack World News - a compilation of reports on the latest counter-culture events.
* International Scenes - a compilation of testimonies from hackers around the world focusing on national and international activities.

<text>Godfrey Reggio (born 1940) is an American director of experimental documentary films.

==Life==
Reggio was born in New Orleans in 1940 to a Catholic family. He left home at age 14 to join the Catholic Christian Brotherhood. He became a monk, and spent 14 years in silence and prayer during his training.

During the 1950s and 60s, Reggio worked as a social activist with Chicano street gangs with the Brotherhood in New Mexico. One of the brothers introduced him to the film &quot;Los Olvidados&quot; by the Spanish-French-Mexican surrealist filmmaker Luis Bunuel which influenced him greatly. He also acknowledges Artavazd Peleshyan, a documentary-poet, who was a mentor and friend.

==Early work==
Reggio helped found the Institute for Regional Education in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a non-profit foundation. He became a founder of &quot;La Clinica de la Gente&quot; a facility providing medical care and service to 12,000 community members in northern New Mexico&#x27;s barrios, as well as founding the Young Citizens for Action, a project aiding juveniles in the street gangs of Santa Fe.

Reggio worked with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico in 1972, to develop a media campaign dealing with the loss of privacy and the rise of surveillance, as well as the militarization of police in the U.S. during the post-Vietnam War era. The media campaign was presented on television, radio, billboards and in major newspapers.

==Filmmaker==
Reggio is widely known for his wordless filmography, especially the trilogy of &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;: “&quot;Life Out of Balance”; Powaqqatsi:&quot; “&quot;Life in Transformation&quot;”; and &quot;Naqoyqatsi:&quot; “&quot;Life as War”&quot;. The film titles are taken from the Hopi language. His short film &quot;Evidence&quot; explores the effect of cinema on the minds of children, and his documentary &quot;Anima Mundi&quot; is a montage of images of over seventy animal species. His film &quot;Visitors&quot;, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, consists for the most part of extended slow-motion closeups of people&#x27;s faces, looking directly into the camera.

Reggio’s latest film, &quot;Once Within a Time&quot;, was produced by Steven Soderbergh &amp; Alexander Rodnyansky and had its world premiere at Santa Fe International Film Festival (SFiFF) in October 2022. The festival awarded him the Lifetime Achievement Award.

For many years, he has collaborated with the composer Philip Glass on the musical and orchestral soundtracks that augment Reggio’s wordless films. He also collaborates with Jon Kane, a fellow filmmaker.

In 2014, Reggio was recognized by the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City with a full career retrospective titled &quot;Life with Technology: The Cinema of Godfrey Reggio&quot;.

The bulk of Reggio&#x27;s cinematic records, manuscripts, papers, photographs, film rolls, over forty years, have been acquired by Harvard University&#x27;s Houghton Library, and the Harvard Film Archive.

His work continues with the Godfrey Reggio Foundation, which his wife Marti started in 2024. 

=== Influences ===
In an interview with &quot;Revus et Corriges,&quot; Reggio stated that he was particularly influenced by the work of experimental filmmakers such as Stan Brakhage and Maya Deren. Like these filmmakers, Reggio uses film as a medium for exploring the boundaries of perception and consciousness, using the camera as a tool for capturing the unseen and the intangible.

==Personal life==
Since the 1960s, Reggio has lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
