<text>Sir William Wallace (, ; Norman French: ; 23 August 1305) was a Scottish knight who became one of the main leaders during the First War of Scottish Independence.

Along with Andrew Moray, Wallace defeated an English army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in September 1297. He was appointed Guardian of Scotland and served until his defeat at the Battle of Falkirk in July 1298. In August 1305, Wallace was captured in Robroyston, near Glasgow, and handed over to King Edward I of England, who had him hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason and crimes against English civilians.

Since his death, Wallace has obtained a legendary status beyond his homeland. He is the protagonist of Blind Harry&#x27;s 15th-century epic poem &quot;The Wallace&quot; and the subject of literary works by Jane Porter and Sir Walter Scott, and of the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Braveheart&quot;.

==Background==
William Wallace was a member of the lesser nobility, but little is definitely known of his family history or even his parentage. William&#x27;s own seal, found on a letter sent to the Hanse city of Lübeck in 1297, gives his father&#x27;s name as Alan Wallace. This Alan Wallace may be the same as the one listed in the 1296 Ragman Rolls as a crown tenant in Ayrshire, but there is no additional confirmation. Others have speculated this Alan held Ellerslie, near Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, and if true, the estate could be a possible birthplace for William, though there is no record of Wallaces holding the estate in the mid-13th century. Blind Harry&#x27;s late-15th-century poem offers an alternate father for William, a Sir Malcolm of Elderslie, in Renfrewshire, and has similarly given rise to a possible birthplace for William. There is no contemporary evidence linking him with either location, although both areas had connections with the wider Wallace family. Records show early members of the family as holding estates at Riccarton, Tarbolton, Auchincruive in Kyle and Stenton in East Lothian. They were vassals of James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland as their lands fell within his territory. It has been claimed that Wallace&#x27;s brothers Malcolm and John are known from other sources, but there is a lack of verifiable evidence for John&#x27;s relationship with William.

The origins of the Wallace surname and its association with southwest Scotland are also far from certain, other than the name&#x27;s being derived from the Old English (pronounced ), meaning or . It is possible that all the Wallaces in the Clyde area were medieval immigrants from Wales, but, as the term was also used for the Cumbric-speaking Strathclyde kingdom of the Celtic Britons, it seems equally likely that the surname refers to people who were seen as being &quot;Welsh&quot; due to their Cumbric language.

== Military career ==
===Political crisis in Scotland===
When Wallace was growing up, King Alexander III ruled Scotland. His reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability. On 19 March 1286, however, Alexander died after falling from his horse. The heir to the throne was Alexander&#x27;s granddaughter, Margaret, Maid of Norway. As she was still a child and in Norway, the Scottish lords set up a government of guardians. Margaret fell ill on the voyage to Scotland and died in Orkney in late September 1290. The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the &quot;Great Cause&quot;, with a total of thirteen contenders laying claim to the throne. The most credible claims were John Balliol and Robert Bruce, grandfather of the future king Robert the Bruce.

With Scotland threatening to descend into civil war, King Edward I of England was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate. Before the process could begin, he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as Lord Paramount of Scotland. In early November 1292, at a great feudal court held in the castle at Berwick-upon-Tweed, judgment was given in favour of John Balliol having the strongest claim in law based on being senior in genealogical primogeniture even though not in proximity of blood.

Edward proceeded to take steps to progressively undermine John&#x27;s authority, treating Scotland as a feudal vassal state, demanding homage be paid towards himself and military support in his war against France—even summoning King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff. The Scots soon tired of their deeply compromised king, and the direction of affairs was allegedly taken out of his hands by the leading men of the kingdom, who appointed a Council of Twelve—in practice, a new panel of Guardians—at Stirling in July 1295. They went on to conclude a treaty of mutual assistance with France—known in later years as the Auld Alliance.

In retaliation for Scotland&#x27;s treaty with France, Edward I invaded, storming Berwick-upon-Tweed and commencing the Wars of Scottish Independence. The Scots were defeated at Dunbar and the English took Dunbar Castle on 27 April 1296. Edward forced John to abdicate, which he did at Stracathro near Montrose on 10 July 1296. Here the arms of Scotland were formally torn from John&#x27;s surcoat, giving him the abiding name of &quot;Toom Tabard&quot; (empty coat). By July, Edward had instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1,800 Scottish nobles (many of the rest being prisoners of war at that time).

===Silent years prior to the Wars of Independence===
Some historians believe Wallace must have had some earlier military experience in order to lead a successful military campaign in 1297. Campaigns like Edward I of England&#x27;s wars in Wales might have provided a good opportunity for a younger son of a landholder to become a mercenary soldier. Wallace&#x27;s personal seal bears the archer&#x27;s insignia, so he may have fought as an archer in Edward&#x27;s army.

Walter Bower&#x27;s mid-15th-century Scotichronicon, states that Wallace was &quot;a tall man with the body of a giant ... with lengthy flanks ... broad in the hips, with strong arms and legs ... with all his limbs very strong and firm&quot;. Blind Harry&#x27;s late 15th-century poem The Wallace, asserts Wallace reached seven feet.

===Start of the uprising===

The first act definitely known to have been carried out by Wallace was his killing of William de Heselrig, the English High Sheriff of Lanark, in May 1297. He then joined with William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas, and they carried out the raid of Scone. This was one of several rebellions taking place across Scotland, including those of several Scottish nobles and Andrew Moray in the north.

The uprising suffered a blow when the nobles submitted to the English at Irvine in July. Wallace and Moray were not involved and continued their rebellions. Wallace used the Ettrick Forest as a base for raiding and attacked Wishart&#x27;s palace at Ancrum. Wallace and Moray met and joined their forces, possibly at the siege of Dundee in early September.

====Battle of Stirling Bridge====

On 11 September 1297, an army jointly led by Wallace and Andrew Moray won the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Although vastly outnumbered, the Scottish army routed the English army. John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey&#x27;s feudal army of 3,000 cavalry and 8,000 to 10,000 infantry met disaster as they crossed over to the north side of the river. The narrowness of the bridge prevented many soldiers from crossing together (possibly as few as three men abreast), so, while the English soldiers crossed, the Scots held back until half of them had passed and then killed the English as quickly as they could cross. The infantry were sent on first, followed by heavy cavalry. The Scots&#x27; schiltron formations forced the infantry back into the advancing cavalry. A pivotal charge, led by one of Wallace&#x27;s captains, caused some of the English soldiers to retreat as others pushed forward, and under the overwhelming weight, the bridge collapsed, and many English soldiers drowned. Thus, the Scots won a significant victory, boosting the confidence of their army. Hugh de Cressingham, Edward&#x27;s treasurer in Scotland, died in the fighting and it is reputed that his body was subsequently flayed, and the skin cut into small pieces as tokens of the victory. The Lanercost Chronicle records that Wallace had &quot;a broad strip [of Cressingham&#x27;s skin] ... taken from the head to the heel, to make therewith a baldrick for his sword&quot;.

After the battle, Moray and Wallace assumed the title of Guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland on behalf of King John Balliol. Moray died of wounds suffered on the battlefield sometime in late 1297.

Wallace soon mounted an invasion of northern England, crossing into Northumberland. The Scots army followed the English army fleeing south. Caught between two armies, hundreds of refugees fled to safety behind the walls of Newcastle. The Scots laid waste a swathe of countryside before turning west into Cumberland and pillaging all the way to Cockermouth, before Wallace led his men back into Northumberland and fired 700 villages. Wallace then returned from England laden with booty.

In a ceremony, at the &#x27;Kirk o&#x27; the Forest&#x27; (Selkirk), towards the end of the year, Wallace was knighted. This would have been carried out by one of three Scottish earls— Carrick (Robert the Bruce), Strathearn, or Lennox.

====Battle of Falkirk====
In April 1298, Edward ordered a second invasion of Scotland. Two days prior to the battle 25,781 foot soldiers were paid. More than half of them would have been Welsh. There are no clear cut sources for the presence of cavalry, but it is safe to assume that Edward had roughly 1,500 horse under his command. They plundered Lothian and regained some castles, but failed to bring William Wallace to combat; the Scots shadowed the English army, intending to avoid battle until shortages of supplies and money forced Edward to withdraw, at which point the Scots would harass his retreat. The English quartermasters&#x27; failure to prepare for the expedition left morale and food supplies low, and a resulting riot within Edward&#x27;s own army had to be put down by his cavalry. In July, while planning a return to Edinburgh for supplies, Edward received intelligence that the Scots were encamped nearby at Falkirk, and he moved quickly to engage them in the pitched battle he had long hoped for.

Wallace arranged his spearmen in four schiltrons—circular, defensive hedgehog formations, probably surrounded by wooden stakes connected with ropes, to keep the infantry in formation. The English, however, employed Welsh longbowmen, who swung tactical superiority in their favour. The English proceeded to attack with cavalry and put the Scottish archers to flight. The Scottish cavalry withdrew as well, due to its inferiority to the English heavy horses. Edward&#x27;s men began to attack the schiltrons, which were still able to inflict heavy casualties on the English cavalry. It remains unclear whether the infantry shooting bolts, arrows and stones at the spearmen proved the deciding factor, although it is very likely that it was the arrows of Edward&#x27;s bowmen. Gaps in the schiltrons soon appeared, and the English exploited these to crush the remaining resistance. The Scots lost many men, including John de Graham. Wallace escaped, though his military reputation suffered badly.

By September 1298, Wallace resigned as Guardian of Scotland in favour of Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick and future king, and John Comyn, King John Balliol&#x27;s nephew.

Details of Wallace&#x27;s activities after this are vague, but there is some evidence that he left on a mission to the court of King Philip IV of France to plead the case for assistance in the Scottish struggle for independence. There is a surviving letter from the French king dated 7 November 1300 to his envoys in Rome demanding that they should help Sir William. It also suggests that Wallace intended to travel to Rome, although it is not known if he did. There is also a report from an English spy at a meeting of Scottish leaders, where they said Wallace was in France.

By 1304 Wallace was back in Scotland and involved in skirmishes at Happrew and Earnside.

===Capture and execution===

Wallace evaded capture by the English until 5 August 1305, when John de Menteith, a Scottish knight loyal to Edward, turned Wallace over to English soldiers at Robroyston, near Glasgow, a site commemorated by a small monument in the form of a Celtic cross. Letters of safe conduct from Haakon V of Norway, Philip IV of France and John Balliol, along with other documents, were found in Wallace&#x27;s possession and delivered to Edward by John de Segrave.

Wallace was transported to London and taken to Westminster Hall. There he was tried for treason, for which his defence was that he, unlike most of the other Scottish leaders, had never sworn allegiance to Edward. He was also charged with committing atrocities against civilians in war, &quot;sparing neither age nor sex, monk nor nun&quot;. As a result, the trial has attracted the attention of modern legal scholarship as it is one of the earliest examples of what would now be considered a prosecution for war crimes. It is one of only three known pre-modern trials which raised, in today&#x27;s terms, issues of international humanitarian law.
Following the trial, on 23 August 1305, Wallace was taken from the hall to the Tower of London, then stripped naked and dragged through the city at the heels of a horse to the Elms at Smithfield. He was hanged, drawn and quartered—strangled by hanging, but released while he was still alive, emasculated, eviscerated (with his bowels burned before him), beheaded, then cut into four parts. Wallace&#x27;s head was dipped in tar and placed on a spike atop London Bridge. His preserved head was later joined by the heads of his brother John and his compatriots Simon Fraser and John of Strathbogie. Wallace&#x27;s limbs were displayed, separately, in Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling and Perth. A plaque unveiled 8 April 1956 stands in a wall of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital near the site of Wallace&#x27;s execution at Smithfield. It includes in Latin the words (&quot;I tell you the truth: Freedom is what is best. Son, never live your life like a slave&quot;), and in Gaelic (&quot;Death and Victory&quot;), an old Scottish battle cry.

In 1869, the Wallace Monument was erected, close to the site of his victory at Stirling Bridge. The Wallace Sword, which supposedly belonged to Wallace, although some parts were made at least 160 years later, was held for many years in Dumbarton Castle and is now in the Wallace Monument.

== In popular culture ==
===Film===
* A popular depiction of Wallace&#x27;s life is presented in the film &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), directed by and starring Mel Gibson as Wallace, written by Randall Wallace, and filmed in Scotland and Ireland. The film was criticised for many historical inaccuracies.
* In the film &quot;Outlaw King&quot; (2018), Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine) is prompted to plan a revolt against the English after observing rioting induced by the public display of the quartered body of Wallace. A prior scene featuring a withered Wallace conferring with Bruce was cut from the film after an initial screening at TIFF.

===Literature===

* Blind Harry&#x27;s 15th-century poem has been a major influence on the legend of Wallace, including details like a wife named Marion Braidfute, and claiming that Wallace killed the Sheriff of Lanark in revenge for the killing of his wife. However much of this poem is unsubstantiated, at variance with contemporary sources, or disputed by historians.
* In 1793, Robert Burns wrote the lyrics to &quot;Scots Wha Hae wi Wallace bled&quot;.
* Jane Porter penned a romantic version of the Wallace legend in the historical novel &quot;The Scottish Chiefs&quot; (1810).
* In her prize-winning poem of 1819, &quot;Wallace&#x27;s Invocation to Bruce&quot;, Felicia Hemans imagines Wallace urging Bruce to continue the struggle for freedom after defeat at the Battle of Falkirk.
* In 1828, Walter Scott wrote of &quot;The Story of Sir William Wallace&quot; in his &quot;Tales of a Grandfather&quot; (first series).
* G. A. Henty wrote a novel about this time period titled &quot;In Freedom&#x27;s Cause: A Story of Wallace and Bruce&quot; (1885). Henty, a producer of and writer for the &quot;Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot; story paper, portrays the life of William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, The Black Douglas and others, while dovetailing the events of his novel with historical fiction.
* Nigel Tranter wrote a historical novel titled &quot;The Wallace&quot; (1975), &quot;admirably free of anything to do with Braveheart&quot;.
* &quot;The Temple and the Stone&quot; (1998), a novel by Katherine Kurtz and Deborah Turner Harris, includes a storyline creating a fictional connection between Wallace and Templar Knights.

===Gaming===
* Wallace is the subject and protagonist of the tutorial campaign in realtime strategy game &quot;Age of Empires II&quot;.
* William Wallace may appear during 1290-1296 at the County of Lennox in Crusader Kings III.

===Beer===
* A number of beers are named for Wallace. A brewery in Bridge of Allan, Scotland, makes a Scottish ale named &quot;William Wallace&quot;, and Scottish Maclays Brewery had a beer called &quot;Wallace&quot;.

<doc id="33833" wikidata="Q214969" url="?curid=33833" title="Willard Van Orman Quine">
<text>Willard Van Orman Quine (; known to his friends as &quot;Van&quot;; June 25, 1908 – December 25, 2000) was an American philosopher and logician in the analytic tradition, recognized as &quot;one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century&quot;. He was the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard University from 1956 to 1978.

Quine was a teacher of logic and set theory. He was famous for his position that first order logic is the only kind worthy of the name, and developed his own system of mathematics and set theory, known as New Foundations. In the philosophy of mathematics, he and his Harvard colleague Hilary Putnam developed the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities. He was the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not conceptual analysis, but continuous with science; it is the abstract branch of the empirical sciences. This led to his famous quip that &quot;philosophy of science is philosophy enough&quot;. He led a &quot;systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself&quot; and developed an influential naturalized epistemology that tried to provide &quot;an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input&quot;. He also advocated holism in science, known as the Duhem–Quine thesis.

His major writings include the papers &quot;On What There Is&quot; (1948), which elucidated Bertrand Russell&#x27;s theory of descriptions and contains Quine&#x27;s famous dictum of ontological commitment, &quot;To be is to be the value of a variable&quot;, and &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot; (1951), which attacked the traditional analytic-synthetic distinction and reductionism, undermining the then-popular logical positivism, advocating instead a form of semantic holism and ontological relativity. They also include the books &quot;The Web of Belief&quot; (1970), which advocates a kind of coherentism, and &quot;Word and Object&quot; (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine&#x27;s famous indeterminacy of translation thesis, advocating a behaviorist theory of meaning.

==Biography==
Quine&#x27;s parents were Robert Cloyd Quine and Harriet Ellis Van Orman. Quine grew up in Akron, Ohio, where he lived with his parents and older brother Robert Cloyd. His father was a manufacturing entrepreneur (founder of the Akron Equipment Company, which produced tire molds) and his mother was a schoolteacher and housewife. Quine became an atheist around the age of 9 and remained one for the rest of his life.

=== Education ===
Quine received his B.A. &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in mathematics from Oberlin College in 1930, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University in 1932. His thesis supervisor was Alfred North Whitehead. He was then appointed a Harvard Junior Fellow, which excused him from having to teach for four years. During the academic year 1932–33, he travelled in Europe thanks to a Sheldon Fellowship, meeting Polish logicians (including Stanislaw Lesniewski and Alfred Tarski) and members of the Vienna Circle (including Rudolf Carnap), as well as the logical positivist A. J. Ayer. It was in Prague that Quine developed a passion for philosophy, thanks to Carnap, whom he defined as his &quot;true and only &quot;.

=== World War II ===
Quine arranged for Tarski to be invited to the September 1939 Unity of Science Congress in Cambridge, for which the Jewish Tarski sailed on the last ship to leave Danzig before Nazi Germany invaded Poland and triggered World War II. Tarski survived the war and worked another 44 years in the US. During the war, Quine lectured on logic in Brazil, in Portuguese, and served in the United States Navy in a military intelligence role, deciphering messages from German submarines, and reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. Quine could lecture in French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish as well as his native English.

=== Personal ===
He had four children by two marriages. Guitarist Robert Quine was his nephew.

Quine was politically conservative, but the bulk of his writing was in technical areas of philosophy removed from direct political issues. He did, however, write in defense of several conservative positions: for example, he wrote in defense of moral censorship; while, in his autobiography, he made some criticisms of American postwar academics.

=== Harvard ===
At Harvard, Quine helped supervise the Harvard graduate theses of, among others, David Lewis, Gilbert Harman, Dagfinn Føllesdal, Hao Wang, Hugues LeBlanc, Henry Hiz and George Myro. For the academic year 1964–1965, Quine was a fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University. In 1980
Quine received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Humanities at Uppsala University, Sweden.

Quine&#x27;s student Dagfinn Føllesdal noted that Quine suffered from memory loss towards his final years. The deterioration of his short-term memory was so severe that he struggled to continue following arguments. Quine also had considerable difficulty in his project to make the desired revisions to &quot;Word and Object&quot;. Before passing away, Quine noted to Morton White: &quot;I do not remember what my illness is called, Althusser or Alzheimer, but since I cannot remember it, it must be Alzheimer.&quot; He died from the illness on Christmas Day in 2000.

==Work==
Quine&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis and early publications were on formal logic and set theory. Only after World War II did he, by virtue of seminal papers on ontology, epistemology and language, emerge as a major philosopher. By the 1960s, he had worked out his &quot;naturalized epistemology&quot; whose aim was to answer all substantive questions of knowledge and meaning using the methods and tools of the natural sciences. Quine roundly rejected the notion that there should be a &quot;first philosophy&quot;, a theoretical standpoint somehow prior to natural science and capable of justifying it. These views are intrinsic to his naturalism.

Like the majority of analytic philosophers, who were mostly interested in systematic thinking, Quine evinced little interest in the philosophical canon: only once did he teach a course in the history of philosophy, on David Hume, in 1946.

===Logic===

Over the course of his career, Quine published numerous technical and expository papers on formal logic, some of which are reprinted in his &quot;Selected Logic Papers&quot; and in &quot;The Ways of Paradox&quot;. His most well-known collection of papers is &quot;From A Logical Point of View&quot;. Quine confined logic to classical bivalent first-order logic, hence to truth and falsity under any (nonempty) universe of discourse. Hence the following were not logic for Quine:

* Higher-order logic and set theory. He referred to higher-order logic as &quot;set theory in disguise&quot;;
* Much of what &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; included in logic was not logic for Quine.
* Formal systems involving intensional notions, especially modality. Quine was especially hostile to modal logic with quantification, a battle he largely lost when Saul Kripke&#x27;s relational semantics became canonical for modal logics.

Quine wrote three undergraduate texts on formal logic:
* &quot;Elementary Logic&quot;. While teaching an introductory course in 1940, Quine discovered that extant texts for philosophy students did not do justice to quantification theory or first-order predicate logic. Quine wrote this book in 6 weeks as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; solution to his teaching needs.
* &quot;Methods of Logic&quot;. The four editions of this book resulted from a more advanced undergraduate course in logic Quine taught from the end of World War II until his 1978 retirement.
* &quot;Philosophy of Logic&quot;. A concise and witty undergraduate treatment of a number of Quinian themes, such as the prevalence of use-mention confusions, the dubiousness of quantified modal logic, and the non-logical character of higher-order logic.

&quot;Mathematical Logic&quot; is based on Quine&#x27;s graduate teaching during the 1930s and 1940s. It shows that much of what &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; took more than 1000 pages to say can be said in 250 pages. The proofs are concise, even cryptic. The last chapter, on Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem and Tarski&#x27;s indefinability theorem, along with the article Quine (1946), became a launching point for Raymond Smullyan&#x27;s later lucid exposition of these and related results.

Quine&#x27;s work in logic gradually became dated in some respects. Techniques he did not teach and discuss include analytic tableaux, recursive functions, and model theory. His treatment of metalogic left something to be desired. For example, &quot;Mathematical Logic&quot; does not include any proofs of soundness and completeness. Early in his career, the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic. His later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. Set against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method (as exposited in his &quot;Methods of Logic&quot;) for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas, the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights, and the fine prose in which he expressed them.

Most of Quine&#x27;s original work in formal logic from 1960 onwards was on variants of his predicate functor logic, one of several ways that have been proposed for doing logic without quantifiers. For a comprehensive treatment of predicate functor logic and its history, see Quine (1976). For an introduction, see ch. 45 of his &quot;Methods of Logic&quot;.

Quine was very warm to the possibility that formal logic would eventually be applied outside of philosophy and mathematics. He wrote several papers on the sort of Boolean algebra employed in electrical engineering, and with Edward J. McCluskey, devised the Quine–McCluskey algorithm of reducing Boolean equations to a minimum covering sum of prime implicants.

===Set theory===
While his contributions to logic include elegant expositions and a number of technical results, it is in set theory that Quine was most innovative. He always maintained that mathematics required set theory and that set theory was quite distinct from logic. He flirted with Nelson Goodman&#x27;s nominalism for a while but backed away when he failed to find a nominalist grounding of mathematics.

Over the course of his career, Quine proposed three axiomatic set theories.
* New Foundations, NF, creates and manipulates sets using a single axiom schema for set admissibility, namely an axiom schema of stratified comprehension, whereby all individuals satisfying a stratified formula compose a set. A stratified formula is one that type theory would allow, were the ontology to include types. However, Quine&#x27;s set theory does not feature types. The metamathematics of NF are curious. NF allows many &quot;large&quot; sets the now-canonical ZFC set theory does not allow, even sets for which the axiom of choice does not hold. Since the axiom of choice holds for all finite sets, the failure of this axiom in NF proves that NF includes infinite sets. The consistency of NF relative to other formal systems adequate for mathematics is an open question, albeit that a number of candidate proofs are current in the NF community suggesting that NF is equiconsistent with Zermelo set theory without Choice. A modification of NF, NFU, due to R. B. Jensen and admitting urelements (entities that can be members of sets but that lack elements), turns out to be consistent relative to Peano arithmetic, thus vindicating the intuition behind NF. NF and NFU are the only Quinean set theories with a following. For a derivation of foundational mathematics in NF, see Rosser (1952);
* The set theory of &quot;Mathematical Logic&quot; is NF augmented by the proper classes of von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, except axiomatized in a much simpler way;
* The set theory of &quot;Set Theory and Its Logic&quot; does away with stratification and is almost entirely derived from a single axiom schema. Quine derived the foundations of mathematics once again. This book includes the definitive exposition of Quine&#x27;s theory of virtual sets and relations, and surveyed axiomatic set theory as it stood circa 1960.

All three set theories admit a universal class, but since they are free of any hierarchy of types, they have no need for a distinct universal class at each type level.

Quine&#x27;s set theory and its background logic were driven by a desire to minimize posits; each innovation is pushed as far as it can be pushed before further innovations are introduced. For Quine, there is but one connective, the Sheffer stroke, and one quantifier, the universal quantifier. All polyadic predicates can be reduced to one dyadic predicate, interpretable as set membership. His rules of proof were limited to modus ponens and substitution. He preferred conjunction to either disjunction or the conditional, because conjunction has the least semantic ambiguity. He was delighted to discover early in his career that all of first order logic and set theory could be grounded in a mere two primitive notions: abstraction and inclusion. For an elegant introduction to the parsimony of Quine&#x27;s approach to logic, see his &quot;New Foundations for Mathematical Logic&quot;, ch. 5 in his &quot;From a Logical Point of View&quot;.

=== Metaphysics ===
Quine has had numerous influences on contemporary metaphysics. He coined the term &quot;abstract object&quot;. He also, in his famous essay &quot;On What There is&quot;, coined the term &quot;Plato&#x27;s beard&quot; to refer to the problem of empty names: 

Suppose now that two philosophers, McX and I, differ over ontology. Suppose McX maintains there is something which I maintain there is not. McX can, quite consistently with his own point of view, describe our difference of opinion by saying that I refuse to recognize certain entities...When I try to formulate our difference of opinion, on the other hand, I seem to be in a predicament. I cannot admit that there are some things which McX countenances and I do not, for in admitting that there are such things I should be contradicting my own rejection of them...This is the old Platonic riddle of nonbeing. Nonbeing must in some sense be, otherwise what is it that there is not? This tangled doctrine might be nicknamed &quot;Plato&#x27;s beard&quot;: historically it has proved tough, frequently dulling the edge of Occam’s razor.

Quine was unsympathetic, however, to the claim that saying &#x27;X does not exist&#x27; is a tacit acceptance of X&#x27;s existence and, thus, a contradiction. Appealing to Bertrand Russell and his theory of &quot;singular descriptions&quot;, Quine explains how Russell was able to make sense of &quot;complex descriptive names&quot; (&#x27;the present King of France&#x27;, &#x27;the author of &quot;Waverly&quot;″, etc.) by thinking about them as merely &quot;fragments of the whole sentences&quot;. For example, &#x27;The author of &quot;Waverly&quot; was a poet&#x27; becomes &#x27;some thing is such that it is the author of &quot;Waverly&quot; and was a poet, and nothing else is such that it is the author of &quot;Waverly&quot;&#x27;.

Using this sort of analysis with the word &#x27;Pegasus&#x27; (that which Quine is wanting to assert does not exist), he turns Pegasus into a description. Turning the word &#x27;Pegasus&#x27; into a description is to turn &#x27;Pegasus&#x27; into a predicate, to use a term of First-order logic: i.e. a property. As such, when we say &#x27;Pegasus&#x27;, we are really saying &#x27;the thing that is Pegasus&#x27; or &#x27;the thing that &quot;Pegasizes&quot;&#x27;. This introduces, to use another term from logic, bound variables (ex: &#x27;everything&#x27;, &#x27;something,&#x27; etc.) As Quine explains, bound variables, &quot;far from purpoting to be names specifically...do not purport to be names at all: they refer to entities generally, with a kind of studied ambiguity peculiar to themselves.&quot;

Putting it another way, to say &#x27;I hate everything&#x27; is a very different statement than saying &#x27;I hate Bertrand Russell&#x27;, because the words &#x27;Bertrand Russell&#x27; are a proper name that refer to a very specific person. Whereas the word &#x27;everything&#x27; is a placeholder. It does not refer to a specific entity or entities. Quine is able, therefore, to make a meaningful claim about Pegasus&#x27; nonexistence for the simple reason that the placeholder (a thing) happens to be empty. It just so happens that the world does not contain a thing that is such that it is winged and it is a horse. 

====Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction====

In the 1930s and 40s, discussions with Rudolf Carnap, Nelson Goodman and Alfred Tarski, among others, led Quine to doubt the tenability of the distinction between &quot;analytic&quot; statements—those true simply by the meanings of their words, such as &quot;No bachelor is married&quot;— and &quot;synthetic&quot; statements, those true or false by virtue of facts about the world, such as &quot;There is a cat on the mat.&quot; This distinction was central to logical positivism. Although Quine is not normally associated with verificationism, some philosophers believe the tenet is not incompatible with his general philosophy of language, citing his Harvard colleague B. F. Skinner and his analysis of language in &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot;. But Quine believes, with all due respect to his &quot;great friend&quot; Skinner, that the ultimate reason is to be found in neurology and not in behavior. For him, behavioral criteria establish only the terms of the problem, the solution of which, however, lies in neurology.

Like other analytic philosophers before him, Quine accepted the definition of &quot;analytic&quot; as &quot;true in virtue of meaning alone&quot;. Unlike them, however, he concluded that ultimately the definition was circular. In other words, Quine accepted that analytic statements are those that are true by definition, then argued that the notion of truth by definition was unsatisfactory.

Quine&#x27;s chief objection to analyticity is with the notion of cognitive synonymy (sameness of meaning). He argues that analytical sentences are typically divided into two kinds; sentences that are clearly logically true (e.g. &quot;no unmarried man is married&quot;) and the more dubious ones; sentences like &quot;no bachelor is married&quot;. Previously it was thought that if you can prove that there is synonymity between &quot;unmarried man&quot; and &quot;bachelor&quot;, you have proved that both sentences are logically true and therefore self evident. Quine however gives several arguments for why this is not possible, for instance that &quot;bachelor&quot; in some contexts mean a Bachelor of Arts, not an unmarried man.

====Confirmation holism and ontological relativity====
Colleague Hilary Putnam called Quine&#x27;s indeterminacy of translation thesis &quot;the most fascinating and the most discussed philosophical argument since Kant&#x27;s &quot;Transcendental Deduction of the Categories&quot;&quot;. The central theses underlying it are ontological relativity and the related doctrine of confirmation holism. The premise of confirmation holism is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by empirical data (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks&#x27; assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.

The &quot;gavagai&quot; thought experiment tells about a linguist, who tries to find out, what the expression &quot;gavagai&quot; means, when uttered by a speaker of a yet unknown, native language upon seeing a rabbit. At first glance, it seems that &quot;gavagai&quot; simply translates with &quot;rabbit&quot;. Now, Quine points out that the background language and its referring devices might fool the linguist here, because he is misled in a sense that he always makes direct comparisons between the foreign language and his own. However, when shouting &quot;gavagai&quot;, and pointing at a rabbit, the natives could as well refer to something like &quot;undetached rabbit-parts&quot;, or &quot;rabbit-tropes&quot; and it would not make any observable difference. The behavioural data the linguist could collect from the native speaker would be the same in every case, or to reword it, several translation hypotheses could be built on the same sensoric stimuli.

Quine concluded his &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot; as follows:

As an empiricist I continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of past experience. Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer …. For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer&#x27;s gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.
Quine&#x27;s ontological relativism (evident in the passage above) led him to agree with Pierre Duhem that for any collection of empirical evidence, there would always be many theories able to account for it, known as the Duhem–Quine thesis. However, Duhem&#x27;s holism is much more restricted and limited than Quine&#x27;s. For Duhem, underdetermination applies only to physics or possibly to natural science, while for Quine it applies to all of human knowledge. Thus, while it is possible to verify or falsify whole theories, it is not possible to verify or falsify individual statements. Almost any particular statement can be saved, given sufficiently radical modifications of the containing theory. For Quine, scientific thought forms a coherent web in which any part could be altered in the light of empirical evidence, and in which no empirical evidence could force the revision of a given part.

====Existence and its contrary====
The problem of non-referring names is an old puzzle in philosophy, which Quine captured when he wrote,

A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity. It can be put into three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: &#x27;What is there?&#x27; It can be answered, moreover, in a word—&#x27;Everything&#x27;—and everyone will accept this answer as true.

More directly, the controversy goes:

How can we talk about Pegasus? To what does the word &#x27;Pegasus&#x27; refer? If our answer is, &#x27;Something&#x27;, then we seem to believe in mystical entities; if our answer is, &#x27;nothing&#x27;, then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this? Certainly when we said that Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and moreover we speak the truth! If we speak the truth, this must be truth &quot;about something&quot;. So we cannot be speaking of nothing.
Quine resists the temptation to say that non-referring terms are meaningless for reasons made clear above. Instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know the proper way to understand them. However, Czesław Lejewski criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it seems we should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain. Lejewski writes further:

This state of affairs does not seem to be very satisfactory. The idea that some of our rules of inference should depend on empirical information, which may not be forthcoming, is so foreign to the character of logical inquiry that a thorough re-examination of the two inferences [existential generalization and universal instantiation] may prove worth our while.
Lejewski then goes on to offer a description of free logic, which he claims accommodates an answer to the problem.

Lejewski also points out that free logic additionally can handle the problem of the empty set for statements like formula_1. Quine had considered the problem of the empty set unrealistic, which left Lejewski unsatisfied.

==== Ontological commitment ====
The notion of ontological commitment plays a central role in Quine&#x27;s contributions to ontology. A theory is ontologically committed to an entity if that entity must exist in order for the theory to be true. Quine proposed that the best way to determine this is by translating the theory in question into first-order predicate logic. Of special interest in this translation are the logical constants known as existential quantifiers (&quot;), whose meaning corresponds to expressions like &quot;there exists...&quot; or &quot;for some...&quot;. They are used to bind the variables in the expression following the quantifier. The ontological commitments of the theory then correspond to the variables bound by existential quantifiers. For example, the sentence &quot;There are electrons&quot; could be translated as &quot;&quot;, in which the bound variable &quot;x&quot; ranges over electrons, resulting in an ontological commitment to electrons. This approach is summed up by Quine&#x27;s famous dictum that &quot;[t]o be is to be the value of a variable&quot;. Quine applied this method to various traditional disputes in ontology. For example, he reasoned from the sentence &quot;There are prime numbers between 1000 and 1010&quot; to an ontological commitment to the existence of numbers, i.e. realism about numbers. This method by itself is not sufficient for ontology since it depends on a theory in order to result in ontological commitments. Quine proposed that we should base our ontology on our best scientific theory. Various followers of Quine&#x27;s method chose to apply it to different fields, for example to &quot;everyday conceptions expressed in natural language&quot;.

====Indispensability argument for mathematical realism====
In philosophy of mathematics, he and his Harvard colleague Hilary Putnam developed the Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities.

The form of the argument is as follows.
#One must have ontological commitments to &quot;all&quot; entities that are indispensable to the best scientific theories, and to those entities &quot;only&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;all and only&quot;).
#Mathematical entities are indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore,
#One must have ontological commitments to mathematical entities.

The justification for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke naturalism to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the &quot;only&quot; part of &quot;all and only&quot;. The assertion that &quot;all&quot; entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by confirmation holism. Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is no justification for excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the nominalist who wishes to exclude the existence of sets and non-Euclidean geometry, but to include the existence of quarks and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position.

===Epistemology===
Just as he challenged the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also took aim at traditional normative epistemology. According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by Rudolf Carnap) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs: 
Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input—certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance—and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output a description of the three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one&#x27;s theory of nature transcends any available evidence... But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology.

As previously reported, in other occasions Quine used the term &quot;neurology&quot; instead of &quot;empirical psychology&quot;.

Quine&#x27;s proposal is controversial among contemporary philosophers and has several critics, with Jaegwon Kim the most prominent among them.

==In popular culture==
* A computer program whose output is its own source code is called a &quot;quine&quot; after Quine. This usage was introduced by Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book, &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&quot;.
* Quine is a recurring character in the webcomic &quot;Existential Comics&quot;.
* Quine was selected for inclusion in the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry&#x27;s &quot;Pantheon of Skeptics&quot;, which celebrates contributors to the cause of scientific skepticism.

<text>The World Calendar is a proposed reform of the Gregorian calendar created by Elisabeth Achelis of Brooklyn, New York in 1930.

== Features ==
The World Calendar is a 12-month, perennial calendar with equal quarters.

Each quarter begins on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday. The quarters are equal: each has exactly 91 days, 13 weeks, or 3 months. The three months in each quarter have 31, 30, and 30 days respectively. Each quarter begins with the 31-day months of January, April, July, or October.

The World Calendar also has the following two additional days to maintain the same new year days as the Gregorian calendar.

; Worldsday
: The last day of the year following Saturday 30 December. This additional day is dated &quot;W&quot; and named Worldsday, a year-end world holiday. It is followed by Sunday, 1 January in the new year.
; Leapyear Day
: This day is similarly added at the end of the second quarter in leap years. It is also dated &quot;W&quot; and named Leapyear Day. It is followed by Sunday, 1 July within the same year.

The World Calendar treats Worldsday and Leapyear Day as a 24-hour waiting period before resuming the calendar again. These off-calendar days, also known as &quot;intercalary days&quot;, are not assigned weekday designations. They are intended to be treated as holidays.

Because any three-month sequence repeats with the same arrangement of days, the World Calendar can be expressed concisely:

== Background and history ==
The World Calendar has its roots in the proposed calendar of the Abbot Marco Mastrofini, a proposal to reform the Gregorian calendar year so that it would always begin on Sunday, 1 January, and would contain equal quarters of 91 days each. The 365th day of the solar cycle would be a year-end, &quot;intercalary&quot; and optionally holiday. In leap years, a second &quot;intercalary day&quot; follows Saturday, 30 June.

Around 1887 French astronomer Gaston Armelin proposed a calendar based on this idea and roughly identical to the World Calendar.

Elisabeth Achelis founded The World Calendar Association (TWCA) in 1930 with the goal of worldwide adoption of the World Calendar. It functioned for most of the next twenty-five years as The World Calendar Association, Inc. Throughout the 1930s, support for the concept grew in the League of Nations, the precursor of the United Nations. Achelis started the Journal of Calendar Reform in 1931, publishing it for twenty-five years, and wrote five books on the calendar concept.

Following World War II, Achelis solicited worldwide support for the World Calendar. As the movement gained international appeal with legislation introduced in the United States Congress, awaiting international decisions, Achelis accepted advice that the United Nations was the proper body to act on calendar reform. At the United Nations in 1955, the United States significantly delayed universal adoption by withholding support &quot;unless such a reform were favoured by a substantial majority of the citizens of the United States acting through their representatives in the Congress of the United States.&quot; Also, Achelis wrote in 1955 (JCR Vol. 25, page 169), &quot;While Affiliates and Committees have over the years and still are able to approach all branches of their governments, the Incorporated (International) Association was prevented from seeking legislation in the United States lest it lose its tax exempt status. Because of this I have been prevented from doing in my own country that which I have been urging all other Affiliates to do in theirs.&quot;

By 1956, she dissolved The World Calendar Association, Incorporated. It continued as the International World Calendar Association through the rest of the century with several directors including Molly E. Kalkstein, who is related to Achelis, and who provided the Association&#x27;s first official website during her 2000–2004 tenure. The association reorganised in 2005 as The World Calendar Association, International. It was last active on 2013 as it had resumed efforts towards adoption of the World Calendar in 2017 and 2023. The World Calendar Association&#x27;s last director was Wayne Edward Richardson of Ellinwood, Kansas who died on 29 May 2020.

== Reception ==
=== Benefits ===
As with other calendar reform proposals, supporters point out several benefits to the World Calendar over the current Gregorian calendar.

Proponents refer to its simple structure. Each day is assigned an exact, repetitive date relative to week and month. Quarterly statistics are easier to compare, since the four-quarters are the same length each year. Economic savings occur from less need to print calendars because only the year number changes. Work and school schedules do not need to unnecessarily reinvent themselves, at great expense, year after year. The World Calendar can be memorised by anyone and used similarly to a clock.

Because the World Calendar is perpetual, there is no need to churn out copies of it every year. Dates in the World Calendar occur with no more than two days difference from Gregorian calendar dates.

=== Religious objections ===
The main opponents of the World Calendar in the 20th century were leaders of religions that worship according to a seven-day cycle. For Jews, Christians and Muslims, particular days of worship are ancient and fundamental elements of their faith.

Jews observe Saturday as &quot;Shabbat&quot;, on the basis of the Decalogue&#x27;s injunction to &quot;remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy&quot; (Exodus 20:8). Most Christians worship on Sunday, the Lord&#x27;s Day, on which they believe Christ rose from the dead. Muslims perform the &quot;jumu&#x27;ah&quot; prayer in Mosques on Fridays, the day they believe Adam was created. Likewise, Seventh-day Adventists are required to worship every Saturday.

Adherents of these religions object that intercalary days are counted outside the usual seven-day week and disrupt the traditional weekly cycle. A week with a Worldsday would be eight days long. Some adherents of these religions insist that they would have to continue observing their holidays every seventh day, causing the worship days to drift by one day each year (two on a leap year), relative to the World Calendar week. The day of rest would then no longer coincide with the weekend.

These concerns played a role in the United States government&#x27;s decision, at the United Nations, in 1955, not to recommend further study.

Supporters of the World Calendar do not deny that their system is at odds with the traditions of a significant portion of the world&#x27;s population, but argue that Worldsdays and Leapyear Days can be treated as &quot;double&quot; holidays by those who wish to maintain the seven-day week sequence.

=== International standards ===
The World Calendar, unlike some other proposals, is not compatible with the international standard ISO 8601, which is based upon, but differs from, the Gregorian calendar. They differ regarding the first weekday of the week (Sunday vs. Monday), and ISO 8601 does not support intercalary dates (e.g. in notation). The World Calendar, however, modifies the Gregorian calendar less than other calendar reform proposals to achieve the sought after improvements of a simpler and perpetual calendar.

<doc id="33861" wikidata="Q7995719" url="?curid=33861" title="White wedding">
<text>A white wedding is a traditional formal or semi-formal wedding originating in Great Britain.

The term originates from the white colour of the wedding dress, which originated with Anne of Brittany during her 1499 marriage to Louis XII of France. The white dress became popular with Victorian era elites after Queen Victoria wore a white lace dress at her 1840 wedding to Prince Albert. The white wedding style was given another significant boost in 1981, when 750 million people watched the wedding of Diana Spencer to Charles, Prince of Wales, which saw her wear an elaborate white taffeta dress with an 8 m train.

The full white wedding experience today typically requires the family to arrange for or purchase printed or engraved wedding invitations, musicians, decorations such as flowers or candles, clothes and flowers for bridesmaids, groomsmen, a flower girl and a ring bearer. They may also add optional features such as a guest book or commemorative wedding leaflets. It is common to have a celebration after the wedding ceremony, normally featuring a large wedding cake with white icing. The term now also encapsulates the entire Western wedding routine, especially in the Christian religious tradition, which generally includes a church service during which the marriage begins, followed by a reception.

“Color Wheel Pro” describes white in association with light, goodness, innocence, purity and virginity. White is also often considered to be the color of perfection. As for other significant meanings for white on a wedding day, “colormeaning.com” says, “In color psychology, white is the color of new beginnings — wiping the slate clean. The color white is a blank canvas, just waiting to be written on.” White is the color in Western culture most often associated with beginnings. Religious rites and the clothing associated with them have always been important, and white is often a common color used to express high religious commitment and purity.

== History of the white dress and traditions==
Though Mary, Queen of Scots, wore a white wedding gown in 1559 when she married her first husband, Francis Dauphin of France, the tradition of a white wedding dress is commonly credited to Queen Victoria&#x27;s choice to wear a white court dress at her wedding to Prince Albert in 1840. Debutantes had long been required to wear white court dresses and long white gloves for their first presentation at court, at a &quot;Drawing Room&quot; where they were introduced to the queen for the first time.
Royal brides before Victoria did not typically wear white, instead choosing &quot;heavy brocaded gowns embroidered with white and silver thread,&quot; with red being a particularly popular colour in Western Europe more generally. During this time, European and American brides wore a plethora of colours, including blue, yellow, and practical colours like black, brown, or gray. As accounts of Victoria&#x27;s wedding spread across the Atlantic and throughout Europe, fashionable people followed her lead.

The traditional white wedding was not necessarily defined by the color of the dress only. The wedding of Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughter Victoria to Prince Fredrick William of Prussia in 1858 also introduced choral music to the processional when standard practice had been to have music of any kind only during a party after the wedding ceremony.

Because of the limitations of laundering techniques before the later part of the 20th century, white dresses provided an opportunity for conspicuous consumption. They were favored primarily as a way to show the world that the bride&#x27;s family was so wealthy and so firmly part of the leisure class that the bride would choose an elaborate dress that could be ruined by any sort of work or spill.

Women were required to wear veils in many Christian churches through the mid-20th century; the resurgence of the wedding veil as a symbol of the bride, and its use even when not required by the bride&#x27;s religion, coincided with societal emphasis on women being modest and well-behaved.

Etiquette books then began to turn the practice into a tradition and the white gown soon became a popular symbol of status that also carried &quot;a connotation of innocence and virginal purity.&quot; The story put out about the wedding veil was that decorous brides were naturally too timid to show their faces in public until they were married.

By the end of the 19th century the white dress was the garment of choice for elite brides on both sides of the Atlantic. However, middle-class British and American brides did not adopt the trend fully until after World War II. With increased prosperity in the 20th century, the tradition also grew to include the practice of wearing the dress only once. As historian Vicky Howard writes, &quot;[i]f a bride wore white in the nineteenth century, it was acceptable and likely that she wore her gown again&quot;. Even Queen Victoria had her famous lace wedding dress re-styled for later use.

After World War I, as full-scale formal weddings began to be desired by the mothers of brides who did not have a permanent social secretary, the position of the wedding planner, who could coordinate the printer, florist, caterer and seamstress, began to assume importance. The first edition of &quot;Bride&#x27;s Magazine&quot; was published in 1934 as a newspaper advertising insert called ‘So You&#x27;re Going to Get Married!’ in a column entitled ‘To the Bride’ and its rival &quot;Modern Bride&quot; began publishing in 1949. 

The portrayal of weddings in Hollywood movies, particularly immediately after World War II, helped crystallize and homogenize the white wedding into a normative form.

== Participants ==
Traditional weddings require, in addition to the bride and groom, a marriage officiant, which is a minister, priest, pastor, vicor, rabbi, imam, or civil officer who is authorized to perform marriages and will read out of a Bible, Torah, Quran, or Civil document.

Typical white weddings also include a wedding party, which consists of some or all of the following:
* Groomsmen or ushers: One or more friends or family members who assist the groom, usually men. The chief groomsman is called the best man, and is given a place of honor. A woman (such as the sister of the groom) is called an honor attendant (matron of honour in the UK). A boy too young to be marriageable, but too old to be a ring bearer, is called a &quot;junior groomsmen&quot;.
* Bridesmaids: One or more friends or family members who support the bride, usually women. The chief bridesmaid may be called a maid of honor or matron of honor. A girl too young to be marriageable, but too old to be a flower girl, is called a &quot;junior bridesmaid&quot;.
* Flower girl: A young girl who scatters flowers in front of the bridal party.
* Ring bearer: An attendant, often a young boy, who carries the wedding rings.

Typically these positions are filled by either close friends or family members (or both) of the bride and groom; being asked to serve in these capacities is seen as an honor and typically entails some expense.

==The ceremony==
When the guests arrive for a wedding, the ushers, if any, help the guests take their places. In a typical white wedding ceremony, which is derived primarily from the Christian tradition (inclusive of denominations such as Lutheranism and Anglicanism, for example), the bride and groom will stand side by side at the front of the church before the chancel throughout most or all the ceremony. Consequently, some guests prefer to sit on the side closer to the person they know best. Typically, this means that the bride&#x27;s family sits on the house left and the groom&#x27;s family on house right. The front rows are generally reserved for close family members or friends.

Some couples make a ceremony of having their grandparents, step-parents, and parents escorted to their seats immediately before the wedding procession begins. In other cases, these relatives form part of the wedding procession.

Depending on the country, her age and situation, and her personal preferences, the bride may walk alone or be escorted by her father, both of her parents, one or more relatives she wishes to honor, or the groom. In Swedish white weddings, the bride and groom usually go down the aisle together. Similarly, some couples choose to have the groom escorted to the altar by his family.

Whether the bride is the first or the last of the wedding party to enter the church varies by country. In the US, the bride is typically last, being preceded by the rest of the wedding party. In the UK, she leads the procession, followed by any bridesmaids, flower girls and page boys. Sometimes the groom is already present in the church; other times, he and any groomsmen form part of the procession. The music played during this procession is commonly called a &quot;wedding march&quot;, no matter what songs are played.

If the wedding is part of a religious service, then technically the service begins after the arrival of the participants, commonly with a prayer, blessing, or ritual greeting. During the ceremony, each partner in the couple makes marriage vows to the other in front of the marriage officiant. The ceremony might include the playing of a prelude, the singing of hymns, and Bible readings, as well as Holy Communion in accordance with the Christian marriage liturgy of the church at which the wedding is held, e.g. Lutheran, Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican, Methodist, Baptist, Mormon, Calvinist, Unitarian, Protestant, Orthodox, etc.

After the wedding ceremony itself ends, the bride, groom, officiant, and two witnesses generally go off to a side room to sign the wedding register in the United Kingdom or the state-issued marriage license in the United States. Without the signing of the register or the marriage license, a marriage has not legally occurred.

Afterward, guests may cheer the departure of the couple from the church by throwing flower petals, confetti, birdseed, or rice over them. Miniature containers of bubbles are often provided to guest to blow at the couple instead of throwing the previously mentioned items.

==The reception==

After this, the celebrations shift to a reception at which the newly married couple, as the guests of honor, and the hosts and perhaps members of the wedding party greet the guests in a receiving line. Although now commonly called a reception no matter the style of party, wedding celebrations range from simple receptions to dinner parties to grand wedding balls.

Food is served, particularly including a wedding cake. Wedding cakes are often multi-tiered layer cakes that are elaborately decorated with white icing. Cutting the wedding cake is often turned into a ritual, complete with sharing a symbolic bite of the cake in a rite that harks back to the pagan confarreatio weddings in ancient Rome.

During the reception, a number of short speeches or toasts may be given in honor of the couple.

If there is dancing, the bride and groom, as the guests of honor, are expected to be the first people to begin dancing. This is usually termed the &quot;bridal waltz&quot;, even if the couple has arranged for a different style of music. Some families then contrive a series of arranged dances between the newlyweds and their parents, or other members of the wedding party, with guests expected to watch the performances.

At some point, the married couple may become the object of a charivari, a good-natured hazing of the newly married couple. The nature depends upon the circumstances. The guests might tie tin cans or a sign saying &quot;Just Married&quot; to the bumper of the couple&#x27;s car, if they depart in their own car rather than a hired one.

As the guests of honor, the newly married couple is the first to leave the party. From ancient Rome through the Middle Ages in Europe, wheat kernels were thrown at the bride in a wish for affluence; now it is typical to throw rice, as a symbol of fertility, at the couple as they depart.

<text>The Wannsee Conference (, ) was a meeting of senior government officials of Nazi Germany and &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) leaders, held in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee on 20 January 1942. The purpose of the conference, called by the director of the Reich Security Main Office SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Reinhard Heydrich, was to ensure the co-operation of administrative leaders of various government departments in the implementation of the Final Solution to the Jewish Question, whereby most of the Jews of German-occupied Europe would be deported to occupied Poland and murdered. Conference participants included representatives from several government ministries, including state secretaries from the Foreign Office, the justice, interior, and state ministries, and representatives from the SS. In the course of the meeting, Heydrich outlined how European Jews would be rounded up and sent to extermination camps in the General Government (the occupied part of Poland), where they would be killed.

Discrimination against Jews began immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, the extermination of European Jews began, first through mobile death squads like the &quot;Einsatzgruppen,&quot; and the killings continued and accelerated after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. On 31 July 1941, Hermann Göring gave written authorization to Heydrich to prepare and submit a plan for a &quot;total solution of the Jewish question&quot; in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations. At the Wannsee Conference, Heydrich emphasised that once the deportation process was complete, the fate of the deportees would become an internal matter under the purview of the SS. A secondary goal was to arrive at a definition of who was Jewish.

One copy of the Protocol with circulated minutes of the meeting survived the war. It was found by Robert Kempner in March 1947 among files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office. It was used as evidence in the subsequent Nuremberg trials. The Wannsee House, site of the conference, is now a Holocaust memorial.

== Background ==
Legalized discrimination against Jews in Germany began immediately after the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space) for the Germanic people. Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by invading Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or exterminate the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race.

Discrimination against Jews, long-standing but extra-legal throughout much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived other Jews of the right to practise their professions. Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to force Jews to leave the country. Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses.
In September 1935, the Nuremberg Laws were enacted, prohibiting marriages between Jews and people of Germanic extraction, extramarital sexual relations between Jews and Germans, and the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households. The Citizenship Law stated that only those of German or related blood were defined as citizens; thus, Jews and other minority groups were stripped of their German citizenship. A supplementary decree issued in November defined as Jewish anyone with three Jewish grandparents, or two grandparents if the Jewish faith was followed. By the start of World War II in Europe in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany&#x27;s 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, British Mandatory Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries.

After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Hitler ordered that the Polish leadership and intelligentsia be destroyed. The &quot;Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen&quot; (Special Ledger of Wanted Persons–Poland)—lists of people to be located so they could be interned or killed—had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (special task forces) performed these murders with the support of the &quot;Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz&quot; (Germanic Self-Protection Group), a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland. Members of the SS, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (German Armed Forces), and the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Order Police; Orpo) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign. Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani people, and the mentally ill.

On 31 July 1941, Hermann Göring gave written authorization to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; (Senior Group Leader) Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), to prepare and submit a plan for a &quot;total solution of the Jewish question&quot; in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations. The resulting &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered. The minutes of the Wannsee Conference estimated the Jewish population of the Soviet Union to be five million, including nearly three million in Ukraine.

In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan devised by Herbert Backe. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists. The objective of the Hunger Plan was to inflict deliberate mass starvation on the Slavic civilian populations under German occupation by directing all food supplies to the German home population and the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front. According to the historian Timothy Snyder, &quot;4.2 million Soviet citizens (largely Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians) were starved&quot; by the Nazis (and the Nazi-controlled &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;) in 1941–1944 as a result of Backe&#x27;s plan.

Harvests were poor in Germany in 1940 and 1941 and food supplies were short, as large numbers of forced labourers had been brought into the country to work in the armaments industry. If these workers—as well as the German people—were to be adequately fed, there must be a sharp reduction in the number of &quot;useless mouths&quot;, of whom the millions of Jews under German rule were, in the light of Nazi ideology, the most obvious example.

At the time of the Wannsee Conference, the killing of Jews in the Soviet Union had already been underway for some months. Right from the start of Operation Barbarossa—the invasion of the Soviet Union—&quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were assigned to follow the army into the conquered areas and round up and kill Jews. In a letter dated 2 July 1941, Heydrich communicated to his SS and police leaders that the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were to execute Comintern officials, ranking members of the Communist Party, extremist and radical Communist Party members, people&#x27;s commissars, and Jews in party and government posts. Open-ended instructions were given to execute &quot;other radical elements (saboteurs, propagandists, snipers, assassins, agitators, etc.)&quot;. He instructed that any pogroms spontaneously initiated by the occupants of the conquered territories were to be quietly encouraged. On 8 July, he announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot. By August, the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. By the time planning was underway for the Wannsee Conference, hundreds of thousands of Polish, Serbian, and Russian Jews had already been killed. The initial plan was to implement &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; after the conquest of the Soviet Union. European Jews would be deported to occupied parts of Russia, where they would be worked to death in road-building projects.

== Planning the conference ==
On 29 November 1941, Heydrich sent invitations for a ministerial conference to be held on 9 December at the offices of Interpol at &quot;Am Kleinen Wannsee 16&quot;. He changed the venue on 4 December to the eventual location of the meeting. He enclosed a copy of a letter from Göring dated 31 July that authorised him to plan a so-called Final Solution to the Jewish Question. The ministries to be represented were those responsible for Jewish issues, including the Reich Chancellery, the Foreign Office, Interior, Justice, Propaganda, the Four Year Plan, and the Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. Representatives from Party and SS components with special interests in the race issue were invited, including the Party Chancellery, the SS Race and Settlement Main Office, and the Office of the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV). Representatives from the General Government of occupied Poland were also added to the list.

Between the date the invitations to the conference went out (29 November) and the date of the cancelled first meeting (9 December), the situation changed. On 5 December 1941, the Red Army began a counter-offensive in front of Moscow ending the prospect of a rapid conquest of the Soviet Union. On 7 December 1941, the Japanese carried out an attack on Pearl Harbor, causing the U.S. to declare war on Japan the next day. Germany declared war on the U.S. on 11 December. Some invitees were involved in these preparations, so Heydrich postponed his meeting. Somewhere around this time, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately, rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. At the Reich Chancellery meeting of 12 December 1941 he met with top party officials and made his intentions plain. On 18 December, Hitler discussed the fate of the Jews with Himmler in the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot;. Following the meeting, Himmler made a note on his service calendar, which simply stated: &quot;Jewish question/to be destroyed as partisans&quot;.

The original intention was to deport the Jews to camps in occupied areas of the Soviet Union and kill them there, but because victory over the Soviet Union was not forthcoming, the plans had to be changed. Heydrich decided that the Jews currently living in the General Government (the German-occupied area of Poland) would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland, as would Jews from the rest of Europe.

On 8 January 1942, Heydrich sent new invitations to a meeting to be held on 20 January. The venue for the rescheduled conference was a villa at &quot;Am Großen Wannsee 56–58&quot;, overlooking the Großer Wannsee. The villa had been purchased from Friedrich Minoux in 1940 by the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (Security Force; SD) for use as a conference centre and guest house.

== Attendees ==
The attendees from the Reich civilian ministries were high level administrators. Most were either the state secretary or an undersecretary. With the cabinet not meeting regularly, meetings between the state secretaries were the chief means of policy coordination among agencies. The process of disseminating information about the fate of the Jews was already well underway by the time the meeting was held, and several of the attendees were aware that changes to the Jewish policy were already underway. In addition to the invited guests, Heydrich instructed several SS officials from his RSHA component to attend. In all, 15 officials attended the conference. Half the attendees were under forty years of age and only two were over fifty. They were well educated, with ten having a university education (of whom eight held academic doctorates), and eight were lawyers.

== Proceedings ==
In preparation for the conference, Eichmann drafted a list of the total numbers of Jews in the various European countries. Countries were listed in two groups, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. &quot;A&quot; countries were those under direct German control or occupation (or partially occupied and quiescent, in the case of Vichy France); &quot;B&quot; countries were allied or client states, neutral, or at war with Germany. The numbers reflect the estimated Jewish population within each country; for example, Estonia is listed as &quot;Judenfrei&quot; (free of Jews), since the 4,500 Jews who remained in Estonia after the German occupation had been killed by the end of 1941. Occupied Poland was not on the list because by 1939 the country was split three ways among Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany in the west, the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union in the east, and the General Government where many Polish and Jewish expellees had already been resettled.

Heydrich opened the conference with an account of the anti-Jewish measures taken in Germany since the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. He said that between 1933 and October 1941, 537,000 German, Austrian, and Czech Jews had emigrated. This information was taken from a briefing paper prepared for him the previous week by Eichmann.

Heydrich reported that there were approximately eleven million Jews in the whole of Europe, of whom half were in countries not under German control. He explained that since further Jewish emigration had been prohibited by Himmler, a new solution would take its place: &quot;evacuating&quot; Jews to the east. This would be a temporary solution, a step towards the &quot;final solution of the Jewish question&quot;.

German historian Peter Longerich notes that vague orders couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime were common, especially when people were being ordered to carry out criminal activities. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;firm&quot;; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly. The wording of the Wannsee Protocol—the distributed minutes of the meeting—made it clear to participants that evacuation east was a euphemism for death.
Heydrich went on to say that in the course of the &quot;practical execution of the final solution&quot;, Europe would be &quot;combed through from west to east&quot;, but that Germany, Austria, and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia would have priority, &quot;due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities&quot;. This was a reference to increasing pressure from the Gauleiters (regional Nazi Party leaders) in Germany for the Jews to be removed from their areas to allow accommodation for Germans made homeless by Allied bombing, as well as to make space for laborers being imported from occupied countries. The &quot;evacuated&quot; Jews, he said, would first be sent to &quot;transit ghettos&quot; in the General Government, from which they would be transported eastward. Heydrich said that to avoid legal and political difficulties, it was important to define who was a Jew for the purposes of &quot;evacuation&quot;. He outlined categories of people who would not be killed. Jews over 65 years old, and Jewish World War I veterans who had been severely wounded or who had won the Iron Cross, might be sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp instead of being killed. &quot;With this expedient solution&quot;, he said, &quot;in one fell swoop, many interventions will be prevented.&quot;

The situation of people who were half or quarter Jews, and of Jews who were married to non-Jews, was more complex. Under the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, their status had been left deliberately ambiguous. Heydrich announced that &quot;Mischlinge&quot; (mixed-race persons) of the first degree (persons with two Jewish grandparents) would be treated as Jews. This would not apply if they were married to a non-Jew and had children by that marriage. It would also not apply if they had been granted written exemption by &quot;the highest offices of the Party and State&quot;. Such persons would be sterilised or deported if they refused sterilisation. A &quot;&quot;Mischling&quot; of the second degree&quot; (a person with one Jewish grandparent) would be treated as German, unless he or she was married to a Jew or a &quot;Mischling&quot; of the first degree, had a &quot;racially especially undesirable appearance that marks him outwardly as a Jew&quot;, or had a &quot;political record that shows that he feels and behaves like a Jew&quot;. Persons in these latter categories would be killed even if married to non-Jews. In the case of mixed marriages, Heydrich recommended that each case should be evaluated individually, and the impact on any German relatives assessed. If such a marriage had produced children who were being raised as Germans, the Jewish partner would not be killed. If they were being raised as Jews, they might be killed or sent to an old-age ghetto. These exemptions applied only to German and Austrian Jews, and were not always observed even for them. In most of the occupied countries, Jews were rounded up and killed &quot;en masse&quot;, and anyone who lived in or identified with the Jewish community in any given place was regarded as a Jew.

Heydrich commented: &quot;In occupied and unoccupied France, the registration of Jews for evacuation will in all probability proceed without great difficulty&quot;, but in the end, the great majority of French-born Jews survived. More difficulty was anticipated with Germany&#x27;s allies Romania and Hungary. &quot;In Romania the government has [now] appointed a commissioner for Jewish affairs&quot;, Heydrich said. In fact the deportation of Romanian Jews was slow and inefficient despite a high degree of popular antisemitism. &quot;In order to settle the question in Hungary&quot;, Heydrich said, &quot;it will soon be necessary to force an adviser for Jewish questions onto the Hungarian government&quot;. The Hungarian regime of Miklós Horthy continued to resist German interference in its Jewish policy until the spring of 1944, when the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; invaded Hungary. Very soon, Eichmannwith the collaboration of Hungarian authoritieswould send 600,000 Jews of Hungary (and parts of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia occupied by Hungary) to be murdered in the extermination camps, primarily Auschwitz.

Heydrich spoke for nearly an hour. Then followed about thirty minutes of questions and comments, followed by some less formal conversation. Otto Hofmann (head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office; RuSHA) and Wilhelm Stuckart (State Secretary of the Interior Ministry) pointed out the legalistic and administrative difficulties over mixed marriages, and suggested compulsory dissolution of mixed marriages or the wider use of sterilisation as a simpler alternative. Erich Neumann from the Four Year Plan argued for the exemption of Jews who were working in industries vital to the war effort and for whom no replacements were available. Heydrich assured him that this was already the policy; such Jews would not be killed. Josef Bühler, State Secretary of the General Government, stated his support for the plan and his hope that the killings would commence as soon as possible.

Towards the end of the meeting cognac was served, and after that the conversation became less restrained. Eichmann said: 

Eichmann recorded that Heydrich was pleased with the course of the meeting. He had expected much resistance, Eichmann recalled, but instead, he had found &quot;an atmosphere not only of agreement on the part of the participants, but more than that, one could feel an agreement which had assumed a form which had not been expected&quot;.

===Eichmann&#x27;s list===



== Wannsee Protocol ==

Shorthand notes for the minutes were taken by Eichmann&#x27;s secretary, Ingeburg Werlemann, and the minutes were written by Eichmann in consultation with Heydrich. At the conclusion of the meeting, Heydrich gave Eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in the minutes. They were not to be verbatim: Eichmann ensured that nothing too explicit appeared in them. He said at his trial: &quot;How shall I put it – certain over-plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me.&quot;

Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended the participants to take away from the meeting. Copies of the minutes (known by the German word for &quot;minutes&quot; as the &quot;Wannsee Protocol&quot;) were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting. Most of these copies were destroyed at the end of the war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks. It was not until 1947 that Luther&#x27;s copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by Robert Kempner, a U.S. prosecutor in the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, in files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office.
== Interpretation ==
The Wannsee Conference lasted only about ninety minutes. The enormous importance which has been attached to the conference by post-war writers was not evident to most of its participants at the time. Heydrich did not call the meeting to make fundamental new decisions on the Jewish question; massive killings of Jews in the conquered territories in the Soviet Union and Poland were ongoing. A new extermination camp was under construction at Belzec at the time of the conference, and other extermination camps were in the planning stages. The decision to exterminate the Jews had already been made, and Heydrich, as Himmler&#x27;s emissary, held the meeting to ensure the cooperation of the various departments in conducting the deportations. Observations from historian Laurence Rees support Longerich&#x27;s position that the decision over the fate of the Jews was determined before the conference; Rees notes that the Wannsee Conference was really a meeting of &quot;second-level functionaries&quot;, and stresses that Himmler, Goebbels, and Hitler were not present. According to Longerich, a primary goal of the meeting was to emphasise that once the deportations had been completed, the fate of the deportees became an internal matter of the SS, totally outside the purview of any other agency. A secondary goal was to determine the scope of the deportations and arrive at definitions of who was Jewish and who was &quot;Mischling&quot;. &quot;The representatives of the ministerial bureaucracy had made it plain that they had no concerns about the principle of deportation &quot;per se&quot;. This was indeed the crucial result of the meeting and the main reason why Heydrich had detailed minutes prepared and widely circulated&quot;, said Longerich. Their presence at the meeting also ensured that all those present were accomplices and accessories to the murders that were about to be undertaken.

Eichmann&#x27;s biographer David Cesarani agrees with Longerich&#x27;s interpretation; he notes that Heydrich&#x27;s main purpose was to impose his own authority on the various ministries and agencies involved in Jewish policy matters, and to avoid any repetition of the objections to the deportations and genocide from his military and civilian subordinates that had occurred earlier in the annihilation campaign. &quot;The simplest, most decisive way that Heydrich could ensure the smooth flow of deportations&quot;, he writes, &quot;was by asserting his total control over the fate of the Jews in the Reich and the east, and [by] cow[ing] other interested parties into toeing the line of the RSHA&quot;.

== House of the Wannsee Conference ==
In 1965, historian Joseph Wulf proposed that the Wannsee House should be made into a Holocaust memorial and document centre, but the West German government was not interested at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. Despondent at the failure of the project, and at the West German government&#x27;s failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.

On 20 January 1992, on the fiftieth anniversary of the conference, the site was finally opened as a Holocaust memorial and museum known as the &quot;Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz&quot; (House of the Wannsee Conference). The museum also hosts permanent exhibits of texts and photographs that document events of the Holocaust and its planning. The Joseph Wulf Bibliothek / Mediothek on the second floor houses a large collection of books on the Nazi era, plus other materials such as microfilms and original Nazi documents.

<text>Wombats are short-legged, muscular quadrupedal marsupials of the family Vombatidae that are native to Australia. Living species are about in length with small, stubby tails and weigh between . They are adaptable and habitat tolerant, and are found in forested, mountainous, and heathland areas of southern and eastern Australia, including Tasmania, as well as an isolated patch of about in Epping Forest National Park in central Queensland.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;wombat&quot; comes from the now nearly extinct Dharug language spoken by the aboriginal Dharug people, who originally inhabited the Sydney area. It was first recorded in January 1798, when John Price and James Wilson, Europeans who had adopted aboriginal ways, visited the area of what is now Bargo, New South Wales. Price wrote: &quot;We saw several sorts of dung of different animals, one of which Wilson called a &#x27;Whom-batt&#x27;, which is an animal about high, with short legs and a thick body with a large head, round ears, and very small eyes; is very fat, and has much the appearance of a badger.&quot; Wombats were often called badgers by early settlers because of their size and habits. Because of this, localities such as Badger Creek, Victoria, and Badger Corner, Tasmania, were named after the wombat. The spelling went through many variants over the years, including &quot;wambat&quot;, &quot;whombat&quot;, &quot;womat&quot;, &quot;wombach&quot;, and &quot;womback&quot;, possibly reflecting dialectal differences in the Darug language.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
Though genetic studies of the Vombatidae have been undertaken, evolution of the family is not well understood. Wombats are estimated to have diverged from other Australian marsupials relatively early, as long as 40 million years ago, while some estimates place divergence at around 25 million years. Some prehistoric wombat genera greatly exceeded modern wombats in size. The largest known wombat, &quot;Phascolonus&quot;, which went extinct approximately 40,000 years ago, is estimated to have had a body mass of up to .

==Characteristics==

Wombats dig extensive burrow systems with their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws. One distinctive adaptation of wombats is their backward pouch. The advantage of a backward-facing pouch is that when digging, the wombat does not gather soil in its pouch over its young. Although mainly crepuscular and nocturnal, wombats may also venture out to feed on cool or overcast days. They are not commonly seen, but leave ample evidence of their passage, treating fences as minor inconveniences to be gone through or under.

Wombats leave distinctive cubic faeces. As wombats arrange these feces to mark territories and attract mates, it is believed that the cubic shape makes them more stackable and less likely to roll, which gives this shape a biological advantage. The method by which the wombat produces them is not well understood, but it is believed that the wombat intestine stretches preferentially at the walls, with two flexible and two stiff areas around its intestines. The adult wombat produces between 80 and 100, pieces of feces in a single night, and four to eight pieces each bowel movement. In 2019 the production of cube-shaped wombat feces was the subject of the Ig Nobel Prize for Physics, won by Patricia Yang and David Hu.

All wombat teeth lack roots and are ever-growing, like the incisors of rodents. Wombats are herbivores; their diets consist mostly of grasses, sedges, herbs, bark, and roots. Their incisor teeth somewhat resemble those of rodents (rats, mice, etc.), being adapted for gnawing tough vegetation. Like many other herbivorous mammals, they have a large diastema between their incisors and the cheek teeth, which are relatively simple. The dental formula of wombats is .

Wombats&#x27; fur can vary from a sandy colour to brown, or from grey to black. All three known extant species average around in length and weigh between .

Male wombats have penile spines, a non-pendulous scrotum, and three pairs of bulbourethral glands. The testes, prostate, and bulbourethral glands enlarge during the breeding season. Female wombats give birth to a single young after a gestation period of roughly 20–30 days, which varies between species. All species have well-developed pouches, which the young leave after about six to seven months. Wombats are weaned after 15 months, and are sexually mature at 18 months.

A group of wombats is known as a wisdom, a mob, or a colony.

Wombats typically live up to 15 years in the wild, but can live past 20 and even 30 years in captivity. The longest-lived captive wombat lived to 34 years of age.

In 2020, biologists discovered that wombats, like many other Australian marsupials, display bio-fluorescence under ultraviolet light.
==Ecology and behaviour==
Wombats have an extraordinarily slow metabolism, taking around 8 to 14 days to complete digestion, which aids their survival in arid conditions. They generally move slowly. Wombats defend home territories centred on their burrows, and they react aggressively to intruders. The common wombat occupies a range of up to , while the hairy-nosed species have much smaller ranges, of no more than .

Dingos and Tasmanian devils prey on wombats. Extinct predators were likely to have included &quot;Thylacoleo&quot; and possibly the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger). Their primary defence is their toughened rear hide, with most of the posterior made of cartilage. This, combined with its lack of a meaningful tail, makes it difficult for any predator that follows the wombat into its tunnel to bite and injure its target. When attacked, wombats dive into a nearby tunnel, using their rumps to block a pursuing attacker. According to an urban legend, wombats sometimes allow an intruder to force its head over the wombat&#x27;s back, and then use its powerful legs to crush the skull of the predator against the roof of the tunnel. However, there is no evidence to support this.

Wombats are generally quiet animals. Bare-nosed wombats can make a number of different sounds, more than the hairy-nosed wombats. Wombats tend to be more vocal during mating season. When angered, they can make hissing sounds. Their call sounds somewhat like a pig&#x27;s squeal. They can also make grunting noises, a low growl, a hoarse cough, and a clicking noise.

==Species==
The three extant species of wombat are all endemic to Australia and a few offshore islands. They are protected under Australian law.

* Common wombat (&quot;Vombatus ursinus&quot;), which has three subspecies:
** &quot;Vombatus ursinus hirsutus&quot;, found on the Australian mainland
** &quot;Vombatus ursinus tasmaniensis&quot;, found in Tasmania
** &quot;Vombatus ursinus ursinus&quot;, found on Flinders Island and Maria Island in the Bass Strait
* Northern hairy-nosed wombat or &quot;yaminon&quot; (&quot;Lasiorhinus krefftii&quot;), which is critically endangered
* Southern hairy-nosed wombat (&quot;Lasiorhinus latifrons&quot;), the smallest of the three species

==Human relations==

===History===
Depictions of the animals in rock art are exceptionally rare, though examples estimated to be up to 4,000 years old have been discovered in Wollemi National Park. The wombat is depicted in aboriginal Dreamtime as an animal of little worth. The mainland stories tell of the wombat as originating from a person named Warreen whose head had been flattened by a stone and tail amputated as punishment for selfishness. In contrast, the Tasmanian aboriginal story first recorded in 1830 tells of the wombat (known as the &quot;drogedy&quot; or &quot;publedina&quot;) the great spirit Moihernee had asked hunters to leave alone. In both cases, the wombat is regarded as having been banished to its burrowing habitat. Estimates of wombat distribution prior to European settlement are that numbers of all three surviving species were prolific and that they covered a range more than ten times greater than that of today.
After the ship &quot;Sydney Cove&quot; ran aground on Clarke Island in February 1797, the crew of the salvage ship &quot;Francis&quot; discovered wombats on the island. A live animal was taken back to Port Jackson. Matthew Flinders, who was travelling on board the &quot;Francis&quot; on its third and final salvage trip, also decided to take a wombat specimen from the island to Port Jackson. Governor John Hunter later sent the animal&#x27;s corpse to Joseph Banks at the Literary and Philosophical Society to verify that it was a new species. The island was named Clarke Island after William Clark.

Wombats were classified as vermin in 1906, and a bounty was introduced in 1925. This and the removal of a substantial amount of habitat have greatly reduced their numbers and range.

===Attacks on humans===
In addition to being bitten, humans can receive puncture wounds from wombat claws. Startled wombats can also charge humans and bowl them over, with the attendant risks of broken bones from the fall. One naturalist, Harry Frauca, once received a bite deep into the flesh of his leg—through a rubber boot, trousers and thick woollen socks. A UK newspaper, &quot;The Independent&quot;, reported that on 6 April 2010, a 59-year-old man from rural Victoria state was mauled by a wombat (thought to have been angered by mange), causing a number of cuts and bite marks requiring hospital treatment. He resorted to killing it with an axe.

===Cultural significance===
Some farmers consider common wombats to be a nuisance due primarily to their burrowing behaviour. &quot;Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat&quot; was the tongue-in-cheek &quot;unofficial&quot; mascot of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Since 2005, an unofficial holiday called Wombat Day has been observed on 22 October.

Wombat meat has been a source of bush food from the arrival of Aboriginal Australians to the arrival of Europeans. Due to the protection of the species, wombat meat as food is no longer part of mainstream Australian cuisine, but wombat stew was once one of the few truly Australian dishes. In the 20th century, the more easily found rabbit meat was more commonly used. (Rabbits are now considered an invasive pest in Australia.) The name of the dish is also used by a popular children&#x27;s book and musical.

Wombats have featured in Australian postage stamps and coins. The hairy-nosed wombats have featured mainly to highlight their elevated conservation status. The northern hairy-nosed wombat featured on an Australian 1974 20-cent stamp and also an Australian 1981 five-cent stamp. The common wombat has appeared on a 1987 37-cent stamp and an Australian 1996 95-cent stamp. The 2006 Australian Bush Babies stamp series features an AU$1.75-stamp of a baby common wombat, and the 2010 Rescue to Release series features a 60-cent stamp of a common wombat being treated by a veterinarian. Wombats are rarely seen on circulated Australian coins, an exception is a 50-cent coin which also shows a koala and lorikeet. The common wombat appeared on a 2005 commemorative $1 coin and the northern hairy-nosed wombat on a 1998 Australia Silver Proof $10 coin.

Many places in Australia have been named after the wombat, including a large number of places where they are now locally extinct in the wild. References to the locally extinct common wombat can be found in parts of the Central Highlands of Victoria, for example the Wombat State Forest and Wombat Hill in Daylesford. Other significant places named after the wombat includes the town of Wombat, New South Wales and the suburb of Quoiba, Tasmania. Numerous less significant Australian places, including hotels, are named after the animals. Prominent sculptures of wombats include in South Australia: &quot;The Big Wombat&quot; at Scotdesco Aboriginal Community (Tjilkaba) and Wudinna visitor information centre, Adelaide Zoo and Norwood; New South Wales: Wombat, New South Wales; Victoria: Daylesford, Trentham, Victoria and Kinglake; Tasmania: Steppes State Reserve.

Wombats have also been a feature of Australian television. While wombats are not generally kept as pets, a notable depiction of a common wombat as a pet is Fatso from the Australian television show &quot;A Country Practice&quot;. The Brisbane television show &quot;Wombat&quot; was also named for the animals.

Australian literature contains many references to the wombat. Examples are Mr. Walter Wombat from the adventures of &quot;Blinky Bill&quot; and one of the main antagonists in &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; by Norman Lindsay.

==Conservation==
All species of wombats are protected in every Australian state.

The northern hairy-nosed wombat is a critically endangered species under Queensland&#x27;s &quot;Nature Conservation Act 1992&quot;, the Commonwealth &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;, and on the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s Red List of Threatened Species. The biggest threats the species faces are its small population size, predation by wild dogs, competition for food because of overgrazing by cattle and sheep, and disease. The only known wild populations of this species exist in two locations in Queensland, the Epping Forest National Park, and a smaller colony being established by translocating wombats to the Richard Underwood Nature Refuge at Yarran Downs. This second colony is being created through the Xstrata reintroduction project, which is being funded by Xstrata, a Swiss global mining company. From a low of just 35 wombats across the state when surveyed in the 1980s, the population had increased to a total of around 315 by May 2021.

Despite its name, the common wombat is no longer as common as it once was, and is under significant threat. However, in eastern Victoria, they are not protected, and they are considered by some to be pests, especially due to the damage they cause to rabbit-proof fences. Opportunistic research studies have been conducted on the immune system of common wombats, which could be used as a tool for future conservation efforts. 

WomSAT, a citizen science project, was established in 2016 to record sightings of wombats across the country. The website and mobile phone app can be used to log sightings of live or deceased wombats and wombat burrows. Since its establishment the project has recorded over 23,000 sightings across New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. More recently, the citizen science project has published findings on wombat roadkill and sarcoptic mange incidence across Australia.

<text>A warhead is the section of a device that contains the explosive agent or toxic (biological, chemical, or nuclear) material that is delivered by a missile, rocket, torpedo, or bomb.

==Classification==
Types of warheads include:
*Explosive: An explosive charge is used to disintegrate the target, and damage surrounding areas with a blast wave.
**Conventional: Chemicals such as gunpowder and high explosives store significant energy within their molecular bonds. This energy can be released quickly by a trigger, such as an electric spark. Thermobaric weapons enhance the blast effect by utilizing the surrounding atmosphere in their explosive reactions.
***Blast: A strong shock wave is provided by the detonation of the explosive.
***Fragmentation: Metal fragments are projected at high velocity to cause damage or injury.
***Continuous rod: Metal bars welded on their ends form a compact cylinder of interconnected rods, which is violently expanded into a contiguous zig-zag-shaped ring by an explosive detonation. The rapidly expanding ring produces a planar cutting effect that is devastating against military aircraft, which may be designed to be resistant to shrapnel.
***Shaped charge: The effect of the explosive charge is focused onto a specially shaped metal liner to project a hypervelocity jet of metal, to perforate heavy armour.
****Explosively formed penetrator: Instead of turning a thin metal liner into a focused jet, the detonation wave is directed against a concave metal plate at the front of the warhead, propelling it at high velocity while simultaneously deforming it into a projectile.
**Nuclear: A runaway nuclear fission (fission bomb) or nuclear fusion (Thermonuclear weapon) reaction causes immense energy release.
*Chemical: A toxic chemical, such as poison gas or nerve gas, is dispersed, which is designed to injure or kill human beings.
*Biological: An infectious agent, such as anthrax spores, is dispersed, which is designed to sicken or kill humans.

Often, a biological or chemical warhead will use an explosive charge for rapid dispersal.

== Detonators ==
Explosive warheads contain detonators to trigger the explosion.

Types of detonators include:

<doc id="33868" wikidata="Q2226962" url="?curid=33868" title="Casorati–Weierstrass theorem">
<text>In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Casorati–Weierstrass theorem describes the behaviour of holomorphic functions near their essential singularities. It is named for Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass and Felice Casorati. In Russian literature it is called Sokhotski&#x27;s theorem, because it was discovered independently by Sokhotski in 1868.

==Formal statement of the theorem==
Start with some open subset formula_1 in the complex plane containing the number formula_2, and a function formula_3 that is holomorphic on formula_4, but has an essential singularity at formula_2 . The &quot;Casorati–Weierstrass theorem&quot; then states that 
This can also be stated as follows: 
Or in still more descriptive terms:
The theorem is considerably strengthened by Picard&#x27;s great theorem, which states, in the notation above, that formula_3 assumes &quot;every&quot; complex value, with one possible exception, infinitely often on formula_7.

In the case that formula_3 is an entire function and formula_9, the theorem says that the values formula_10 approach every complex number and formula_11, as formula_12 tends to infinity.
It is remarkable that this does not hold for holomorphic maps in higher dimensions, as the famous example of Pierre Fatou shows.

==Examples==
The function has an essential singularity at 0, but the function does not (it has a pole at 0).

Consider the function
formula_13

This function has the following Laurent series about the essential singular point at 0:
formula_14

Because formula_15 exists for all points we know that is analytic in a punctured neighborhood of . Hence it is an isolated singularity, as well as being an essential singularity. 

Using a change of variable to polar coordinates formula_16 our function, becomes:
formula_17

Taking the absolute value of both sides:
formula_18

Thus, for values of &quot;θ&quot; such that , we have formula_19 as formula_20, and for formula_21, formula_22 as formula_20.

Consider what happens, for example when &quot;z&quot; takes values on a circle of diameter tangent to the imaginary axis. This circle is given by . Then,
formula_24
and
formula_25

Thus,formula_26 may take any positive value other than zero by the appropriate choice of &quot;R&quot;. As formula_27 on the circle, formula_28 with &quot;R&quot; fixed. So this part of the equation:
formula_29
takes on all values on the unit circle infinitely often. Hence takes on the value of every number in the complex plane except for zero infinitely often.

==Proof of the theorem==
A short proof of the theorem is as follows:

Take as given that function is meromorphic on some punctured neighborhood , and that is an essential singularity. Assume by way of contradiction that some value exists that the function can never get close to; that is: assume that there is some complex value and some such that for all in at which is defined.

Then the new function:
formula_30
must be holomorphic on , with zeroes at the poles of &quot;f&quot;, and bounded by 1/ε. It can therefore be analytically continued (or continuously extended, or holomorphically extended) to &quot;all&quot; of &quot;V&quot; by Riemann&#x27;s analytic continuation theorem. So the original function can be expressed in terms of :
formula_31
for all arguments &quot;z&quot; in &quot;V&quot; \ {&quot;z&quot;0}. Consider the two possible cases for
formula_32

If the limit is 0, then &quot;f&quot; has a pole at &quot;z&quot;0 . If the limit is not 0, then &quot;z&quot;0 is a removable singularity of &quot;f&quot; . Both possibilities contradict the assumption that the point &quot;z&quot;0 is an essential singularity of the function &quot;f&quot; . Hence the assumption is false and the theorem holds.

==History==
The history of this important theorem is described by Collingwood and Lohwater. It was published by Weierstrass in 1876 (in German) and by Sokhotski in 1868 in his Master thesis (in Russian). So it was called Sokhotski&#x27;s theorem in the Russian literature and Weierstrass&#x27;s theorem in the Western literature. The same theorem was published by Casorati in 1868, and by Briot and Bouquet in the &quot;first edition&quot; of their book (1859).
However, Briot and Bouquet &quot;removed&quot; this theorem from the second edition (1875).

<text>Walter Whitman Jr. (; May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist, and journalist; he also wrote two novels. He is considered one of the most influential poets in American literature. Whitman incorporated both transcendentalism and realism in his writings and is often called the father of free verse. His work was controversial in his time, particularly his 1855 poetry collection &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, which was described by some as obscene for its overt sensuality.

Whitman was born in Huntington on Long Island and lived in Brooklyn as a child and through much of his career. At age 11, he left formal schooling to go to work. He worked as a journalist, a teacher, and a government clerk. Whitman&#x27;s major poetry collection, &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, first published in 1855, was financed with his own money and became well known. The work was an attempt to reach out to the common person with an American epic. Whitman continued expanding and revising &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; until his death in 1892.

During the American Civil War, he went to Washington, D.C., and worked in hospitals caring for the wounded. His poetry often focused on both loss and healing. On the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, whom Whitman greatly admired, he authored two poems, &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot; and &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot;, and gave a series of lectures on Lincoln. After suffering a stroke towards the end of his life, Whitman moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral was a public event.

Whitman&#x27;s influence on poetry remains strong. Art historian Mary Berenson wrote, &quot;You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;... He has expressed that civilization, &#x27;up to date,&#x27; as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him.&quot; Modernist poet Ezra Pound called Whitman &quot;America&#x27;s poet... He America.&quot; According to the Poetry Foundation, he is &quot;America&#x27;s world poet—a latter-day successor to Homer, Virgil, Dante, and Shakespeare.&quot;

==Life and work==
===Early life===

Whitman was born on May 31, 1819, in West Hills, New York, the second of nine children of Quaker parents Walter and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, of English and Dutch descent respectively. He was immediately nicknamed &quot;Walt&quot; to distinguish him from his father. At the age of four, Whitman moved with his family from Huntington to Brooklyn, living in a series of homes, in part due to bad investments. Whitman looked back on his childhood as generally restless and unhappy, given his family&#x27;s difficult economic struggles. One happy moment that he later recalled was when he was lifted in the air and kissed on the cheek by the Marquis de Lafayette during a celebration of the setting of the Brooklyn Apprentices&#x27; Library&#x27;s cornerstone by Lafayette in Brooklyn on July 4, 1825. Whitman later worked as a librarian at that institution.

At the age of 11, Whitman ended his formal schooling and sought employment to assist his family, which was struggling economically. He was an office boy for two lawyers and later was an apprentice and printer&#x27;s devil for the weekly Long Island newspaper the &quot;Patriot&quot;, edited by Samuel E. Clements. There, Whitman learned about the printing press and typesetting. He may have written &quot;sentimental bits&quot; of filler material for occasional issues. Clements aroused controversy when he and two friends attempted to dig up the corpse of the Quaker minister Elias Hicks to create a plaster mold of his head. Clements left the &quot;Patriot&quot; shortly afterward, possibly as a result of the controversy.

===Career===

The following summer Whitman worked for another printer, Erastus Worthington, in Brooklyn. His family moved back to West Hills, New York, on Long Island in the spring, but Whitman remained and took a job at the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading Whig weekly newspaper the &quot;Long-Island Star&quot;. While at the &quot;Star&quot;, Whitman became a regular patron of the local library, joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances, and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the &quot;New-York Mirror&quot;. At the age of 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the &quot;Star&quot; and Brooklyn. He moved to New York City to work as a compositor though, in later years, Whitman could not remember where. He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district, and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the Panic of 1837. In May 1836, he rejoined his family, now living in Hempstead, Long Island. Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher.

After his teaching attempts, Whitman returned to Huntington, New York, to found his own newspaper, the &quot;Long-Islander&quot;. Whitman served as publisher, editor, pressman, and distributor and even provided home delivery. After ten months, he sold the publication to E. O. Crowell, whose first issue appeared on July 12, 1839. There are no known surviving copies of the &quot;Long-Islander&quot; published under Whitman. By the summer of 1839, he found a job as a typesetter in Jamaica, Queens, with the &quot;Long Island Democrat&quot;, edited by James J. Brenton. He left shortly thereafter, and made another attempt at teaching from the winter of 1840 to the spring of 1841. One story, possibly , tells of Whitman&#x27;s being chased away from a teaching job in Southold, New York, in 1840. After a local preacher called him a &quot;Sodomite&quot;, Whitman was allegedly tarred and feathered. Biographer Justin Kaplan notes that the story is likely untrue, because Whitman regularly vacationed in the town thereafter. Biographer Jerome Loving calls the incident a &quot;myth&quot;. During this time, Whitman published a series of ten editorials, called &quot;Sun-Down Papers—From the Desk of a Schoolmaster&quot;, in three newspapers between the winter of 1840 and July 1841. In these essays, he adopted a constructed persona, a technique he would employ throughout his career.

Whitman moved to New York City in May, initially working a low-level job at the &quot;New World&quot;, working under Park Benjamin Sr. and Rufus Wilmot Griswold. He continued working for short periods of time for various newspapers; in 1842 he was editor of the &quot;Aurora&quot; and from 1846 to 1848 he was editor of the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;. While working for the latter institution, many of his publications were in the area of music criticism, and it is during this time that he became a devoted lover of Italian opera through reviewing performances of works by Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi. This new interest had an impact on his writing in free verse. He later said, &quot;But for the opera, I could never have written &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;.&quot;

Throughout the 1840s, Whitman contributed freelance fiction and poetry to various periodicals, including &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; magazine edited by John Neal. Whitman lost his position at the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; in 1848 after siding with the free-soil &quot;Barnburner&quot; wing of the Democratic party against the newspaper&#x27;s owner, Isaac Van Anden, who belonged to the conservative, or &quot;Hunker&quot;, wing of the party. Whitman was a delegate to the 1848 founding convention of the Free Soil Party, which was concerned about the threat slavery would pose to free white labor and northern businessmen moving into the newly colonized western territories. Abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison derided the party philosophy as &quot;white manism&quot;.

In 1852, he serialized a novel, &quot;Life and Adventures of Jack Engle&quot;, in six installments of New York&#x27;s &quot;The Sunday Dispatch&quot;. In 1858, Whitman published a 47,000 word series, &quot;Manly Health and Training&quot;, under the pen name Mose Velsor. Apparently he drew the name Velsor from Van Velsor, his mother&#x27;s family name. This self-help guide recommends beards, nude sunbathing, comfortable shoes, bathing daily in cold water, eating meat almost exclusively, plenty of fresh air, and getting up early each morning. Present-day writers have called &quot;Manly Health and Training&quot; &quot;quirky&quot;, &quot;so over the top&quot;, &quot;a pseudoscientific tract&quot;, and &quot;wacky&quot;.

===&quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;===
Whitman claimed that after years of competing for &quot;the usual rewards&quot;, he determined to become a poet. He first experimented with a variety of popular literary genres that appealed to the cultural tastes of the period. As early as 1850, he began writing what would become &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, a collection of poetry that he would continue editing and revising until his death. Whitman intended to write a distinctly American epic and used free verse with a cadence based on the Bible. At the end of June 1855, Whitman surprised his brothers with the already-printed first edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. George &quot;didn&#x27;t think it worth reading&quot;.

Whitman paid for the publication of the first edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; himself and had it printed at a local print shop during its employees&#x27; breaks from commercial jobs. A total of 795 copies were printed. No author is named; instead, facing the title page was an engraved portrait done by Samuel Hollyer, but 500 lines into the body of the text he calls himself &quot;Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshly, and sensual, no sentimentalist, no stander above men or women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest&quot;. The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines. The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled 2315 lines with 1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem, later called &quot;Song of Myself&quot;. The book received its strongest praise from Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote a flattering five-page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends. Emerson called it &quot;the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.&quot; Emerson had called for the first truly American poet, saying that aspects of America &quot;are yet unsung. Yet America is a poem in our eyes.&quot;

The first edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest, in part due to Emerson&#x27;s praise, but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly &quot;obscene&quot; nature of the poetry. Geologist Peter Lesley wrote to Emerson, calling the book &quot;trashy, profane &amp; obscene&quot; and the author &quot;a pretentious ass&quot;. Whitman embossed a quote from Emerson&#x27;s letter, &quot;I greet you at the beginning of a great career&quot;, in gold leaf on the spine of the second edition. Of this action, Laura Dassow Walls, professor emerita of English at the University of Notre Dame, wrote: &quot;In one stroke, Whitman had given birth to the modern cover blurb, quite without Emerson&#x27;s permission.&quot;

On July 11, 1855, a few days after &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was published, Whitman&#x27;s father died at the age of 65. In the months following the first edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, critical responses began focusing on what some found offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems, in August 1856. &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was revised and re-released in 1860, again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman&#x27;s life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.

During the first publications of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, Whitman had financial difficulties and was forced to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn&#x27;s &quot;Daily Times&quot; starting in May 1857. As an editor, he oversaw the paper&#x27;s contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials. He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear whether he was fired or chose to leave. Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s.

===Civil War years===
As the American Civil War was beginning, Whitman published his poem &quot;&quot; as a patriotic rally call for the Union. Whitman&#x27;s brother George had joined the Union army in the 51st New York Infantry Regiment and began sending Whitman several vividly detailed letters of the battle front. On December 16, 1862, a listing of fallen and wounded soldiers in the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; included &quot;First Lieutenant G. W. Whitmore&quot;, which Whitman worried was a reference to his brother George. He made his way south immediately to find him, though his wallet was stolen on the way. &quot;Walking all day and night, unable to ride, trying to get information, trying to get access to big people&quot;, Whitman later wrote, he eventually found George alive, with only a superficial wound on his cheek. Whitman, profoundly affected by seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs, left for Washington, D.C., on December 28, 1862, with the intention of never returning to New York.

In Washington, D.C., Whitman&#x27;s friend Charley Eldridge helped him obtain part-time work in the army paymaster&#x27;s office, leaving time for Whitman to volunteer as a nurse in the army hospitals. He would write of this experience in &quot;The Great Army of the Sick&quot;, published in a New York newspaper in 1863 and, 12 years later, in a book called &quot;Memoranda During the War&quot;. He then contacted Emerson, this time to ask for help in obtaining a government post. Another friend, John Trowbridge, passed on a letter of recommendation from Emerson to Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, hoping he would grant Whitman a position in that department. Chase, however, did not want to hire the author of such a disreputable book as &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;.

The Whitman family had a difficult end to 1864. On September 30, 1864, Whitman&#x27;s brother George was captured by Confederate forces in Virginia, and another brother, Andrew Jackson, died of tuberculosis compounded by alcoholism on December 3. That month, Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum. Whitman&#x27;s spirits were raised, however, when he finally got a better-paying government post as a low-grade clerk in the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior, thanks to his friend William Douglas O&#x27;Connor. O&#x27;Connor, a poet, daguerreotypist, and an editor at &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; wrote to William Tod Otto, Assistant Secretary of the Interior, on Whitman&#x27;s behalf. Whitman began the new appointment on January 24, 1865, with a yearly salary of $1,200. A month later, on February 24, 1865, George was released from capture and granted a furlough because of his poor health. By May 1, Whitman received a promotion to a slightly higher clerkship and published &quot;Drum-Taps&quot;.

Effective June 30, 1865, however, Whitman was fired from his job. His dismissal came from the new Secretary of the Interior, former Iowa Senator James Harlan. Though Harlan dismissed several clerks who &quot;were seldom at their respective desks&quot;, he may have fired Whitman on moral grounds after finding an 1860 edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. O&#x27;Connor protested until J. Hubley Ashton had Whitman transferred to the Attorney General&#x27;s office on July 1. O&#x27;Connor, though, was still upset and vindicated Whitman by publishing a biased and exaggerated biographical study, &quot;The Good Gray Poet&quot;, in January 1866. The fifty-cent pamphlet defended Whitman as a wholesome patriot, established the poet&#x27;s nickname and increased his popularity. Also aiding in his popularity was the publication of &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot;, a conventional poem on the death of Abraham Lincoln, the only poem to appear in anthologies during Whitman&#x27;s lifetime.

Part of Whitman&#x27;s role at the Attorney General&#x27;s office was interviewing former Confederate soldiers for presidential pardons. &quot;There are real characters among them&quot;, he later wrote, &quot;and you know I have a fancy for anything out of the ordinary.&quot; In August 1866, he took a month off to prepare a new edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher. He hoped it would be its last edition. In February 1868, &quot;Poems of Walt Whitman&quot; was published in England thanks to the influence of William Michael Rossetti, with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved. The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer Anne Gilchrist. Another edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident. As Whitman&#x27;s international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general&#x27;s office until January 1872. He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother, who was now nearly eighty and struggling with arthritis. He also traveled and was invited to Dartmouth College to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.

===Health decline and death===

After suffering a paralytic stroke in early 1873, Whitman was induced to move from Washington to the home of his brother—George Washington Whitman, an engineer—at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New Jersey. His mother, having fallen ill, was also there and died that same year in May. Both events were difficult for Whitman and left him depressed. He remained at his brother&#x27;s home until buying his own in 1884. However, before purchasing his home, he spent the greatest period of his residence in Camden at his brother&#x27;s home on Stevens Street. While in residence there he was very productive, publishing three versions of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; among other works. He was also last fully physically active in this house, receiving both Oscar Wilde and Thomas Eakins. His other brother, Edward, an &quot;invalid&quot; since birth, lived in the house.

When his brother and sister-in-law were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street (now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). First taken care of by tenants, he was completely bedridden for most of his time in Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street. She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals. During this time, Whitman produced further editions of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; in 1876, 1881, and 1889.

While in South Jersey, Whitman spent a good portion of his time in the then quite pastoral community of Laurel Springs, between 1876 and 1884, converting one of the Stafford Farm buildings to his summer home. The restored summer home has been preserved as a museum by the local historical society. Part of his &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was written here, and in his &quot;Specimen Days&quot; he wrote of the spring, creek and lake. To him, Laurel Lake was &quot;the prettiest lake in: either America or Europe&quot;.

As the end of 1891 approached, he prepared a final edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, a version that has been nicknamed the &quot;Deathbed Edition&quot;. He wrote, &quot;L. of G. &quot;at last complete&quot;—after 33 y&#x27;rs of hackling at it, all times &amp; moods of my life, fair weather &amp; foul, all parts of the land, and peace &amp; war, young &amp; old.&quot; Preparing for death, Whitman commissioned a granite mausoleum shaped like a house for $4,000 and visited it often during construction. In the last week of his life, he was too weak to lift a knife or fork and wrote: &quot;I suffer all the time: I have no relief, no escape: it is monotony—monotony—monotony—in pain.&quot;
Walt Whitman died on March 26, 1892, at his home in Camden, New Jersey at the age of 72. An autopsy revealed his lungs had diminished to one-eighth their normal breathing capacity, a result of bronchial pneumonia, and that an egg-sized abscess on his chest had eroded one of his ribs. The cause of death was officially listed as &quot;pleurisy of the left side, consumption of the right lung, general miliary tuberculosis and parenchymatous nephritis&quot;. A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home; more than 1,000 people visited in three hours. Whitman&#x27;s oak coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him. Four days after his death, he was buried in his tomb at Harleigh Cemetery in Camden. Another public ceremony was held at the cemetery, with friends giving speeches, live music, and refreshments. Whitman&#x27;s friend, the orator Robert Ingersoll, delivered the eulogy. Later, the remains of Whitman&#x27;s parents and two of his brothers and their families were moved to the mausoleum. His brain was donated to the American Anthropometric Society in Philadelphia, but it was accidentally destroyed.

==Writing==
Whitman&#x27;s work broke the boundaries of poetic form and is generally prose-like. Its signature style deviates from the course set by his predecessors and includes &quot;idiosyncratic treatment of the body and the soul as well as of the self and the other.&quot; It uses unusual images and symbols, including rotting leaves, tufts of straw, and debris. Whitman openly wrote about death and sexuality, including prostitution. He is often labeled the father of free verse, though he did not invent it.

===Poetic theory===
Whitman wrote in the preface to the 1855 edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;: &quot;The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.&quot; He believed there was a vital, relationship between the poet and society. He emphasized this connection especially in &quot;Song of Myself&quot; by using an all-powerful first-person narration. An American epic, it deviated from the historic use of an elevated hero and instead assumed the identity of the common people. &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; also responded to the impact of rapid urbanization in the United States on the masses.

==Lifestyle and beliefs==
===Alcohol===
Whitman was a vocal proponent of temperance and in his youth rarely drank alcohol. He once stated he did not taste &quot;strong liquor&quot; until he was 30 and occasionally argued for prohibition. His first novel, &quot;Franklin Evans, or The Inebriate&quot;, published November 23, 1842, is a temperance novel. Whitman wrote the novel at the height of the popularity of the Washingtonian movement, a movement that was plagued with contradictions, as was &quot;Franklin Evans&quot;. Years later Whitman claimed he was embarrassed by the book and called it &quot;damned rot&quot;. He dismissed it by saying he wrote the novel in three days solely for money while under the influence of alcohol. Even so, he wrote other pieces recommending temperance, including &quot;The Madman&quot; and a short story &quot;Reuben&#x27;s Last Wish&quot;. Later in life he was more liberal with alcohol, enjoying local wines and champagne.

===Religion===
Whitman was deeply influenced by deism. He denied any one faith was more important than another, and embraced all religions equally. In &quot;Song of Myself&quot;, he gave an inventory of major religions and indicated he respected and accepted all of them—a sentiment he further emphasized in his poem &quot;With Antecedents&quot;, affirming: &quot;I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god, / I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception&quot;. In 1874, he was invited to write a poem about the Spiritualism movement, to which he responded: &quot;It seems to me nearly altogether a poor, cheap, crude .&quot; Whitman was a religious skeptic: though he accepted all churches, he believed in none. God, to Whitman, was both immanent and transcendent and the human soul was immortal and in a state of progressive development. &quot;American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia&quot; classes him as one of several figures who &quot;took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.&quot;

===Sexuality===

Though biographers continue to debate Whitman&#x27;s sexuality, he is usually described as either homosexual or bisexual in his feelings and attractions. Whitman&#x27;s sexual orientation is generally assumed on the basis of his poetry, though this assumption has been disputed. His poetry depicts love and sexuality in a more earthy, individualistic way common in American culture before the medicalization of sexuality in the late 19th century. Though &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was often labeled pornographic or obscene, only one critic remarked on its author&#x27;s presumed sexual activity: in a November 1855 review, Rufus Wilmot Griswold suggested Whitman was guilty of &quot;that horrible sin not to be mentioned among Christians&quot;. The manuscript of his love poem &quot;Once I Pass&#x27;d Through A Populous City&quot;, written when Whitman was 29, indicates it was originally about a man. Late in his life, when Whitman was asked outright whether his &quot;Calamus&quot; poems were homosexual—John Addington Symonds inquired about &quot;athletic friendship&quot;, &quot;the love of man for man&quot;, or &quot;the Love of Friends&quot;—he chose not to respond.

Whitman had intense friendships with many men and boys throughout his life. Some biographers have suggested that he did not actually engage in sexual relationships with males, while others cite letters, journal entries, and other sources that they claim as proof of the sexual nature of some of his relationships. English poet and critic John Addington Symonds spent 20 years in correspondence trying to pry the answer from him. In 1890, Symonds wrote to Whitman: &quot;In your conception of Comradeship, do you contemplate the possible intrusion of those semi-sexual emotions and actions which no doubt do occur between men?&quot; In reply, Whitman denied that his work had any such implication, asserting &quot;[T]hat the calamus part has even allow&#x27;d the possibility of such construction as mention&#x27;d is terrible—I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to be even mention&#x27;d for such gratuitous and quite at this time entirely undream&#x27;d &amp; unreck&#x27;d possibility of morbid inferences—wh&#x27; are disavow&#x27;d by me and seem damnable&quot;, and insisting that he had fathered six illegitimate children. Some contemporary scholars are skeptical of the veracity of Whitman&#x27;s denial or the existence of the children he claimed. In a letter dated August 21, 1890, Whitman claimed: &quot;I have had six children—two are dead.&quot; This claim has never been corroborated.

Peter Doyle may be the most likely candidate for the love of Whitman&#x27;s life. Doyle was a bus conductor whom Whitman met around 1866, and the two were inseparable for several years. Interviewed in 1895, Doyle said: &quot;We were familiar at once—I put my hand on his knee—we understood. He did not get out at the end of the trip—in fact went all the way back with me.&quot; In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle&#x27;s initials using the code &quot;16.4&quot; (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet). Oscar Wilde met Whitman in the United States in 1882 and later told the homosexual-rights activist George Cecil Ives that &quot;I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips.&quot; The only explicit description of Whitman&#x27;s sexual activities is secondhand. In 1924, Edward Carpenter told Gavin Arthur of a sexual encounter in his youth with Whitman, the details of which Arthur recorded in his journal.Another possible lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, he lived on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him a number of years and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman&#x27;s money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as &quot;thick&quot;. Though some biographers describe Duckett as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph together is described as &quot;modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait&quot;, part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Another young man with whom Whitman had an intense relationship was Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met in 1876, when Stafford was 18. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given over the course of a stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman: &quot;You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death.&quot;

There is also some evidence that Whitman had sexual relationships with women. He had a romantic friendship with a New York actress, Ellen Grey, in the spring of 1862, but it is not known whether it was also sexual. He still had a photograph of her decades later, when he moved to Camden, and he called her &quot;an old sweetheart of mine&quot;. Toward the end of his life, he often told stories of previous girlfriends and sweethearts and denied an allegation from the &quot;New York Herald&quot; that he had &quot;never had a love affair&quot;. As Whitman biographer Jerome Loving wrote, &quot;the discussion of Whitman&#x27;s sexual orientation will probably continue in spite of whatever evidence emerges.&quot;

===Shakespeare authorship===
Whitman was an adherent of the Shakespeare authorship question, refusing to believe in the historical attribution of the works to William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1888, Whitman commented in &quot;November Boughs&quot;:

===Slavery===
Like many in the Free Soil Party who were concerned about the threat slavery would pose to free white labor and northern businessmen exploiting the newly colonized western territories, Whitman opposed the extension of slavery in the United States and supported the Wilmot Proviso. At first he was opposed to abolitionism, believing the movement did more harm than good. In 1846, he wrote that the abolitionists had, in fact, slowed the advancement of their cause by their &quot; and officiousness&quot;. His main concern was that their methods disrupted the democratic process, as did the refusal of the Southern states to put the interests of the nation as a whole above their own. In 1856, in his unpublished &quot;The Eighteenth Presidency&quot;, addressing the men of the South, he wrote &quot;you are either to abolish slavery or it will abolish you&quot;. Whitman also subscribed to the widespread opinion that even free African-Americans should not vote and was concerned at the increasing number of African-Americans in the legislature; as David Reynolds notes, Whitman wrote in prejudiced terms of these new voters and politicians, calling them &quot;blacks, with about as much intellect and calibre (in the mass) as so many baboons.&quot; George Hutchinson and David Drews have written that &quot;what little is known about the early development of Whitman&#x27;s racial awareness suggests that he imbibed the prevailing white prejudices of his time and place, thinking of black people as servile, shiftless, ignorant, and given to stealing,&quot; but that despite his views remaining largely unchanged, &quot;readers of the twentieth century, including black ones, imagined him as a fervent antiracist.&quot;

===Nationalism===
Whitman is often described as America&#x27;s national poet, creating an image of the United States for itself. &quot;Although he is often considered a champion of democracy and equality, Whitman constructs a hierarchy with himself at the head, America below, and the rest of the world in a subordinate position.&quot; In his study &quot;The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy&quot;, Stephen John Mack suggests that critics, who tend to ignore it, should look again at Whitman&#x27;s nationalism: &quot;Whitman&#x27;s seemingly mawkish celebrations of the United States[...] [are] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away&quot; (xv–xvi). Nathanael O&#x27;Reilly in an essay on &quot;Walt Whitman&#x27;s Nationalism in the First Edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;&quot; claims that &quot;Whitman&#x27;s imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights.&quot; Whitman&#x27;s nationalism avoided issues concerning the treatment of Native Americans. As George Hutchinson and David Drews further suggest in an essay &quot;Racial attitudes&quot;: &quot;Clearly, Whitman could not consistently reconcile the ingrained, even foundational, racist character of the United States with its egalitarian ideals. He could not even reconcile such contradictions in his own psyche.&quot; The authors concluded their essay with:

In reference to the Mexican–American War, Whitman wrote in 1864 that Mexico was &quot;the only [country] to whom we have ever really done wrong.&quot; In 1883, celebrating the 333rd anniversary of Santa Fe, Whitman argued that the indigenous and Spanish-Indian elements would supply leading traits in the &quot;composite American identity of the future.&quot;

==Legacy and influence==

Whitman has been claimed as the first &quot;poet of democracy&quot; in the United States, a title meant to reflect his ability to write in a singularly American character. An American-British friend of Whitman, Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, wrote: &quot;You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; ... He has expressed that civilization, &#x27;up to date,&#x27; as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him.&quot; Andrew Carnegie called him &quot;the great poet of America so far&quot;. Whitman considered himself a messiah-like figure in poetry. Others agreed: one of his admirers, William Sloane Kennedy, speculated that &quot;people will be celebrating the birth of Walt Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ&quot;.

Literary critic Harold Bloom wrote, as the introduction for the 150th anniversary of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;:
In his own time, Whitman attracted an influential coterie of disciples and admirers. Among his admirers were the Eagle Street College, an informal group established in 1885 at the home of James William Wallace on Eagle Street in Bolton, England, to read and discuss the poetry of Whitman. The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or Whitmanites. Its members held an annual &quot;Whitman Day&quot; celebration around the poet&#x27;s birthday. Whitman&#x27;s niece, Jessie Louisa Whitman, also contributed to his legacy by allowing Ralph L. Fansler to record her memories of Whitman during a series of interviews that took place between 1939 and 1943. In the interviews Jessie is noted for her faithfulness and lifelong interest in her uncle. Jessie held letters written by Whitman, which were given to the Missouri Historical Society in 1960.

=== American poets ===
Whitman is one of the most influential American poets. Modernist poet Ezra Pound called Whitman &quot;America&#x27;s poet ... He &quot;is&quot; America.&quot; To poet Langston Hughes, who wrote &quot;I, too, sing America&quot;, Whitman was a literary hero. Whitman&#x27;s lifestyle was adopted by the Beat movement and its leaders such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as anti-war poets such as Adrienne Rich, Alicia Ostriker, and Gary Snyder. Lawrence Ferlinghetti numbered himself among Whitman&#x27;s &quot;wild children&quot;, and the title of Ferlinghetti&#x27;s 1961 collection &quot;Starting from San Francisco&quot; is a reference to Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Starting from Paumanok&quot;. June Jordan published a pivotal essay entitled &quot;For the Sake of People&#x27;s Poetry: Walt Whitman and the Rest of Us&quot;, praising Whitman as a democratic poet whose works speak to ethnic minorities from all backgrounds. United States poet laureate Joy Harjo, who is a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, counts Whitman among her influences.

=== Latin American poets ===
Whitman&#x27;s poetry influenced Latin American and Caribbean poets in the 19th and 20th centuries, starting with Cuban poet, philosopher, and nationalist leader José Martí, who published essays in Spanish on Whitman&#x27;s writings in 1887. Álvaro Armando Vasseur&#x27;s 1912 translations further raised Whitman&#x27;s profile in Latin America. Peruvian vanguardist César Vallejo, Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, and Argentine Jorge Luis Borges acknowledged Walt Whitman&#x27;s influence.

=== European authors ===
Some, like Oscar Wilde and Edward Carpenter, viewed Whitman both as a prophet of a utopian future and of same-sex desire—the passion of comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly socialism. Whitman also influenced Bram Stoker, author of &quot;Dracula&quot;, and was a model for the character of Dracula. Stoker said in his notes that Dracula represented the quintessential male which, to Stoker, was Whitman, with whom he corresponded until Whitman&#x27;s death.

===Film and television===
Whitman&#x27;s life and verse have been referenced in a substantial number of works of film and video. In &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989) by Peter Weir, teacher John Keating, portrayed by Robin Williams, inspires his students with the works of Whitman, Thoreau, Frost, Shakespeare and Byron.

In the movie &quot;Beautiful Dreamers&quot; (Hemdale Films, 1992) Whitman was portrayed by Rip Torn. Whitman visits an insane asylum in London, Ontario, where some of his ideas are adopted as part of an occupational therapy program.

Whitman&#x27;s poem &quot;Yonnondio&quot; influenced both a book (&quot;Yonnondio: From the Thirties&quot;, 1974) by Tillie Olsen and a sixteen-minute film, &quot;Yonnondio&quot; (1994) by Ali Mohamed Selim.

Whitman&#x27;s poem &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; (1855) was used by Ray Bradbury as the title of a short story and a short story collection. Bradbury&#x27;s story was adapted for the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode of May 18, 1962, in which a bereaved family buys a made-to-order robot grandmother to forever love and serve the family.
&quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; inspired the showcase finale in the movie &quot;Fame&quot; (1980), a diverse fusion of gospel, rock, and orchestra.

===Music and audio recordings===
Whitman&#x27;s poetry has been set to music by more than 500 composers; indeed it has been suggested that his poetry has been set to music more than that of any other American poet except for Emily Dickinson and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Those who have set his poems to music include John Adams; Ernst Bacon; Leonard Bernstein; Benjamin Britten; Rhoda Coghill; David Conte; Ronald Corp; George Crumb; Frederick Delius; Howard Hanson; Karl Amadeus Hartmann; Hans Werner Henze; Bernard Herrmann;Jennifer Higdon; Paul Hindemith; Ned Rorem; Howard Skempton; Eva Ruth Spalding; Williametta Spencer; Charles Villiers Stanford; Robert Strassburg; Ananda Sukarlan; Ivana Marburger Themmen; Rossini Vrionides; Ralph Vaughan Williams; Kurt Weill; Helen L. Weiss; Charles Wood; and Roger Sessions. &quot;Crossing&quot;, an opera composed by Matthew Aucoin and inspired by Whitman&#x27;s Civil War diaries, premiered in 2015.

In 2014, German publisher Hörbuch Hamburg issued the bilingual double-CD audio book of the &quot;Kinder Adams/Children of Adam&quot; cycle, based on translations by Kai Grehn in the 2005 &quot;Children of Adam from Leaves of Grass&quot; (Galerie Vevais), accompanying a collection of nude photography by Paul Cava. The audio release included a complete reading by Iggy Pop, as well as readings by Marianne Sägebrecht; Martin Wuttke; Birgit Minichmayr; Alexander Fehling; Lars Rudolph; Volker Bruch; Paula Beer; Josef Osterndorf; Ronald Lippok; Jule Böwe; and Robert Gwisdek. In 2014 composer John Zorn released &quot;On Leaves of Grass&quot;, an album inspired by and dedicated to Whitman.

===Namesake recognition===
Whitman&#x27;s importance in American culture is reflected in schools, roads, rest stops, and bridges named after him. Among them are the Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland and Walt Whitman High School on Long Island, Walt Whitman Elementary School (Woodbury, New York), Walt Whitman Boulevard (Cherry Hill, New Jersey), and a service area on the New Jersey Turnpike in Cherry Hill, to name a few.
The Walt Whitman Bridge, which crosses the Delaware River between Philadelphia and Gloucester City, New Jersey near Whitman&#x27;s home in Camden, New Jersey, was opened on May 16, 1957. A statue of Whitman by Jo Davidson is located at the entrance to the Walt Whitman Bridge and another casting resides in the Bear Mountain State Park. The controversy that surrounded the naming of the Walt Whitman bridge has been documented in a series of letters from members of the public, which are held in the University of Pennsylvania library. The web page about this matter states: &quot;The bridge was meant to be named after a person of note who had lived in New Jersey, but some area citizens opposed the name &#x27;Walt Whitman Bridge&#x27;... Many objecting to the choice of his name for the bridge saw Whitman&#x27;s work as sympathizing with communist ideals and criticized him for his egalitarian view of humanity.&quot;

In 1997, the Walt Whitman Community School in Dallas opened, becoming the first private high school catering to LGBT youth. His other namesakes include the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York, near his birthplace, and Walt Whitman Road, which spans Huntington Station to Melville on Long Island.

Whitman was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2009, and, in 2013, he was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people.

A coed summer camp founded in 1948 in Piermont, New Hampshire, is named after Whitman.

A crater on Mercury is named for him.

<text>The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an intergovernmental organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland that regulates and facilitates international trade. Governments use the organization to establish, revise, and enforce the rules that govern international trade in cooperation with the United Nations System. The WTO is the world&#x27;s largest international economic organization, with 166 members representing over 98% of global trade and global GDP.

The WTO facilitates trade in goods, services and intellectual property among participating countries by providing a framework for negotiating trade agreements, which usually aim to reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas, and other restrictions; these agreements are signed by representatives of member governments and ratified by their legislatures. It also administers independent dispute resolution for enforcing participants&#x27; adherence to trade agreements and resolving trade-related disputes. The organization prohibits discrimination between trading partners, but provides exceptions for environmental protection, national security, and other important goals.

It officially commenced operations on 1 January 1995, pursuant to the 1994 Marrakesh Agreement, thus replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that had been established in 1948.

Its top decision-making body is the Ministerial Conference, which is composed of all members and usually convenes biennially; consensus is emphasized in all decisions. Day-to-day functions are handled by the General Council, made up of representatives from all members. A Secretariat of over 600 personnel, led by the Director-General and four deputies, provides administrative, professional, and technical services. The WTO&#x27;s annual budget is roughly 220 million USD, which is contributed by members based on their proportion of international trade.

Studies show the WTO has increased trade and reduced trade barriers. It has also influenced trade agreement generally; the vast majority of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) explicitly reference the WTO, with substantial portions of text copied from WTO agreements. Goal 10 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals also referenced WTO agreements as instruments of reducing inequality. However, critics contend that the benefits of WTO-facilitated free trade are not shared equally.

==History==


The WTO precursor, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), was established by a multilateral treaty of 23 countries in 1947 after the end of World War II, in the wake of other new multilateral institutions dedicated to international economic cooperation—such as the World Bank (founded 1944) and the International Monetary Fund (founded 1944–1945). A comparable international institution for trade, named the International Trade Organization (ITO), never started, since the United States and other signatories did not ratify the establishment treaty, and so the GATT slowly became a &quot;de facto&quot; international organization.

===GATT negotiations before Uruguay===
Seven rounds of negotiations occurred under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1949 to 1979). The first real GATT trade rounds (1947 to 1960) concentrated on further reducing tariffs. Then the Kennedy Round in the mid-sixties brought about a GATT anti-dumping agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies represented the first major attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on non-tariff barriers, which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because not all GATT members accepted these plurilateral agreements, they were often informally called &quot;codes&quot;. (The Uruguay Round amended several of these codes and turned them into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft, and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two.) Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to establish some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty régime on a provisional basis.

===Uruguay Round: 1986–1994===
Well before GATT&#x27;s 40th anniversary (due in 1987–1988), GATT members concluded that the GATT system was straining to adapt to a globalizing world economy. In response to problems identified in the 1982 Ministerial Declaration (structural deficiencies, spill-over impacts of certain countries&#x27; policies on world trade which GATT could not manage, etc.), a meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay, launched the eighth GATT round—known as the &quot;Uruguay Round&quot;—in September 1986.

In the biggest negotiating mandate on trade ever agreed, the Uruguay Round talks aimed to extend the trading system into several new areas, notably trade in services and intellectual property, and to reform trade in the sensitive sectors of agriculture and textiles; all the original GATT articles were up for review. The Final Act concluding the Uruguay Round and officially establishing the WTO regime was signed on 15 April 1994, during the ministerial meeting at Marrakesh, Morocco—hence known as the Marrakesh Agreement.

The GATT still exists as the WTO&#x27;s umbrella treaty for trade in goods, updated as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations (a distinction is made between &quot;GATT 1994&quot;, the updated parts of GATT, and &quot;GATT 1947&quot;, the original agreement which is still the heart of GATT 1994). GATT 1994 is not, however, the only legally binding agreement included via the Final Act at Marrakesh; a long list of about 60 agreements, annexes, decisions, and understandings was adopted. The agreements fall into six main parts:
* the Agreement Establishing the WTO
* the Multilateral Agreements on Trade in Goods, including the GATT 1994 and the Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMS)
* the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)
* the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
* dispute settlement
* reviews of governments&#x27; trade policies

In terms of the WTO&#x27;s principle relating to tariff &quot;ceiling-binding&quot; (No. 3), the Uruguay Round has been successful in increasing binding commitments by both developed and developing countries, as may be seen in the percentages of tariffs bound before and after the 1986–1994 talks.

===Ministerial conferences===
The highest decision-making body of the WTO, the Ministerial Conference, usually meets every two years. It brings together all members of the WTO, all of which are countries or customs unions. The Ministerial Conference can take decisions on all matters under any of the multilateral trade agreements. Some meetings, such as the inaugural ministerial conference in Singapore (1996) and the inaugural ministerial conference in Cancún, Mexico (2003) involved arguments between developed nations and low-income and lower-middle income countries, referred to as the &quot;Singapore issues&quot;, such as agricultural subsidies; while others such as the Seattle conference in 1999 provoked large demonstrations. The fourth ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar in 2001 approved China&#x27;s entry to the WTO and launched the Doha Development Round which was supplemented by the sixth WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong, which agreed to phase out agricultural export subsidies and to adopt the European Union&#x27;s Everything but Arms initiative to phase out tariffs for goods from the least developed countries. At the sixth WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005 in December, WTO launched the Aid for Trade initiative and it is specifically to assist developing countries in trade as included in the Sustainable Development Goal 8 which is to increase aid for trade support and economic growth.

The Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) was due to be held in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, in June 2020 but was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was later held in Geneva, Switzerland from 12–17 June 2022. The Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13) was held in Abu Dhabi, UAE on 26–29 February 2024, and extended to Friday 1 March 2024 to complete deliberations.

===Doha Round (Doha Agenda): 2001–present===
The WTO launched the current round of negotiations, the Doha Development Round, at the fourth ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar in November 2001. This was to be an ambitious effort to make globalization more inclusive and help the world&#x27;s poor, particularly by slashing barriers and subsidies in farming. The initial agenda comprised both further trade liberalization and new rule-making, underpinned by commitments to strengthen substantial assistance to developing countries.

Progress stalled over differences between developed nations and the major low-income and lower-middle income countries on issues such as industrial tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade particularly against and between the EU and the US over their maintenance of agricultural subsidies—seen to operate effectively as trade barriers. Repeated attempts to revive the talks proved unsuccessful, though the adoption of the Bali Ministerial Declaration in 2013 addressed bureaucratic barriers to commerce.

, the future of the Doha Round remained uncertain: the work programme lists 21 subjects in which the original deadline of 1 January 2005 was missed, and the round remains incomplete. The conflict between free trade on industrial goods and services but retention of protectionism on farm subsidies to domestic agricultural sectors (requested by developed countries) and the substantiation of fair trade on agricultural products (requested by developing countries) remain the major obstacles. This impasse has made it impossible to launch new WTO negotiations beyond the Doha Development Round. As a result, there have been an increasing number of bilateral free trade agreements between governments. there were various negotiation groups in the WTO system for the current stalemated agricultural trade negotiation.

==Functions==
Promotion of growth by facilitating trade is the most important function of WTO. Other important functions include:

* It oversees the implementation, administration and operation of the covered agreements (with the exception that it does not enforce any agreements when China came into the WTO in December 2001)
* It provides a forum for negotiations and for settling disputes.

Additionally, it is WTO&#x27;s duty to review and propagate the national trade policies and to ensure the coherence and transparency of trade policies through surveillance in global economic policy-making. Another priority of the WTO is the assistance of developing, least-developed and low-income countries in transition to adjust to WTO rules and disciplines through technical cooperation and training:
# The WTO shall facilitate the implementation, administration, and operation and further the objectives of this Agreement and the Multilateral Trade Agreements, and shall also provide the framework for the implementation, administration, and operation of the multilateral Trade Agreements.
# The WTO shall provide the forum for negotiations among its members concerning their multilateral trade relations in matters dealt with under the Agreement in the Annexes to this Agreement.
# The WTO shall administer the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes.
# The WTO shall administer a Trade Policy Review Mechanism.
# to achieve greater coherence in global economic policymaking, the WTO shall cooperate, as appropriate, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and its affiliated agencies.

The above five listings are the additional functions of the World Trade Organization. As globalization proceeds in today&#x27;s society, the necessity of an International Organization to manage the trading systems has been of vital importance. As the trade volume increases, issues such as protectionism, trade barriers, subsidies, violation of intellectual property arise due to the differences in the trading rules of every nation. The World Trade Organization serves as the mediator between the nations when such problems arise. WTO could be referred to as the product of globalization and also as one of the most important organizations in today&#x27;s globalized society.

The WTO is also a center of economic research and analysis: regular assessments of the global trade picture in its annual publications and research reports on specific topics are produced by the organization. Finally, the WTO cooperates closely with the two other components of the Bretton Woods system, the IMF and the World Bank.

== Key Publications ==
The WTO is recognized for producing authoritative annual reports that provide clarity on the complexities of global trade. These documents are essential for anyone involved with or interested in trade policies and trends.

=== World Trade Report ===
The World Trade Report stands as a key publication from the WTO. It delves into the current trade trends and policy challenges, offering comprehensive insights into the evolving dynamics of the global multilateral trading system and its socioeconomic implications.

=== WTO Annual Report ===
The WTO Annual Report compiles a complete overview of the organization&#x27;s activities, operations, and progress over the year. Detailed reports on the WTO&#x27;s budget and staffing highlight its commitment to transparency and accountability within the realm of global trade management.

=== World Trade Statistical Review ===
The World Trade Statistical Review has taken the place of the previously issued &quot;International Trade Statistics&quot;. As the WTO&#x27;s premier source for annual trade data, it provides thorough analysis and statistics on the latest developments in world trade, proving to be an indispensable resource for global trade information.

==Principles of the trading system== 
The WTO establishes a framework for trade policies; it does not define or specify outcomes. That is, it is concerned with setting the rules of &quot;trade policy&quot;. Five principles are of particular importance in understanding both the pre-1994 GATT and the WTO:
# Non-discrimination. It has two major components: the most favored nation (MFN) treatment and the national treatment. Both are embedded in the main WTO agreements on goods, services, and intellectual property, but their precise scope and nature differ across these areas. The MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members, i.e., a WTO member has to grant the most favorable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain product type to all other WTO members. &quot;Grant someone a special favor and you have to do the same for all other WTO members.&quot; Some exceptions exist, such as when states participate in a free trade agreement or for preferential treatment given to developing countries. National treatment means that imported goods should be treated no less favorably than domestically produced goods (at least after the foreign goods have entered the market) and was introduced to tackle non-tariff barriers to trade (e.g. technical standards, security standards et al. discriminating against imported goods).
# Reciprocity. It reflects both a desire to limit the scope of free-riding that may arise because of the MFN rule and a desire to obtain better access to foreign markets. A related point is that for a nation to negotiate, it is necessary that the gain from doing so be greater than the gain available from unilateral liberalization; reciprocal concessions intend to ensure that such gains will materialize.
# Binding and enforceable commitments. The tariff commitments made by WTO members in multilateral trade negotiation and on accession are enumerated in a legal instrument known as a schedule (list) of concessions. These schedules establish &quot;ceiling bindings&quot;: a country can change its bindings, but only after negotiating with its trading partners, which could mean compensating them for loss of trade. If satisfaction is not obtained, the complaining country may invoke the WTO dispute settlement procedures.
# Transparency. The WTO members are required to publish their trade regulations, to maintain institutions allowing for the review of administrative decisions affecting trade, to respond to requests for information by other members, and to notify changes in trade policies to the WTO. These internal transparency requirements are supplemented and facilitated by periodic country-specific reports (trade policy reviews) through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM). The WTO system tries also to improve predictability and stability, discouraging the use of quotas and other measures used to set limits on quantities of imports.
# Safety values. In specific circumstances, governments are able to restrict trade. The WTO&#x27;s agreements permit members to take measures to protect not only the environment but also public health, animal health and plant health.
There are three types of provision in this direction:
# articles allowing for the use of trade measures to attain non-economic objectives;
# articles aimed at ensuring &quot;fair competition&quot;; members must not use environmental protection measures as a means of disguising protectionist policies.
# provisions permitting intervention in trade for economic reasons.

Exceptions to the MFN principle also allow for preferential treatment of developing countries, regional free trade areas and customs unions.

==Organizational structure==
The highest authority of the WTO is the Ministerial Conference, which must meet at least every two years. The Ministerial Conference met most recently in June 2022 in Geneva.

In between each Ministerial Conference, the daily work is handled by three bodies whose membership is the same; they only differ by the terms of reference under which each body is constituted:
* The General Council
* The Dispute Settlement Body
* The Trade Policy Review Body

The General Council, whose Chair as of 2020 is David Walker of New Zealand, has the following subsidiary bodies which oversee committees in different areas:

; Council for Trade in Goods: There are 11 committees under the jurisdiction of the Goods Council each with a specific task. All members of the WTO participate in the committees. The Textiles Monitoring Body is separate from the other committees but still under the jurisdiction of the Goods Council. The body has its chairman and only 10 members. The body also has several groups relating to textiles.

; Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights: Information on intellectual property in the WTO, news and official records of the activities of the TRIPS Council, and details of the WTO&#x27;s work with other international organizations in the field.

; Council for Trade in Services: The Council for Trade in Services operates under the guidance of the General Council and is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). It is open to all WTO members and can create subsidiary bodies as required.

;Trade Negotiations Committee: The Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) is the committee that deals with the current trade talks round. The chair is WTO&#x27;s director-general. the committee was tasked with the Doha Development Round.

The Service Council has three subsidiary bodies: financial services, domestic regulations, GATS rules, and specific commitments. The council has several different committees, working groups, and working parties. There are committees on the following: Trade and Environment; Trade and Development (Subcommittee on Least-Developed Countries); Regional Trade Agreements; Balance of Payments Restrictions; and Budget, Finance and Administration. There are working parties on the following: Accession. There are working groups on the following: Trade, debt and finance; and Trade and technology transfer.

As of 31 December 2022, the number of WTO staff on a regular budget is 340 women and 283 men.

==Decision-making==
The WTO describes itself as &quot;a rules-based, member-driven organization—all decisions are made by the member governments, and the rules are the outcome of negotiations among members&quot;. The WTO Agreement foresees votes where consensus cannot be reached, but the practice of consensus dominates the process of decision-making.

Richard Harold Steinberg (2002) argues that although the WTO&#x27;s consensus governance model provides law-based initial bargaining, trading rounds close through power-based bargaining favoring Europe and the U.S., and may not lead to Pareto improvement.

==Dispute settlement==

The WTO&#x27;s dispute-settlement system &quot;is the result of the evolution of rules, procedures and practices developed over almost half a century under the GATT 1947&quot;. In 1994, the WTO members agreed on the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) annexed to the &quot;Final Act&quot; signed in Marrakesh in 1994. Dispute settlement is regarded by the WTO as the central pillar of the multilateral trading system, and as a &quot;unique contribution to the stability of the global economy&quot;. WTO members have agreed that, if they believe fellow-members are violating trade rules, they will use the multilateral system of settling disputes instead of taking action unilaterally.

The operation of the WTO dispute settlement process involves case-specific panels appointed by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), the Appellate Body, the Director-General and the WTO Secretariat, arbitrators, and advisory experts.

The priority is to settle disputes, preferably through a mutually agreed solution, and provision has been made for the process to be conducted in an efficient and timely manner so that &quot;If a case is adjudicated, it should normally take no more than one year for a panel ruling and no more than 16 months if the case is appealed... If the complainant deems the case urgent, consideration of the case should take even less time. WTO member nations are obliged to accept the process as exclusive and compulsory.

According to a 2018 study in the &quot;Journal of Politics&quot;, states are less likely and slower to enforce WTO violations when the violations affect states in a diffuse manner. This is because states face collective action problems with pursuing litigation: they all expect other states to carry the costs of litigation. A 2016 study in &quot;International Studies Quarterly&quot; challenges that the WTO dispute settlement system leads to greater increases in trade.

However, the dispute settlement system cannot be used to resolve trade disputes that arise from political disagreements. When Qatar requested the establishment of a dispute panel concerning measures imposed by the UAE, other GCC countries and the US were quick to dismiss its request as a political matter, stating that national security issues were political and not appropriate for the WTO dispute system.

Since 2019, when the Donald Trump administration blocked appointments to the body, the Appellate Body has been unable to enforce WTO rules and punish violators of WTO rules. In March 2020, the European Union and 15 other WTO members agreed to a &quot;Multiparty Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement&quot; (MPIA). This gave access to an alternative appellate mechanism (arbitration as an appellate mechanism) while the Appellate Body is not functional.

==Accession and membership==
The process of becoming a WTO member is unique to each applicant country, and the terms of accession are dependent upon the country&#x27;s stage of economic development and the current trade regime. The process takes about five years, on average, but it can last longer if the country is less than fully committed to the process or if political issues interfere. The shortest accession negotiation was that of the Kyrgyz Republic, while the longest was that of Russia, which, having first applied to join GATT in 1993, was approved for membership in December 2011 and became a WTO member on 22 August 2012. Kazakhstan also had a long accession negotiation process. The Working Party on the Accession of Kazakhstan was established in 1996 and was approved for membership in 2015. The second longest was that of Vanuatu, whose Working Party on the Accession of Vanuatu was established on 11 July 1995. After a final meeting of the Working Party in October 2001, Vanuatu requested more time to consider its accession terms. In 2008, it indicated its interest to resume and conclude its WTO accession. The Working Party on the Accession of Vanuatu was reconvened informally on 4 April 2011 to discuss Vanuatu&#x27;s future WTO membership. The re-convened Working Party completed its mandate on 2 May 2011. The General Council formally approved the Accession Package of Vanuatu on 26 October 2011. On 24 August 2012, the WTO welcomed Vanuatu as its 157th member. An offer of accession is only given once consensus is reached among interested parties.

A 2017 study argues that &quot;political ties rather than issue-area functional gains determine who joins&quot; and shows &quot;how geopolitical alignment shapes the demand and supply sides of membership&quot;. The &quot;findings challenge the view that states first liberalize trade to join the GATT/WTO. Instead, democracy and foreign policy similarity encourage states to join.&quot;

===Accession process===
A country wishing to accede to the WTO submits an application to the General Council, and has to describe all aspects of its trade and economic policies that have a bearing on WTO agreements. The application is submitted to the WTO in a memorandum which is examined by a working party open to all interested WTO Members.

After all necessary background information has been acquired, the working party focuses on issues of discrepancy between the WTO rules and the applicant&#x27;s international and domestic trade policies and laws. The working party determines the terms and conditions of entry into the WTO for the applicant nation and may consider transitional periods to allow countries some leeway in complying with the WTO rules.

The final phase of accession involves bilateral negotiations between the applicant nation and other working party members regarding the concessions and commitments on tariff levels and market access for goods and services. The new member&#x27;s commitments are to apply equally to all WTO members under normal non-discrimination rules, even though they are negotiated bilaterally. For instance, as a result of joining the WTO, Armenia offered a 15 per cent ceiling bound tariff rate on accessing its market for goods. Together with the tariff bindings being ad valorem there are no specific or compound rates. Moreover, there are no tariff-rate quotas on both industrial and agricultural products. Armenia&#x27;s economic and trade performance growth was noted since its first review in 2010, especially its revival from the 2008 global financial crisis, with an average annual 4% GDP growth rate, despite some fluctuations. Armenia&#x27;s economy was marked by low inflation, diminishing poverty, and essential progress in enhancing its macroeconomic steadiness in which trade in goods and services, which is the equivalent of 87% of GDP, played a growing role.

When the bilateral talks conclude, the working party sends to the general council or ministerial conference an accession package, which includes a summary of all the working party meetings, the Protocol of Accession (a draft membership treaty), and lists (&quot;schedules&quot;) of the member to be commitments. Once the general council or ministerial conference approves of the terms of accession, the applicant&#x27;s parliament must ratify the Protocol of Accession before it can become a member. Some countries may have faced tougher and a much longer accession process due to challenges during negotiations with other WTO members, such as Vietnam, whose negotiations took more than 11 years before it became an official member in January 2007.

===Members and observers===

The WTO has 166 members and 23 observer governments. Most recently, on 26 February 2024 at the 13th Ministerial Conference in Abu Dhabi, Comoros and Timor Leste were approved to became the 165th and 166th members. In addition to states, the European Union, and each EU country in its own right, is a member. WTO members do not have to be fully independent states; they need only be a customs territory with full autonomy in the conduct of their external commercial relations. Thus Hong Kong has been a member since 1995 (as &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot; since 1997) predating the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which joined in 2001 after 15 years of negotiations. Taiwan acceded to the WTO in 2002 as the &quot;Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.&quot; The WTO Secretariat omits the official titles (such as Counsellor, First Secretary, Second Secretary and Third Secretary) of the members of Taiwan&#x27;s Permanent Mission to the WTO, except for the titles of the Permanent Representative and the Deputy Permanent Representative.

As of 2007, WTO members represented 96.4% of global trade and 96.7% of global GDP. Iran, followed by Algeria, are the economies with the largest GDP and trade outside the WTO, using 2005 data. With the exception of the Holy See, observers must start accession negotiations within five years of becoming observers. A number of international intergovernmental organizations have also been granted observer status to WTO bodies. Ten UN members have no affiliation with the WTO.

==Agreements==
The WTO oversees about 60 different agreements which have the status of international legal texts. Member countries must sign and ratify all WTO agreements on accession. A discussion of some of the most important agreements follows.

The Agreement on Agriculture came into effect with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. The AoA has three central concepts, or &quot;pillars&quot;: domestic support, market access and export subsidies.

The General Agreement on Trade in Services was created to extend the multilateral trading system to service sector, in the same way as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provided such a system for merchandise trade. The agreement entered into force in January 1995.

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation. It was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994.

The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures—also known as the SPS Agreement—was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of GATT, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on members&#x27; policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection, and labeling) as well as animal and plant health (imported pests and diseases).

The Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade is an international treaty of the World Trade Organization. It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the end of 1994. The object ensures that technical negotiations and standards, as well as testing and certification procedures, do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade&quot;.

The Agreement on Customs Valuation, formally known as the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of GATT, prescribes methods of customs valuation that Members are to follow. Chiefly, it adopts the &quot;transaction value&quot; approach.

In December 2013, the biggest agreement within the WTO was signed and known as the Bali Package.

==Office of director-general==
The procedures for the appointment of the WTO director-general were updated in January 2003, and include quadrennial terms. Additionally, there are four deputy directors-general. under director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the four deputy directors-general are:
* Angela Ellard of the United States (as of 4 May 2021)
* Anabel González of Costa Rica (as of 4 May 2021)
* Ambassador Jean-Marie Paugam of France (as of 4 May 2021)
* Ambassador Xiangchen Zhang of China (as of 4 May 2021)

===List of directors-general===
Source: Official website

===2020 Director-General selection===

In May 2020, Director-General Roberto Azevedo announced that he would step down on 31 August 2020. , a nomination and selection process is currently under way with eight candidates and the final selection is expected on 7 November 2020 with the consensus of 164 member countries. A strong consensus had formed around the candidacy of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala but on 28 October it emerged that the US representative was opposed to her appointment.

WTO members made history on 15 February 2021 when the General Council agreed by consensus to select Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria as the organization&#x27;s seventh Director-General.

Okonjo-Iweala became the first woman and the first African to be chosen as Director-General. Her term, renewable, will expire on 31 August 2025.

==Budget==
The WTO derives most of the income for its annual budget from contributions by its Members. These are established according to a formula based on their share of international trade.

== Criticism ==
Although tariffs and other trade barriers have been significantly reduced thanks to GATT and WTO, the promise that free trade will accelerate economic growth, reduce poverty, and increase people&#x27;s incomes has been questioned by many critics. 

Economist Ha-Joon Chang argues that there is a &quot;paradox&quot; in neo-liberal beliefs regarding free trade because the economic growth of developing countries was higher in the 1960–1980 period compared to the 1980–2000 period even though its trade policies are now far more liberal than before. Also, there are results of research that show that new countries actively reduce trade barriers only after becoming significantly rich. From the results of the study, WTO critics argue that trade liberalization does not guarantee economic growth and certainly not poverty alleviation. He also cites the example of El Salvador; in the early 1990s, El Salvador removed all quantitative barriers to imports and also cut tariffs. However, the country&#x27;s economic growth remained weak. On the other hand, Vietnam, which only began reforming its economy in the late 1980s, saw a great deal of success by deciding to follow China&#x27;s economic model and liberalizing slowly along with implementing safeguards for domestic commerce. Vietnam has largely succeeded in accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty without immediately removing substantial trade barriers.

Critics also put forward the view that the benefits derived from WTO facilitated free trade are not shared equally. This criticism is usually supported by historical accounts of the outcomes of negotiations and/or data showing that the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, especially in China and India, where economic inequality was growing at the time even though economic growth is very high. In addition, WTO approaches aiming to reduce trade barriers can harm developing countries. Trade liberalization that is too early without any prominent domestic barriers is feared to trap the developing economies in the primary sector, which often does not require skilled labor. And when these developing countries decide to advance their economy utilizing industrialization, the premature domestic industry cannot immediately skyrocket as expected, making it difficult to compete with other countries whose industries are more advanced.

==Impact==
Studies show that the WTO boosted trade. Research shows that in the absence of the WTO, the average country would face an increase in tariffs on their exports by 32 percentage points. The dispute settlement mechanism in the WTO is one way in which trade is increased.

According to a 2017 study in the &quot;Journal of International Economic Law&quot;, &quot;nearly all recent preferential trade agreements (PTAs) reference the WTO explicitly, often dozens of times across multiple chapters. Likewise, in many of these same PTAs we find that substantial portions of treaty language—sometime the majority of a chapter—is copied verbatim from a WTO agreement... the presence of the WTO in PTAs has increased over time.&quot;

<text>Wenceslaus I ( ; 907 – 28 September 935), Wenceslas I or &quot;Václav the Good&quot; was the Prince (&quot;kníže&quot;) of Bohemia from 921 until his death, probably in 935. According to the legend, he was assassinated by his younger brother, Boleslaus the Cruel.

His martyrdom and the popularity of several biographies gave rise to a reputation for heroic virtue that resulted in his sainthood. He was posthumously declared to be a king and patron saint of the Czech state. He is the subject of the well-known &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, a carol for Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day.

==Biography==
Wenceslaus was the son of Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia from the Přemyslid dynasty. His grandfather, Bořivoj I of Bohemia, and grandmother, Ludmila, had been converted by Cyril and Methodius to Byzantine Christianity in a still unified Christendom, before the Great Schism. His mother, Drahomíra, was the daughter of a chief of the Havelli, but was baptized at the time of her marriage. His paternal grandmother, Ludmila of Bohemia, saw to it that he was educated in the Old Church Slavonic liturgical language and, at an early age, Wenceslaus was sent to the college at Budeč.

In 921, when Wenceslaus was about 13, his father died and his grandmother became regent. Jealous of the influence Ludmila wielded over Wenceslaus, Drahomíra arranged to have her killed. Ludmila was at Tetín Castle near Beroun when assassins murdered her on 15 September 921. She is said to have been strangled by them with her veil. She was at first buried in the church of St. Michael at Tetín, but her remains were later removed, probably by Wenceslaus, to the church of St. George in Prague, which had been built by his father.

Drahomíra then assumed the role of regent and immediately initiated measures against Christians. When Wenceslaus was 18, those Christian nobles who remained rebelled against Drahomira. The uprising was successful, and Drahomira was sent into exile to Budeč.

===Reign===

With the support of the nobles, Wenceslaus took control of the government. He &quot;reined in the dependent dukes who had become restive under the regency and used Christianity to strengthen his state.&quot;

After the fall of Great Moravia, the rulers of the Bohemian Duchy had to deal both with continuous raids by the Magyars and the forces of the Saxon and East Frankish king Henry the Fowler, who had started several eastern campaigns into the adjacent lands of the Polabian Slavs, homeland of Wenceslaus&#x27;s mother. To withstand Saxon overlordship, Wenceslaus&#x27;s father Vratislaus had forged an alliance with the Bavarian duke Arnulf, a fierce opponent of King Henry at that time. The alliance became worthless, however, when Arnulf and Henry reconciled at Regensburg in 921.

Early in 929, the joint forces of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria and King Henry I the Fowler reached Prague in a sudden attack that forced Wenceslaus to resume the payment of a tribute first imposed by the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia in 895. Henry had been forced to pay a huge tribute to the Magyars in 926 and needed the Bohemian tribute, which Wenceslaus probably refused to pay after the reconciliation between Arnulf and Henry. Another possible reason for the attack was the formation of the anti-Saxon alliance between Bohemia, the Polabian Slavs, and the Magyars.

Wenceslaus introduced German priests into his realm and favoured the Latin rite instead of the old Slavic, which had gone into disuse in many places for want of priests. He also founded a rotunda consecrated to St. Vitus at Prague Castle in Prague that was the basis of present-day St. Vitus Cathedral.

===Assassination===
In September 935, a group of nobles allied with Wenceslaus&#x27;s younger brother Boleslav plotted to kill him. After Boleslav invited Wenceslaus to a celebration of the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian in Stará Boleslav, three of Boleslav&#x27;s companions (Tira, Česta, and Hněvsa) fell on the duke and stabbed him to death. As the duke fell, Boleslav ran him through with a lance.

According to Cosmas of Prague, in his &quot;Chronica Boëmorum&quot; of the early 12th century, one of Boleslav&#x27;s sons was born on the day of Wenceslaus&#x27;s death. Because of the ominous circumstance of his birth, the infant was named Strachkvas, which means &quot;a dreadful feast&quot;.

There is also a tradition that Wenceslaus&#x27;s loyal servant Podevin avenged his death by killing one of the chief conspirators, an act for which he was executed by Boleslav.

The assassination of Wenceslaus has been characterized as an important turning point in early Bohemian history, as the rule of Boleslav I saw him renounce the Franks, centralize power in Bohemia and expand the territory of the polity.

==Veneration==

Wenceslaus was considered a martyr and saint immediately after his death, when a cult of Wenceslaus grew up in Bohemia and in England. Within a few decades, four biographies of him were in circulation. These hagiographies had a powerful influence on the High Middle Ages concept of the &quot;rex justus&quot; (righteous king), a monarch whose power stems mainly from his great piety as well as his princely vigor.

Referring approvingly to these hagiographies, the chronicler Cosmas of Prague, writing in about the year 1119, states:

Several centuries later this legend was asserted as fact by Pope Pius II.

Although Wenceslaus was only a duke during his lifetime, Holy Roman Emperor Otto I posthumously &quot;conferred on [Wenceslaus] the regal dignity and title&quot;, which is why he is referred to as &quot;king&quot; in legend and song.

The hymn &quot;Svatý Václave&quot; (Saint Wenceslaus) or &quot;Saint Wenceslas Chorale&quot; is one of the oldest known Czech songs. Traceable to the 12th century AD, it is still among the most popular religious songs in the Bohemian lands. In 1918, at the founding of the modern Czechoslovak state, the song was discussed as a possible choice for the national anthem. During the Nazi occupation, it was often played along with the Czech anthem.

Wenceslaus&#x27;s feast day is celebrated on September 28. On this day, celebrations and a pilgrimage are held in the city of Stará Boleslav, whereas the translation of his relics, which took place in 938, is commemorated on 4 March. Since 2000, the September 28 feast day has been a public holiday in the Czech Republic, celebrated as Czech Statehood Day.

===In legend===
Legends of Wenceslaus began to appear around the second half of the 10th century, several decades after his death, and spread throughout both Bohemia and abroad, including Italy, Germany, and even Russia. Such legends include the first Old Slavic legend from the 10th century, the Latin legend Crescente fide, Gumpold&#x27;s legend, and Christian&#x27;s legend.

According to legend, one Count Radislas rose in rebellion and marched against King Wenceslaus. The latter sent a deputation with offers of peace, but Radislas viewed this as a sign of cowardice. The two armies were drawn up opposite each other in battle array, when Wenceslaus, to avoid shedding innocent blood, challenged Radislas to single combat. As Radislas advanced toward the king, he saw by Wenceslaus&#x27;s side two angels, who cried: &quot;Stand off!&quot; Thunderstruck, Radislas repented his rebellion, threw himself from his horse at Wenceslaus&#x27;s feet, and asked for pardon. Wenceslaus raised him and kindly received him again into favour.

A second enduring legend claims an army of knights sleeps under Blaník, a mountain in the Czech Republic. They will awake and, under the command of Wenceslaus, bring aid to the Czech people in their ultimate danger. There is a similar legend in Prague which says that when the Motherland is in danger or in its darkest times and close to ruin, the equestrian statue of King Wenceslaus in Wenceslaus Square will come to life, raise the army sleeping in Blaník, and upon crossing the Charles Bridge his horse will stumble and trip over a stone, revealing the legendary sword of Bruncvík. With this sword, King Wenceslaus will slay all the enemies of the Czechs, bringing peace and prosperity to the land.

==Legacy==

Wenceslaus is the subject of the popular Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day (celebrated on December 26 in the West) carol &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;. It was published by John Mason Neale in 1853, and may be a translation of a poem by Czech poet Václav Alois Svoboda.
A supposed American spelling of the duke&#x27;s name, &quot;Wenceslaus,&quot; is occasionally encountered in later textual variants of the carol, although it was not used by Neale in his version, and in the U.S. the name usually is spelled Wenceslas, as in the carol. Wenceslaus is not to be confused with King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia (Wenceslaus I Premyslid), who lived more than three centuries later.

At the beginning of the Hussite Wars Wenceslaus’s name was often invoked, and it was only later that he was overshadowed by Hussite warrior Jan Žižka. Later, even when the Hussites and Protestants gained the upper hand in Bohemia and the cult of Wenceslaus faded, he still remained a venerated figure throughout Bohemia, with Jan Hus himself often referencing Wenceslaus in his sermons. During the reign of Charles IV, Wenceslaus’s image as a saint and martyr was often employed by Charles in his enterprises both at home and abroad, and in later years when the systematic Germanization of Bohemia began, Wenceslaus came to be considered a representation of the Czech national consciousness.

An equestrian statue of Saint Wenceslaus and other patrons of Bohemia (St. Adalbert, St. Ludmila, St. Prokop and St. Agnes of Bohemia) are located on Wenceslaus Square in Prague. The statue is a popular meeting place in Prague. Demonstrations against the Communist regime were held there.

His helmet and armour are on display inside Prague Castle.

===In popular culture===
The lavish 1930 silent film &quot;St. Wenceslas&quot; was at the time the most expensive Czech film ever made.

Ogden Nash wrote a comic epic poem, &quot;The Christmas that Almost Wasn&#x27;t&quot; (1957), in which a boy awakens Wenceslaus and his knights to save the kingdom of Lullapat from usurpers who have outlawed Christmas, with elements from the legend of Wenceslas.

The 1994 television film, &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, is a highly fictional account of his early life. The film stars Jonathan Brandis in the title role, supported by Leo McKern, Stefanie Powers, and Joan Fontaine as Ludmila.

<text>Windows XP is a major release of Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT operating system. It was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and later to retail on October 25, 2001. It is a direct successor to Windows 2000 for high-end and business users and Windows Me for home users.

Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s under the codename &quot;Neptune&quot;, built on the Windows NT kernel and explicitly intended for mainstream consumer use. An updated version of Windows 2000 was also initially planned for the business market. However, in January 2000, both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed &quot;Whistler&quot;, which would serve as a single platform for both consumer and business markets. As a result, Windows XP is the first consumer edition of Windows not based on the Windows 95 kernel or MS-DOS. Windows XP removed support for PC-98, i486, and SGI Visual Workstation 320 and 540, and will only run on 32-bit x86 CPUs and devices that use BIOS firmware.

Upon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, noting increased performance and stability (especially compared to Windows Me), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and expanded multimedia capabilities. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were succeeded by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, released in 2007 and 2008, respectively. 

Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009, and extended support ended on April 8, 2014. Windows Embedded POSReady 2009, based on Windows XP Professional, received security updates until April 2019. The final security update for Service Pack 3 was released on May 14, 2019. Unofficial methods were made available to apply the updates to other editions of Windows XP. Microsoft has discouraged this practice, citing compatibility issues.

, globally, under 0.6% of Windows PCs and 0.1% of all devices across all platforms continued to run Windows XP.

==Development==
In the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP was focused on two individual products: &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which was reportedly intended to succeed the future Windows 2000 and &quot;Neptune&quot;, which was reportedly a consumer-oriented operating system using the Windows NT architecture, succeeding the MS-DOS-based Windows 98.

However, the projects proved to be too ambitious. In January 2000, shortly prior to the official release of Windows 2000, technology writer Paul Thurrott reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune and Odyssey in favor of a new product codenamed &quot;Whistler&quot;, named after Whistler, British Columbia, as many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort. The goal of Whistler was to unify both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single, Windows NT platform. Thurrott stated that Neptune had become &quot;a black hole when all the features that were cut from Windows Me were simply re-tagged as Neptune features. And since Neptune and Odyssey would be based on the same code-base anyway, it made sense to combine them into a single project&quot;.

At PDC on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be released during the second half of 2001, and also unveiled the first preview build, 2250, which featured an early implementation of Windows XP&#x27;s visual styles system and interface changes to Windows Explorer and the Control Panel.

Microsoft released the first public beta build of Whistler, build 2296, on October 31, 2000. Subsequent builds gradually introduced features that users of the release version of Windows XP would recognize, such as Internet Explorer 6.0, the Microsoft Product Activation system, and the &quot;Bliss&quot; desktop background.

Whistler was officially unveiled during a media event on February 5, 2001, under the name Windows XP, where XP stands for &quot;eXPerience&quot;.

===Release===
In June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it was planning to spend at least US$1 billion on marketing and promoting Windows XP, in conjunction with Intel and other PC makers. The theme of the campaign, &quot;Yes You Can&quot;, was designed to emphasize the platform&#x27;s overall capabilities. Microsoft had originally planned to use the slogan &quot;Prepare to Fly&quot;, but it was replaced because of sensitivity issues in the wake of the September 11 attacks.

On August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was released to manufacturing (RTM). During a ceremonial media event at Microsoft Redmond Campus, copies of the RTM build were given to representatives of several major PC manufacturers in briefcases, who then flew off on decorated helicopters. While PC manufacturers would be able to release devices running XP beginning on September 24, 2001, XP was expected to reach general retail availability on October 25, 2001. On the same day, Microsoft also announced the final retail pricing of XP&#x27;s two main editions, &quot;Home&quot; (as a replacement for Windows Me for home computing) and &quot;Professional&quot; (as a replacement for Windows 2000 for high-end users).

==New and updated features==
===User interface===
While retaining some similarities to previous versions, Windows XP&#x27;s interface was overhauled with a new visual appearance, with an increased use of alpha compositing effects, drop shadows, and &quot;visual styles&quot;, which completely changed the appearance of the operating system. The number of effects enabled are determined by the operating system based on the computer&#x27;s processing power, and can be enabled or disabled on a case-by-case basis. XP also added ClearType, a new subpixel rendering system designed to improve the appearance of fonts on liquid-crystal displays. A new set of system icons was also introduced. The default wallpaper, &quot;Bliss&quot;, is a photo of a landscape in the Napa Valley outside Napa, California, with rolling green hills and a blue sky with stratocumulus and cirrus clouds.

The Start menu received its first major overhaul in XP, switching to a two-column layout with the ability to list, pin, and display frequently used applications, recently opened documents, and the traditional cascading &quot;All Programs&quot; menu. The taskbar can now group windows opened by a single application into one taskbar button, with a popup menu listing the individual windows. The notification area also hides &quot;inactive&quot; icons by default. A &quot;common tasks&quot; list was added, and Windows Explorer&#x27;s sidebar was updated to use a new task-based design with lists of common actions; the tasks displayed are contextually relevant to the type of content in a folder (e.g. a folder with music displays offers to play all the files in the folder, or burn them to a CD).

Fast user switching allows additional users to log into a Windows XP machine without existing users having to close their programs and log out. Although only one user at the time can use the console (i.e., monitor, keyboard, and mouse), previous users can resume their session once they regain control of the console. Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3 also introduced new features to Windows XP post-release, including the Windows Security Center, Bluetooth support, Data Execution Prevention, Windows Firewall, and support for SDHC cards that are larger than 4 GB and smaller than 32 GB.

===Infrastructure===
Windows XP uses prefetching to improve startup and application launch times. It also became possible to revert the installation of an updated device driver, should the updated driver produce undesirable results.

A copy protection system known as Windows Product Activation was introduced with Windows XP and its server counterpart, Windows Server 2003. All non-enterprise (Volume Licensing) Windows licenses must be tied to a unique ID generated using information from the computer hardware, transmitted either via the internet or a telephone hotline. If Windows is not activated within 30 days of installation, the OS will cease to function until it is activated. Windows also periodically verifies the hardware to check for changes. If significant hardware changes are detected, the activation is voided, and Windows must be re-activated.

===Networking and internet functionality===
Windows XP was originally bundled with Internet Explorer 6, Outlook Express 6, Windows Messenger, and MSN Explorer. New networking features were also added, including Internet Connection Firewall, Internet Connection Sharing integration with UPnP, NAT traversal APIs, Quality of Service features, IPv6 and Teredo tunneling, Background Intelligent Transfer Service, extended fax features, network bridging, peer to peer networking, support for most DSL modems, IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) connections with auto configuration and roaming, TAPI 3.1, and networking over FireWire. Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop were also added, which allow users to connect to a computer running Windows XP from across a network or the Internet and access their applications, files, printers, and devices or request help. Improvements were also made to &quot;IntelliMirror&quot; features such as Offline Files, roaming user profiles, and folder redirection.

===Backward compatibility===
To enable running software that targets or locks out specific versions of Windows, &quot;Compatibility mode&quot; was added. It allows pretending a selected earlier version of Windows to software, starting at Windows 95. This feature was first introduced in Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, released five months before the release of Windows XP, and was backported from prerelease Windows XP builds. Unlike with Windows XP, however, it was hidden from the operating system as it was not enabled by default and had to be manually activated through the Register Server utility. It was also only available to administrator users. Windows XP has this feature activated out of the box and also grants it to regular users.

===Other features===
* Improved application compatibility and shims compared to Windows 2000.
* DirectX 8.1, upgradeable to DirectX 9.0c.
* A number of new features in Windows Explorer including task panes, thumbnails, and the option to view photos as a slideshow.
* Improved imaging features such as &quot;Windows Picture and Fax Viewer&quot;.
* Faster start-up, (because of improved Prefetch functions) logon, logoff, hibernation, and application launch sequences.
* Numerous improvements to increase the system reliability such as improved System Restore, Automated System Recovery, and driver reliability improvements through Device Driver Rollback.
* Hardware support improvements such as FireWire 800, and improvements to multi-monitor support under the name &quot;DualView&quot;.
* Fast user switching.
* The ClearType font rendering mechanism, which is designed to improve text readability on liquid-crystal display (LCD) and similar monitors, especially laptops.
* Side-by-side assemblies and registration-free COM.
* General improvements to international support such as more locales, languages and scripts, MUI support in Terminal Services, improved Input Method Editors, and National Language Support.

==Removed features==
Some of the programs and features that were part of the previous versions of Windows did not make it to Windows XP. Various MS-DOS commands available in its Windows 9x predecessor were removed, as were the POSIX and OS/2 subsystems.

In networking, NetBEUI, NWLink and NetDDE were deprecated and not installed by default. Plug-and-play–incompatible communication devices (like modems and network interface cards) were no longer supported.

Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3 also removed features from Windows XP, including support for TCP half-open connections and the address bar on the taskbar.

==Editions==


Windows XP was released in two major editions on launch: &quot;Home Edition&quot; and &quot;Professional Edition&quot;. Both editions were made available at retail as pre-loaded software on new computers and as boxed copies. Boxed copies were sold as &quot;Upgrade&quot; or &quot;Full&quot; licenses; the &quot;Upgrade&quot; versions were slightly cheaper, but require an existing version of Windows to install. The &quot;Full&quot; version can be installed on systems without an operating system or existing version of Windows. The two editions of XP were aimed at different markets: &quot;Home Edition&quot; is explicitly intended for consumer use and disables or removes certain advanced and enterprise-oriented features present on &quot;Professional&quot;, such as the ability to join a Windows domain, Internet Information Services, and Multilingual User Interface. Windows 98 or Me can be upgraded to either edition, but Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 can only be upgraded to &quot;Professional&quot;. Windows&#x27; software license agreement for pre-loaded licenses allows the software to be &quot;returned&quot; to the OEM for a refund if the user does not wish to use it. Despite the refusal of some manufacturers to honor the entitlement, it has been enforced by courts in some countries.

Two specialized variants of XP were introduced in 2002 for certain types of hardware, exclusively through OEM channels as pre-loaded software. &quot;Windows XP Media Center Edition&quot; was initially designed for high-end home theater PCs with TV tuners (marketed under the term &quot;Media Center PC&quot;), offering expanded multimedia functionality, an electronic program guide, and digital video recorder (DVR) support through the Windows Media Center application. Microsoft also unveiled &quot;Windows XP Tablet PC Edition&quot;, which contains additional pen input features, and is optimized for mobile devices meeting its Tablet PC specifications. Two different 64-bit editions of XP were made available. The first, &quot;Windows XP 64-Bit Edition&quot;, was intended for IA-64 (Itanium) systems; as IA-64 usage declined on workstations in favor of AMD&#x27;s x86-64 architecture, the Itanium edition was discontinued in January 2005. A new 64-bit edition supporting the x86-64 architecture, called &quot;Windows XP Professional x64 Edition&quot;, was released in April 2005.

Microsoft also targeted emerging markets with the 2004 introduction of &quot;Windows XP Starter Edition&quot;, a special variant of &quot;Home Edition&quot; intended for low-cost PCs. The OS is primarily aimed at first-time computer owners, containing heavy localization (including wallpapers and screen savers incorporating images of local landmarks), and a &quot;My Support&quot; area which contains video tutorials on basic computing tasks. It also removes certain &quot;complex&quot; features, and does not allow users to run more than three applications at a time. After a pilot program in India and Thailand, &quot;Starter&quot; was released in other emerging markets throughout 2005. In 2006, Microsoft also unveiled the FlexGo initiative, which would also target emerging markets with subsidized PCs on a pre-paid, subscription basis.

As a result of unfair competition lawsuits in Europe and South Korea, which both alleged that Microsoft had improperly leveraged its status in the PC market to favor its own bundled software, Microsoft was ordered to release special editions of XP in these markets that excluded certain applications. In March 2004, after the European Commission fined Microsoft €497 million (US$603 million), Microsoft was ordered to release &quot;N&quot; editions of XP that excluded Windows Media Player, encouraging users to pick and download their own media player software. As it was sold at the same price as the edition with Windows Media Player included, certain OEMs (such as Dell, who offered it for a short period, along with Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Fujitsu Siemens) chose not to offer it. Consumer interest was minuscule, with roughly 1,500 units shipped to OEMs, and no reported sales to consumers. In December 2005, the Korean Fair Trade Commission ordered Microsoft to make available editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 that do not contain Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger. The &quot;K&quot; and &quot;KN&quot; editions of Windows XP were released in August 2006, and are only available in English and Korean, and also contain links to third-party instant messenger and media player software.

==Service packs==
A service pack is a cumulative update package that is a superset of all updates, and even service packs, that have been released before it. Three service packs have been released for Windows XP. Service Pack 3 is slightly different, in that it needs at least Service Pack 1 to have been installed, in order to update a live OS. However, Service Pack 3 can still be embedded into a Windows installation disc; SP1 is not reported as a prerequisite for doing so.

The boot screens for all editions of Windows XP have been unified by Service Pack 2 for Windows XP with a new one that no longer displays the SKU, with the boot screen for Home Edition using a blue progress bar instead of green. The copyright years on the boot screen were also removed.

===Service Pack 1===
Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on September 9, 2002. It contained over 300 minor, post-RTM bug fixes, along with all security patches released since the original release of XP. SP1 also added USB 2.0 support, the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine, .NET Framework support, and support for technologies used by the then-upcoming &quot;Media Center&quot; and &quot;Tablet PC&quot; editions of XP. The most significant change on SP1 was the addition of &quot;Set Program Access and Defaults&quot;, a settings page which allows programs to be set as default for certain types of activities (such as media players or web browsers) and for access to bundled, Microsoft programs (such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player) to be disabled. This feature was added to comply with the settlement of &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corp.&quot;, which required Microsoft to offer the ability for OEMs to bundle third-party competitors to software it bundles with Windows (such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player), and give them the same level of prominence as those normally bundled with the OS.

On February 3, 2003, Microsoft released Service Pack 1a (SP1a). It was the same as SP1, except the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine was excluded.

===Service Pack 2===
Service Pack 2 (SP2) for Windows XP Home edition and Professional edition was released on August 25, 2004. Headline features included WPA encryption compatibility for Wi-Fi and usability improvements to the Wi-Fi networking user interface, partial Bluetooth support, and various improvements to security systems.

Headed by former computer hacker Window Snyder, the service pack&#x27;s security improvements (codenamed &quot;Springboard&quot;, as these features were intended to underpin additional changes in Longhorn) included a major revision to the included firewall (renamed Windows Firewall, and now enabled by default), and an update to Data Execution Prevention, which gained hardware support in the NX bit that can stop some forms of buffer overflow attacks. Raw socket support is removed (which supposedly limits the damage done by zombie machines) and the Windows Messenger service (which had been abused to cause pop-up advertisements to be displayed as system messages without a web browser or any additional software) became disabled by default. Additionally, security-related improvements were made to e-mail and web browsing. Service Pack 2 also added Security Center, an interface that provides a general overview of the system&#x27;s security status, including the state of the firewall and automatic updates. Third-party firewall and antivirus software can also be monitored from Security Center.

In August 2006, Microsoft released updated installation media for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 SP2 (SP2b), in order to incorporate a patch requiring ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer to be manually activated before a user may interact with them. This was done so that the browser would not violate a patent owned by Eolas. Microsoft has since licensed the patent, and released a patch reverting the change in April 2008. In September 2007, another minor revision known as SP2c was released for XP Professional, extending the number of available product keys for the operating system to &quot;support the continued availability of Windows XP Professional through the scheduled system builder channel end-of-life (EOL) date of January 31, 2009.&quot;

Windows XP Service Pack 2 was later included in Windows Embedded for Point of Service and Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs.

===Service Pack 3===
The third and final Service Pack, SP3, was released through different channels between April 21 and June 10, 2008, about a year after the release of Windows Vista, and about a year before the release of Windows 7. Service Pack 3 was not available for Windows XP x64 Edition, which was based on the Windows Server 2003 kernel and, as a result, used its service packs rather than the ones for the other editions.

It began being automatically pushed out to &quot;Automatic Updates&quot; users on July 10, 2008. A feature set overview which detailed new features available separately as stand-alone updates to Windows XP, as well as backported features from Windows Vista, was posted by Microsoft. A total of 1,174 fixes are included in SP3. Service Pack 3 could be installed on systems with Internet Explorer up to and including version 8; Internet Explorer 7 was not included as part of SP3. It also did not include Internet Explorer 8, but instead was included in Windows 7, which was released one year after XP SP3.

Service Pack 3 included security enhancements over and above those of SP2, including APIs allowing developers to enable Data Execution Prevention for their code, independent of system-wide compatibility enforcement settings, the Security Support Provider Interface, improvements to WPA2 security, and an updated version of the Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Module that is FIPS 140-2 certified.

In incorporating all previously released updates not included in SP2, Service Pack 3 included many other key features. Windows Imaging Component allowed camera vendors to integrate their own proprietary image codecs with the operating system&#x27;s features, such as thumbnails and slideshows. In enterprise features, Remote Desktop Protocol 6.1 included support for ClearType and 32-bit color depth over RDP, while improvements made to Windows Management Instrumentation in Windows Vista to reduce the possibility of corruption of the WMI repository were backported to XP SP3.

In addition, SP3 contains updates to the operating system components of Windows XP Media Center Edition (MCE) and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, and security updates for .NET Framework version 1.0, which is included in these editions. However, it does not include update rollups for the Windows Media Center application in Windows XP MCE 2005. SP3 also omits security updates for Windows Media Player 10, although the player is included in Windows XP MCE 2005. The Address Bar DeskBand on the Taskbar is no longer included because of antitrust violation concerns.

Unofficial SP3 ZIP download packages were released on a now-defunct website called The Hotfix from 2005 to 2007. The owner of the website, Ethan C. Allen, was a former Microsoft employee in Software Quality Assurance and would comb through the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles daily and download new hotfixes Microsoft would put online within the articles. The articles would have a &quot;kbwinxppresp3fix&quot; and/or &quot;kbwinxpsp3fix&quot; tag, thus allowing Allen to easily find and determine which fixes were planned for the official SP3 release to come. Microsoft publicly stated at the time that the SP3 pack was unofficial and advised users to not install it. Allen also released a Vista SP1 package in 2007, for which Allen received a cease-and-desist email from Microsoft.

Windows XP Service Pack 3 was later included in Windows Embedded Standard 2009 and Windows Embedded POSReady 2009.

==System requirements==
System requirements for Windows XP are as follows:

===Notes===
===Physical memory limits===
The maximum amount of RAM that Windows XP can support varies depending on the product edition and the processor architecture. All 32-bit editions of XP support up to 4 GB, except the Windows XP Starter edition, which supports up to 512 MB of RAM. The 64-bit editions support up to 128 GB.

===Processor limits===
Windows XP Professional supports up to two physical processors;
Windows XP Home Edition supports only one.

However, XP supports a greater number of logical processors:
32-bit editions support up to 32 logical processors, and 64-bit editions support up to 64 logical processors.

==Upgradeability==
Several Windows XP components are upgradable to the latest versions, which include new versions introduced in later versions of Windows, and other major Microsoft applications are available. These latest versions for Windows XP include:

* ActiveSync 4.5
* DirectX 9.0c (June 7, 2010, Redistributable)
* Internet Explorer 8
* Windows Media Format Runtime and Windows Media Player 11
* Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 SP1
* .NET Framework 4.0
* Visual Studio 2010
* Windows Script Host 5.7
* Windows Installer 4.5
* Microsoft NetMeeting 3.02
* Windows Sidebar
* Windows Defender
* Office 2010 SP2
* The Windows Services for UNIX subsystem can be installed to allow certain Unix-based applications to run on the operating system.

==Support lifecycle==
Support for the original release of Windows XP (without a service pack) ended on August 30, 2005. Both Windows XP Service Pack 1 and 1a were retired on October 10, 2006, and both Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP2 reached their end of support on July 13, 2010, about 24 months after the launch of Windows XP Service Pack 3. The company stopped general licensing of Windows XP to OEMs and terminated retail sales of the operating system on June 30, 2008, 17 months after the release of Windows Vista. However, an exception was announced on April 3, 2008, for OEMs producing what it defined as &quot;ultra low-cost personal computers&quot;, particularly netbooks, until one year after the availability of Windows 7 on October 22, 2009. Analysts felt that the move was primarily intended to compete against Linux-based netbooks, although Microsoft&#x27;s Kevin Hutz stated that the decision was due to apparent market demand for low-end computers with Windows.

Variants of Windows XP for embedded systems have different support policies: Windows XP Embedded SP3 and Windows Embedded for Point of Service SP3 were supported until January and April 2016, respectively. Windows Embedded Standard 2009, which was succeeded by Windows Embedded Standard 7, and Windows Embedded POSReady 2009, which was succeeded by Windows Embedded POSReady 7, were supported until January and April 2019, respectively. These updates, while intended for the embedded editions, could also be downloaded on standard Windows XP with a registry hack, which enabled unofficial patches until April 2019. However, Microsoft advised Windows XP users against installing these fixes, citing compatibility issues.

===End of support===
On April 14, 2009, the main Windows XP exited mainstream support and entered the extended support phase; Microsoft continued to provide security updates every month for Windows XP, however, free technical support, warranty claims, and design changes were no longer being offered. Extended support for the main version ended on April 8, 2014, over 12 years after the release of Windows XP; normally Microsoft products have a support life cycle of only 10 years. Beyond the final security updates released on April 8 for the main version, no more security patches or support information are provided for XP free-of-charge; &quot;critical patches&quot; will still be created, and made available only to customers subscribing to a paid &quot;Custom Support&quot; plan. As it is a Windows component, all versions of Internet Explorer for Windows XP also became unsupported.

In January 2014, it was estimated that more than 95% of the 3 million automated teller machines in the world were still running Windows XP (which largely replaced IBM&#x27;s OS/2 as the predominant operating system on ATMs); ATMs have an average lifecycle of between seven and ten years, but some have had lifecycles as long as 15. Plans were being made by several ATM vendors and their customers to migrate to Windows 7-based systems over the course of 2014, while vendors have also considered the possibility of using Linux-based platforms in the future to give them more flexibility for support lifecycles, and the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA) has since endorsed Windows 10 as a further replacement. However, ATMs typically run the embedded variant of Windows XP, which was supported through January 2016. As of May 2017, around 60% of the 220,000 ATMs in India still run Windows XP.

Furthermore, at least 49% of all computers in China still ran XP at the beginning of 2014. These holdouts were influenced by several factors; prices of genuine copies of later versions of Windows in the country are high, while Ni Guangnan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the United States government, and the Chinese government banned the purchase of Windows 8 products for government use in May 2014 in protest of Microsoft&#x27;s inability to provide &quot;guaranteed&quot; support. The government also had concerns that the impending end of support could affect their anti-piracy initiatives with Microsoft, as users would simply pirate newer versions rather than purchasing them legally. As such, government officials formally requested that Microsoft extend the support period for XP for these reasons. While Microsoft did not comply with their requests, a number of major Chinese software developers, such as Lenovo, Kingsoft and Tencent, will provide free support and resources for Chinese users migrating from XP. Several governments, in particular those of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, elected to negotiate &quot;Custom Support&quot; plans with Microsoft for their continued, internal use of Windows XP; the British government&#x27;s deal lasted for a year, and also covered support for Office 2003 (which reached end-of-life the same day) and cost £5.5 million.

On March 8, 2014, Microsoft deployed an update for XP that, on the 8th of each month, displays a pop-up notification to remind users about the end of support; however, these notifications may be disabled by the user. Microsoft also partnered with Laplink to provide a special &quot;express&quot; version of its PCmover software to help users migrate files and settings from XP to a computer with a newer version of Windows.

Despite the approaching end of support of the main version, there were still notable holdouts that had not migrated past XP; many users elected to remain on XP because of the poor reception of Windows Vista, sales of newer PCs with newer versions of Windows declined because of the Great Recession and the effects of Vista, and deployments of new versions of Windows in enterprise environments require a large amount of planning, which includes testing applications for compatibility (especially those that are dependent on Internet Explorer 6, which is not compatible with newer versions of Windows). Major security software vendors (including Microsoft itself) planned to continue offering support and definitions for Windows XP past the end of support to varying extents, along with the developers of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera web browsers; despite these measures, critics similarly argued that users should eventually migrate from XP to a supported platform.

The United States&#x27; Computer Emergency Readiness Team released an alert in March 2014 advising users of the impending end of support, and informing them that using XP after April 8 may prevent them from meeting US government information security requirements.
Microsoft continued to provide Security Essentials virus definitions and updates for its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) for XP until July 14, 2015. As the end of extended support approached, Microsoft began to increasingly urge XP customers to migrate to newer versions such as Windows 7 or 8 in the interest of security, suggesting that attackers could reverse engineer security patches for newer versions of Windows and use them to target equivalent vulnerabilities in XP. Windows XP is remotely exploitable by numerous security holes that were discovered after Microsoft stopped supporting it.

Similarly, specialized devices that run XP, particularly medical devices, must have any revisions to their software—even security updates for the underlying operating system—approved by relevant regulators before they can be released. For this reason, manufacturers often did not allow any updates to devices&#x27; operating systems, leaving them open to security exploits and malware.

Despite the end of support of the main version, Microsoft has released three emergency security updates for the operating system to patch major security vulnerabilities:

* A patch released in May 2014 to address recently discovered vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer 6 through 11 on all versions of Windows.
* A patch released in May 2017 to address a vulnerability that was being leveraged by the WannaCry ransomware attack.
* A patch released in May 2019 to address a critical code execution vulnerability in Remote Desktop Services which can be exploited in a similar way as the WannaCry vulnerability.

Researchers reported in August 2019 that Windows 10 users may be at risk for &quot;critical&quot; system compromise because of design flaws of hardware device drivers from multiple providers. In the same month, computer experts reported that the BlueKeep security vulnerability, , that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program&#x27;s Remote Desktop Protocol, allowing for the possibility of remote code execution, may now include related flaws, collectively named &quot;DejaBlue&quot;, affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., Windows 7 and all recent versions) as well. In addition, experts reported a Microsoft security vulnerability, , based on legacy code involving Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe), that affects all Windows versions from the older Windows XP version to the most recent Windows 10 versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.

Microsoft announced in July 2019 that the Microsoft Internet Games services on Windows XP and Windows Me would end on July 31, 2019 (and for Windows 7 on January 22, 2020).

In 2020, Microsoft announced that it would disable the Windows Update service for SHA-1 endpoints; since Windows XP did not get an update for SHA-2, Windows Update Services are no longer available on the OS as of late July 2020. However, as of March 2024, many of the old updates for Windows XP are still available on the Microsoft Update Catalog. A third-party tool named Legacy Update allows previously-released updates for Windows XP to be installed from the Update Catalog.

=== Third-party support ===
In February 2016, Opera announced that version 36 of its web browser would be the last version of the web browser to support Windows XP and Windows Vista. Google Chrome ended support for Windows XP and Windows Vista in April 2016. Firefox 52 ESR (Extended Support Release), which was released in March 2017, was the last version to support Windows XP and Windows Vista. Support for Firefox 52 ESR ended in June 2018.

Blizzard Entertainment ended support for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;StarCraft II&quot;, &quot;Diablo III&quot;, &quot;Hearthstone&quot;, and &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; on Windows XP and Vista in October 2017. Steam ended support for Windows XP and Vista on January 1, 2019.

There are several unofficial web browser projects that maintain support for Windows XP, well after official web browsers dropped support for the operating system. Supermium, a fork of the Chromium project that Google Chrome is based on, is maintained for Windows XP and later unsupported versions of Windows as of 2024. MyPal, a fork of Firefox 68, is also being actively maintained for Windows XP.

==Reception==
On release, Windows XP received critical acclaim. CNET described the operating system as being &quot;worth the hype&quot;, considering the new interface to be &quot;spiffier&quot; and more intuitive than previous versions, but feeling that it may &quot;annoy&quot; experienced users with its &quot;hand-holding&quot;. XP&#x27;s expanded multimedia support and CD burning functionality were also noted, along with its streamlined networking tools. The performance improvements of XP in comparison to 2000 and Me were also praised, along with its increased number of built-in device drivers in comparison to 2000. The software compatibility tools were also praised, although it was noted that some programs, particularly older MS-DOS software, may not work correctly on XP because of its differing architecture. They panned Windows XP&#x27;s new licensing model and product activation system, considering it to be a &quot;slightly annoying roadblock&quot;, but acknowledged Microsoft&#x27;s intent for the changes. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; provided similar praise, although noting that a number of its online features were designed to promote Microsoft-owned services, and that aside from quicker boot times, XP&#x27;s overall performance showed little difference over Windows 2000. Windows XP&#x27;s default theme, Luna, was criticized by some users for its childish look.

Despite extended support for the main Windows XP ending in 2014, many users – including some enterprises – were reluctant to move away from an operating system they viewed as a stable known quantity despite the many security and functionality improvements in subsequent releases of Windows. Windows XP&#x27;s longevity was viewed as testament to its stability and Microsoft&#x27;s successful attempts to keep it up to date, but also as an indictment of its direct successor&#x27;s perceived failings.

===Market share===
According to web analytics data generated by Net Applications, Windows XP was the most widely used operating system until August 2012, when Windows 7 overtook it (later overtaken by Windows 10), while StatCounter indicates it happening almost a year earlier. In January 2014, Net Applications reported a market share of 29.23% of &quot;desktop operating systems&quot; for XP (when XP was introduced there was not a separate mobile category to track), while W3Schools reported a share of 11.0%.

, in most regions or continents, Windows XP market share on PCs, as a fraction of the total Windows share, had gone below 1% (0.5% in Africa). XP retained a double-digit market share into the 2020s in a few countries, such as Armenia, where it was still over 50% in 2021.

==Source code leak==
On September 23, 2020, source code for Windows XP with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 was leaked onto the imageboard 4chan by an unknown user. Anonymous users managed to compile the code, as well as a Twitter user who posted videos of the process on YouTube proving that the code was genuine. The videos were later removed on copyright grounds by Microsoft. The leak was incomplete as it was missing Winlogon and some other components. The original leak itself was spread using magnet links and torrent files whose payload originally included Server 2003 and XP source code and which was later updated with additional files, among which were previous leaks of Microsoft products, its patents, media about conspiracy theories on Bill Gates by anti-vaccination movements and an assortment of PDF files on different topics.

Microsoft issued a statement stating that it was investigating the leaks.

<text>Woodwind instruments are a family of musical instruments within the greater category of wind instruments. 

Common examples include flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, and saxophone. There are two main types of woodwind instruments: flutes and reed instruments (otherwise called reed pipes). The main distinction between these instruments and other wind instruments is the way in which they produce sound. All woodwinds produce sound by splitting the air blown into them on a sharp edge, such as a reed or a fipple. Despite the name, a woodwind may be made of any material, not just wood. Common examples of other materials include brass, silver, cane, and other metals such as gold and platinum. The saxophone, for example, though made of brass, is considered a woodwind because it requires a reed to produce sound. Occasionally, woodwinds are made of earthen materials, especially ocarinas.
==Flutes==
Flutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air across the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube. The flute family can be divided into two subfamilies: open flutes and closed flutes.

To produce a sound with an open flute, the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream. This split air stream then acts upon the air column contained within the flute&#x27;s hollow, causing it to vibrate and produce sound. Examples of open flutes are the transverse flute, panpipes, and shakuhachi. Ancient flutes of this variety, including bamboo flutes, were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses, reeds, bamboo and hollowed-out tree branches. Later, flutes were made of metals such as tin, copper, or bronze. Modern concert flutes are usually made of high-grade metal alloys, usually containing nickel, silver, copper, or gold.

To produce a sound with a closed flute, the player is required to blow air into a duct. This duct acts as a channel, bringing the air to a sharp edge. As with the open flutes, the air is then split; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound. Examples of this type of flute include the recorder, ocarina, and organ pipes.

==Reed instruments==
Reed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece which then causes a reed, or reeds, to vibrate. Similarly to flutes, reed pipes are also further divided into two types: single reed and double reed.

Single-reed woodwinds produce sound by fixing a reed onto the opening of a mouthpiece (using a ligature). When air is forced between the reed and the mouthpiece, the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vibrate and produce its unique sound. Single reed instruments include the clarinet and saxophone.

Double reed instruments use two precisely cut, small pieces of cane bound together at the base. This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period; its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush. The finished, bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces (again, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well). This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two subfamilies: exposed double reed, and capped double reed instruments. 
Exposed double-reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player&#x27;s lips. This family includes instruments such as the oboe, cor anglais (also called English horn), and bassoon, and many types of shawms throughout the world.

Capped double-reed instruments, on the other hand, have the double reed covered by a cap; the player blows through a hole in this cap that then directs the air through the reeds. This family includes the crumhorn.

Bagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments, since they use two or more double or single reeds. However, bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double reed instruments, since the reeds are never in direct contact with the player&#x27;s lips.

Free reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by &#x27;free reeds&#x27; – small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame. The airflow necessary for the instrument&#x27;s sound is generated either by a player&#x27;s breath (e.g. harmonica), or by bellows (e.g. accordion).

== Modern orchestra and concert band woodwinds ==
The modern orchestra&#x27;s woodwind section typically includes flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons. Supplementary instruments include piccolo, cor anglais, bass clarinet, E-flat clarinet, and contrabassoon. Saxophones are also used on occasion.

The concert band&#x27;s woodwind section is typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestra&#x27;s. It typically includes piccolos, flutes, oboes, B clarinets, alto clarinets, bass clarinets, bassoons, alto saxophones, tenor saxophones, and baritone saxophones. Alto flute, cor anglais, E clarinet, contra-alto clarinet, contrabass clarinet, contrabassoon, soprano saxophone, and bass saxophone are also sometimes used.

<text>Wade–Giles ( ) is a romanization system for Mandarin Chinese. It developed from the system produced by Thomas Francis Wade during the mid-19th century, and was given completed form with Herbert Giles&#x27;s &quot;A Chinese–English Dictionary&quot; (1892).

The romanization systems in common use until the late 19th century were based on the Nanjing dialect, but Wade–Giles was based on the Beijing dialect and was the system of transcription familiar in the English-speaking world for most of the 20th century. Both of these kinds of transcription were used in postal romanizations (romanized place-names standardized for postal uses). In mainland China, Wade–Giles has been mostly replaced by Hanyu Pinyin, which was officially adopted in 1958, with exceptions for the romanized forms of some of the most commonly used names of locations and persons, and other proper nouns. The romanized name for most locations, persons and other proper nouns in Taiwan is based on the Wade–Giles derived romanized form, for example Kaohsiung, the Matsu Islands and Chiang Ching-kuo.

==History==
Wade–Giles was developed by Thomas Francis Wade, a scholar of Chinese and a British ambassador in China who was the first professor of Chinese at the University of Cambridge. Wade published &quot;&quot; () in 1867, the first textbook on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin in English, which became the basis for the system later known as Wade–Giles. The system, designed to transcribe Chinese terms for Chinese specialists, was further refined in 1892 by Herbert Giles (in &quot;A Chinese–English Dictionary&quot;), a British diplomat in China, and his son Lionel Giles, a curator at the British Museum.

Taiwan used Wade–Giles for decades as the de facto standard, co-existing with several official romanizations in succession, namely, Gwoyeu Romatzyh (1928), Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II (1986), and Tongyong Pinyin (2000). The Kuomintang (KMT) has previously promoted pinyin with Ma Ying-jeou&#x27;s successful presidential bid in 2008 and in a number of cities with Kuomintang mayors. However, the Tsai Ing-wen administration and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) along with the majority of the people in Taiwan, both native and overseas, use spelling and transcribe their legal names based on the Wade–Giles system, as well as the other aforementioned systems.

==Initials and finals==
The tables below show the Wade–Giles representation of each Chinese sound (in bold type), together with the corresponding IPA phonetic symbol (in square brackets), and equivalent representations in Bopomofo and Hanyu Pinyin.
===Initials===
Instead of &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;ts&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, Wade–Giles writes &quot;tz&quot;, &quot;tz&quot; and &quot;ss&quot; before &quot;ŭ&quot; (see below).

===Finals===
Wade–Giles writes &quot;-uei&quot; after &quot;k&quot; and &quot;k&quot;, otherwise &quot;-ui&quot;: &quot;kuei&quot;, &quot;kuei&quot;, &quot;hui&quot;, &quot;shui&quot;, &quot;chui&quot;.

It writes as &quot;-o&quot; after &quot;k&quot;, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;h&quot;, otherwise as &quot;-ê&quot;: &quot;ko&quot;, &quot;ko&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;, &quot;shê&quot;, &quot;chê&quot;. When forms a syllable on its own, it is written &quot;ê&quot; or &quot;o&quot; depending on the character.

Wade–Giles writes as &quot;-uo&quot; after &quot;k&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;h&quot; and &quot;sh&quot;, otherwise as &quot;-o&quot;: &quot;kuo&quot;, &quot;kuo&quot;, &quot;huo&quot;, &quot;shuo&quot;, &quot;bo&quot;, &quot;tso&quot;. After &quot;ch&quot;, it is written &quot;cho&quot; or &quot;chuo&quot; depending on the character.

For &quot;-ih&quot; and &quot;-ŭ&quot;, see below.

Giles&#x27;s &quot;A Chinese–English Dictionary&quot; also includes the finals &quot;-io&quot; (in &quot;yo&quot;, &quot;chio&quot;, &quot;chio&quot;, &quot;hsio&quot;, &quot;lio&quot; and &quot;nio&quot;) and &quot;-üo&quot; (in &quot;chüo&quot;, &quot;chüo&quot;, &quot;hsüo&quot;, &quot;lüo&quot; and &quot;nüo&quot;), both of which are pronounced &quot;-üeh&quot; in modern Standard Chinese: &quot;yüeh&quot;, &quot;chüeh&quot;, &quot;chüeh&quot;, &quot;hsüeh&quot;, &quot;lüeh&quot; and &quot;nüeh&quot;.

===Syllables that begin with a medial===
Wade–Giles writes the syllable as &quot;i&quot; or &quot;yi&quot; depending on the character.

==System features==

===Consonants and initial symbols===
A feature of the Wade–Giles system is the representation of the unaspirated-aspirated stop consonant pairs using a character resembling an apostrophe. Thomas Wade and others used the spiritus asper ( or ), borrowed from the polytonic orthography of the Ancient Greek language. Herbert Giles and others used a left (opening) curved single quotation mark (‘) for the same purpose. A third group used a plain apostrophe (&#x27;). The backtick, and visually similar characters, are sometimes seen in various electronic documents using the system.

Examples using the spiritus asper: &quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;. The use of this character preserves &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, and &quot;j&quot; for the romanization of Chinese varieties containing voiced consonants, such as Shanghainese (which has a full set of voiced consonants) and Min Nan (Hō-ló-oē) whose century-old Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ, often called Missionary Romanization) is similar to Wade–Giles. POJ, Legge romanization, Simplified Wade, and EFEO Chinese transcription use the letter instead of an apostrophe-like character to indicate aspiration. (This is similar to the obsolete IPA convention before the revisions of the 1970s). The convention of an apostrophe-like character or to denote aspiration is also found in romanizations of other Asian languages, such as McCune–Reischauer for Korean and ISO 11940 for Thai.

People unfamiliar with Wade–Giles often ignore the spiritus asper, sometimes omitting them when copying texts, unaware that they represent vital information. Hànyǔ Pīnyīn addresses this issue by employing the Latin letters customarily used for voiced stops, unneeded in Mandarin, to represent the unaspirated stops: &quot;b, p, d, t, g, k, j, q, zh, ch.&quot;

Partly because of the popular omission of apostrophe-like characters, the four sounds represented in Hànyǔ Pīnyīn by &quot;j&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;zh&quot;, and &quot;ch&quot; often all become &quot;ch&quot;, including in many proper names. However, if the apostrophe-like characters are kept, the system reveals a symmetry that leaves no overlap:
* The non-retroflex &quot;ch&quot; (Pīnyīn &quot;j&quot;) and &quot;ch&quot; (Pīnyīn &quot;q&quot;) are always before either &quot;ü&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, but never &quot;ih&quot;. 
* The retroflex &quot;ch&quot; (Pīnyīn &quot;zh&quot;) and &quot;ch&quot; (Pīnyīn &quot;ch&quot;) are always before &quot;ih&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ê&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, or &quot;u&quot;.

===Vowels and final symbols===

====Syllabic consonants====
Like Yale and Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II, Wade–Giles renders the two types of syllabic consonant (; Wade–Giles: &quot;kung1-yün4&quot;; Hànyǔ Pīnyīn: &quot;kōngyùn&quot;) differently: 
* &quot;-ŭ&quot; is used after the sibilants written in this position (and this position only) as &quot;tz&quot;, &quot;tz&quot; and &quot;ss&quot; (Pīnyīn &quot;z&quot;, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;s&quot;).
* &quot;-ih&quot; is used after the retroflex &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, and &quot;j&quot; (Pīnyīn &quot;zh&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, and &quot;r&quot;).
These finals are both written as &quot;-ih&quot; in Tongyòng Pinyin, as &quot;-i&quot; in Hànyǔ Pīnyīn (hence distinguishable only by the initial from as in &quot;li&quot;), and as &quot;-y&quot; in Gwoyeu Romatzyh and Simplified Wade. They are typically omitted in Zhùyīn (Bōpōmōfō).
====Vowel &quot;o&quot; ====
Final &quot;o&quot; in Wade–Giles has two pronunciations in modern Peking dialect: and .

What is pronounced in vernacular Peking dialect as a close-mid back unrounded vowel is written usually as &quot;ê&quot;, but sometimes as &quot;o&quot;, depending on historical pronunciation (at the time Wade–Giles was developed). Specifically, after velar initials &quot;k&quot;, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;h&quot; (and a historical &quot;ng&quot;, which had been dropped by the time Wade–Giles was developed), &quot;o&quot; is used; for example, &quot;哥&quot; is &quot;ko1&quot; (Pīnyīn &quot;gē&quot;) and &quot;刻&quot; is &quot;ko4&quot; (Pīnyīn &quot;kè&quot;). In Peking dialect, &quot;o&quot; after velars (and what used to be &quot;ng&quot;) have shifted to , thus they are written as &quot;ge&quot;, &quot;ke&quot;, &quot;he&quot; and &quot;e&quot; in Pīnyīn. When forms a syllable on its own, Wade–Giles writes &quot;ê&quot; or &quot;o&quot; depending on the character. In all other circumstances, it writes &quot;ê&quot;.

What is pronounced in Peking dialect as is usually written as &quot;o&quot; in Wade–Giles, except for &quot;wo&quot;, &quot;shuo&quot; (e.g. &quot;說&quot; &quot;shuo1&quot;) and the three syllables of &quot;kuo&quot;, &quot;kuo&quot;, and &quot;huo&quot; (as in 過, 霍, etc.), which contrast with &quot;ko&quot;, &quot;ko&quot;, and &quot;ho&quot; that correspond to Pīnyīn &quot;ge&quot;, &quot;ke&quot;, and &quot;he&quot;. This is because characters like 羅, 多, etc. (Wade–Giles: &quot;lo2&quot;, &quot;to1&quot;; Pīnyīn: &quot;luó&quot;, &quot;duō&quot;) did not originally carry the medial . Peking dialect does not have phonemic contrast between &quot;o&quot; and &quot;-uo&quot;/&quot;wo&quot; (except in interjections when used alone) and a medial is usually inserted in front of &quot;-o&quot; to form .
Zhùyīn and Pīnyīn write as ㄛ &quot;-o&quot; after ㄅ &quot;b&quot;, ㄆ &quot;p&quot;, ㄇ &quot;m&quot; and ㄈ &quot;f&quot;, and as ㄨㄛ &quot;-uo&quot; after all other initials.

===Tones===
Tones are indicated in Wade–Giles using superscript numbers (1–4) placed after the syllable. This contrasts with the use of diacritics to represent the tones in Pīnyīn. For example, the Pīnyīn &quot;qiàn&quot; (fourth tone) has the Wade–Giles equivalent &quot;chien4&quot;.

===Punctuation===
Wade–Giles uses hyphens to separate all syllables within a word (whereas Pīnyīn separates syllables only in specially defined cases, using hyphens or closing (right) single quotation marks as appropriate).

If a syllable is not the first in a word, its first letter is not capitalized, even if it is part of a proper noun. The use of apostrophe-like characters, hyphens, and capitalization is frequently not observed in place names and personal names. For example, the majority of overseas Taiwanese people write their given names like &quot;Tai Lun&quot; or &quot;Tai-Lun&quot;, whereas the Wade–Giles is actually &quot;Tai-lun&quot;. (See also Chinese names.)

==Comparison with other systems==

===Pinyin===
*Wade–Giles chose the French-like (implying a sound like IPA&#x27;s , as in s in English &quot;measure&quot;) to represent a Northern Mandarin pronunciation of what is represented as in pinyin (Northern Mandarin / Southern Mandarin ; generally considered allophones).
*&quot;Ü&quot; (representing ) always has an umlaut above, while pinyin only employs it in the cases of , &#x27;, , &#x27; and &quot;&quot;, while leaving it out after &quot;j&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; as a simplification because / cannot otherwise appear after those letters. (The vowel / can occur in those cases in pinyin where the diaeresis are indicated / or ; in which cases it serves to distinguish the front vowel from the back vowel . By contrast it is always present to mark the front vowel in Wade–Giles.) Because (as in &quot;jade&quot;) must have an umlaut in Wade–Giles, the umlaut-less in Wade–Giles is freed up for what corresponds to ( &quot;have&quot;/&quot;there is&quot;) in Pinyin.
*The Pīnyīn cluster is in Wade–Giles, reflecting the pronunciation of as in English &quot;book&quot; . (Compare &quot;kung1-fu&quot; to as an example.)
*After a consonant, both Wade–Giles and Pīnyīn use and instead of the complete syllables: and /.

===Chart===

Note: In Hànyǔ Pīnyīn, the so-called neutral tone is written leaving the syllable with no diacritic mark at all. In Tongyòng Pinyin, a ring is written over the vowel.

==Adaptations==
There are several adaptations of Wade–Giles.

===&quot;Mathews&quot;===
The Romanization system used in the 1943 edition of &quot;Mathews&#x27; Chinese–English Dictionary&quot; differs from Wade–Giles in the following ways:

*It uses the right apostrophe: &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;tzŭ&quot;; while Wade–Giles uses the left apostrophe, similar to the aspiration diacritic used in the International Phonetic Alphabet before the revisions of the 1970s: &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;tzŭ&quot;.
*It consistently uses &quot;i&quot; for the syllable , while Wade–Giles uses &quot;i&quot; or &quot;yi&quot; depending on the character.
*It uses &quot;o&quot; for the syllable , while Wade–Giles uses &quot;ê&quot; or &quot;o&quot; depending on the character.
*It offers the choice between &quot;ssŭ&quot; and &quot;szŭ&quot;, while Wade–Giles requires &quot;ssŭ&quot;.
*It does not use the spellings &quot;chio&quot;, &quot;chio&quot;, &quot;hsio&quot;, &quot;yo&quot;, replacing them with &quot;chüeh&quot;, &quot;chüeh&quot;, &quot;hsüeh&quot;, &quot;yüeh&quot; in accordance with their modern pronunciations.
*It uses an underscored &quot;3&quot; to denote a second tone which comes from an original third tone, but only if the following syllable has the neutral tone and the tone sandhi is therefore not predictable: &quot;hsiao3•chieh&quot;.
*It denotes the neutral tone by placing a dot (if the neutral tone is compulsory) or a circle (if the neutral tone is optional) before the syllable. The dot or circle replaces the hyphen.

<text>The Woodstock Music and Art Fair, commonly referred to as Woodstock, was a music festival held from August 15 to 18, 1969, on Max Yasgur&#x27;s dairy farm in Bethel, New York, southwest of the town of Woodstock. Billed as &quot;an Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace &amp; Music&quot; and alternatively referred to as the Woodstock Rock Festival, it attracted an audience of more than 460,000. Thirty-two acts performed outdoors despite overcast and sporadic rain. It was one of the largest music festivals in history and became synonymous with the counterculture of the 1960s.

The festival has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history, as well as a defining event for the silent and baby boomer generations. The event&#x27;s significance was reinforced by a 1970 documentary film, an accompanying , and a song written by Joni Mitchell that became a major hit for both Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and Matthews Southern Comfort. Musical events bearing the Woodstock name were planned for anniversaries, including the 10th, 20th, 25th, 30th, 40th, and 50th. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine listed it as number 19 of the 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll. In 2017, the festival site became listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Planning and preparation==
Woodstock was initiated through the efforts of Michael Lang, Artie Kornfeld, Joel Rosenman, and John P. Roberts. Roberts and Rosenman financed the project. Lang had some experience as a promoter, having co-organized the Miami Pop Festival on the East Coast the previous year, where an estimated 25,000 people attended the two-day event.

Early in 1969, Roberts and Rosenman were New York City entrepreneurs who were in the process of building Mediasound, a recording studio complex in Manhattan. Lang and Kornfeld&#x27;s lawyer, Miles Lourie, who had done legal work on the Mediasound project, suggested that they contact Roberts and Rosenman about financing a similar but much smaller studio, Kornfeld, that Lang hoped to build in Woodstock, New York. Unpersuaded by this Studio-in-the-Woods proposal, Roberts and Rosenman counter-proposed a concert featuring the kind of artists known to frequent the Woodstock area, such as Bob Dylan and the Band. Kornfeld and Lang agreed to the new plan, and Woodstock Ventures was formed in January 1969. The company offices were located in an oddly decorated floor of 47 West 57th Street in Manhattan. Burt Cohen and his design group, Curtain Call Productions, oversaw the psychedelic transformation of the office.

From the start there were differences in approach among the four. Roberts was disciplined and knew what was needed for the venture to succeed, while the laid-back Lang saw Woodstock as a new, &quot;relaxed&quot; way of bringing entrepreneurs together. When Lang was unable to find a site for the concert, Roberts and Rosenman, growing increasingly concerned, took to the road and found a venue. Similar differences about financial discipline made Roberts and Rosenman wonder whether to pull the plug or to continue pumping money into the project.

In April 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival became the first act to sign a contract for the event, agreeing to play for $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The promoters had experienced difficulty in landing big-name groups until Creedence committed to play. Creedence drummer Doug Clifford later commented: &quot;Once Creedence signed, everyone else jumped in line and all the other big acts came on.&quot; Given their 12:30 am start time and omission from the &quot;Woodstock&quot; film (at frontman John Fogerty&#x27;s insistence), members have expressed bitterness over their experiences regarding the festival.

Woodstock was conceived as a profit-making venture. It became a &quot;free concert&quot; when circumstances prevented the organizers from installing fences and ticket booths before opening day. Tickets for the three-day event cost US$18 in advance and $24 at the gate (equivalent to about $ and $ today). Ticket sales were limited to record stores in the greater New York City area, or by mail via a post office box at the Radio City Station Post Office located in Midtown Manhattan. Around 186,000 advance tickets were sold. The organizers had anticipated that approximately 50,000 festival-goers would turn up.

===Selection of venue===
The original plan was for the festival to take place in the town of Woodstock on a site owned by Alexander Tapooz. After local residents rejected that idea, Lang and Kornfeld thought they had found another possible location at the Winston Farm in Saugerties, New York. But they were mistaken, as the landowner&#x27;s attorney made clear in a brief meeting with Roberts and Rosenman. Growing alarmed at the lack of progress, Roberts and Rosenman took over the search for a venue, and discovered the Mills Industrial Park () in the town of Wallkill, New York, which Woodstock Ventures leased for US$10,000 (equivalent to $ today) in the Spring of 1969. Town officials were assured that no more than 50,000 would attend. Town residents immediately opposed the project. In early July, the Town Board passed a law requiring a permit for any gathering of over 5,000 people. The conditions upon which a permit would be issued made it impossible for the promoters to continue construction at the Wallkill site. Reports of the ban, however, turned out to be a publicity bonanza for the festival.

In his 2007 book &quot;Taking Woodstock&quot;, Elliot Tiber relates that he offered to host the event on his motel grounds, and had a permit for such an event. He claims to have introduced the promoters to dairy farmer Max Yasgur. Lang, however, disputes Tiber&#x27;s account and says that Tiber introduced him to a realtor, who drove him to Yasgur&#x27;s farm without Tiber. Sam Yasgur, Max&#x27;s son, agrees with Lang&#x27;s account. Yasgur&#x27;s land formed a natural bowl sloping down to Filippini Pond on the land&#x27;s north side. The stage would be set up at the bottom of the hill with Filippini Pond forming a backdrop. The pond became a popular skinny dipping destination. Filippini was the only landowner who refused to sign a lease for the use of his property. The organizers again told Bethel authorities that they expected no more than 50,000 people.

Despite opposition from the residents and signs proclaiming, &quot;Buy No Milk. Stop Max&#x27;s Hippy Music Festival&quot;, Bethel Town Attorney Frederick W. V. Schadt, building inspector Donald Clark and Town Supervisor Daniel Amatucci approved the festival permits, although the Bethel Town Board refused to issue the permits formally. Clark was ordered to post stop-work orders. Rosenman recalls meeting Don Clark and discussing with him how unethical it was for him to withhold permits which had already been authorized, and which he had in his pocket. At the end of the meeting, Inspector Clark gave him the permits. The stop work order was lifted, allowing the festival to proceed pending backing by the Department of Health and Agriculture, and removal of all structures by September 1, 1969.

The late change in venue did not give the festival organizers enough time to prepare. At a meeting three days before the event, Rosenman was asked by the construction foremen to choose between (a) completing the fencing and ticket booths, without which Roberts and Rosenman would be facing almost certain bankruptcy after the festival, or (b) trying to complete the stage, without which it would be a weekend of half a million concert-goers with no concerts. The next morning, on Wednesday, it became clear that option (a) had disappeared. Overnight, 50,000 &quot;early birds&quot; had arrived and had planted themselves in front of the half-finished stage. For the rest of the weekend, concert-goers simply walked on to the site with or without tickets. The festival left Roberts and Rosenman close to financial ruin, but their ownership of the film and recording rights turned their finances around when the Academy Award-winning documentary film &quot;Woodstock&quot; was released in March 1970.

==Festival==

The influx of people to the rural concert site in Bethel created a huge traffic jam. The town of Bethel did not enforce its codes, fearing chaos as crowds flowed to the site. Radio and television descriptions of the traffic jams eventually discouraged people from setting off to the festival. Arlo Guthrie made an announcement that was included in the film saying that the New York State Thruway was closed, although the director of the Woodstock museum said that this did not happen. To add to the problems and difficulty in dealing with the large crowds, recent rain had created muddy roads and fields. The facilities were not adequate to provide sanitation or first aid for the number of people attending, and hundreds of thousands found themselves in a struggle against bad weather, food shortages and poor sanitation.

The event&#x27;s security was to be handled by a group of 346 off-duty New York City police officers, but the officers were forced to withdraw when they were warned that they were violating regulations against moonlighting. On the morning of Sunday, August 17, New York governor and future vice president Nelson Rockefeller called festival organizer John P. Roberts and told him that he was thinking of ordering 10,000 National Guard troops to the festival site, but Roberts persuaded him not to. Sullivan County declared a state of emergency. During the festival, personnel from nearby Stewart Air Force Base helped to ensure order and air-lifted performers in and out of the site.

Jimi Hendrix was the last to perform at the festival, taking the stage at 8:30 Monday morning after delays caused by the rain. By that point the audience numbers had fallen to about 30,000 from an estimated peak of 450,000. Many left during Hendrix&#x27;s performance, having waited to catch a glimpse of him. Hendrix and his new band Gypsy Sun and Rainbows were introduced as the Experience, but he corrected this and added: &quot;You could call us a Band of Gypsies&quot;. They performed a two-hour set, including his psychedelic rendition of the national anthem, which became &quot;part of the sixties Zeitgeist&quot; after it was captured in the Woodstock film.

The festival was remarkably peaceful given the number of people and the conditions involved, although there were three recorded fatalities: two drug overdoses and another caused when a tractor ran over a 17-year-old sleeping in a nearby hayfield. Births were claimed to have occurred, one in a car caught in traffic and another in hospital after an airlift by helicopter, but extensive research by a book author could not confirm any births. Several miscarriages were reported (sources range from four to eight) and over the course of the three days there were 742 drug overdoses.

Max Yasgur, who owned the site, spoke of how nearly half a million people had spent the three days with music and peace on their minds. He stated, &quot;If we join them, we can turn those adversities that are the problems of America today into a hope for a brighter and more peaceful future&quot;.

===Sound===

Sound for the concert was engineered by sound engineer Bill Hanley. &quot;It worked very well&quot;, he said of the event. &quot;I built special speaker columns on the hills and had 16 loudspeaker arrays in a square platform going up to the hill on towers. We set it up for 150,000 to 200,000 people. Of course, 500,000 showed up.&quot; ALTEC designed marine plywood cabinets that weighed half a ton apiece and stood tall, almost deep, and wide. Each of these enclosures carried four JBL D140 loudspeakers. The tweeters consisted of 4×2-Cell &amp; 2×10-Cell Altec Horns. Behind the stage were three transformers providing 2,000 amperes of current to power the amplification setup. For many years this system was collectively referred to as &quot;the Woodstock Bins&quot;. The live performances were captured on two 8-track Scully recorders in a tractor trailer backstage by Edwin Kramer and Lee Osbourne on 1-inch Scotch recording tape at 15ips, then mixed at the Record Plant studio in New York.

===Lighting===
Lighting for the concert was engineered by lighting designer and technical director E.H. Beresford &quot;Chip&quot; Monck. Monck was hired to plan and build the staging and lighting, ten weeks of work for which he was paid $7,000 (equivalent to $ today). Much of his plan had to be scrapped when the promoters were not allowed to use the original location in Wallkill, New York. The stage roof that was constructed in the shorter time available was not able to support the lighting that had been rented, which wound up sitting unused underneath the stage. The only light on the stage was from spotlights.

Monck used twelve 1300 Watt Super Trouper follow spots rigged on four towers around the stage. The follow spots weighed each and were operated by spotlight operators who had to climb up on the top of the lighting towers.

Monck also was drafted just before the concert started as the master of ceremonies when Michael Lang noticed he had forgotten to hire one. He can be heard and seen in recordings of Woodstock making the stage announcements, including requests to &quot;stay off the towers&quot; and the warning about the &quot;brown acid&quot;.

===Artists===

Thirty-two acts performed over the course of the four days:



===Declined invitations or missed connections===
* The Beatles were recording &quot;Abbey Road&quot; at the time and on the verge of breaking up. Promoter Michael Lang, realizing the Beatles were not an option, invited John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band. Due to Lennon&#x27;s position on Vietnam and 1968 drug bust in England, Richard Nixon and the U.S. government reportedly did not want him in the country. Apple Corps sent a letter to the promoters offering the Plastic Ono Band, but the letter arrived as promoters were losing the location in Wallkill, so distractions did not allow arrangements to be finalized.
* The Jeff Beck Group disbanded prior to Woodstock. &quot;I deliberately broke the group up before Woodstock,&quot; Beck said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want it to be preserved.&quot; Beck&#x27;s piano player Nicky Hopkins performed with Jefferson Airplane.
* Blues Image agreed to appear at the Woodstock festival, according to a 2011 interview with percussionist Joe Lala. Their manager did not want them to go and said, &quot;There&#x27;s only one road in and it&#x27;s going to be raining, you don&#x27;t want to be there&quot;. The band instead took a gig at Binghamton.
* The Byrds were invited but chose not to participate, believing that Woodstock would be no different from any of the other music festivals that summer. There were also concerns about money. Bassist John York later said, &quot;We had no idea what it was going to be. We were burned out and tired of the festival scene.&quot;
* Chicago had initially been signed to play at Woodstock, but they had a contract with concert promoter Bill Graham which allowed him to move their concerts at the Fillmore West. He rescheduled some of their dates to August 17, thus forcing them to back out of the concert. Graham did so to ensure that Santana would take their slot at the festival, as he managed them as well.
* Eric Clapton wanted English supergroup Blind Faith to play the festival, which occurred during their only tour, but was outvoted by the rest of the group.
* The Doors were considered but canceled at the last moment. According to guitarist Robby Krieger, they turned it down because they thought that it would be a &quot;second class repeat of Monterey Pop Festival&quot; and later regretted that decision. Other sources claim that lead singer Jim Morrison &quot;hated playing large outdoor concerts and feared [...] he might be assassinated.&quot; Krieger and Doors drummer John Densmore did attend Woodstock, &quot;though they did not perform.&quot; The Doors would later appear at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, and Krieger later made a guest performance with post-grunge band Creed at the ill-fated Woodstock &#x27;99.
* Bob Dylan lived in the town of Woodstock but never seriously negotiated to appear. Instead, he signed in mid-July to play the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival on August 31. He intended to travel to England on &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; on August 15, the day that the Woodstock Festival started, but his son was injured by a cabin door and the family disembarked. Dylan and his wife Sara flew to England the following week. The Band accompanied him during his Isle of Wight appearance.
* Free was asked to perform and declined, although they did perform at the Isle of Wight Festival a week later.
* The Guess Who were invited to perform and declined, according to former band member Randy Bachman. However, vocalist Burton Cummings later confirmed that there was no such invitation.
* Iron Butterfly was booked to appear, and is listed on the Woodstock poster for a Sunday performance, but could not perform because they were stuck at LaGuardia Airport. According to Production Coordinator John Morris, &quot;They sent me a telegram saying, &#x27;We will arrive at LaGuardia. You will have helicopters pick us up. We will fly straight to the show. We will perform immediately, and then we will be flown out.&#x27; And I picked up the phone and called Western Union ... And [my telegram] said: For reasons I can&#x27;t go into / Until you are here / Clarifying your situation / Knowing you are having problems / You will have to find /Other transportation /Unless you plan not to come.&#x27;&quot;
* It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day had a verbal agreement with Michael Lang to perform at the festival. Violinist and band leader David LaFlamme said their manager Bill Graham wanted Santana, who he also managed to play the festival instead. Lang and Graham agreed to flip a coin to decide which band would play, Graham won, and Santana performed instead.
* Tommy James and the Shondells claimed to have declined an invitation. James stated: &quot;We could have just kicked ourselves. We were in Hawaii, and my secretary called and said, &#x27;Yeah, listen, there&#x27;s this pig farmer in upstate New York that wants you to play in his field.&#x27; That&#x27;s how it was put to me. So we passed, and we realized what we&#x27;d missed a couple of days later.&quot;
* Jethro Tull also declined. According to Ian Anderson, he knew that it would be a big event, but he did not want to go because he did not like hippies and had other concerns, including inappropriate nudity, heavy drinking, and drug use.
* Led Zeppelin were asked to perform. Their manager Peter Grant stated: &quot;I said no because at Woodstock we&#x27;d have just been another band on the bill.&quot;
* Lighthouse declined to perform at Woodstock.
* Arthur Lee and Love declined an invitation, in part due to turmoil within the band.
* Mind Garage declined because they thought that the festival would be a minor event, and they had a higher paying gig elsewhere.
* Joni Mitchell was originally slated to perform, but canceled at the urging of her manager to avoid missing a scheduled appearance on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;. She later composed the song &quot;Woodstock&quot; inspired by what she saw on television.
* Essra Mohawk was scheduled to perform at the festival, but her driver took a wrong turn on the way. &quot;We got there in time to see the last verse of the last song of the last act of the first night, and then the stage went dark before we got to it from the parking lot,&quot; she recalled in a 2009 video interview.
* The Moody Blues were included on the original Wallkill poster as performers, but they backed out after being booked in Paris the same weekend.
* Poco were offered a chance to perform at the festival, but their manager turned it down for a concert at a Los Angeles school gymnasium.
* Procol Harum were invited, but refused because Woodstock fell at the end of a long tour and also coincided with the due date of guitarist Robin Trower&#x27;s baby.
* The Rascals were invited to play, but declined because they were in the middle of recording a new album.
* Raven turned down an invitation to play because they played at one of the Woodstock Sound-Outs the year before and it did not go well.
* Roy Rogers was asked to close the festival with &quot;Happy Trails&quot;, but he declined.
* The Rolling Stones were invited, but declined because Mick Jagger was in Australia filming &quot;Ned Kelly&quot;, and Keith Richards&#x27; girlfriend Anita Pallenberg had just given birth to their son Marlon.
* Simon &amp; Garfunkel declined the invitation, as they were working on their new album.
* Spirit also declined an invitation to play, as they already had shows planned and wanted to play those instead, not knowing how big Woodstock would be.
* Steel Mill, Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s then band, was reportedly offered a slot but was already booked. 
* Strawberry Alarm Clock declined an invitation because they did not think Woodstock would be &quot;that big of a deal&quot;.
* According to Michael Lang, Apple Records wanted to send some of their acts to Woodstock. &quot;Apple sent me a letter saying they were going to send an art installation from the Plastic Ono Band and also offered James Taylor and Billy Preston,&quot; Lang continued to Billboard. &quot;All three would have been great, but the letter arrived around the time we were losing the site in Wallkill and we were kind of distracted, so those never got finalized.&quot;
* Zager and Evans were invited to play Woodstock and appear on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, but Rick Evans was injured by a drunk driver in a crash.
* Frank Zappa was then with The Mothers of Invention; he said, &quot;A lot of mud at Woodstock ... We were invited to play there, we turned it down.&quot;

===Media coverage===
Very few reporters from outside the immediate area were on the scene. During the first few days of the festival, national media coverage emphasized the problems. Front-page headlines in the &quot;Daily News&quot; read &quot;Traffic Uptight at Hippiefest&quot; and &quot;Hippies Mired in a Sea of Mud&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; ran an editorial titled &quot;Nightmare in the Catskills&quot;, which read in part, &quot;The dreams of marijuana and rock music that drew 300,000 fans and hippies to the Catskills had little more sanity than the impulses that drive the lemmings to march to their deaths in the sea. They ended in a nightmare of mud and stagnation ... What kind of culture is it that can produce so colossal a mess?&quot; Coverage became more positive by the end of the festival, in part because the parents of concertgoers called the media and told them, based on their children&#x27;s phone calls, that their reporting was misleading.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; covered the prelude to the festival and the move from Wallkill to Bethel. Barnard Collier, who reported from the event for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, asserted that he was pressured by on-duty editors at the paper to write a misleadingly negative article about the event. According to Collier, this led to acrimonious discussions and his threat to refuse to write the article until the paper&#x27;s executive editor, James Reston, agreed to let him write the article as he saw fit. The eventual article dealt with issues of traffic jams and minor lawbreaking, but went on to emphasize cooperation, generosity, and the good nature of the festival goers. When the festival was over, Collier wrote another article about the exodus of fans from the festival site and the lack of violence at the event. The chief medical officer for the event and several local residents were quoted as praising the festival goers.

Middletown, New York&#x27;s &quot;Times Herald-Record&quot;, the only local daily newspaper, editorialized against the law that banned the festival from Wallkill. During the festival, a rare Saturday edition was published. The paper had the only phone line running out of the site, and it used a motorcyclist to get stories and pictures from the impassable crowd to the newspaper&#x27;s office away in Middletown.

==Releases==

===Films===
====1970 documentary====

The documentary film &quot;Woodstock&quot;, directed by Michael Wadleigh and edited by a crew headed by Thelma Schoonmaker, was released in March 1970. Artie Kornfeld (one of the promoters of the festival) went to Fred Weintraub, an executive at Warner Bros., and asked for money to film the festival. Kornfeld had been turned down everywhere else, but against the express wishes of other Warner Bros. executives, Weintraub put his job on the line and gave Kornfeld $100,000 (equivalent to $ today) to make the film. &quot;Woodstock&quot; helped to save Warner Bros at a time when the company was on the verge of going out of business. The book &quot;Easy Riders, Raging Bulls&quot; details the making of the film.

Wadleigh rounded up a crew of about 100 from the New York film scene. With no money to pay the crew, he agreed to a double-or-nothing scheme, in which the crew would receive double pay if the film succeeded and nothing if it bombed. Wadleigh strove to make the film as much about the hippies as the music, listening to their feelings about compelling events contemporaneous with the festival (such as the Vietnam War), as well as the views of the townspeople.

&quot;Woodstock&quot; received the Academy Award for Documentary Feature. In 1996, the film was inducted into the Library of Congress National Film Registry. In 1994, &quot;Woodstock: The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; was released and expanded to include Janis Joplin as well as additional performances by Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, and Canned Heat not seen in the original version of the film. In 2009, the expanded 40th Anniversary Edition was released on DVD. This release marked the film&#x27;s first availability on Blu-ray.

====Other films====
&quot;Woodstock Diaries&quot; was produced by D. A. Pennebaker in 1994 as a three-part TV documentary miniseries. It was intended to commemorate Woodstock&#x27;s 25th anniversary and included rare performances and interviews with many of the concert&#x27;s producers, including Joel Rosenman, John Roberts and Michael Lang.

&quot;Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock&quot; was produced in 2005 as two-disc set that included all available footage of Hendrix&#x27;s Woodstock performance in two different edits. The release also included a mini-documentary with members of Hendrix&#x27;s band, and footage of a September 1969 news conference where he discussed his Woodstock set.

&quot;Taking Woodstock&quot; was produced in 2009 by Taiwanese American filmmaker Ang Lee. Lee practically rented out the entire town of New Lebanon, New York, to shoot the film. He was initially concerned with not angering the locals, but they ended up being very welcoming and willing to help. The movie is based on Elliot Tiber, played by Demetri Martin, and his role in bringing Woodstock to Bethel, New York. The film also starred Jonathan Groff as Michael Lang, Daniel Eric Gold as Joel Rosenman, and Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton as Jake and Sonia Teichberg.

&quot;Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation&quot; is a documentary by Barak Goodman, produced in 2019 by PBS. It focused on Woodstock&#x27;s social and political context and contained previously unseen footage supplemented by voice-over anecdotes from people at the festival. It focused more on the scenes in the crowd (and around the country) than on the stage.

&quot;Creating Woodstock&quot; was directed by Mick Richards and produced in 2019. It looked at how the festival came together, with interviews with producers clarifying some of Woodstock&#x27;s myths and what it took to get many performers to attend. (Janis Joplin, for example, apparently required a personal supply of strawberries.)

===Albums===
====Soundtrack albums and 25th anniversary releases====
Two soundtrack albums were released. The first, &quot;&quot;, was a 3-LP (later 2-CD) album containing a sampling of one or two songs by most of the acts who performed. A year later, &quot;Woodstock 2&quot; was released as a 2-LP album. Both albums included recordings of stage announcements (many by Production Coordinator John Morris, e.g., &quot;[We&#x27;re told] that the brown acid is not specifically too good&quot;, &quot;Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain&quot;) and crowd noises (i.e., the rain chant) between songs. In August 1994, a third album, &quot;Woodstock Diary&quot; was released, containing music not included on the earlier two albums.

Tracks from all three albums, as well as numerous additional, previously unreleased performances from the festival (but not the stage announcements and crowd noises) were reissued by Atlantic, also in August 1994, as a four compact disc box set titled &quot;&quot;.

An album titled &quot;Jimi Hendrix: Woodstock&quot; was also released in August 1994, featuring only selected recordings of Jimi Hendrix at the festival.

====30th anniversary releases====
In July 1999, MCA Records released &quot;Live at Woodstock&quot;, an expanded, double disc set featuring nearly every song of Hendrix&#x27;s performance, omitting just two pieces that were sung by his rhythm guitarist Larry Lee.

====40th anniversary releases====
In June 2009, complete performances from Woodstock by Santana, Janis Joplin, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Jefferson Airplane, and Johnny Winter were released separately by Legacy/SME Records, and were also collected in a box set titled &quot;The Woodstock Experience&quot;.

In August 2009, Rhino/Atlantic Records issued a six-disc box set titled &quot;Woodstock 40 Years On: Back To Yasgur&#x27;s Farm&quot;, which included further musical performances as well as stage announcements and other ancillary material.

In October 2009, Joe Cocker released &quot;Live at Woodstock&quot;, a live album of his entire Woodstock set. The album contains eleven tracks, ten of which were previously unreleased.

====50th anniversary releases====
On August 2, 2019, the Rhino/Atlantic released &quot;Woodstock – Back to the Garden: The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive&quot;, a massive 38 disc, 36-hour, 432-song completists&#x27; audio box set of nearly every note played at the original 1969 Woodstock festival (including 276 songs that were previously unreleased), a &quot;CD collection [co-produced for Rhino by archivist Andy Zax] that lays the &#x27;69 fest out in chronological order, from the first stage announcements to muddy farewells.&quot; The only things missing from this 38-CD edition were two Jimi Hendrix songs that his estate did not believe were up to the required standard and some of Sha Na Na&#x27;s music that missed being captured on tape. Because of various production and warehousing issues, the release of the box set was delayed, causing a backlash and dissatisfaction toward Rhino and Warner Music. More condensed versions — a ten disc deluxe set and a three disc or five LP sampler set — were also released. The full version was limited to a run of only 1,969 copies.

Also released in 2019 was &quot;Live at Woodstock&quot;, an official album of all 11 songs played by Creedence Clearwater Revival, from &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot; to &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; and &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. John Fogerty had originally thought the band&#x27;s performance was unworthy, but this album was finally released both on CD and as a double vinyl LP.

==Aftermath==
In the years immediately following the festival, Woodstock co-producers John Roberts and Joel Rosenman, along with Robert Pilpel, wrote &quot;Young Men with Unlimited Capital: The Inside Story of the Legendary Woodstock Festival Told By The Two People Who Paid for It&quot;, a book about the events behind the scenes during the production of the Woodstock Festival.

Bethel voters did not re-elect Supervisor Amatucci in an election held in November 1969 because of his role in bringing the festival to the town and the upset attributed to some residents. Although accounts vary, it was decided by only a small margin of between six and fifty votes. The New York State Legislature and the Town of Bethel also enacted mass gathering laws designed to prevent anymore festivals from occurring.

Approximately 80 lawsuits were filed against Woodstock Ventures, primarily by farmers in the area. The movie financed settlements and paid off the $1.4 million of debt (equivalent to $ million today) Roberts and Rosenman had incurred from the festival. Max Yasgur refused to rent out his farm for a 1970 revival of the festival, saying, &quot;As far as I know, I&#x27;m going back to running a dairy farm.&quot; Yasgur died in 1973.

In 1984, at the original festival site, land owners Louis Nicky and June Gelish put up a monument marker with plaques called &quot;Peace and Music&quot; by a local sculptor from nearby Bloomingburg, Wayne C. Saward.

Attempts were made to prevent people from visiting the site. Its owners spread chicken manure, and during one anniversary, tractors and state police cars formed roadblocks. Twenty thousand people gathered at the site in 1989 during an impromptu 20th anniversary celebration. In 1997 a community group put up a welcoming sign for visitors. Unlike Bethel, the town of Woodstock made several efforts to capitalize on its connection. Bethel&#x27;s stance eventually changed and the town began to embrace the festival. Efforts were undertaken to forge a link between Bethel and Woodstock.

==Legacy==

===Woodstock site today===
The field and the stage area remain preserved and are open to visitors as part of the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts after being purchased in 1996 by cable television pioneer Alan Gerry for the purpose. The center opened on July 1, 2006, with a performance by the New York Philharmonic on a newly constructed pavilion stage located about SSE of the site of the 1969 stage. (The site of the original stage is vacant except for a commemorative plaque which was placed in 1984.) In June 2008 the Bethel Woods Center opened a museum dedicated to the experience and cultural significance of the Woodstock festival.

Notable events since the opening of the center have included an August 2006 performance by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and the scattering of Richie Havens&#x27;s ashes in August 2013.

In late 2016 New York&#x27;s State Historic Preservation Office applied to the National Park Service to have , including the site of the festival and adjacent areas used for campgrounds, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the site was listed on the register in February 2017.

===Woodstock 40th anniversary ===
There was worldwide media interest in the 40th anniversary of Woodstock in 2009. A number of activities to commemorate the festival took place around the world. On August 15, at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts overlooking the original site, the largest assembly of Woodstock performing alumni since the original 1969 festival performed in an eight-hour concert in front of a sold-out crowd. Hosted by Country Joe McDonald, the concert featured Big Brother and the Holding Company performing Janis Joplin&#x27;s hits (she actually appeared with the Kozmic Blues Band at Woodstock, although that band did feature former Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew), Canned Heat, Ten Years After, Jefferson Starship, Mountain and headliners the Levon Helm Band. At Woodstock, Levon Helm played drums and was one of the lead vocalists with the Band. Paul Kantner was the only member of the 1969 Jefferson Airplane lineup to appear with Jefferson Starship. Tom Constanten, who played keyboard with the Grateful Dead at Woodstock, joined Jefferson Starship on stage for several numbers. Jocko Marcellino from Sha Na Na also appeared, backed up by Canned Heat. Richie Havens, who opened the Woodstock festival in 1969, appeared at a separate event the previous night. Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash and Arlo Guthrie also marked the anniversary with live performances at Bethel earlier in August 2009.

Another event occurred in Hawkhurst, Kent (UK), at a Summer of Love party, with acts including two of the participants at the original Woodstock, Barry Melton of Country Joe and the Fish and Robin Williamson of the Incredible String Band, plus Santana and Grateful Dead cover bands. On August 14 and 15, 2009, a 40th anniversary tribute concert was held in Woodstock, Illinois, and was the only festival to receive the official blessing of the &quot;Father of Woodstock&quot;, Artie Kornfeld. Kornfeld later made an appearance in Woodstock with the event&#x27;s promoters.

Also in 2009, Michael Lang and Holly George-Warren published &quot;The Road to Woodstock&quot;, which describes Lang&#x27;s involvement in the creation of the Woodstock Music &amp; Arts Festival, and includes personal stories and quotes from central figures involved in the event.

===Woodstock 50th anniversary===

In May 2014, Michael Lang, one of the producers and organizers of the original Woodstock event, revealed plans for a possible 50th anniversary concert in 2019 and that he was exploring various locations. Reports in late 2018 confirmed the plans for a concurrent 50th anniversary event on the original site to be operated by the Bethel Woods Centre for the Arts. The scheduled date for the &quot;Bethel Woods Music and Culture Festival: Celebrating the golden anniversary at the historic site of the 1969 Woodstock festival&quot; was August 16–18, 2019. Bethel Woods described the festival as a &quot;pan-generational music, culture and community event&quot; (including some live performances and talks by) &quot;leading futurists and retro-tech experts&quot;.

Michael Lang told a reporter that he also had &quot;definite plans&quot; for a 50th anniversary concert that would &quot;hopefully encourage people to get involved with our lives on the planet&quot; with a goal of re-capturing the &quot;history and essence of what Woodstock was&quot;. On January 9, 2019, Lang announced that the official Woodstock 50th anniversary festival would take place on August 16–18, 2019 in Watkins Glen, New York.

On March 19, 2019, the proposed lineup for Woodstock 50 was announced. This included some artists who performed at the original Woodstock festival in 1969: John Fogerty (from Creedence Clearwater Revival), Carlos Santana (as Santana), David Crosby (from Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash), Melanie, John Sebastian, Country Joe McDonald, three Grateful Dead members (as Dead &amp; Company), Canned Heat, and Hot Tuna (containing members of Jefferson Airplane). The event was to take place at Watkins Glen International, the race track in Watkins Glen, New York, the site in 1973 for the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen which drew an estimated 600,000 people.

On April 29, 2019, it was announced that Woodstock 50 had been canceled by investors (Dentsu Aegis Network), who had lost faith in its preparations. The producers &quot;vehemently&quot; denied any cancellation, with Michael Lang telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; that investors have no such prerogative.
After a lawsuit with original financiers, the Woodstock 50 team then announced that it had received help from Oppenheimer &amp; Co. for financing so that the three-day event can continue to take place in August despite the original financiers pulling out. On July 31, 2019, NPR reported that the concert had finally been canceled. The Bethel Woods Center for the Arts did organize a weekend of &quot;low-key&quot; concerts.

===Local economic impact===
Woodstock still acts as an economic engine for the local economy. A Bethel Woods report from 2018 indicates that $560.82 million of spending has been generated in New York. With 2.9 million visitors since 2006 and 214,405 visitors in 2018, an equivalent of 172 full-time jobs exist as a result, which includes direct wages of $5.1 million from Bethel Woods in Sullivan County.

==In popular culture==
As one of the biggest music festivals of all time and a cultural touchstone for the late 1960s, Woodstock has been referenced in many different ways in popular culture. The phrase &quot;the Woodstock generation&quot; became part of the common lexicon. Tributes and parodies of the festival began almost as soon as the festival concluded. Cartoonist Charles Schulz named his recurring &quot;Peanuts&quot; bird character (which began appearing in 1966 but was still unnamed) Woodstock in tribute to the festival. In April 1970, &quot;Mad&quot; magazine published a poem by Frank Jacobs and illustrated by Sergio Aragonés titled &quot;I Remember, I Remember The Wondrous Woodstock Music Fair&quot; that parodies the traffic jams and the challenges of getting close enough to actually hear the music. Keith Robertson&#x27;s 1970 children&#x27;s book &quot;Henry Reed&#x27;s Big Show&quot; has the title character attempting to emulate the success of the festival by having his own concert at his uncle&#x27;s farm.

In 1973, the stage show &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Lemmings&quot; portrayed the &quot;Woodchuck&quot; festival, featuring parodies of many Woodstock performers.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;The Who at Woodstock – 1969&quot; to the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Music-Festival Moments&quot; list on March 18, 2010.

In 2005, Argentine writer Edgar Brau published &quot;Woodstock&quot;, a long poem commemorating the festival. An English translation of the poem was published in January 2007 by Words Without Borders.

In 2017, the singer Lana Del Rey released a song, &quot;Coachella – Woodstock in My Mind,&quot; to show her worries about the tensions between North Korea and the United States while she was at Coachella, expressing nostalgia by using the Woodstock festival as a symbol of peace.

In 2017, Portland rock band Portugal. The Man released album Woodstock, inspired by the lead singer John Gourley&#x27;s conversation with his dad about the Woodstock festival ticket stub.

In August 2019, the United States Postal Service released a Forever stamp commemorating Woodstock&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The stamp was designed by Antonio Alcalá, Art Director of the USPS and was first issued at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City on August 8, 2019. The museum was hosting &quot;Play it Loud&quot;, an exhibit co-organized with the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame consisting of vintage rock and roll instruments, posters, and costumes. Attending the ceremony were Woodstock producers Michael Lang and Joel Rosenman. The ceremony began with a &quot;stirring&quot; electric guitar performance of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; by &quot;Captain&quot; Kirk Douglas of the Roots—&quot;reminiscent&quot; of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s performance at the original festival.

In 2023, a South Korean organizer officially purchased Woodstock&#x27;s license and tried to hold a festival in Pocheon, but there was a lot of controversy because of insufficient preparation in the process of preparing for the festival, and it was eventually canceled.

<doc id="33889" wikidata="Q1244764" url="?curid=33889" title="Washtub bass">
<text>The washtub bass, or gutbucket, is a stringed instrument used in American folk music that uses a metal washtub as a resonator. Although it is possible for a washtub bass to have four or more strings and tuning pegs, traditional washtub basses have a single string whose pitch is adjusted by pushing or pulling on a staff or stick to change the tension.

The washtub bass was used in jug bands that were popular in some African American communities in the early 1900s. In the 1950s, British skiffle bands used a variant called a tea chest bass, and during the 1960s, US folk musicians used the washtub bass in jug band-influenced music.

Variations on the basic design are found around the world, particularly in the choice of resonator. As a result, there are many different names for the instrument including the &quot;gas-tank bass&quot;, &quot;barrel bass&quot;, &quot;box bass&quot; (Trinidad), &quot;bush bass&quot; (Australia), &quot;babatoni&quot; (South Africa), &quot;tanbou marengwen&quot; (Haiti) &quot;tingotalango&quot; (Cuba), &quot;tulòn&quot; (Italy), &quot;laundrophone&quot; and others.

The hallmarks of the traditional design are simplicity, very low cost and do it yourself construction, leading to its historical association with lower economic classes. These factors also make it quite common for modern-day builders to promote modifications to the basic design, such as adding a finger board, pedal, electronic pickup, drumhead, or making the staff immovable.

==History==

Ethnomusicologists trace the origins of the instrument to the &#x27;ground bow&#x27; or &#x27;ground harp&#x27; – a version that uses a piece of bark or an animal skin stretched over a pit as a resonator. The &quot;ang-bindi&quot; made by the Baka people of the Congo is but one example of this instrument found among tribal societies in Africa and Southeast Asia, and it lends its name to the generic term &quot;inbindi&quot; for all related instruments. Evolution of design, including the use of more portable resonators, has led to many variations, such as the &quot;dan bau&quot; (Vietnam) and &quot;gopichand&quot; (India), and more recently, the &quot;electric one-string&quot;, which amplifies the sound using a pickup.

The washtub bass is sometimes used in a jug band, often accompanied by a washboard as a percussion instrument. Jug bands, first known as &quot;spasm bands&quot;, were popular especially among African-Americans around 1900 in New Orleans and reached a height of popularity between 1925 and 1935 in Memphis and Louisville.

At about the same time, European-Americans of Appalachia were using the instrument in &quot;old-timey&quot; folk music. A musical style known as &quot;gut-bucket blues&quot; came out of the jug band scene, and was cited by Sam Phillips of Sun Records as the type of music he was seeking when he first recorded Elvis Presley.

According to Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith&#x27;s autobiography, the term &quot;gutbucket&quot; comes from &quot;Negro families&quot; who all owned their own pail, or bucket, and would get it filled with the makings for chitterlings. The term &quot;gutbucket&quot; came from playing a lowdown style of music.

In English skiffle bands, Australian and New Zealand bush bands and South African kwela bands, the same sort of bass has a tea chest as a resonator. The Quarrymen, John Lennon and Paul McCartney&#x27;s band before the Beatles, featured a tea-chest bass, as did many young bands around 1956.

A folk music revival in the U.S. in the early 1960s re-ignited interest in the washtub bass and jug band music. Bands included Mother McCree&#x27;s Uptown Jug Champions, which later became The Grateful Dead, and the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, which featured Fritz Richmond on bass.

==Tea chest bass==

A tea chest bass is a variation of the washtub bass that uses a tea chest as the resonator for an upright stringed bass. The instrument is made from a pole, traditionally a broomstick, placed into or alongside the chest. One or more strings are stretched along the pole and plucked.

In Europe, particularly Britain and Germany, the instrument is associated with skiffle bands.

In Australia it was traditionally used to provide deep sounds for &quot;bush bands&quot;, though most such groups today use electric bass or double bass. It is also known as bush bass or Tbox in Australia, and was used by the Northern Territory group the Mills Sisters.

==Other variations==

Other variations on the basic design are found around the world, particularly in the choice of resonator, for example:
* &quot;gas-tank bass&quot;
* &quot;barrel bass&quot;
* &quot;box bass&quot; (Trinidad)
* &quot;bush bass&quot; (Australia)
* &quot;babatoni&quot; (South Africa)
* &quot;dumdum&quot; (Zimbabwe)
* &quot;dan bau&quot; (Vietnam)
* &quot;sanduku&quot; (Zanzibar)
* &quot;tanbou marengwen, in English, mosquito drum&quot; (Haiti)
* &quot;tingotalango&quot; (Cuba)
* &quot;tulòn&quot; (Italy)

==Notable players==

* Will Shade, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist member of the Memphis Jug Band who recorded from the 1920s until his death in 1966.
* Kansas Joe McCoy, washtub bass player and multi-instrumentalist, recorded with Arthur Crudup in 1941.
* Fritz Richmond (19392005) has performed on numerous recordings from America and Japan. One of his washtub basses is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.
* Donald Kachamba and Moya Aliya, one-string box players with the influential Malawi group Kachamba Brothers Band. Can be heard on &quot;Donald Kachamba&#x27;s Kwela Band&quot;, and &quot;Malawi / Concert Kwela&quot;.
* Brian Ritchie, of the band The Violent Femmes, plays a &#x27;tubless electric washtub bass&#x27;.
* Les Claypool, of Primus, often plays a variation called a whamola, as can be heard on the opening theme of the tenth season of &quot;South Park&quot;.
* Bill Smith, Len Garry, Ivan Vaughan, and Nigel Walley, tea-chest bass players of The Quarrymen.
* John Sanford, a.k.a. Redd Foxx, got his start in show business as washtub bass player for the &quot;Bon Bons&quot;. In the &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; episode &quot;Sanford and Gong&quot; (aired December 17, 1976), Sanford and Don &quot;Bubba&quot; Bexley audition for &quot;The Gong Show&quot; with Bubba on washtub bass.
* Emmett Otter, a Muppet voiced by Jerry Nelson in Emmett Otter&#x27;s Jug Band Christmas, puts a hole in his mother&#x27;s washtub in order to make a washtub bass. He later performs with it in a talent show. 
* Bob Weir and Mike Garbett played washtub bass on the eponymous album Mother McCree&#x27;s Uptown Jug Champions – a forerunner band to Grateful Dead.
* Stu Cook, the bassist of Creedence Clearwater Revival, played washtub bass on the track &quot;Poorboy Shuffle&quot; from the album &quot;Willy and the Poor Boys&quot;. He faked playing the instrument to a recording of &quot;Down on the Corner&quot; on the ABC-TV variety show &quot;Music Scene&quot;, December 1, 1969.
* Lionel Kilberg (1930–2008), promoter and player of the &#x27;Brownie Bass&#x27; with &#x27;The Shanty Boys&#x27; during the folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s in New York, and producer/lyricist/player of the 1973 album &quot;We Walked by the Water&quot; featuring Kate Wolf.
* That 1 Guy plays a variation of the washtub bass called the &#x27;Magic Pipe&#x27; and a few other self-built instruments.
* Geoff Bell played the washtub bass for folk punk group Days N&#x27; Daze.

<text>A Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component. The primary benefit of the circuit is its ability to provide extremely accurate measurements (in contrast with something like a simple voltage divider). Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer.

The Wheatstone bridge was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie (sometimes spelled &quot;Christy&quot;) in 1833 and improved and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843. One of the Wheatstone bridge&#x27;s initial uses was for soil analysis and comparison.

== Operation ==
In the figure, is the fixed, yet unknown, resistance to be measured.
, , and are resistors of known resistance and the resistance of is adjustable. The resistance is adjusted until the bridge is &quot;balanced&quot; and no current flows through the galvanometer . At this point, the potential difference between the two midpoints (B and D) will be zero. Therefore the ratio of the two resistances in the known leg is equal to the ratio of the two resistances in the unknown leg . If the bridge is unbalanced, the direction of the current indicates whether is too high or too low.

At the point of balance,
: formula_1

Detecting zero current with a galvanometer can be done to extremely high precision. Therefore, if , , and are known to high precision, then can be measured to high precision. Very small changes in disrupt the balance and are readily detected.

Alternatively, if , , and are known, but is not adjustable, the voltage difference across or current flow through the meter can be used to calculate the value of , using Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws. This setup is frequently used in strain gauge and resistance thermometer measurements, as it is usually faster to read a voltage level off a meter than to adjust a resistance to zero the voltage.

== Derivation ==
=== Quick derivation at balance ===
At the point of balance, both the voltage and the current between the two midpoints (B and D) are zero. Therefore, , , .

Because of , then and .

Dividing the last two equations by members and using the above currents equalities, then

=== Alternative Derivation at Balance using Voltage Divider Expressions ===
ADB and ABC form two voltage dividers, with formula_3 equal to the difference in output voltages. Thus

First, Kirchhoff&#x27;s first law is used to find the currents in junctions B and D:
: formula_5

Then, Kirchhoff&#x27;s second law is used for finding the voltage in the loops ABDA and BCDB:
: formula_6

When the bridge is balanced, then , so the second set of equations can be rewritten as:
: formula_7

Then, equation (1) is divided by equation (2) and the resulting equation is rearranged, giving:
: formula_8

Due to and being proportional from Kirchhoff&#x27;s First Law, cancels out of the above equation. The desired value of is now known to be given as:
: formula_8

On the other hand, if the resistance of the galvanometer is high enough that is negligible, it is possible to compute from the three other resistor values and the supply voltage (), or the supply voltage from all four resistor values. To do so, one has to work out the voltage from each potential divider and subtract one from the other. The equations for this are:
: formula_10
where is the voltage of node D relative to node B.

== Significance ==
The Wheatstone bridge illustrates the concept of a difference measurement, which can be extremely accurate. Variations on the Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure capacitance, inductance, impedance and other quantities, such as the amount of combustible gases in a sample, with an explosimeter. The Kelvin bridge was specially adapted from the Wheatstone bridge for measuring very low resistances. In many cases, the significance of measuring the unknown resistance is related to measuring the impact of some physical phenomenon (such as force, temperature, pressure, etc.) which thereby allows the use of Wheatstone bridge in measuring those elements indirectly.

The concept was extended to alternating current measurements by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865 and further improved as by Alan Blumlein in British Patent no. 323,037, 1928.

== Modifications of the basic bridge ==

The Wheatstone bridge is the fundamental bridge, but there are other modifications that can be made to measure various kinds of resistances when the fundamental Wheatstone bridge is not suitable. Some of the modifications are:
* Carey Foster bridge, for measuring small resistances
* Kelvin bridge, for measuring small four-terminal resistances
* Maxwell bridge, and Wien bridge for measuring reactive components
* Anderson&#x27;s bridge, for measuring the self-inductance of the circuit, an advanced form of Maxwell&#x27;s bridge

<text>Worms (; ) is a city in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, situated on the Upper Rhine about south-southwest of Frankfurt am Main. It had about 84,646 inhabitants .

A pre-Roman foundation, Worms is one of the oldest cities in northern Europe. It was the capital of the Kingdom of the Burgundians in the early fifth century, hence is the scene of the medieval legends referring to this period, notably the first part of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;.

Worms has been a Roman Catholic bishopric since at least 614, and was an important palatinate of Charlemagne. Worms Cathedral is one of the imperial cathedrals and among the finest examples of Romanesque architecture in Germany. Worms prospered in the High Middle Ages as an imperial free city. Among more than a hundred imperial diets held at Worms, the Diet of 1521 (commonly known as &quot;the&quot; Diet of Worms) ended with the Edict of Worms, in which Martin Luther was declared a heretic. Worms is also one of the historical ShUM-cities as a cultural center of Jewish life in Europe during the Middle Ages. Its Jewish sites (along with those in Speyer and Mainz) were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021.

Today, the city is an industrial centre and is famed as the origin of &quot;Liebfraumilch&quot; wine. Its other industries include chemicals, metal goods, and fodder.

==Name==

Worms&#x27; name is of Celtic origin: &quot;Borbetomagus&quot; meant &quot;settlement in a watery area&quot;. This was eventually transformed into the Latin name &quot;Vormatia&quot;, in use since the 6th century, which was preserved in the Medieval Hebrew form &quot;Vermayza&quot; (ורמייזא) and the contemporary Polish form &quot;Wormacja&quot;. It is pronounced in English as &quot;vorms&quot;.

According to a legend printed in the 17th century in the book &quot;Ma&#x27;aseh Nisim&quot; by Juspa Schammes, the origin of the city&#x27;s name is attributed to the mythical creature lint-wurm. This creature, resembling a snake and a worm, arrived in the city of Germisa and terrorized its inhabitants. Every day, the people held a lottery to determine which of them would be sacrificed to the lint-wurm in order to spare the city from destruction. Eventually, the lot fell on the queen. One of the city&#x27;s heroes refused to allow her to sacrifice herself and offered to replace her on the condition that if he survived, she would marry him. The queen agreed, and he donned iron armor. After the lint-wurm swallowed him, he cut his way out from the inside and killed it. He married the queen, became king, and renamed the city to Worms to commemorate this tale.

==Geography==
Worms is located on the west bank of the River Rhine between the cities of Ludwigshafen and Mainz. On the northern edge of the city, the Pfrimm flows into the Rhine, and on the southern edge, the Eisbach flows into the Rhine.

===Boroughs===
Worms has 13 boroughs (or &quot;quarters&quot;) around the city centre. They are:

===Climate===
The climate in the Rhine Valley is cool in winter and very warm in summer. Rainfall is below average for the surrounding areas. Winter snow accumulation is low and often melts quickly.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Worms was in ancient times a Celtic city named &quot;Borbetomagus&quot;, perhaps meaning &quot;water meadow&quot;. Later it was conquered by the Germanic Vangiones tribe. In 14 BC, Romans under the command of Drusus captured and fortified the city, and from that time onwards, a small troop of infantry and cavalry was garrisoned there. The Romans renamed the city as &quot;Augusta Vangionum&quot;, after the then-emperor and the local tribe. The name does not seem to have taken hold, however, and from &quot;Borbetomagus&quot; developed the German &quot;Worms&quot; and Latin &quot;Wormatia&quot;; as late as the modern period, the city name was written as &quot;Wormbs&quot;. The garrison grew into a small town with a regular Roman street plan, a forum, and temples for the main gods Jupiter, Juno, Minerva (whose temple was the site of the later cathedral), and Mars.

Roman inscriptions, altars, and votive offerings can be seen in the archaeological museum, along with one of Europe&#x27;s largest collections of Roman glass. Local potters worked in the town&#x27;s south quarter. Fragments of &quot;amphorae&quot; contain traces of olive oil from Hispania Baetica, doubtless transported by sea and then up the Rhine by ship.

During the disorders of 411–413 AD, Roman usurper Jovinus established himself in Borbetomagus as a puppet-emperor with the help of King Gunther of the Burgundians, who had settled in the area between the Rhine and Moselle some years before. The city became the capital of the Burgundian kingdom under Gunther (also known as Gundicar). Few remains of this early Burgundian kingdom survive, because in 436, it was all but destroyed by a combined army of Romans (led by Aëtius) and Huns (led by Attila); a belt clasp found at Worms-Abenheim is a museum treasure. Provoked by Burgundian raids against Roman settlements, the combined Romano-Hunnic army destroyed the Burgundian army at the Battle of Worms (436), killing King Gunther. About 20,000 are said to have been killed. The Romans led the survivors southwards to the Roman district of Sapaudia (modern-day Savoy). The story of this war later inspired the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. The city appears on the Peutinger Map, dated to the fourth century.

===Middle Ages===

The bishopric of Worms existed by at least 614. In the Frankish Empire, the city was the location of an important palace of Charlemagne. The bishops administered the city and its territory. The most famous of the early medieval bishops was Burchard of Worms. In 868, an important synod was held in Worms. Around 900, the circuit wall was rebuilt according to the wall-building ordinance of Bishop Thietlach.

Worms prospered in the High Middle Ages. Having received far-reaching privileges from King Henry IV as early as 1074, the city became an imperial free city. The bishops resided at Ladenburg and only had jurisdiction over Worms Cathedral itself. In 1122, the Concordat of Worms was signed; the 1495 imperial diet met here and made an attempt at reforming the disintegrating Imperial Circle Estates by the Imperial Reform. Most important, among more than 100 imperial diets held at Worms, that of 1521 (commonly known as &quot;the&quot; Diet of Worms) ended with the Edict of Worms, in which Martin Luther was declared a heretic after refusing to recant his religious beliefs. Worms was also the birthplace of the first Bibles of the Reformation, both Martin Luther&#x27;s German Bible and William Tyndale&#x27;s first complete English New Testament by 1526.

===Modern era===

In 1689 during the Nine Years&#x27; War, Worms (like the nearby towns and cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Oppenheim, Speyer, and Bingen) was sacked by troops of Louis XIV of France, though the French only held the city for a few weeks. In 1743, the Treaty of Worms was signed, forming a political alliance between Great Britain, Austria, and the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1792, the city was occupied by troops of the First French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Bishopric of Worms was secularized in 1801, with the city being annexed into the First French Empire. In 1815, Worms passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse in accordance with the Congress of Vienna, and the city was subsequently administered within Rhenish Hesse.

After the Battle of the Bulge in early 1945, Allied armies advanced into the Rhineland in preparation for a massive assault into the heart of the Reich. Worms was a German strongpoint on the west bank of the Rhine, and the forces there resisted the Allied advance tenaciously. Worms was, thus, heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces in two attacks on February 21 and March 18, 1945, respectively. A postwar survey estimated that 39% of the town&#x27;s developed area was destroyed. The RAF attack on Feb. 21 was aimed at the main railway station on the edge of the inner city, and at chemical plants southwest of the inner city, but also destroyed large areas of the city centre. Carried out by 334 bombers, the attack in a few minutes rained 1,100 tons of bombs on the inner city, and Worms Cathedral was among the buildings set on fire. The Americans did not enter the city until the Rhine crossings began after the seizure of the Remagen Bridge.

In the attacks, 239 inhabitants were killed in the first and 141 in the second; 35,000 (60% of the population of 58,000) were made homeless. In all, 6,490 buildings were severely damaged or destroyed. After the war, the inner city was rebuilt, mostly in modern style. Around a third of Worms&#x27;s buildings is from before 1950. Postwar Worms became part of the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate; the borough Rosengarten, on the east bank of the Rhine, was lost to Hesse.

Worms today fiercely vies with the cities Trier and Cologne for the title of &quot;Oldest City in Germany&quot;. A multimedia &quot;Nibelungenmuseum&quot; was opened in 2001, and a yearly festival in front of the &quot;Dom&quot;, the Worms Cathedral, attempts to recapture the atmosphere of the pre-Christian period.

In 2010, the Worms synagogue was firebombed. Eight corners of the building were set ablaze, and a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a window, but with no injuries. Kurt Beck, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate, condemned the attack and vowed to mobilize all necessary resources to find the perpetrators, saying, &quot;We will not tolerate such an attack on a synagogue&quot;.

== The Jewish community of &quot;Varmayza&quot; ==
The Free Imperial City of Worms, known in medieval Hebrew by the name &quot;Varmayza&quot; or &quot;Vermaysa&quot; (Hebrew: וורמיזא, וורמישא), was a centre of medieval Ashkenazic Jewry. The Jewish community was established there in the late 10th century, and Worms&#x27;s first synagogue was erected in 1034. In 1096, 800 to 1000 Jews were murdered by crusaders and the local mob, what later became known as Rhineland massacres or &quot;Gzerot Tatnó&quot; (Hebrew: גזרות תתנ&quot;ו, &quot;Edicts of 4856&quot;). The Jewish Cemetery in Worms, dating from the 11th century, is believed to be the oldest surviving &quot;in situ&quot; cemetery in Europe. The Rashi Synagogue, which dates from 1175 and was carefully reconstructed after its desecration on &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, is the oldest in Germany.

Prominent students, rabbis, and scholars of Worms include Shlomo Yitzhaki (Rashi) who studied with R. Yizhak Halevi, Meir of Rothenburg (Maharam), Elazar Rokeach, Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin (Maharil), and Yair Bacharach. At the rabbinical synod held at Worms at the turn of the 11th century, Rabbi Gershom ben Judah (Rabbeinu Gershom) explicitly prohibited polygamy for the first time. The community&#x27;s customs were collected and written by Juspa Schammes in a &quot;Minhagbuch (book of customs)&quot; and preserve ancient traditions unique to the community.

The Jewish community was destroyed and expelled from the city several times. The main expulsions were both in 1615 after the city&#x27;s residents committed a pogrom against the Jewish community and in 1689 during the Nine Years&#x27; War by troops of Louis XIV of France (with all the city&#x27;s citizens), After a few years, the Jews were allowed to return to live in the city. Despite this, For hundreds of years, until &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938, the Jewish Quarter of Worms was a centre of Jewish life. It was among the oldest Jewish communities that maintained continuity over time, and a beautiful example of this is the 900th anniversary celebrations of the synagogue held in 1934.

Worms today has only a very small Jewish population, and a recognizable Jewish community as such no longer exists. After renovations in the 1970s and 1980s, though, many of the buildings of the quarter can be seen in a close-to-original state, preserved as an outdoor museum. The Jewish sites (along with those in Speyer and Mainz) were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021.

<text>A website (also written as a web site) is one or more web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social media. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. The most-visited sites are Google, YouTube, and Facebook.

All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company&#x27;s internal website for its employees. Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a web browser.

==Background==
The World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1989 by the British CERN computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone, contributing to the immense growth of the Web. Before the introduction of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offer a simple directory structure in which the user navigates and where they choose files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting or were encoded in word processor formats.

==History==
While &quot;web site&quot; was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized &quot;Web site&quot;, since &quot;Web&quot; is a proper noun when referring to the World Wide Web), this variant has become rarely used, and &quot;website&quot; has become the standard spelling. All major style guides, such as &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; and the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;, have reflected this change.

In February 2009, Netcraft, an Internet monitoring company that has tracked Web growth since 1995, reported that there were 215,675,903 websites with domain names and content on them in 2009, compared to just 19,732 websites in August 1995. After reaching 1 billion websites in September 2014, a milestone confirmed by Netcraft in its October 2014 Web Server Survey and that Internet Live Stats was the first to announce—as attested by this tweet from the inventor of the World Wide Web himself, Tim Berners-Lee—the number of websites in the world have subsequently declined, reverting to a level below 1 billion. This is due to the monthly fluctuations in the count of inactive websites. The number of websites continued growing to over 1 billion by March 2016 and has continued growing since. Netcraft Web Server Survey in January 2020 reported that there are 1,295,973,827 websites and in April 2021 reported that there are 1,212,139,815 sites across 10,939,637 web-facing computers, and 264,469,666 unique domains. An estimated 85 percent of all websites are inactive.

==Static website==

A static website is one that has Web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client Web browser. It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML); Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML. Images are commonly used to create the desired appearance and as part of the main content. Audio or video might also be considered &quot;static&quot; content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive. This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time. Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos, and other content and may require basic website design skills and software. Simple forms or marketing examples of websites, such as a &quot;classic website&quot;, a &quot;five-page website&quot; or a &quot;brochure website&quot; are often static websites, because they present pre-defined, static information to the user. This may include information about a company and its products and services through text, photos, animations, audio/video, and navigation menus.

Static websites may still use server side includes (SSI) as an editing convenience, such as sharing a common menu bar across many pages. As the site&#x27;s behavior &quot;to the reader&quot; is still static, this is not considered a dynamic site.

==Dynamic website==
A dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically. Server-side dynamic pages are generated &quot;on the fly&quot; by computer code that produces the HTML (CSS are responsible for appearance and thus, are static files). There are a wide range of software systems, such as CGI, Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP), Active Server Pages and ColdFusion (CFML) that are available to generate dynamic Web systems and dynamic sites. Various Web application frameworks and Web template systems are available for general-use programming languages like Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby to make it faster and easier to create complex dynamic websites.

A site can display the current state of a dialogue between users, monitor a changing situation, or provide information in some way personalized to the requirements of the individual user. For example, when the front page of a news site is requested, the code running on the webserver might combine stored HTML fragments with news stories retrieved from a database or another website via RSS to produce a page that includes the latest information. Dynamic sites can be interactive by using HTML forms, storing and reading back browser cookies, or by creating a series of pages that reflect the previous history of clicks. Another example of dynamic content is when a retail website with a database of media products allows a user to input a search request, e.g. for the keyword Beatles. In response, the content of the Web page will spontaneously change the way it looked before, and will then display a list of Beatles products like CDs, DVDs, and books. Dynamic HTML uses JavaScript code to instruct the Web browser how to interactively modify the page contents. One way to simulate a certain type of dynamic website while avoiding the performance loss of initiating the dynamic engine on a per-user or per-connection basis is to periodically automatically regenerate a large series of static pages.

==Multimedia and interactive content==
Early websites had only text, and soon after, images. Web browser plug-ins were then used to add audio, video, and interactivity (such as for a rich Web application that mirrors the complexity of a desktop application like a word processor). Examples of such plug-ins are Microsoft Silverlight, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Shockwave Player, and Java SE. HTML 5 includes provisions for audio and video without plugins. JavaScript is also built into most modern web browsers, and allows for website creators to send code to the web browser that instructs it how to interactively modify page content and communicate with the web server if needed. The browser&#x27;s internal representation of the content is known as the Document Object Model (DOM).

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a modern JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics without the use of plug-ins. It allows interactive content such as 3D animations, visualizations and video explainers to presented users in the most intuitive way.

A 2010-era trend in websites called &quot;responsive design&quot; has given the best viewing experience as it provides a device-based layout for users. These websites change their layout according to the device or mobile platform, thus giving a rich user experience.

==Types==
Websites can be divided into two broad categories—static and interactive. Interactive sites are part of the Web 2.0 community of sites and allow for interactivity between the site owner and site visitors or users. Static sites serve or capture information but do not allow engagement with the audience or users directly. Some websites are informational or produced by enthusiasts or for personal use or entertainment. Many websites do aim to make money using one or more business models, including:

* Posting interesting content and selling contextual advertising either through direct sales or through an advertising network.
* E-commerce: products or services are purchased directly through the website
* Advertising products or services available at a brick-and-mortar business
* Freemium: basic content is available for free, but premium content requires a payment (e.g., WordPress website, it is an open-source platform to build a blog or website).
* Some websites require user registration or subscription to access the content. Examples of subscription websites include many business sites, news websites, academic journal websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, message boards, Web-based email, social networking websites, websites providing real-time stock market data, as well as sites providing various other services.

<doc id="33900" wikidata="Q294147" url="?curid=33900" title="William Bligh">
<text>Vice-Admiral William Bligh (9 September 1754 – 7 December 1817) was a British officer in the Royal Navy and a colonial administrator. He is best known for the mutiny on HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;, which occurred in 1789 when the ship was under his command. The reasons behind the mutiny continue to be debated. After being set adrift in &quot;Bounty&quot;″s launch by the mutineers, Bligh and those loyal to him stopped for supplies on Tofua, losing a man to natives. Bligh and his men reached Timor alive, after a journey of .

On 13 August 1806, Bligh was appointed Governor of New South Wales in Australia, with orders to clean up the corrupt rum trade of the New South Wales Corps. His actions directed against the trade resulted in the so-called Rum Rebellion, during which Bligh was placed under arrest on 26 January 1808 by the New South Wales Corps and deposed from his command, an act which the British Foreign Office later declared to be illegal. He died in London on 7 December 1817.

==Early life==
Bligh was born on 9 September 1754, but it is not clear where. It is likely that he was born in Plymouth, Devon, as he was baptised at St Andrew&#x27;s Church on Royal Parade in Plymouth on 4 October 1754, where Bligh&#x27;s father, Francis, was serving as a customs officer. Bligh&#x27;s ancestral home of Tinten Manor in St Tudy, near Bodmin, Cornwall, is also a possibility. Bligh&#x27;s mother, Jane Pearce (née Balsam), was a widow who married Francis at the age of 40.

Bligh was signed for the Royal Navy at age seven, at a time when it was common to sign on a &quot;young gentleman&quot; simply to gain, or at least record, the experience at sea required for a commission. In 1770, at age 16, he joined HMS &quot;Hunter&quot; as an able seaman, the term used because there was no vacancy for a midshipman. He became a midshipman early in the following year. In September 1771, Bligh was transferred to and remained on the ship for three years.
In 1776, Bligh was selected by Captain James Cook, for the position of sailing master of and accompanied Cook in July 1776 on Cook&#x27;s third voyage to the Pacific Ocean, during which Cook was killed and was succeeded by Captain Charles Clerke, who was dying from tuberculosis. Due to his weakened state, Clerke placed Bligh in charge as navigator of the expedition and attempted to explore the Northwest Passage for a second time. Following Cook&#x27;s and Clerke&#x27;s deaths, Bligh played a significant role in navigating the beleaguered expedition back to England in August 1780. He was also able to supply details of Cook&#x27;s last voyage following the return.

Bligh married Elizabeth Betham, daughter of a customs collector (stationed in Douglas, Isle of Man), on 4 February 1781. The wedding took place at nearby Onchan. The couple had eight children together: six daughters and twin sons (the boys died in infancy). The couple remained married until Elizabeth&#x27;s death on 15 April 1812. A few days after the wedding, Bligh was appointed to serve on HMS &quot;Belle Poule&quot; as master (senior warrant officer responsible for navigation). Soon after this, in August 1781, he fought in the Battle of Dogger Bank under Admiral Parker, which won him his commission as a lieutenant. For the next 18 months, he was a lieutenant on various ships. He also fought with Lord Howe at Gibraltar in 1782.

Between 1783 and 1787, Bligh was a captain in the Merchant Service. Like many lieutenants, he would have found full-pay employment in the Navy; however, commissions were hard to obtain with the fleet largely demobilised at the end of the War with France, during which that country was allied with the North American rebelling colonies in the War of American Independence (1775–1783). In 1787, Bligh was selected as commander of His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Transport &quot;Bounty&quot;. He rose eventually to the rank of vice admiral in the Royal Navy.

==Naval career==
William Bligh&#x27;s naval career involved various appointments and assignments. He first rose to prominence as Master of &quot;Resolution&quot;, under the command of Captain James Cook. Bligh received praise from Cook during what would be the latter&#x27;s final voyage. Bligh served on three of the same ships on which Fletcher Christian also served simultaneously in his naval career.
In the early 1780s, while in the merchant service, Bligh became acquainted with a young man named Fletcher Christian (1764–1793), who was eager to learn navigation from him. Bligh took Christian under his wing, and the two became friends.

==Voyage of &quot;Bounty&quot;==
The mutiny on the Royal Navy vessel HMAV &quot;Bounty&quot; occurred in the South Pacific Ocean on 28 April 1789. Led by Master&#x27;s Mate / Acting Lieutenant Fletcher Christian, disaffected crewmen seized control of the ship, and set the then Lieutenant Bligh, who was the ship&#x27;s captain, and 18 loyalists adrift in the ship&#x27;s open launch. The mutineers variously settled on Tahiti or on Pitcairn Island. Meanwhile, Bligh completed a voyage of more than to the west in the launch to reach safety north of Australia in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) and began the process of bringing the mutineers to justice.

===First breadfruit voyage===
In 1787, Lieutenant Bligh, as he then was, took command of HMAV &quot;Bounty.&quot; In order to win a premium offered by the Royal Society, he first sailed to Tahiti to obtain breadfruit trees, then set course east across the South Pacific for South America and the Cape Horn and eventually to the Caribbean Sea, where breadfruit was wanted for experiments to see whether it would be a successful food crop for enslaved Africans on British colonial plantations in the West Indies islands. According to one modern researcher, the notion that breadfruit had to be collected from Tahiti was intentionally misleading. Tahiti was merely one of many places where the esteemed seedless breadfruit could be found. The real reason for choosing Tahiti has its roots in the territorial contention that existed then between France and Great Britain at the time. &quot;Bounty&quot; never reached the Caribbean, as mutiny broke out on board shortly after the ship left Tahiti.

The voyage to Tahiti was difficult. After trying unsuccessfully for a month to go west by rounding South America and Cape Horn, &quot;Bounty&quot; was finally defeated by the notoriously stormy weather and opposite winds and forced to take the longer way to the east around the southern tip of Africa (Cape of Good Hope and Cape Agulhas). That delay caused a further delay in Tahiti, as Bligh had to wait five months for the breadfruit plants to mature sufficiently to be potted in soil and transported. &quot;Bounty&quot; departed Tahiti heading west in April 1789.

===Mutiny===

Because the vessel was rated only as a cutter, &quot;Bounty&quot; had no commissioned officers other than Bligh (who was then only a lieutenant), a very small crew, and no Royal Marines to provide protection from hostile natives during stops or to enforce security on board ship. To allow longer uninterrupted sleep, Bligh divided his crew into three watches instead of two, placing his &quot;protégé&quot; Fletcher Christian—rated as a Master&#x27;s Mate—in charge of one of the watches. The mutiny, which took place on 28 April 1789 during the return voyage, was led by Christian and supported by eighteen of the crew. They had seized firearms during Christian&#x27;s night watch and surprised and bound Bligh in his cabin.

 Despite being in the majority, none of the loyalists put up a significant struggle once they saw Bligh bound, and the ship was taken over without bloodshed. The mutineers provided Bligh and eighteen loyal crewmen a launch (so heavily loaded that the gunwales were only a few inches above the water). They were allowed four cutlasses, food and water for perhaps a week, a quadrant and a compass, but no charts, or marine chronometer. The gunner, William Peckover, brought his pocket watch, which was used to regulate time. Most of these instruments were obtained by the clerk, Mr Samuel, who acted with great calm and resolution, despite threats from the mutineers. The launch could not hold all the loyal crew members, so four were detained on &quot;Bounty&quot; for their useful skills; they were later released in Tahiti.

Tahiti was upwind from Bligh&#x27;s initial position, and was the obvious destination of the mutineers. Many of the loyalists claimed to have heard the mutineers cry &quot;Huzzah for Otaheite!&quot; as &quot;Bounty&quot; pulled away. Timor was the nearest European colonial outpost in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), away. Bligh and his crew first made for Tofua, only a few leagues distant, to obtain supplies. However, they were attacked by hostile natives and John Norton, a quartermaster, was killed. Fleeing from Tofua, Bligh did not dare to stop at the next islands to the west (the Fiji islands), as he had only a pair of cutlasses for defence and expected hostile receptions. He did however keep a log entitled &quot;Log of the Proceedings of His Majesty&#x27;s Ship Bounty Lieut. Wm Bligh Commander from Otaheite towards Jamaica&quot; which he used to record events from 5 April 1789 to 13 March 1790. He also made use of a small notebook to sketch a rough map of his discoveries.

Bligh had confidence in his navigational skills, which he had perfected under the instruction of Captain James Cook. His first responsibility was to bring his men to safety. Thus, he undertook the seemingly impossible voyage to Timor, the nearest European settlement. Bligh succeeded in reaching Timor after a 47-day voyage, the only casualty being the crewman killed on Tofua. From 4 May until 29 May, when they reached the Great Barrier Reef north of Australia, the 18 men lived on of bread per day. The weather was often stormy, and they were in constant fear of foundering due to the boat&#x27;s heavily laden condition. On 29 May they landed on a small island off the coast of Australia, which they named Restoration Island, 29 May 1660 being the date of the restoration of the English monarchy after the English Civil War. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered. Fryer later said Bligh &quot;was as tyrannical in his temper in the boat as in the ship.&quot; Over the next week or more they island-hopped north along the Great Barrier reef—while Bligh, cartographer as always, sketched maps of the coast. Early in June they passed through the Endeavour Strait and sailed again on the open sea until they reached Coupang, a settlement on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Despite the hardships he and his men had endured, upon reaching Kupang Bligh maintained his stubborn adherence to Navy protocol, insisting that a makeshift Union Jack be made up and hoisted and that Fryer remain aboard the launch to guard her. Three of the men who survived this arduous voyage with him were so weak that they soon died of sickness, possibly malaria, in the pestilential Dutch East Indies port of Batavia, the present-day Indonesian capital of Jakarta, as they waited for transport to Britain. Two others died on the way to England.

===Possible causes of the mutiny===
The reasons behind the mutiny are still debated; some sources report that Bligh was a tyrant whose abuse of the crew led them to feel that they had no choice but to take over the ship. Other sources argue that Bligh was no worse (and in many cases gentler) than the average captain and naval officer of the era. They also argue that the crew—inexperienced and unused to the rigours of the sea—were corrupted by the freedom, idleness and sexual licence of their five months in Tahiti, finding themselves unwilling to return to the &quot;Jack Tar&#x27;s&quot; life of an ordinary seaman. This view holds that most of the men supported Christian&#x27;s prideful personal vendetta against Bligh out of a misguided hope that their new captain would return them to Tahiti to live their lives &quot;hedonistically&quot; and in peace, free from Bligh&#x27;s acid tongue and strict discipline.

The mutiny is made more mysterious by the friendship of Christian and Bligh, which dates back to Bligh&#x27;s days in the merchant service. Christian was well acquainted with the Bligh family. As Bligh was being set adrift, he appealed to this friendship, saying &quot;you have dandled my children upon your knee&quot;. According to Bligh, Christian &quot;appeared disturbed&quot; and replied, &quot;That,—Captain Bligh,—that is the thing;—I am in hell—I am in hell&quot;.

&quot;Bounty&quot;″s log shows that Bligh was relatively sparing in his punishments. He scolded when other captains would have whipped, and whipped when other captains would have hanged. He was an educated man, deeply interested in science, convinced that good diet and sanitation were necessary for the welfare of his crew. He took a great interest in his crew&#x27;s exercise, was very careful about the quality of their food and insisted upon the &quot;Bounty&quot; being kept very clean. The modern historian John Beaglehole has described the major flaw in this otherwise enlightened naval officer: &quot;[Bligh made] dogmatic judgements which he felt himself entitled to make; he saw fools about him too easily … thin-skinned vanity was his curse through life … [Bligh] never learnt that you do not make friends of men by insulting them.&quot; Bligh was also capable of holding intense grudges against those he thought had betrayed him, such as Midshipman Peter Heywood and ship&#x27;s gunner William Peckover; in regard to Heywood, Bligh was convinced that the young man was as guilty as Christian. Bligh&#x27;s first detailed comments on the mutiny are in a letter to his wife Betsy, in which he names Heywood (a mere boy not yet 16) as &quot;one of the ringleaders&quot;, adding: &quot;I have now reason to curse the day I ever knew a Christian or a Heywood or indeed a Manks man.&quot; Bligh&#x27;s later official account to the Admiralty lists Heywood with Christian, Edward Young and George Stewart as the mutiny&#x27;s leaders, describing Heywood as a young man of abilities for whom he had felt a particular regard. To the Heywood family, Bligh wrote: &quot;His baseness is beyond all description.&quot; Peckover applied for a position as gunner on HMS &quot;Providence&quot; (the second breadfruit expedition to Tahiti) but was refused by Bligh. In a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, dated 17 July 1791 (two weeks before departure), Bligh wrote:

Should Peckover my late Gunner ever trouble you to render him further services I shall esteem it a favour if you will tell him I informed you he was a vicious and worthless fellow—He applied to me to render him service &amp; wanted to be appointed Gunner of the Providence but as I had determined never to suffer an officer who was with me in the &quot;Bounty&quot; to sail with again, it was for the cause I did not apply for him.

Bligh&#x27;s refusal to appoint Peckover was partly due to Edward Christian&#x27;s polemic testimony against Bligh in an effort to clear his brother&#x27;s name. Christian states in his appendix:

In the evidence of Mr. Peckover and Mr. Fryer, it is proved that Mr. Nelson the botanist said, upon hearing the commencement of the mutiny, &quot;We know whose fault this is, or who is to blame, Mr. Fryer, what have we brought upon ourselves?&quot; In addition to this, it ought to be known that Mr. Nelson, in conversation afterwards with an officer (Peckover) at Timor, who was speaking of returning with Captain Bligh if he got another ship, observed, &quot;I am surprized that you should think of going a second time with [Bligh] (using a term of abuse) who has been the cause of all our losses.&quot;

Popular fiction often confuses Bligh with Edward Edwards of , who was sent on the Royal Navy&#x27;s expedition to the South Pacific to find the mutineers and bring them to trial. Edwards is often made out to be the cruel man that Hollywood has portrayed. The 14 men from &quot;Bounty&quot; who were captured by Edwards&#x27;s men were confined in a cramped 18′ × 11′ × 5′8″ wooden cell on &quot;Pandora&quot;″s quarterdeck. Yet, when &quot;Pandora&quot; ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, three prisoners were immediately let out of the prison cell to help at the pumps. Finally, Captain Edwards gave orders to release the other 11 prisoners, to which end Joseph Hodges, the armourer&#x27;s mate, went into the cell to remove the prisoners&#x27; irons. Unfortunately, before he could finish the job, the ship sank. Four of the prisoners and 31 of the crew died during the sinking. More prisoners would likely have perished, had not William Moulter, a bosun&#x27;s mate, unlocked their cages before jumping off the sinking vessel.

===Aftermath===
In October 1790, Bligh was honourably acquitted at the court-martial inquiring into the loss of &quot;Bounty.&quot; Shortly thereafter, he published &quot;A Narrative of the Mutiny on board His Majesty&#x27;s Ship &quot;Bounty&quot;; And the Subsequent Voyage of Part of the Crew, In the Ship&#x27;s Boat, from Tofoa, one of the Friendly Islands, to Timor, a Dutch Settlement in the East Indies.&quot; Of the 10 surviving prisoners eventually brought home in spite of &quot;Pandora&quot;&#x27;s loss, four were acquitted, owing to Bligh&#x27;s testimony that they were non-mutineers that Bligh was obliged to leave on &quot;Bounty&quot; because of lack of space in the launch. Two others were convicted because, while not participating in the mutiny, they were passive and did not resist. They subsequently received royal pardons. One was convicted but excused on a technicality. The remaining three were convicted and hanged.

===Bligh&#x27;s letter to his wife, Betsy===
The following is a letter to Bligh&#x27;s wife, written from Coupang, Timor, Dutch East Indies (circa June 1791), in which the first reference to events on the &quot;Bounty&quot; is made.
My Dear, Dear Betsy,

I am now, for the most part, in a part of the world I never expected, it is however a place that has afforded me relief and saved my life, and I have the happiness to assure you that I am now in perfect health...

Know then my own Dear Betsy, that I have lost the &quot;Bounty&quot; ... on the 28 April at day light in the morning Christian having the morning watch. He with several others came into my Cabin while I was a Sleep, and seizing me, holding naked Bayonets at my Breast, tied my Hands behind my back, and threatened instant destruction if I uttered a word. I however call&#x27;d loudly for assistance, but the conspiracy was so well laid that the Officers Cabbin Doors were guarded by Centinels, so Nelson, Peckover, Samuels or the Master could not come to me. I was now dragged on Deck in my Shirt &amp; closely guarded—I demanded of Christian the case of such a violent act, &amp; severely degraded for his Villainy but he could only answer—&quot;not a word sir or you are Dead.&quot; I dared him to the act &amp; endeavoured to rally some one to a sense of their duty but to no effect...

The Secrisy of this Mutiny is beyond all conception so that I can not discover that any who are with me had the least knowledge of it. It is unbeknown to me why I must beguile such force. Even Mr. Tom Ellison took such a liking to Otaheite [Tahiti] that he also turned Pirate, so that I have been run down by my own Dogs...

My misfortune I trust will be properly considered by all the World—It was a circumstance I could not foresee—I had not sufficient Officers &amp; had they granted me Marines most likely the affair would never have happened—I had not a Spirited &amp; brave fellow about me &amp; the Mutineers treated them as such. My conduct has been free of blame, &amp; I showed everyone that, tied as I was, I defied every Villain to hurt me...

I know how shocked you will be at this affair but I request of you My Dear Betsy to think nothing of it all is now past &amp; we will again looked forward to future happyness. Nothing but true consciousness as an Officer that I have done well could support me...Give my blessings to my Dear Harriet, my Dear Mary, my Dear Betsy &amp; to my Dear little stranger &amp; tell them I shall soon be home...To You my Love I give all that an affectionate Husband can give –

Love, Respect &amp; all that is or ever will be in the power of your &lt;br&gt;ever affectionate Friend and Husband Wm Bligh.

Strictly speaking, the crime of the mutineers (apart from the disciplinary crime of mutiny) was not piracy but barratry, the misappropriation, by those entrusted with its care, of a ship and/or its contents to the detriment of the owner (in this case the British Crown).

==Second breadfruit voyage==

After his exoneration by the court-martial inquiry into the loss of &quot;Bounty&quot;, Bligh remained in the Royal Navy. From 1791 to 1793, as master and commander of and in company with under the command of Nathaniel Portlock, he undertook again to transport breadfruit from Tahiti to the West Indies. He also transported plants provided by Hugh Ronalds, a nurseryman in Brentford. The operation was generally successful but its immediate objective, which was to provide a cheap and nutritious food for the African slaves in the West Indies islands around the Caribbean Sea was not met, as most slaves refused to eat the new food. During this voyage, Bligh also collected samples of the ackee fruit of Jamaica, introducing it to the Royal Society in Britain upon his return. The ackee&#x27;s scientific name &quot;Blighia sapida&quot; in binomial nomenclature was given in honour of Bligh.
In Adventure Bay, Tasmania, third lieutenant George Tobin made the first European drawing of an echidna.

==Later life==

In February 1797, while Bligh was captain of , he surveyed the Humber estuary, preparing a map of the stretch from Spurn to the west of Sunk Island. In April–May, Bligh was one of the captains whose crews mutinied over &quot;issues of pay and involuntary service for common seamen&quot; during the Spithead and Nore mutinies. The mutinies were not triggered by any specific actions by Bligh; the mutinies &quot;were widespread, [and] involved a fair number of English ships&quot;. Whilst &quot;Director&quot;&#x27;s role was relatively minor in this episode, she was the last to raise the white flag at its cessation. It was at this time that he learned &quot;that his common nickname among men in the fleet was &#x27;that Bounty bastard&#x27;.&quot;

As captain of &quot;Director&quot; at the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October, Bligh engaged three Dutch vessels: &quot;Haarlem&quot;, &quot;Alkmaar&quot; and &quot;Vrijheid&quot;. While the Dutch suffered serious casualties, only seven seamen were wounded on &quot;Director&quot;. &quot;Director&quot; captured &quot;Vrijheid&quot; and the Dutch commander, Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter. For his actions during the battle, Bligh was awarded the Naval Gold Medal.

Bligh went on to serve under Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801, in command of , a 56-gun ship of the line, which was experimentally fitted exclusively with carronades. After the battle, Nelson personally praised Bligh for his contribution to the victory. He sailed &quot;Glatton&quot; safely between the banks while three other vessels ran aground. When Nelson pretended not to notice Admiral Parker&#x27;s signal &quot;43&quot; (stop the battle) and kept the signal &quot;16&quot; hoisted to continue the engagement, Bligh was the only captain in the squadron who could see that the two signals were in conflict. By choosing to fly Nelson&#x27;s signal, he ensured that all the vessels behind him kept fighting.

Bligh was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1801 for distinguished services in navigation, botany, etc.

===Governor of New South Wales===
Bligh had gained a reputation as a firm disciplinarian. Accordingly, he was offered the position of Governor of New South Wales on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society and a main sponsor of the breadfruit expeditions) and appointed in March 1805, at £2,000 per annum (equal to £ today), twice the pay of the retiring governor, Philip Gidley King. He arrived in Sydney on 6 August 1806, to become the fourth governor. As his wife Elizabeth had been unwilling to undertake a long sea voyage, Bligh was accompanied by his daughter, Mary Putland, who would be the Lady of Government House; Mary&#x27;s husband John Putland was appointed as William Bligh&#x27;s aide-de-camp. During his time in Sydney, his confrontational administrative style provoked the wrath of influential settlers and officials. They included the wealthy landowner and businessman John Macarthur, and prominent Crown representatives such as the colony&#x27;s principal surgeon, Thomas Jamison, as well as senior officers of the New South Wales Corps. Jamison and his military associates were defying government regulations by engaging in private trading ventures for profit, a practice that Bligh was determined to end.

The conflict between Bligh and the entrenched colonists culminated in another mutiny, the Rum Rebellion, when, on 26 January 1808, 400 soldiers of the New South Wales Corps under the command of Major George Johnston marched on Government House in Sydney to arrest Bligh. A petition written by John Macarthur and addressed to George Johnston was written on the day of the arrest but most of the 151 signatures were gathered in the days after Bligh&#x27;s overthrow. A rebel government was subsequently installed and Bligh, now deposed, made for Hobart in Tasmania aboard . Bligh failed to gain support from the authorities in Hobart to retake control of New South Wales, and remained effectively imprisoned on the &quot;Porpoise&quot; from 1808 until January 1810.
Shortly after Bligh&#x27;s arrest, a watercolour illustrating the arrest by an unknown artist was exhibited in Sydney at perhaps Australia&#x27;s first public art exhibition. The watercolour depicts a soldier dragging Bligh from underneath one of the servants&#x27; beds in Government House, with two other figures standing by. The two soldiers in the watercolour are most likely John Sutherland and Michael Marlborough and the other figure on the far right is believed to represent Lieutenant William Minchin. This cartoon is Australia&#x27;s earliest surviving political cartoon and like all political cartoons it makes use of caricature and exaggeration to convey its message. The New South Wales Corps&#x27; officers regarded themselves as gentlemen, and in depicting Bligh as a coward, the cartoon declares that Bligh was not a gentleman and therefore not fit to govern.

Of interest, however, was Bligh&#x27;s concern for the more recently arrived settlers in the colony, who did not have the wealth and influence of Macarthur and Jamison. From the tombstones in Ebenezer and Richmond cemeteries, (areas being settled west of Sydney during Bligh&#x27;s tenure as governor), can be seen the number of boys born around 1807 to 1811 who received &quot;William Bligh&quot; as a given name, e.g. William Bligh Turnbull, ancestor of former Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Bligh Turnbull; and James Bligh Johnston, who designed Ebenezer Chapel, Australia&#x27;s oldest extant church and oldest extant school.

===Aftermath of the Rum Rebellion===

Bligh received a letter in January 1810, advising him that the rebellion had been declared illegal, and that the British Foreign Office had declared it to be a mutiny. Lachlan Macquarie had been appointed to replace him as governor. At this news Bligh sailed from Hobart. He arrived in Sydney on 17 January 1810, only two weeks into Macquarie&#x27;s tenure. There he would collect evidence for the coming court martial in England of Major Johnston. He departed to attend the trial on 12 May 1810, arriving on 25 October 1810. In the days immediately prior to their departure, his daughter, Mary Putland (widowed in 1808), was hastily married to the new Lieutenant-Governor, Maurice Charles O&#x27;Connell, and remained in Sydney. The following year, the trial&#x27;s presiding officers sentenced Johnston to be cashiered, a form of disgraceful dismissal that entailed surrendering his commission in the Royal Marines without compensation. (This was a comparatively mild punishment that enabled Johnston to return a free man to New South Wales, where he could continue to enjoy the benefits of his accumulated private wealth.) Bligh was court martialled twice again during his career, being acquitted both times. Soon after Johnston&#x27;s trial had concluded, Bligh received a backdated promotion to rear admiral. In 1814, he was promoted again to vice-admiral of the blue. Perhaps significantly, he never again received an important command, though with the Napoleonic Wars almost over there would have been few fleet commands available.

===Final years and death===
Bligh was recruited to chart and map Dublin Bay, and recommended the building walls for a refuge harbour at what was then known as Dunleary; the large harbour and naval base subsequently built there between 1816 and 1821 was called Kingstown, later renamed Dún Laoghaire. Many sources claim that Bligh designed the North Bull Wall at the mouth of the River Liffey in Dublin. He did propose the construction of a sea wall or barrier at the north of the bay in order to clear a sandbar by Venturi action, but his design was not used. The wall that was constructed used a design by George Halpin and resulted in the formation of North Bull Island by the sand cleared by the river&#x27;s now more narrowly focused force.
Bligh died of cancer in Bond Street, London, on 7 December 1817 and was buried in a family plot at St. Mary&#x27;s, Lambeth (this church is now the Garden Museum). His tomb was notable for its use of Coade stone (&quot;Lithodipyra&quot;), a compound of clay and other materials that was moulded in imitation of carved stonework and fired in a kiln. This stoneware was produced by Eleanor Coade at her factory in Lambeth. The tomb is topped by an eternal flame, not a breadfruit. A plaque marks Bligh&#x27;s house, half a mile (700m) east of the Garden Museum at 100 Lambeth Road, opposite the Imperial War Museum.

He was related to Admiral Sir Richard Rodney Bligh and Captain George Miller Bligh, and his British and Australian descendants include Native Police Commandant John O&#x27;Connell Bligh and the former Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh. He was also distantly related to the architect and psychical researcher Frederick Bligh Bond.

The New South Wales suburb of Bligh Park is named after William Bligh, as at the time of the Rum Rebellion, the Hawkesbury settlers supported the then-deposed governor.

==Legacy==
Bligh&#x27;s reputation as the archetypal bad commander remains though several historians&#x27; attempts to portray Bligh more sympathetically are those of Richard Hough (1972) and Caroline Alexander (2003).

Bligh&#x27;s logbooks documenting the mutiny were inscribed on the UNESCO Australian Memory of the World register on 26 February 2021.

===Portrayals===
Bligh has been the subject of numerous print and film portrayals.

===Film===
Bligh was portrayed by:

* George Cross (1916) &quot;The Mutiny of the Bounty&quot; 
* Mayne Lynton (1933) &quot;In the Wake of the Bounty&quot; 
* Charles Laughton (1935) &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; 
* Bugs Bunny (1948) &quot;Buccaneer Bunny&quot;, in imitation of Laughton&#x27;s 1935 portrayal
* Trevor Howard (1962) &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; 
* Anthony Hopkins (1984) &quot;The Bounty&quot;

The 1935 and 1962 films largely perpetuate the image of Bligh as a tyrant while the 1984 film attempts a non-judgmental portrayal of Bligh.

===Literature===
Bligh is humorously portrayed in Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch&#x27;s short story &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot; as a competent but irascible and tactless surveyor sent to a small fishing village in Cornwall during the Napoleonic Wars. His accent and strong language being misunderstood by the locals as French, he is temporarily imprisoned as a spy.

The situation in Sydney in 1810, with Bligh returning from Tasmania to be restored as governor, is the setting of Naomi Novik&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;Tongues of Serpents&quot; (Harper-Collins, 2011).

===Television===
On 17 December 1964, the &quot;Adobe Dick&quot; episode of the cartoon &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (episode 128) paid a humorous homage to Captain Bligh and his ship. On the show, the characters Fred and Barney took a chartered fishing trip with the guys from the lodge on the U.S.S. &quot;Bountystone&quot;. The captain of the ship, Captain Blah, was a domineering man with a uniform resembling the historical figure William Bligh.

&quot;Mutiny&quot;, on Channel 4 in the UK, charts a recreation of Bligh&#x27;s journey to Timor. It aired in 2017.

<text>WIYN Consortium founding members were the University of Wisconsin–Madison (W), Indiana University (I), Yale University (Y), and the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (N). Yale University withdrew from the WIYN consortium on April 1, 2014, and was replaced by the University of Missouri in the fall of that year. In 2015, a NASA-NSF partnership called NN-EXPLORE effectively took over NOAO&#x27;s share, although NOAO still manages the operations. Purdue University joined in 2017 for a three-year period.

The consortium operates two telescopes of 3.5 m and 0.9 m diameters.

The universities financed the construction of the WIYN Observatory at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) in 1994.

In 2001, the WIYN Consortium took over control of the KPNO telescope, built in 1960, and rechristened it as the &quot;WIYN 0.9 m Telescope&quot;. This small but popular telescope was in danger of being mothballed for budgetary reasons.

<text>William Goldman (August 12, 1931 – November 16, 2018) was an American novelist, playwright, and screenwriter. He first came to prominence in the 1950s as a novelist before turning to screenwriting. Among other accolades, Goldman won two Academy Awards in both writing categories: first for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969) and then for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976).

His other well-known works include his thriller novel &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1974) and his cult classic comedy/fantasy novel &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1973), both of which he also adapted for film versions.

==Early life==
Goldman was born in Chicago on August 12, 1931, the second son of Marion () and Maurice Clarence Goldman. He grew up in Highland Park, Illinois, and was raised Jewish. Goldman&#x27;s father was a successful businessman, working in Chicago and in a partnership, but he suffered from alcoholism, which cost him his business. He &quot;came home to live and he was in his pajamas for the last five years of his life,&quot; according to Goldman. His father committed suicide while Goldman was still in high school. It was a 15-year-old Goldman who discovered the body. His mother was deaf, which created additional stress in the home.

===Education and military service===
Goldman attended Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. According to his memoir &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot; (1983), Goldman began to write when he took a creative-writing course in college. His grades in the class were &quot;horrible&quot;. He was an editor of Oberlin&#x27;s literary magazine. He submitted his short stories to the magazine anonymously; he recalls that the other editors read his submissions and remarked, &quot;We can&#x27;t possibly publish this shit.&quot; He graduated from college in 1952. 

At that time, the Korean War was occurring, so he was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter. Because he knew how to type, he was assigned as a clerk in the Pentagon, Defense headquarters. He was discharged with the rank of corporal in September 1954. He returned to graduate studies under the GI Bill, earning a Master of Arts degree at Columbia University, graduating in 1956. Throughout this period, he was writing short stories in the evenings, but struggled to have them published.

==Career==
===Novelist===
Goldman did not originally intend to become a screenwriter. His main interests were poetry, short stories, and novels. In 1956, he completed a master&#x27;s thesis at Columbia University on the comedy of manners in America.

His older brother James Goldman was a playwright and screenwriter. They shared an apartment in New York with their friend John Kander. Also an alumnus of Oberlin, Kander was working on his Ph.D. in music, and the Goldman brothers wrote the libretto for his dissertation. Kander was the composer of more than a dozen musicals, including &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;, and all three of them eventually won Academy Awards. On June 25, 1956, Goldman began writing his first novel &quot;The Temple of Gold&quot;, completing it in less than three weeks. He sent the manuscript to agent Joe McCrindle, who agreed to represent him; McCrindle submitted the novel to Knopf, who agreed to publish it if he doubled the length. It sold well enough in paperback to launch Goldman on his career. He wrote his second novel &quot;Your Turn to Curtsy, My Turn to Bow&quot; (1958) in a little more than a week. It was followed by &quot;Soldier in the Rain&quot; (1960), based on Goldman&#x27;s time in the military. It sold well in paperback and was turned into a film, though Goldman had no involvement in the screenplay.

===Theater work===
Goldman and his brother received a grant to do some rewriting on the musical &quot;Tenderloin&quot; (1960). They then collaborated on their own play, &quot;Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole&quot; (1961), and on the musical, &quot;A Family Affair&quot; (1962), written with John Kander. Both plays had short runs.

Goldman began writing &quot;Boys and Girls Together&quot;, but found that he suffered writer&#x27;s block. His writer&#x27;s block continued, but he had an idea for the novel &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot; (1964) based on the Boston Strangler. He wrote it in two weeks, and it was published under the pseudonym Harry Longbaugh—a variant spelling of the Sundance Kid&#x27;s real name, which Goldman had been researching since the late 1950s. He then finished &quot;Boys and Girls Together&quot;, which became a best seller.

===Screenwriter===
Cliff Robertson read an early draft of &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot; and hired Goldman to adapt the short story &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; for the movies. Before he had even finished the script, Robertson recommended him to do some rewriting on the spy spoof &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1965), in which Robertson was starring. Goldman did that, then finished the &quot;Algernon&quot; script. Robertson disliked it, though, and hired Stirling Silliphant, instead, to work on what became &quot;Charly&quot; (1968).

Producer Elliot Kastner had optioned the film rights to &quot;Boys and Girls Together&quot;. Goldman suggested that Kastner make a film of the Lew Archer novels of Ross Macdonald and offered to do an adaptation. Kastner agreed, and Goldman chose &quot;The Moving Target&quot;. The result was &quot;Harper&quot; (1966) starring Paul Newman, which was a big hit.

===&quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;===
Goldman returned to novels, writing &quot;The Thing of It Is...&quot; (1967). He taught at Princeton and wished to write something, but he could not come up with an idea for a novel. Instead, he wrote &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, his first original screenplay, which he had been researching for eight years. He sold it for $400,000, the highest price ever paid for an original screenplay at that time. The movie was released in 1969, a critical and commercial success that earned Goldman an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The money enabled Goldman to take some time off and research the nonfiction &quot;The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway&quot; (1969).

Goldman adapted Steven Linakis&#x27;s novel &quot;In the Spring the War Ended&quot; into a screenplay, but it was not filmed. Neither were scripts of &quot;The Thing of It Is&quot;, which came close to being made several times in the early &#x27;70s, and &quot;Papillon&quot;, on which he worked for six months and three drafts; the book was filmed, but little of Goldman&#x27;s work was used. He returned to novels with &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; (1971), a sequel to &quot;The Thing of It Is…&quot;. He also wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; (1972).

===&quot;The Princess Bride&quot;===
Goldman&#x27;s next novel was &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1973); he also wrote a screenplay, but it was more than a decade before the film was made. That same year, he contracted a rare strain of pneumonia, which resulted in his being hospitalized and affected his health for months. This inspired him into a burst of creativity, including several novels and screenplays.

Goldman&#x27;s novel writing moved in a more commercial direction following the death of his editor Hiram Haydn in late 1973. This started with the children&#x27;s book &quot;Wigger&quot; (1974), followed by the thriller &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1974), which he sold to Delacorte as part of a three-book deal worth $2 million. He sold movie rights to &quot;Marathon Man&quot; for $450,000.

His second book for Delacorte was the thriller &quot;Magic&quot; (1976), which he sold to Joe Levine for $1 million. He did the screenplays for the film versions of &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976) and &quot;Magic&quot; (1978). He also wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (1975), which he says was an unpleasant experience because director Bryan Forbes rewrote most of it; Goldman tried to take his name off it, but they would not let him. He was reunited with director George Roy Hill and star Robert Redford on &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975), which Goldman wrote from an idea of Hill.

===&quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;===
Redford hired Goldman to write the script of &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976).

Goldman wrote the famous line &quot;Follow the money&quot; for the screenplay of &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;; while the line is often attributed to Deep Throat, it is not found in Bob Woodward&#x27;s notes nor in Woodward and Carl Bernstein&#x27;s book or articles. The book does have the far less-quotable line from Woodward to Senator Sam Ervin, who was about to begin his own investigation: &quot;The key was the secret campaign cash, and it should all be traced...&quot;

Goldman was unhappy with the movie. &quot;The Guardian&quot; says that he changes the subject when asked about the movie, but suggests that his displeasure may be because he was pressured to add a romantic interest to the film. In his memoir, Goldman says of the film that if he could live his life over, he would have written the same screenplays, &quot;Only I wouldn&#x27;t have come near &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;.&quot; He said that he has never written as many versions of a screenplay as he did for that movie. Speaking of his choice to write the script, he said: &quot;Many movies that get made are not long on art and are long on commerce. This was a project that seemed it might be both. You don&#x27;t get many and you can&#x27;t turn them down.&quot;

In Michael Feeney Callan&#x27;s book &quot;Robert Redford: The Biography&quot;, Redford is reported as stating that Goldman did not actually write the screenplay for the movie, a story that was excerpted in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. &quot;Written By&quot; magazine conducted a thorough investigation of the screenplay&#x27;s many drafts and concluded, &quot;Goldman was the sole author of &quot;All The President&#x27;s Men&quot;. Period.&quot;

===Joseph E. Levine===
Goldman had a happier experience when hired by Joseph E. Levine to write &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977) based on the book by Cornelius Ryan. Goldman later wrote a promotional book, &quot;Story of A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), as a favor to Levine, and signed a three-film contract with the producer worth $1.5 million.

He wrote a novel about Hollywood, &quot;Tinsel&quot; (1979), which sold well. He wrote two more films for Levine, &quot;The Sea Kings&quot; and &quot;Year of the Comet&quot;, but did not write a third. He did a script about Tom Horn; &quot;Mr. Horn&quot; (1979), was filmed for TV.

Goldman was the original screenwriter for the film version of Tom Wolfe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;; director Philip Kaufman wrote his own screenplay without using Goldman&#x27;s material, because Kaufman wanted to include Chuck Yeager as a character; Goldman did not.

He wrote a number of other screenplays around this time, including &quot;The Ski Bum&quot;; a musical adaptation of &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932) that was going to be directed by Norman Jewison; and &quot;Rescue&quot;, the story of the rescue of Electronic Data Systems employees during the Iranian Revolution. None were made into films.

===&quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot; and the &quot;Leper Period&quot;===
After several of his screenplays were not filmed, Goldman found himself in less demand as a screenwriter. He published a memoir about his professional life in Hollywood, &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot; (1983), which summed up the entertainment industry in the opening sentence of the book, &quot;Nobody knows anything.&quot;

He focused on novels: &quot;Control&quot; (1982), &quot;The Silent Gondoliers&quot; (1983), &quot;The Color of Light&quot; (1984), &quot;Heat&quot; (1985), and &quot;Brothers&quot; (1986). The latter, a sequel to &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, was Goldman&#x27;s last published novel.

===Return to Hollywood===
Goldman attributed his return to Hollywood to signing with talent agent Michael Ovitz at Creative Artists Agency. He went to work on &quot;Memoirs of an Invisible Man&quot;, although he left the project relatively early.

Hollywood&#x27;s interest in Goldman was reawakened; he wrote the scripts for film versions of &quot;Heat&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987). The latter was directed by Rob Reiner for Castle Rock, which hired Goldman to write the screenplay for Rob Reiner&#x27;s 1990 adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Misery&quot;, considered &quot;one of [King&#x27;s] least adaptable novels&quot;. The movie, for which Kathy Bates received an Academy Award, performed well with critics and at the box office.

Goldman continued to write nonfiction regularly. He published a collection of sports writing, &quot;Wait Till Next Year&quot; (1988) and an account of his time as a judge at both the Cannes Film Festival and the Miss America Pageant, &quot;Hype and Glory&quot; (1990).

Goldman began to work steadily as a &quot;script doctor&quot;, doing uncredited work on films including &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; (1993), &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993), &quot;Malice&quot; (1994), &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; (1995), and &quot;Extreme Measures&quot;. Most of these movies were by Castle Rock.

He was credited on several other movies: &quot;Year of the Comet&quot; (1992), which was eventually filmed by Castle Rock, but was not a success; the biopic &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992), directed by Richard Attenborough; &quot;Maverick&quot; (1994), a popular hit; &quot;The Chamber&quot; (1996), from a novel by John Grisham; &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; (1996), an original script based on a true story; &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (1997) for Clint Eastwood; and &quot;The General&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1999), from the novel by Nelson DeMille.

===Later career===

Goldman wrote another volume of memoirs, &quot;Which Lie Did I Tell?&quot; (2000), and a collection of his essays, &quot;The Big Picture: Who Killed Hollywood? and Other Essays&quot; (2001).

His later screenplay credits include &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; (2001) and &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; (2003), both from novels by Stephen King. He adapted &quot;Misery&quot; into a stage play, which made its debut on Broadway in 2015 in a production starring Bruce Willis and Laurie Metcalf.

His script for &quot;Heat&quot; was filmed again as &quot;Wild Card&quot; (2015), starring Jason Statham.

After his death, screenwriter Peter Morgan wrote that Goldman had completed a final book on Hollywood, comparing the production of three different films, including Morgan&#x27;s Frost/Nixon, but that the book had run into legal problems and was never published. Writers Tony Gilroy and Scott Frank said Goldman spent considerable time mentoring and advising other writers.

===Critical reception===
In their feature on Goldman, &quot;IGN&quot; said, &quot;It&#x27;s a testament to just how truly great William Goldman is at his best that I actually had to think hard about what to select as his &#x27;Must-See&#x27; cinematic work&quot;. The site described his script for &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; as a &quot;model of storytelling clarity... and artful manipulation&quot;.

Art Kleiner, writing in 1987, said, &quot;William Goldman, a very skilled storyteller, wrote several of the most well-known films of the past 18 years—including &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, part of &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, and &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;.&quot; 
Three of Goldman&#x27;s scripts have been voted into the Writers Guild of America hall-of-fame&#x27;s 101 Greatest Screenplays list.

In his book evaluating Goldman&#x27;s work, &quot;William Goldman: The Reluctant Storyteller&quot; (2014), Sean Egan said Goldman&#x27;s achievements were made &quot;without ever lunging for the lowest common denominator. Although his body of work has been consumed by millions, he has never let his populism overwhelm a glittering intelligence and penchant for upending expectation.&quot;

===Self-appraisal===
In 2000, Goldman said of his writing:
Goldman also said of his work:
&quot;I [don&#x27;t] like my writing. I wrote a movie called &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; and I wrote a novel called &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and those are the only two things I&#x27;ve ever written, not that I&#x27;m proud of, but that I can look at without humiliation.&quot;

===Awards===
He won two Academy Awards: one for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, and Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;. He also won two Edgar Awards, from the Mystery Writers of America, for Best Motion Picture Screenplay: for &quot;Harper&quot; in 1967, and for &quot;Magic&quot; (adapted from his 1976 novel) in 1979. In 1985, he received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement from the Writers Guild of America.

==Personal life==
He was married to Ilene Jones from 1961 until their divorce in 1991; the couple had two daughters, Jenny and Susanna. Ilene, a native of Texas, modeled for Neiman Marcus; Ilene&#x27;s brother was actor Allen Case.

Goldman was survived by his partner of nineteen years, Susan Burden, his daughter, Jenny, and a grandson. His daughter, Susanna, died in 2015. 

Goldman said that his favorite writers were Miguel de Cervantes, Anton Chekhov, Somerset Maugham, Irwin Shaw, and Leo Tolstoy.

He was a die-hard fan of the New York Knicks, having held season tickets at Madison Square Garden for over 40 years. He contributed a writing section to Bill Simmons&#x27;s bestselling book about the history of the NBA, in which he discussed the career of Dave DeBusschere.

==Death==
Goldman died at his Manhattan apartment on November 16, 2018, due to colon cancer complicated by pneumonia. He was 87.

<text>Wallace Michael Shawn (born November 12, 1943) is an American actor, essayist, playwright, and screenwriter. He is known for playing Vizzini in &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987), Mr. Hall in &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995), Dr. John Sturgis in &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; (2018–2024), and voicing Rex in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise (1995–present).

Shawn also appeared in &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1984), &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; (1987), &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills&quot; (1989), &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; (1994), &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; (1999), &quot;The Double&quot; (2013), &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Plan&quot; (2015), and &quot;Marriage Story&quot; (2019). He appeared in six Woody Allen films including &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979), &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987), and &quot;Rifkin&#x27;s Festival&quot; (2020). His television work includes recurring roles as Jeff Engels in &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1987–1991), Grand Nagus Zek in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993–1999), Cyrus Rose in &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; (2008–2012), and Father Frank Ignatius in &quot;Evil&quot; (2022–2024).

Shawn is also a playwright; his plays include the Obie Award–winning &quot;Aunt Dan and Lemon&quot; (1985), &quot;The Designated Mourner&quot; (1996) and &quot;Grasses of a Thousand Colors&quot; (2008). He wrote and starred, with Andre Gregory, in the 1981 avant-garde drama &quot;My Dinner with Andre,&quot; and played the title role in &quot;A Master Builder&quot; (2013), a film adaptation of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play. Haymarket Books published his books &quot;Essays&quot; (2009) and &quot;Night Thoughts&quot; (2017).

==Early life==
Shawn was born on November 12, 1943, in New York City, to a Jewish family. His parents were journalist Cecille (née Lyon) and William Shawn, the longtime editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. He has younger twin siblings: composer Allen Shawn, and Mary, who is autistic and lives in an institution. His father&#x27;s family had emigrated from Central Europe; his paternal grandfather, Benjamin W. Chon, was a Chicago-based cutlery merchant who married Anna Bransky.

Shawn grew up on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. He attended The Putney School, a private liberal arts high school in Putney, Vermont. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history from Harvard College. He studied philosophy, politics and economics, as well as Latin, at Magdalen College, Oxford, originally intending to become a diplomat. He traveled to India as an English teacher on a Fulbright program.

==Career==
===Playwright===
Shawn&#x27;s early plays, such as &quot;Marie and Bruce&quot; (1978), portrayed emotional and sexual conflicts in an absurdist style, with language both lyrical and violent. In a conversation with Andre Gregory, parts of which were used to create &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;, Shawn said these plays depicted &quot;my interior life as a raging beast.&quot; Critical response was extremely polarized: some critics hailed Shawn as a major writer, while John Simon called &quot;Marie and Bruce&quot; &quot;garbage&quot; and Shawn &quot;one of the unsightliest actors in this city.&quot; His 1977 play &quot;A Thought in Three Parts&quot; caused controversy in London when the production was investigated by a vice squad and attacked in Parliament after allegations of pornographic content. Shawn received an Obie Award for playwrighting in 1975, for &quot;Our Late Night&quot;.

Shawn&#x27;s later plays are more overtly political, drawing parallels between his characters&#x27; psychology and the behavior of governments and social classes. Among the best-known of these are &quot;Aunt Dan and Lemon&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Designated Mourner&quot; (1997). Shawn&#x27;s political work has invited controversy, as he often presents the audience with several contradictory points of view. He has called &quot;Aunt Dan and Lemon&quot; a cautionary tale against fascism. Shawn&#x27;s monologue &quot;The Fever&quot;, originally meant to be performed for small audiences in apartments, depicts a person who becomes sick while struggling to find a morally consistent way to live when faced with injustice, and harshly criticizes the United States&#x27; record in supporting oppressive anti-communist regimes. In 1997, Shawn discussed the political nature of &quot;Aunt Dan and Lemon&quot;, &quot;The Fever&quot; and &quot;The Designated Mourner&quot; in an interview in which he talked extensively about the thematic connections among them, as well as his own views on Marxist, communist and socialist politics, their relevance to American liberalism, and how governmental and individual responsibilities for finding solutions to the dichotomy between rich and poor in the world take hold in his characters. &quot;Aunt Dan and Lemon&quot; earned Shawn his second Obie Award for playwrighting in 1986, and &quot;The Fever&quot; won an Obie for Best American Play in 1991. Three of Shawn&#x27;s plays have been adapted into films: &quot;The Designated Mourner&quot; (basically a film version of David Hare&#x27;s stage production), &quot;Marie and Bruce&quot; and &quot;The Fever&quot;. Vanessa Redgrave stars in &quot;The Fever&quot; (2004), which first aired on HBO on June 13, 2007.

Shawn has also written political commentary for &quot;The Nation&quot;, and in 2004 he published the one-issue-only progressive political magazine &quot;Final Edition&quot;, which featured interviews with and articles by Jonathan Schell, Noam Chomsky, Mark Strand and Deborah Eisenberg. Shawn is credited as translator of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, which opened at Studio 54 in Manhattan on March 25, 2006. He appeared briefly in voiceover during &quot;Song about the Futility of Human Endeavor&quot;. He published his first nonfiction work, &quot;Essays&quot;, on September 1, 2009. It is a collection of essays that express his perceptions of politics and other aspects of his life.

===Acting===
Shawn&#x27;s involvement with theater began in 1970 when he met Andre Gregory, who has since directed several of his plays. As a stage actor, he has appeared mostly in his own plays and other projects with Gregory. He made his film debut in 1979, playing Diane Keaton&#x27;s ex-husband in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Manhattan&quot; and an insurance agent in Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;All That Jazz&quot;. His best-known film roles include Earl in &quot;Strange Invaders&quot; (1983) and Mr. Hall in &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995). After seeing his performance in &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; (1981), casting director Janet Hirshenson was so fond of his delivery of the word &quot;inconceivable&quot; that she cast him as Vizzini in &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987), for whom the word is a catchphrase. Other roles include Baron Von Westphalen in &quot;Southland Tales&quot;, Cyrus Rose on &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, Marty in &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot; (1997), and Ezra in &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; (2003). 

His rare non-comedic film roles include two collaborations with Andre Gregory and Louis Malle: the semi-autobiographical dialogue &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;, and a combined production-and-backstage-drama of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; titled &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot;. Shawn quite often appears on television, where he has appeared in many genres and series. He has had recurring roles as the Grand Nagus Zek on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, Stuart Best on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, Jeff Engels on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, Dr. Howard Stiles on &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, Arnie Ross on &quot;Taxi&quot;, Charles Lester on both &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and &quot;The Good Fight&quot;, a reprisal of his role as Mr. Hall on &quot;Clueless&quot; (based on the film), and Father Frank Ignatius on &quot;Evil&quot;. He appeared in the 1985 music video for Chaka Khan&#x27;s &quot;This Is My Night&quot;. On February 4, 2010, Shawn appeared as Alan Rubin on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;. &quot;A Master Builder&quot; opened in New York City in June 2014. In 2018, he joined the cast of &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; in the recurring role of Meemaw&#x27;s boyfriend and Sheldon&#x27;s physics professor, Dr. John Sturgis.

Shawn stars in Woody Allen&#x27;s 2020 film &quot;Rifkin&#x27;s Festival&quot;, set in San Sebastian, Spain.

Shawn was honored in 2005 with the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award as a Master American Dramatist.

====Voice acting====
Shawn is a voice actor for animated films and television series, including the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (during the outtakes in the closing credits), &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Happily N&#x27;Ever After&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers&quot;, &quot;Regular Show&quot;, &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; and &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;.

Shawn said that &quot;Toy Story&quot; director John Lasseter might have seen both &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and seen him as &quot;excitable&quot; like Shawn&#x27;s character, Rex.

In &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;, Shawn was originally to voice Boomer, but dropped out and was replaced by Paul Winchell&quot;, he replaced Jon Lovitz as the voice of Calico. He also provided the voice of Mr. Mustela in &quot;The Addams Family 2&quot;.

==Political activity==
Shawn has written many plays with socialist themes; much of his work examines the &quot;connective tissue between private psychology and the politics of inequality&quot;. He identifies as a socialist in the essay &quot;Why I Call Myself a Socialist: Is the World Really a Stage?&quot;, which was published online and later in his &quot;Essays&quot;.

In June 2013, Shawn and many other public figures appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning, a U.S. Army soldier imprisoned for leaking classified material.

Shawn voiced his support for the Palestinian people during the 2014 Gaza War. He is a member of Jewish Voice for Peace and is on the advisory board.

On October 16, 2023, Shawn spoke at a Washington D.C. rally organized by Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow. The rally called for a ceasefire in the Gaza war and for President Joe Biden to support a ceasefire. Also that month, Shawn was among the artists to sign the Artists4Ceasefire campaign&#x27;s open letter urging Biden to push for a ceasefire.

In April 2024, Shawn narrated a political ad by a group of organizations opposing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee&#x27;s influence in Democratic Party primaries.

In a January 2025 interview, Shawn compared Israel to Nazi Germany, saying the Israelis were &quot;doing evil that is just as great as what the Nazis did. And in some ways, it&#x27;s worse, because they kind of boast about it. Hitler had the decency to try to keep it secret... the Israelis are almost proud of it, and it&#x27;s demonically evil.&quot;

==Personal life==
Shawn&#x27;s longtime companion is writer Deborah Eisenberg. Shawn is a Jewish atheist. , he lived in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

<text>__notoc__
William Ashbless is a fictional poet, invented by fantasy writers James Blaylock and Tim Powers.

==Invention==
Ashbless was invented by Powers and Blaylock when they were students at California State University, Fullerton in the early 1970s, originally as a reaction to the low quality of the poetry being published in the school magazine. They invented nonsensical free verse poetry and submitted it to the paper in Ashbless&#x27;s name, where it was reportedly enthusiastically accepted.

==As a character==
Ashbless is, however, best known in his incarnation as a 19th-century poet, in which guise he appears in Powers&#x27; &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot; (1983) and as a lesser character in Blaylock&#x27;s &quot;The Digging Leviathan&quot; (1984). Neither author was aware that the other&#x27;s novel contained a William Ashbless until the coincidence was noticed by the editor responsible for both books, who suggested that the two consult one another so that their references would be consistent. Ashbless also features (as Sir William Ashbless) in Powers&#x27; 1979 novel &quot;The Drawing of the Dark&quot;, credited with a brief quote before the book&#x27;s prologue:

In his 1992 novel &quot;Last Call&quot; (), Tim Powers includes a poem attributed to William Ashbless in the introduction to Book One. The poem is &quot;from&quot; a later time period, as it mentions airplanes, cars, and blue jeans.

Powers&#x27; novel &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot; opens with an excerpt from a poem by William Ashbless, implying that the novel&#x27;s name is in reference to the poem:

==As a supposed writer==
In 1985, Powers and Blaylock produced &quot;Offering the Bicentennial Edition of the Complete Twelve Hours of the Night: 1785–1985&quot;, a prospectus for a non-existent collection of Ashbless poetry, published by Cheap Street Press. (&quot;The Twelve Hours of the Night&quot; had been mentioned in &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot; as Ashbless&#x27;s most famous work.) The prospectus included a sample poem and a replica of Ashbless&#x27;s signature (the &quot;William&quot; was signed by one, and the &quot;Ashbless&quot; by the other, of the authors). This was followed in 2001 by &quot;On Pirates&quot; ()—supposedly written by Ashbless, with an introduction by Powers, an afterword by Blaylock, and illustrations by Gahan Wilson—and in 2002 by &quot;The William Ashbless Memorial Cookbook&quot;.

==Blog==

In 2017, Big Hit Entertainment, the label behind K-Pop group BTS, created a blog post on Naver that mentions Ashbless as a character. The blog post tells the fictional story of Ashbless as a 16th-century poet and playing card enthusiast who created a special card known as The Flower. The blog adds details to Ashbless&#x27; life in order to flesh out the narrative surrounding some of BTS&#x27; concepts. The post was deleted and then re-uploaded in 2018 to further support themes of time travel in BTS&#x27; fictional universe.

<doc id="33908" wikidata="Q1771928" url="?curid=33908" title="Why We Fight">
<text>Why We Fight is a series of seven propaganda films produced by the US Department of War from 1942 to 1945, during World War II. It was originally written for American soldiers to help them understand why the United States was involved in the war, but US President Franklin Roosevelt ordered distribution for public viewing.

Academy Award-winning filmmaker Frank Capra, daunted but impressed and challenged by Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s 1935 propaganda film &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, worked in direct response. The series faced various challenges, such as convincing a noninterventionist nation to get involved in the war and to become an ally of the Soviet Union. Many entries feature Axis powers&#x27; propaganda footage from up to 20 years earlier, recontextualized to promote the Allies.

Although primarily edited by William Hornbeck, some parts were re-enacted &quot;under War Department supervision&quot; if no relevant footage was available. Animated segments were produced by Walt Disney Productions, and the animated maps followed a convention of depicting Axis-occupied territory in black.

==Purpose==

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and America&#x27;s subsequent joining World War II, American film director Frank Capra enlisted with the armed forces. He was already an established Hollywood director responsible for directing films winning Academy Award such as &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934) and &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939). He was assigned to work directly under George Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Marshall felt that the Signal Corps, an army branch responsible for communications, was incapable of producing &quot;sensitive and objective troop information films&quot;. One colonel explained the importance of these future films to Capra:

During his first meeting with Marshall, Capra received his mission:

===Countering enemy propaganda films===
Shortly after his meeting with General Marshall, Capra viewed Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s &quot;terrifying motion picture&quot;, &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. Capra describes the film as &quot;the ominous prelude of Hitler&#x27;s holocaust of hate. Satan couldn&#x27;t have devised a more blood-chilling super-spectacle. ... Though panoplied with all the pomp and mystical trappings of a Wagnerian opera, its message was as blunt and brutal as a lead pipe: We, the Herrenvolk, are the new invincible gods!&quot;

According to Capra, &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; &quot;fired no gun, dropped no bombs. But as a psychological weapon aimed at destroying the will to resist, it was just as lethal.&quot; Capra still had no assistants or facilities, and he began to see his assignment as overwhelming:

===Creating a powerful film idea===
Capra made his primary focus the creation of &quot;one basic, powerful idea&quot; that would spread and evolve into other related ideas. He considered one important idea that had always been in his thoughts:

As a result, his goal became to &quot;let the &quot;enemy&quot; prove to our soldiers the enormity of his cause—and the justness of ours.&quot; He would compile enemy speeches, films, newsreels, newspaper articles, with a list of the enemy&#x27;s hostile actions. He presented his ideas to other officers who were now assigned to help him:

Weeks later, after major efforts and disappointments, Capra located hard-to-reach archives within government facilities, and by avoiding normal channels, he was able to gain access:

==Description==
# &quot;Prelude to War&quot; (1942; 51 min 35 s) examines the difference between democratic and fascist states and covers the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. Capra describes it as &quot;presenting a general picture of two worlds; the slave and the free, and the rise of totalitarian militarism from Japan&#x27;s conquest of Manchuria to Mussolini&#x27;s conquest of Ethiopia.&quot; This film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film.
# &quot;The Nazis Strike&quot; (1943, 40 min 20 s) covers geopolitics: the conquest of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Capra&#x27;s synopsis: &quot;Hitler rises. Imposes Nazi dictatorship on Germany. Goose-steps into Rhineland and Austria. Threatens war unless given Czechoslovakia. Appeasers oblige. Hitler invades Poland. Curtain rises on the tragedy of the century—World War II.&quot; 
# &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot; (1943, 56 min) – about the campaign in Benelux and the Fall of France. Capra&#x27;s synopsis: &quot;Hitler occupies Denmark and Norway, outflanks Maginot Line, drives British Army into North Sea, forces surrender of France.&quot;
# &quot;The Battle of Britain&quot; (1943, 51 min 30 s) depicts Britain&#x27;s victory against the Luftwaffe. Capra&#x27;s synopsis: &quot;Showing the gallant and victorious defense of Britain by Royal Air Force, at a time when shattered, but unbeaten, British were the only people fighting Nazis.&quot;
# &quot;The Battle of Russia&quot; (1943, 76 min 7 s) Part I and Part II shows a history of Russia&#x27;s defense and battle against Germany. Capra&#x27;s synopsis: &quot;History of Russia; people, size, resources, wars. Death struggle against Nazi armies at gates of Moscow and Leningrad. At Stalingrad, Nazis are put through meat grinder.&quot;
# &quot;The Battle of China&quot; (1944, 62 min 16 s) shows Japanese aggression such as the Nanking Massacre and Chinese efforts such as the construction of the Burma Road and the Battle of Changsha. Capra&#x27;s synopsis: &quot;Japan&#x27;s warlords commit total effort to conquest of China. Once conquered, Japan would use China&#x27;s manpower for the conquest of &quot;all&quot; Asia.&quot;
# &quot;War Comes to America&quot; (1945, 64 min 20 s) shows how the pattern of the Axis powers&#x27; aggression turned the American people against isolationism. Capra&#x27;s synopsis: &quot;Dealt with who, what, where, why, and how we came to be the USA—the oldest major democratic republic still living under its original constitution. But the heart of the film dealt with the depth and variety of emotions with which Americans reacted to the traumatic events in Europe and Asia. How our convictions slowly changed from total non-involvement to total commitment as we realized that loss of freedom anywhere increased the danger to our own freedom. This last film of the series was, and still is, one of the most graphic visual histories of the United States ever made.&quot;

==Production==

Produced from 1942 to 1945, the seven installments range from 40 to 76 minutes in length, and all are available for free on DVD or online since they have always been public domain material by the US government. All are directed by Frank Capra and narrated by Walter Huston alongside radio actors Elliott Lewis, Harry von Zell, film actor Lloyd Nolan and others. The score is performed by the Army Air Force Orchestra.

The films employed a great deal of stock footage, including enemy propaganda (such as the Nazis&#x27; &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;) recontextualized to discredit its creators. Other scenes were performed. Animation was produced by Disney Studios. The quotation ending each film (&quot;The victory of the democracies can only be complete with the &quot;utter defeat&quot; of the war machines of Germany and Japan&quot;) is from the Army Chief of Staff George Marshall.

==Accuracy==
&quot;Prelude to War&quot; and &quot;The Battle of China&quot; refer to the &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; several times by portraying it as &quot;Japan&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;&quot; in order to raise US morale for a protracted war against Japan. The authenticity of that document is not accepted by scholars today, and it is regarded as an anti-Japanese hoax, but the &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; was widely accepted as authentic in the 1930s and the 1940s because Japanese actions corresponded so closely to its plans.

To justify the Western Allies&#x27; help to the Soviet Union, the series omitted many facts which could have cast the Soviets in a negative light, such as the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States and the Winter War. However, it shows the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact being signed and the Soviet invasion of Poland.

==Impact==

After World War I, methods used to gain support from troops and civilians needed to change. Giving speeches to soldier recruits and to the US public was no longer effective. Film became the medium of choice to persuade US soldiers and recruits on why fighting was necessary. As Kathleen German stated, &quot;this was the first massive attempt to influence opinion in the U.S. military&quot; through film. Film was also chosen because it combined the senses of sight and hearing, which gives it an advantage over radio or print. Capra, who had no experience in documentary films, was chosen because &quot;of his commitment to American ideals&quot; and because of the popularity of some of his earlier feature films. He was thought &quot;to understand the heart and soul of American audiences&quot;. Once the documentary series was completed, it was said to contain the &quot;Capra touch&quot;.

The series&#x27;s appeal was furthered by its editing. &quot;Throughout his career, Capra depended upon his skill as an editor to achieve the contrast of the individual and the group, critical in the success of his Hollywood movies.&quot; Capra thought that it would be most effective to use the enemy&#x27;s original film and propaganda in the series to expose the enemies with their own images. By taking pieces of the enemy material to edit together and placing his own narration over the results, Capra gave meaning and purpose to the war with added narrative. That &quot;parallel editing&quot; created an &quot;us vs. them&quot; image by re-framing and showing clips out of their original order and context.

By such careful editing, the films compare and contrast the forces of evil with the U.S. and its traditional values. Capra highlighted the differences between the US and the enemy and showed how the enemy would attack these values if &quot;we&quot; did not fight. That worked to create a battle not only between Allies and the Axis powers but also between good and evil. Capra treated it as a matter of showing the enormity of the Axis and the justness of the Allies.

The &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series became a heavily used means of presenting information about Axis powers for the American government during WWII. General Surles, director of the Department of War&#x27;s Bureau of Public Relations, had hoped that the series would be effective enough to allow similar kinds of army films to be shown to the general public. Surles saw that goal to be realized when US President Franklin Roosevelt watched &quot;Prelude to War&quot;, the most successful of the seven. Roosevelt considered it so important that he ordered its distribution in civilian arenas for public viewing. However, some objections were raised against the series due to its persuasiveness. Lowell Mellett, coordinator of government films and aide to Roosevelt, saw the films as dangerous. He was most concerned with the effect that the series would have after the war was over and the &quot;hysteria&quot; that it would create in its wake. At least 54 million Americans had seen the series by the end of the war, and studies were done to gauge the impact of the films. However, results were inconclusive, and so the effectiveness of the series is still disputed.

==Legacy==
Created by the US Army Pictorial Services, the films are in the public domain, and all of them are available for download on the Internet Archive.

In 2000 the US Library of Congress deemed the films &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected them for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==List of films==
==Other Capra World War II films==
Capra was involved in a number of other World War II propaganda films that were not part of the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series. He directed or co-directed the following films:
* &quot;Tunisian Victory&quot; (1944, 75 minutes) – co-directed with John Huston, Anthony Veiller, Hugh Stewart and Roy Boulting

<doc id="33909" wikidata="Q371912" url="?curid=33909" title="Wiccan Rede">
<text>The Wiccan Rede is a statement that provides the key moral system in the new religious movement of Wicca and certain other related witchcraft-based faiths. A common form of the Rede is &quot;An ye harm none, do what ye will&quot; which was taken from a longer poem also titled the Wiccan Rede.

The word &quot;rede&quot; derives from Middle English, meaning &quot;advice&quot; or &quot;counsel&quot;, and being closely related to the German or Scandinavian . &quot;An&#x27;&quot; is an archaic Middle English conjunction, meaning &quot;if.&quot; &quot;Ye&quot; is an archaic or dialectal form of &quot;you&quot; (nominative plural).

If we take meanings of An as If and Ye as You in &quot;An ye harm none, do what ye will&quot; then modern english form would be &quot;If you do no harm, do what you will.&quot;

== History ==
In its best known form as the &quot;eight words&quot; couplet, the Rede was first publicly recorded in a 1964 speech by Doreen Valiente. Other variants of the Rede include:
*&quot;Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill, An it harm none do what ye will.&quot; Note: this is the first published form of the couplet, quoted from Doreen Valiente in 1964. Later published versions include &quot;ye&quot; instead of &quot;it&quot; (as the second word, following &#x27;An&#x27;): &quot;Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill – An &#x27;ye&#x27; harm none, do what ye will&quot; (Earth Religion News, 1974); &quot;wilt&quot; rather than &quot;will&quot;: &quot;Eight words Wiccan Rede fulfill – An&#x27; it harm none, do what ye wilt&quot; (Green Egg, 1975); &quot;thou&quot; instead of &quot;ye&quot; or &quot;you&quot;, or &quot;as&quot; in place of &quot;what&quot;, or any combination, e.g. &quot;...An&#x27; (it/ye/you) harm none, do (as/what) (ye/thou/you) (wilt/will)&quot;:

Another notable antecedent was put forth by the philosopher John Stuart Mill with his &quot;harm principle&quot; in the 19th century. &quot;Mill argues that the sole purpose of law should be to stop people from harming others and that should people want to participate in victimless crimes, crimes with no complaining witness, such as gambling, drug usage, engaging in prostitution, then they should not be encroached in doing so.&quot; In addition, the first part of the phrase is strikingly similar to the Latin maxim primum non nocere (first do no harm).

===The Long Rede===
A complete twenty-six line poem entitled &quot;The Wiccan Rede&quot; was published in the Spring 1974 issue of neopagan magazine &quot;Earth Religion News&quot;. Each line contained a rhymed couplet laid out as a single line, the last line being the familiar &quot;short rede&quot; couplet beginning &quot;Eight words...&quot;.

This poem was shortly followed by another, slightly different, version, entitled the &quot;Rede of the Wiccae&quot;, which was published in &quot;Green Egg&quot; magazine by Lady Gwen Thompson. She ascribed it to her grandmother Adriana Porter, and claimed that the earlier published text was distorted from &quot;its original form&quot;. The poem has since been very widely circulated and has appeared in other versions and layouts, with additional or variant passages. It is commonly known as the &quot;Long Rede&quot;.

Although Thompson wrote that this version of the Rede was in its original form, this declaration is disputed for several reasons, but primarily as the language of the poem refers to Wiccan concepts that are not known to have existed in her grandmother&#x27;s lifetime. It is sometime ascribed to Thompson herself. Mathiesen and Theitic concluded that 18 to 20 of the verses are lore which would be common to the area of rural 17th to 19th century New England and compiled by the hand of someone who would have been born no later that the late 19th century, and that at least six of the verses which are deemed &quot;The Wiccan Verses&quot; were compiled and added by a second and later hand. Since Thompson was dispensing these 26 as a whole from around 1969 it is a reasonable assumption that hers was that second hand. Another claim is that it is adapted from a speech given by Doreen Valiente at a dinner sponsored by the Witchcraft Research Association and mentioned in volume one (1964) of the Pentagram, a United Kingdom pagan newsletter then being published. Valiente did publish a poem &quot;The Witches Creed&quot; in her 1978 book, &quot;Witchcraft for Tomorrow&quot;, which contains some similar concepts.

===Dating the Rede===
King Pausole, a character in Pierre Louÿs&#x27; &quot;Les aventures du roi Pausole&quot; (The Adventures of King Pausole, published in 1901), issued a similar pair of edicts: &quot;I. — Ne nuis pas à ton voisin. II. — Ceci bien compris, fais ce qu&#x27;il te plaît.&quot; (&quot;Do not harm your neighbor; this being well understood, do that which pleases you.&quot;) In Thelema, a similar phrase, &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law&quot;, appears in Aleister Crowley&#x27;s works by 1904, in &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Although Gardner noted the similarity of the rede to King Pausole&#x27;s words, Silver Ravenwolf believes it is more directly referencing Crowley.

According to Don Frew, Valiente composed the couplet, following Gardner&#x27;s statement that witches &quot;are inclined to the morality of the legendary Good King Pausol, &#x27;Do what you like so long as you harm none&#x27;&quot;; he claims the common assumption that the Rede that was copied from Crowley is misinformed, and has resulted in the words often being misquoted as &quot;an it harm none, do what thou wilt&quot; instead of &quot;do what you will&quot;.

Thompson&#x27;s attribution of the Long Rede to her grandmother has been disputed, since Adriana Porter died in 1946, well before Gerald Gardner published &quot;The Old Laws&quot;, and no evidence for Porter&#x27;s authorship exists other than Thompson&#x27;s word. The poem refers to Wiccan concepts that, though ostensibly very old, have not been proven to pre-date the 1940s. Its attribution to Porter may have formed part of Thompson&#x27;s claim to be a hereditary witch. Its precise origin has yet to be determined.

Adrian Bott, in an article written in &quot;White Dragon&quot; magazine, 2003, argues that the Long Rede&#x27;s creation can be placed somewhere between 1964 and 1975. Bott bases his argument on the alleged misuse of archaic English in the poem, in particular of &quot; an&#x27; &quot; as an abbreviation of &quot;and&quot;, and of &quot;ye&quot; instead of &quot;the&quot;. Bott states that the author of the poem was evidently unaware that this contraction of &quot;and&quot; is not an archaic, but a modern convention. According to Bott, in the &quot;eight words&quot; couplet originally cited by Valiente, &quot;an&#x27;&quot; is used correctly, in the Middle English sense of &quot; &#x27;in the event that&#x27;, or simply &#x27;if&#x27; &quot; (as in the Shakespearean &quot;an hadst thou not come to my bed&quot;) and thus has no apostrophe. In the poem, this has been transformed into an abbreviated &quot;and&quot; and given an apostrophe, with every &quot;and&quot; in the poem&#x27;s additional lines then being written &quot; an&#x27; &quot; as if to match. Accordingly, Bott concludes that the poem was an attempt to expand Valiente&#x27;s couplet into a full Wiccan credo, written by someone who misunderstood the archaic language they attempted to imitate.

Robert Mathiesen repeats Bott&#x27;s objection to &quot;ye&quot;, but argues that most other archaisms are used correctly. However, he states that they all derive from late 19th century revivalist usages. Based on this fact Mathiesen concludes that early twentieth century authorship of at least part of the poem is probable. He argues that its references to English folklore are consistent with Porter&#x27;s family history. His provisional conclusion is that a folkloric form of the poem may have been written by Porter, but that it was supplemented and altered by Thompson to add specifically Wiccan material. Mathiessen also takes the view that the last line was probably a Thompson addition derived from Valiente. According to this account, the 1974 variant of the text, which was published by one of Thompson&#x27;s former initiates, may represent one of the earlier drafts. Its publication prompted Thompson to publish what she – falsely, according to Mathiessen – claimed was Porter&#x27;s &quot;original&quot; poem.

==Interpretations==
The Rede is similar to a consequentialist formulation of the Golden Rule, a belief that is found in nearly every religion. Not all traditional Wiccans follow the Rede; some Gardnerians (a sect under Wicca) espouse the Charge of the Goddess as a guide for morality. Its line &quot;Keep pure your highest ideal, strive ever towards it; let naught stop you or turn you aside, for mine is the secret door which opens upon the door of youth&quot; is used as a maxim for ethical dilemmas.

There is some debate in the neopagan and Wiccan communities as to the meaning of the Rede. The debate centres on the concept of the Rede being advice, not a commandment. The rejection of specific exhortations and prohibitions of conduct such as those given in the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments and emphasis on the consequences of one&#x27;s actions makes the Rede&#x27;s character somewhat different from major religious texts such as the Bible or the Qur&#x27;an. The Rede is only a guideline which the individual must interpret to fit each particular situation and unlike most religions, which actions &quot;do harm&quot; (and which do not) are not discussed in the Rede. What exactly does and does not do harm is therefore open to personal interpretation.

The concept of ethical reciprocity is not explicitly stated, but most Wiccans interpret the Rede to imply the Golden Rule in the belief that the spirit of the Rede is to actively do good for one&#x27;s fellow humans as well as for oneself. Different sects of Wiccans read &quot;none&quot; differently. &quot;None&quot; can apply to only the self, or it may include animals and/or plants, and so forth. In essence, the Rede can be fully understood as meaning that one should always follow their true will instead of trying to obtain simple wants and to ensure that following one&#x27;s will does not harm anyone or anything. In this light, the Rede can be seen as encouraging a Wiccan to take personal responsibility for their actions.

<text>Working memory is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that can hold information temporarily. It is important for reasoning and the guidance of decision-making and behavior. Working memory is often used synonymously with short-term memory, but some theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of stored information, whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information. Working memory is a theoretical concept central to cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and neuroscience.

== History ==
The term &quot;working memory&quot; was coined by Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, and was used in the 1960s in the context of theories that likened the mind to a computer. In 1968, Atkinson and Shiffrin used the term to describe their &quot;short-term store&quot;. The term short-term store was the name previously used for working memory. Other suggested names were short-term memory, primary memory, immediate memory, operant memory, and provisional memory. Short-term memory is the ability to remember information over a brief period (in the order of seconds). Most theorists today use the concept of working memory to replace or include the older concept of short-term memory, marking a stronger emphasis on the notion of manipulating information rather than mere maintenance.

The earliest mention of experiments on the neural basis of working memory can be traced back to more than 100 years ago, when Hitzig and Ferrier described ablation experiments of the prefrontal cortex (PFC); they concluded that the frontal cortex was important for cognitive rather than sensory processes. In 1935 and 1936, Carlyle Jacobsen and colleagues were the first to show the deleterious effect of prefrontal ablation on delayed response.

== Theories ==
Numerous models have been proposed for how working memory functions, both anatomically and cognitively. Of those, the two that have been most influential are summarized below.

=== The multicomponent model ===

In 1974 Baddeley and Hitch introduced the multicomponent model of working memory. The theory proposed a model containing three components: the central executive, the phonological loop, and the visuospatial sketchpad with the central executive functioning as a control center of sorts, directing info between the phonological and visuospatial components. The central executive is responsible for, among other things, directing attention to relevant information, suppressing irrelevant information and inappropriate actions, and coordinating cognitive processes when more than one task is simultaneously performed. A &quot;central executive&quot; is responsible for supervising the integration of information and for coordinating subordinate systems responsible for the short-term maintenance of information. One subordinate system, the phonological loop (PL), stores phonological information (that is, the sound of language) and prevents its decay by continuously refreshing it in a rehearsal loop. It can, for example, maintain a seven-digit telephone number for as long as one repeats the number to oneself repeatedly. The other subordinate system, the visuospatial sketchpad, stores visual and spatial information. It can be used, for example, for constructing and manipulating visual images and for representing mental maps. The sketchpad can be further broken down into a visual subsystem (dealing with such phenomena as shape, colour, and texture), and a spatial subsystem (dealing with location).

In 2000 Baddeley extended the model by adding a fourth component, the episodic buffer, which holds representations that integrate phonological, visual, and spatial information, and possibly information not covered by the subordinate systems (e.g., semantic information, musical information). The episodic buffer is also the link between working memory and long-term memory. The component is episodic because it is assumed to bind information into a unitary episodic representation. The episodic buffer resembles Tulving&#x27;s concept of episodic memory, but it differs in that the episodic buffer is a temporary store.

=== Working memory as part of long-term memory ===
Anders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch have introduced the notion of &quot;long-term working memory&quot;, which they define as a set of &quot;retrieval structures&quot; in long-term memory that enable seamless access to the information relevant for everyday tasks. In this way, parts of long-term memory effectively function as working memory. In a similar vein, Cowan does not regard working memory as a separate system from long-term memory. Representations in working memory are a subset of representations in long-term memory. Working memory is organized into two embedded levels. The first consists of long-term memory representations that are activated. There can be many of these—there is theoretically no limit to the activation of representations in long-term memory. The second level is called the focus of attention. The focus is regarded as having a limited capacity and holds up to four of the activated representations.

Oberauer has extended Cowan&#x27;s model by adding a third component—a more narrow focus of attention that holds only one chunk at a time. The one-element focus is embedded in the four-element focus and serves to select a single chunk for processing. For example, four digits can be held in mind at the same time in Cowan&#x27;s &quot;focus of attention&quot;. When the individual wishes to perform a process on each of these digits—for example, adding the number two to each digit—separate processing is required for each digit since most individuals cannot perform several mathematical processes in parallel. Oberauer&#x27;s attentional component selects one of the digits for processing and then shifts the attentional focus to the next digit, continuing until all digits have been processed.

== Capacity ==
Working memory is widely acknowledged as having limited capacity. An early quantification of the capacity limit associated with short-term memory was the &quot;magical number seven&quot; suggested by Miller in 1956. Miller claimed that the information-processing capacity of young adults is around seven elements, referred to as &quot;chunks&quot;, regardless of whether the elements are digits, letters, words, or other units. Later research revealed this number depends on the category of chunks used (e.g., span may be around seven for digits, six for letters, and five for words), and even on features of the chunks within a category. For instance, attention span is lower for longer words than short words. In general, memory span for verbal contents (digits, letters, words, etc.) depends on the phonological complexity of the content (i.e., the number of phonemes, the number of syllables), and on the lexical status of the contents (whether the contents are words known to the person or not). Several other factors affect a person&#x27;s measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults (and fewer in children and old adults).

In the visual domain, some investigations report no fixed capacity limit with respect to the total number of items that can be held in working memory. Instead, the results argue for a limited resource that can be flexibly shared between items retained in memory (see below in Resource theories), with some items in the focus of attention being allocated more resource and recalled with greater precision.

Whereas most adults can repeat about seven digits in correct order, some individuals have shown impressive enlargements of their digit span—up to 80 digits. This feat is possible by extensive training on an encoding strategy by which the digits in a list are grouped (usually in groups of three to five) and these groups are encoded as a single unit (a chunk). For this to succeed, participants must be able to recognize the groups as some known string of digits. One person studied by Ericsson and his colleagues, for example, used an extensive knowledge of racing times from the history of sports in the process of coding chunks: several such chunks could then be combined into a higher-order chunk, forming a hierarchy of chunks. In this way, only some chunks at the highest level of the hierarchy must be retained in working memory, and for retrieval the chunks are unpacked. That is, the chunks in working memory act as retrieval cues that point to the digits they contain. Practicing memory skills such as these does not expand working memory capacity proper: it is the capacity to transfer (and retrieve) information from long-term memory that is improved, according to Ericsson and Kintsch (1995; see also Gobet &amp; Simon, 2000).

=== Measures and correlates ===
Working memory capacity can be tested by a variety of tasks. A commonly used measure is a dual-task paradigm, combining a memory span measure with a concurrent processing task, sometimes referred to as &quot;complex span&quot;. Daneman and Carpenter invented the first version of this kind of task, the &quot;reading span&quot;, in 1980. Subjects read a number of sentences (usually between two and six) and tried to remember the last word of each sentence. At the end of the list of sentences, they repeated back the words in their correct order. Other tasks that do not have this dual-task nature have also been shown to be good measures of working memory capacity. Whereas Daneman and Carpenter believed that the combination of &quot;storage&quot; (maintenance) and processing is needed to measure working memory capacity, we know now that the capacity of working memory can be measured with short-term memory tasks that have no additional processing component. Conversely, working memory capacity can also be measured with certain processing tasks that do not involve maintenance of information. The question of what features a task must have to qualify as a good measure of working memory capacity is a topic of ongoing research.

Recently, several studies of visual working memory have used delayed response tasks. These use analogue responses in a continuous space, rather than a binary (correct/incorrect) recall method, as often used in visual change detection tasks. Instead of asking participants to report whether a change occurred between the memory and probe array, delayed reproduction tasks require them to reproduce the precise quality of a visual feature, e.g. an object&#x27;s location, orientation or colour. In addition, the combination of visual perception such as within objects and colors can be used to improve memory strategy through elaboration, thus creating reinforcement within the capacity of working memory.

Measures of working-memory capacity are strongly related to performance in other complex cognitive tasks, such as reading comprehension, problem solving, and with measures of intelligence quotient.

Some researchers have argued that working-memory capacity reflects the efficiency of executive functions, most notably the ability to maintain multiple task-relevant representations in the face of distracting irrelevant information; and that such tasks seem to reflect individual differences in the ability to focus and maintain attention, particularly when other events are serving to capture attention. Both working memory and executive functions rely strongly, though not exclusively, on frontal brain areas.

Other researchers have argued that the capacity of working memory is better characterized as the ability to mentally form relations between elements, or to grasp relations in given information. This idea has been advanced, among others, by Graeme Halford, who illustrated it by our limited ability to understand statistical interactions between variables. These authors asked people to compare written statements about the relations between several variables to graphs illustrating the same or a different relation, as in the following sentence: &quot;If the cake is from France, then it has more sugar if it is made with chocolate than if it is made with cream, but if the cake is from Italy, then it has more sugar if it is made with cream than if it is made of chocolate&quot;. This statement describes a relation between three variables (country, ingredient, and amount of sugar), which is the maximum most individuals can understand. The capacity limit apparent here is obviously not a memory limit (all relevant information can be seen continuously) but a limit to how many relationships are discerned simultaneously.

=== Experimental studies of working-memory capacity ===
There are several hypotheses about the nature of the capacity limit. One is that a limited pool of cognitive resources is needed to keep representations active and thereby available for processing, and for carrying out processes. Another hypothesis is that memory traces in working memory decay within a few seconds, unless refreshed through rehearsal, and because the speed of rehearsal is limited, we can maintain only a limited amount of information. Yet another idea is that representations held in working memory interfere with each other.

====Decay theories====

The assumption that the contents of short-term or working memory decay over time, unless decay is prevented by rehearsal, goes back to the early days of experimental research on short-term memory. It is also an important assumption in the multi-component theory of working memory. The most elaborate decay-based theory of working memory to date is the &quot;time-based resource sharing model&quot;. This theory assumes that representations in working memory decay unless they are refreshed. Refreshing them requires an attentional mechanism that is also needed for any concurrent processing task. When there are small time intervals in which the processing task does not require attention, this time can be used to refresh memory traces. The theory therefore predicts that the amount of forgetting depends on the temporal density (rate and duration) of attentional demands of the processing task—this density is called &quot;cognitive load&quot;. The cognitive load depends on two variables, the rate at which the processing task requires individual steps to be carried out, and the duration of each step. For example, if the processing task consists of adding digits, then having to add another digit every half-second places a higher cognitive load on the system than having to add another digit every two seconds. In a series of experiments, Barrouillet and colleagues have shown that memory for lists of letters depends neither on the number of processing steps nor the total time of processing but on cognitive load.

====Resource theories====

Resource theories assume that the capacity of working memory is a limited resource that must be shared between all representations that need to be maintained in working memory simultaneously. Some resource theorists also assume that maintenance and concurrent processing share the same resource; this can explain why maintenance is typically impaired by a concurrent processing demand. Resource theories have been very successful in explaining data from tests of working memory for simple visual features, such as colors or orientations of bars. An ongoing debate is whether the resource is a continuous quantity that can be subdivided among any number of items in working memory, or whether it consists of a small number of discrete &quot;slots&quot;, each of which can be assigned to one memory item, so that only a limited number of about 3 items can be maintained in working memory at all.

====Interference theories====

Several forms of interference have been discussed by theorists. One of the oldest ideas is that new items simply replace older ones in working memory. Another form of interference is retrieval competition. For example, when the task is to remember a list of 7 words in their order, we need to start recall with the first word. While trying to retrieve the first word, the second word, which is represented in proximity, is accidentally retrieved as well, and the two compete for being recalled. Errors in serial recall tasks are often confusions of neighboring items on a memory list (so-called transpositions), showing that retrieval competition plays a role in limiting our ability to recall lists in order, and probably also in other working memory tasks. A third form of interference is the distortion of representations by superposition: When multiple representations are added on top of each other, each of them is blurred by the presence of all the others. A fourth form of interference assumed by some authors is feature overwriting. The idea is that each word, digit, or other item in working memory is represented as a bundle of features, and when two items share some features, one of them steals the features from the other. As more items are held in working memory, whose features begin to overlap, the more each of them will be degraded by the loss of some features.

==== Limitations ====
None of these hypotheses can explain the experimental data entirely. The resource hypothesis, for example, was meant to explain the trade-off between maintenance and processing: The more information must be maintained in working memory, the slower and more error prone concurrent processes become, and with a higher demand on concurrent processing memory suffers. This trade-off has been investigated by tasks like the reading-span task described above. It has been found that the amount of trade-off depends on the similarity of the information to be remembered and the information to be processed. For example, remembering numbers while processing spatial information, or remembering spatial information while processing numbers, impair each other much less than when material of the same kind must be remembered and processed. Also, remembering words and processing digits, or remembering digits and processing words, is easier than remembering and processing materials of the same category. These findings are also difficult to explain for the decay hypothesis, because decay of memory representations should depend only on how long the processing task delays rehearsal or recall, not on the content of the processing task. A further problem for the decay hypothesis comes from experiments in which the recall of a list of letters was delayed, either by instructing participants to recall at a slower pace, or by instructing them to say an irrelevant word once or three times in between recall of each letter. Delaying recall had virtually no effect on recall accuracy. The interference theory seems to fare best with explaining why the similarity between memory contents and the contents of concurrent processing tasks affects how much they impair each other. More similar materials are more likely to be confused, leading to retrieval competition.

== Development ==
The capacity of working memory increases gradually over childhood and declines gradually in old age.

=== Childhood ===
Measures of performance on tests of working memory increase continuously between early childhood and adolescence, while the structure of correlations between different tests remains largely constant. Starting with work in the Neo-Piagetian tradition, theorists have argued that the growth of working-memory capacity is a major driving force of cognitive development. This hypothesis has received substantial empirical support from studies showing that the capacity of working memory is a strong predictor of cognitive abilities in childhood. Particularly strong evidence for a role of working memory for development comes from a longitudinal study showing that working-memory capacity at one age predicts reasoning ability at a later age. Studies in the Neo-Piagetian tradition have added to this picture by analyzing the complexity of cognitive tasks in terms of the number of items or relations that have to be considered simultaneously for a solution. Across a broad range of tasks, children manage task versions of the same level of complexity at about the same age, consistent with the view that working memory capacity limits the complexity they can handle at a given age. One experiment has correlated that a decrease of complexity regarding capacity limits are articulated from research concerning language processes, outlining the effect on the capacity of children with language disorders, having performed lower than their age-matched peers. A correlation between memory storage deficits can be viewed as a contribution due to these language disorders, or rather the cause of the language disorder, but has not fully suggested a deficit in being able to rehearse information.

Although neuroscience studies support the notion that children rely on prefrontal cortex for performing various working memory tasks, an fMRI meta-analysis on children compared to adults performing the n back task revealed a lack of consistent prefrontal cortex activation in children, while posterior regions including the insular cortex and cerebellum remain intact.

=== Aging ===

Working memory is among the cognitive functions most sensitive to decline in old age. Several explanations for this decline have been offered. One is the processing speed theory of cognitive aging by Tim Salthouse. Drawing on the finding that cognitive processes generally slow as people grow older, Salthouse argues that slower processing leaves more time for working memory content to decay, thus reducing effective capacity. However, the decline of working memory capacity cannot be entirely attributed to slowing because capacity declines more in old age than speed. Another proposal is the inhibition hypothesis advanced by Lynn Hasher and Rose Zacks. This theory assumes a general deficit in old age in the ability to inhibit irrelevant information. Thus, working memory should tend to be cluttered with irrelevant content that reduces effective capacity for relevant content. The assumption of an inhibition deficit in old age has received much empirical support but, so far, it is not clear whether the decline in inhibitory ability fully explains the decline of working memory capacity. An explanation on the neural level of the decline of working memory and other cognitive functions in old age has been proposed by West. She argues that working memory depends to a large degree on the prefrontal cortex, which deteriorates more than other brain regions as we grow old. The prefrontal cortex hemodynamics also play an important role in the impairment of working memory through a prevalence of sleeping disorders that many older adults face but it is not the only region that is influenced since other brain regions have demonstrated an output of influence within neuroimaging studies. Within the studies of fMRI, a connection between sleep deprivation was observed through a reduction of performance on the prefrontal cortex and a overall decrease in working memory performance. Age-related decline in working memory can be briefly reversed using low intensity transcranial stimulation to synchronize rhythms in prefrontal and temporal areas.

The neurobiological bases for reduced working memory abilities has been studied in aging macaques, who naturally develop impairments in working memory and the executive functions. Research has shown that aged macaques have reduced working memory-related neuronal firing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, that arises in part from excessive cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling, which opens nearby potassium channels that weaken the glutamate synapses on spines needed to maintain persistent firing across the delay period when there is no sensory stimulation. Dysregulation of this process with age likely involves increased inflammation with age. Sustained weakness leads to loss of dendritic spines, the site of essential glutamate connections.

== Training ==
Some studies in the effects of training on working memory, including the first by Torkel Klingberg, suggest that working memory in those with ADHD can improve by training. This study found that a period of working memory training increases a range of cognitive abilities and increases IQ test scores. Another study by the same group has shown that, after training, measured brain activity related to working memory increased in the prefrontal cortex, an area that many researchers have associated with working memory functions. One study has shown that working memory training increases the density of prefrontal and parietal dopamine receptors (specifically, DRD1) in test subjects. However, subsequent experiments with the same training program have shown mixed results, with some successfully replicating, and others failing to replicate the beneficial effects of training on cognitive performance.

In another influential study, training with a working memory task (the dual n-back task) improved performance on a fluid intelligence test in healthy young adults. The improvement of fluid intelligence by training with the n-back task was replicated in 2010, but two studies published in 2012 failed to reproduce the effect. The combined evidence from about 30 experimental studies on the effectiveness of working-memory training has been evaluated by several meta-analyses. The authors of these meta-analyses disagree in their conclusions as to whether or not working-memory training improves intelligence. Yet these meta-analyses agree that, the more distant the outcome measure, the weaker is the causal link – training working memory almost always yields increases in working memory, often in attention, and sometimes in academic performance, but it is still an outstanding question what exact circumstances differs between cases of successful and unsuccessful transfer of effects.

== In the brain ==
=== Neural mechanisms of maintaining information ===
The first insights into the neuronal and neurotransmitter basis of working memory came from animal research. The work of Jacobsen and Fulton in the 1930s first showed that lesions to the PFC impaired spatial working memory performance in monkeys. The later work of Joaquin Fuster recorded the electrical activity of neurons in the PFC of monkeys while they were doing a delayed matching task. In that task, the monkey sees how the experimenter places a bit of food under one of two identical-looking cups. A shutter is then lowered for a variable delay period, screening off the cups from the monkey&#x27;s view. After the delay, the shutter opens and the monkey is allowed to retrieve the food from under the cups. Successful retrieval in the first attempt – something the animal can achieve after some training on the task – requires holding the location of the food in memory over the delay period. Fuster found neurons in the PFC that fired mostly during the delay period, suggesting that they were involved in representing the food location while it was invisible. Later research has shown similar delay-active neurons also in the posterior parietal cortex, the thalamus, the caudate, and the globus pallidus. The work of Goldman-Rakic and others showed that principal sulcal, dorsolateral PFC interconnects with all of these brain regions, and that neuronal microcircuits within PFC are able to maintain information in working memory through recurrent excitatory glutamate networks of pyramidal cells that continue to fire throughout the delay period. These circuits are tuned by lateral inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. The neuromodulatory arousal systems markedly alter PFC working memory function; for example, either too little or too much dopamine or norepinephrine impairs PFC network firing and working memory performance. A brain network analysis demonstrates that the FPC network requires less induced energy during working memory tasks than other functional brain networks. This finding underscores the efficient processing of the FPC network and highlights its crucial role in supporting working memory processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41598-024-83696-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The research described above on persistent firing of certain neurons in the delay period of working memory tasks shows that the brain has a mechanism of keeping representations active without external input. Keeping representations active, however, is not enough if the task demands maintaining more than one chunk of information. In addition, the components and features of each chunk must be bound together to prevent them from being mixed up. For example, if a red triangle and a green square must be remembered at the same time, one must make sure that &quot;red&quot; is bound to &quot;triangle&quot; and &quot;green&quot; is bound to &quot;square&quot;. One way of establishing such bindings is by having the neurons that represent features of the same chunk fire in synchrony, and those that represent features belonging to different chunks fire out of sync. In the example, neurons representing redness would fire in synchrony with neurons representing the triangular shape, but out of sync with those representing the square shape. So far, there is no direct evidence that working memory uses this binding mechanism, and other mechanisms have been proposed as well. It has been speculated that synchronous firing of neurons involved in working memory oscillate with frequencies in the theta band (4 to 8 Hz). Indeed, the power of theta frequency in the EEG increases with working memory load, and oscillations in the theta band measured over different parts of the skull become more coordinated when the person tries to remember the binding between two components of information.

=== Localization in the brain ===
Localization of brain functions in humans has become much easier with the advent of brain imaging methods (PET and fMRI). This research has confirmed that areas in the PFC are involved in working memory functions. During the 1990s much debate had centered on the different functions of the ventrolateral (i.e., lower areas) and the dorsolateral (higher) areas of the PFC. A human lesion study provides additional evidence for the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in working memory. One view was that the dorsolateral areas are responsible for spatial working memory and the ventrolateral areas for non-spatial working memory. Another view proposed a functional distinction, arguing that ventrolateral areas are mostly involved in pure maintenance of information, whereas dorsolateral areas are more involved in tasks requiring some processing of the memorized material. The debate is not entirely resolved but most of the evidence supports the functional distinction.

Brain imaging has revealed that working memory functions are not limited to the PFC. A review of numerous studies shows areas of activation during working memory tasks scattered over a large part of the cortex. There is a tendency for spatial tasks to recruit more right-hemisphere areas, and for verbal and object working memory to recruit more left-hemisphere areas. The activation during verbal working memory tasks can be broken down into one component reflecting maintenance, in the left posterior parietal cortex, and a component reflecting subvocal rehearsal, in the left frontal cortex (Broca&#x27;s area, known to be involved in speech production).

There is an emerging consensus that most working memory tasks recruit a network of PFC and parietal areas. A study has shown that during a working memory task the connectivity between these areas increases. Another study has demonstrated that these areas are necessary for working memory, and not simply activated accidentally during working memory tasks, by temporarily blocking them through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), thereby producing an impairment in task performance.

A current debate concerns the function of these brain areas. The PFC has been found to be active in a variety of tasks that require executive functions. This has led some researchers to argue that the role of PFC in working memory is in controlling attention, selecting strategies, and manipulating information in working memory, but not in maintenance of information. The maintenance function is attributed to more posterior areas of the brain, including the parietal cortex. Other authors interpret the activity in parietal cortex as reflecting executive functions, because the same area is also activated in other tasks requiring attention but not memory. Evidence from decoding studying employing multi-voxel-pattern-analysis of fMRI data showed the content of visual working memory can be decoded from activity patterns in visual cortex, but not prefrontal cortex. This led to the suggestion that the maintenance function of visual working memory is performed by visual cortex while the role of the prefrontal cortex is in executive control over working memory though it has been pointed out that such comparisons do not take into account the base rate of decoding across different regions.

A 2003 meta-analysis of 60 neuroimaging studies found left frontal cortex was involved in low-task demand verbal working memory and right frontal cortex for spatial working memory. Brodmann&#x27;s areas (BAs) 6, 8, and 9, in the superior frontal cortex was involved when working memory must be continuously updated and when memory for temporal order had to be maintained. Right Brodmann 10 and 47 in the ventral frontal cortex were involved more frequently with demand for manipulation such as dual-task requirements or mental operations, and Brodmann 7 in the posterior parietal cortex was also involved in all types of executive function.

Working memory has been suggested to involve two processes with different neuroanatomical locations in the frontal and parietal lobes. First, a selection operation that retrieves the most relevant item, and second an updating operation that changes the focus of attention made upon it. Updating the attentional focus has been found to involve the transient activation in the caudal superior frontal sulcus and posterior parietal cortex, while increasing demands on selection selectively changes activation in the rostral superior frontal sulcus and posterior cingulate/precuneus.

Articulating the differential function of brain regions involved in working memory is dependent on tasks able to distinguish these functions. Most brain imaging studies of working memory have used recognition tasks such as delayed recognition of one or several stimuli, or the n-back task, in which each new stimulus in a long series must be compared to the one presented n steps back in the series. The advantage of recognition tasks is that they require minimal movement (just pressing one of two keys), making fixation of the head in the scanner easier. Experimental research and research on individual differences in working memory, however, has used largely recall tasks (e.g., the reading span task, see below). It is not clear to what degree recognition and recall tasks reflect the same processes and the same capacity limitations.

Brain imaging studies have been conducted with the reading span task or related tasks. Increased activation during these tasks was found in the PFC and, in several studies, also in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). People performing better on the task showed larger increase of activation in these areas, and their activation was correlated more over time, suggesting that their neural activity in these two areas was better coordinated, possibly due to stronger connectivity.

=== Neural models ===
One approach to modeling the neurophysiology and the functioning of working memory is prefrontal cortex basal ganglia working memory (PBWM). In this model, the prefrontal cortex works hand-in-hand with the basal ganglia to accomplish the tasks of working memory. Many studies have shown this to be the case. One used ablation techniques in patients who had had seizures and had damage to the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Researchers found that such damage resulted in decreased capacity to carry out the executive function of working memory. Additional research conducted on patients with brain alterations due to methamphetamine use found that training working memory increases volume in the basal ganglia.

=== Effects of stress on neurophysiology ===
Working memory is impaired by acute and chronic psychological stress. This phenomenon was first discovered in animal studies by Arnsten and colleagues, who have shown that stress-induced catecholamine release in PFC rapidly decreases PFC neuronal firing and impairs working memory performance through feedforward, intracellular signaling pathways that open potassium channels to rapidly weaken prefrontal network connections. This process of rapid changes in network strength is called Dynamic Network Connectivity, and can be seen in human brain imaging when cortical functional connectivity rapidly changes in response to a stressor. Exposure to chronic stress leads to more profound working memory deficits and additional architectural changes in PFC, including dendritic atrophy and spine loss, which can be prevented by inhibition of protein kinase C signaling. fMRI research has extended this research to humans, and confirms that reduced working memory caused by acute stress links to reduced activation of the PFC, and stress increased levels of catecholamines. Imaging studies of medical students undergoing stressful exams have also shown weakened PFC functional connectivity, consistent with the animal studies. The marked effects of stress on PFC structure and function may help to explain how stress can cause or exacerbate mental illness.
The more stress in one&#x27;s life, the lower the efficiency of working memory in performing simple cognitive tasks. Students who performed exercises that reduced the intrusion of negative thoughts showed an increase in their working memory capacity. Mood states (positive or negative) can have an influence on the neurotransmitter dopamine, which in turn can affect problem solving.

=== Effects of alcohol on neurophysiology ===
Excessive alcohol use can result in brain damage which impairs working memory. Alcohol has an effect on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response. The BOLD response correlates increased blood oxygenation with brain activity, which makes this response a useful tool for measuring neuronal activity. The BOLD response affects regions of the brain such as the basal ganglia and thalamus when performing a working memory task. Adolescents who start drinking at a young age show a decreased BOLD response in these brain regions. Alcohol dependent young women in particular exhibit less of a BOLD response in parietal and frontal cortices when performing a spatial working memory task. Binge drinking, specifically, can also affect one&#x27;s performance on working memory tasks, particularly visual working memory. Additionally, there seems to be a gender difference in regards to how alcohol affects working memory. While women perform better on verbal working memory tasks after consuming alcohol compared to men, they appear to perform worse on spatial working memory tasks as indicated by less brain activity. Finally, age seems to be an additional factor. Older adults are more susceptible than others to the effects of alcohol on working memory.

== Genetics ==

=== Behavioral genetics ===
Individual differences in working-memory capacity are to some extent heritable; that is, about half of the variation between individuals is related to differences in their genes. The genetic component of variability of working-memory capacity is largely shared with that of fluid intelligence.

=== Attempts to identify individual genes ===
Little is known about which genes are related to the functioning of working memory. Within the theoretical framework of the multi-component model, one candidate gene has been proposed, namely ROBO1 for the hypothetical phonological loop component of working memory.

More recently another gene was found regarding working memory. Looking at genetically diverse mice, GPR12 was found in promoting a protein necessary for working memory. When they took mice that were performing worse on memory tests than their control mouse counterparts and increased their GPR12 proteins, those mice improved from 50% to 80%. That brought the low performance mice up to level similar to their control counterparts.

With the build up of prior work on mice such as testing the Formimidoyltransferase Cyclodeaminase (FTCD) gene in regards to the Morris water maze performance, testing out if there was a potential variation of genetic coding within the FTCD gene within humans was soon tested out. Results showed that a variation was found but varied depending on the age of the individual. In regards to the FTCD gene, it appeared that only children were affected by it. Working memory seemed to have a higher performance when the FTCD gene was present but had no similar affect to adults.

== Role in academic achievement ==
Working memory capacity is correlated with learning outcomes in literacy and numeracy. Initial evidence for this relation comes from the correlation between working-memory capacity and reading comprehension, as first observed by Daneman and Carpenter (1980) and confirmed in a later meta-analytic review of several studies. Subsequent work found that working memory performance in primary school children accurately predicted performance in mathematical problem solving. One longitudinal study showed that a child&#x27;s working memory at 5 years old is a better predictor of academic success than IQ.

A randomized controlled study of 580 children in Germany indicated that working memory training at age six had a significant positive effect in spatial working memory immediately after training, and that the effect gradually transferred to other areas, with significant and meaningful increases in reading comprehension, mathematics (geometry), and IQ (measured by Raven matrices). Additionally, a marked increase in ability to inhibit impulses was detected in the follow-up after one year, measured as a higher score in the Go-No Go task. Four years after the treatment, the effects persisted and was captured as a 16 percentage point higher acceptance rate to the academic track (German Gymnasium), as compared to the control group.

In a large-scale screening study, one in ten children in mainstream classrooms were identified with working memory deficits. The majority of them performed very poorly in academic achievements, independent of their IQ. Similarly, working memory deficits have been identified in national curriculum low-achievers as young as seven years of age. Without appropriate intervention, these children lag behind their peers. A recent study of 37 school-age children with significant learning disabilities has shown that working memory capacity at baseline measurement, but not IQ, predicts learning outcomes two years later. This suggests that working memory impairments are associated with low learning outcomes and constitute a high risk factor for educational underachievement for children. In children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and developmental coordination disorder, a similar pattern is evident.

== Relation to attention ==
There is some evidence that optimal working memory performance links to the neural ability to focus attention on task-relevant information and to ignore distractions, and that practice-related improvement in working memory is due to increasing these abilities. One line of research suggests a link between the working memory capacities of a person and their ability to control the orientation of attention to stimuli in the environment. Such control enables people to attend to information important for their current goals, and to ignore goal-irrelevant stimuli that tend to capture their attention due to their sensory saliency (such as an ambulance siren). The direction of attention according to one&#x27;s goals is assumed to rely on &quot;top-down&quot; signals from the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) that biases processing in posterior cortical areas. Capture of attention by salient stimuli is assumed to be driven by &quot;bottom-up&quot; signals from subcortical structures and the primary sensory cortices. The ability to override &quot;bottom-up&quot; capture of attention differs between individuals, and this difference has been found to correlate with their performance in a working-memory test for visual information. Another study, however, found no correlation between the ability to override attentional capture and measures of more general working-memory capacity.

== Relationship with neural disorders ==
An impairment of working memory functioning is normally seen in several neural disorders:

===ADHD===
Several authors have proposed that symptoms of ADHD arise from a primary deficit in a specific executive function (EF) domain such as working memory, response inhibition or a more general weakness in executive control. A meta-analytical review cites several studies that found significant lower group results for ADHD in spatial and verbal working memory tasks, and in several other EF tasks. However, the authors concluded that EF weaknesses neither are necessary nor sufficient to cause all cases of ADHD.

Several neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and glutamate may be involved in both ADHD and working memory. Both are associated with the frontal brain, self-direction and self-regulation, but cause–effect have not been confirmed, so it is unclear whether working memory dysfunction leads to ADHD, or ADHD distractibility leads to poor functionality of working memory, or if there is some other connection.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
Patients with Parkinson&#x27;s show signs of a reduced verbal function of working memory. They wanted to find if the reduction is due to a lack of ability to focus on relevant tasks, or a low amount of memory capacity. Twenty-one patients with Parkinson&#x27;s were tested in comparison to the control group of 28 participants of the same age. The researchers found that both hypotheses were the reason working memory function is reduced which did not fully agree with their hypothesis that it is either one or the other.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
As Alzheimer&#x27;s disease becomes more serious, less working memory functions. In addition to deficits in episodic memory, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is associated with impairments in visual short-term memory, assessed using delayed reproduction tasks. These investigations point to a deficit in visual feature binding as an important component of the deficit in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. There is one study that focuses on the neural connections and fluidity of working memory in mice brains. Half of the mice were given an injection that mimicked the effects of Alzheimer&#x27;s, and the other half were not. Then the mice were expected to go through a maze that is a task to test working memory. The study helps answer questions about how Alzheimer&#x27;s can deteriorate the working memory and ultimately obliterate memory functions.

===Huntington&#x27;s disease===
A group of researchers hosted a study that researched the function and connectivity of working memory over a 30-month longitudinal experiment. It found that there were certain places in the brain where most connectivity was decreased in pre-Huntington diseased patients, in comparison to the control group that remained consistently functional.

== Relationship with uncertainty ==
A recent study by Li and colleagues showed evidence that the same brain regions responsible for working memory are also responsible for how much humans trust those memories. In the past, studies have shown that individuals can evaluate how much they trust their own memories, but how humans can do this was largely unknown. Using spatial memory tests and fMRI scans, they processed where and when the information was being stored and used this data to determine memory errors. They also asked the participants to express how uncertain they were about their memories. With both sets of information, the researchers could conclude that memory and the trust in that memory are stored within the same brain region.

<text>William Abbot or Abbott (12 June 1790 – 1 June 1843) was an English actor, and a theatrical manager, both in England and the United States.

==Life==
Abbot was born in Chelsea just outside London, and made his first appearance on the stage at Bath in 1806, and his first London appearance in 1808, at the Haymarket Theatre, in a benefit performance. There he appeared as Frederick in an 1809 production of &quot;Lovers&#x27; Vows&quot;. At the Covent Garden Theatre in 1813, in light comedy and melodrama, he made his first definite success. He was Pylades to William Charles Macready&#x27;s Orestes in Ambrose Philips&#x27;s &quot;Distressed Mother&quot; when Macready made his first appearance there, in 1816. He created the parts of Appius Claudius in Sheridan Knowles&#x27;s &quot;Virginius&quot; (1820) and of Modus in his &quot;The Hunchback&quot; (1832).

In 1827 Abbot organized the company, including Harriet Smithson, which acted Shakespeare in Paris. His position was as stage manager; he performed at the Salle Favart, but not to plaudits. On his return to London he played Romeo to Fanny Kemble&#x27;s &quot;Juliet&quot; (1830). Two of Abbot&#x27;s melodramas, &quot;The Youthful Days of Frederick the Great&quot; (1817) and &quot;Swedish Patriotism&quot; (1819), were produced at Covent Garden.

Abbot also worked in America, where he first appeared as &quot;Mr. Beverly&quot; in an 1832 production of &quot;The Gamester&quot; at the Park Theatre in New York. Later he moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he created the New Charleston Theatre and operated it from 1837 through 1841. This theatre brought stars like Ellen Tree to the company there, but did not enjoy major success.

William Abbot probably died in New York on 7 June 1843, although some sources say that he died in Baltimore, Maryland. He had married an actress, Elizabeth Bradshaw née Buloid.

<text>Web indexing, or Internet indexing, comprises methods for indexing the contents of a website or of the Internet as a whole. Individual websites or intranets may use a back-of-the-book index, while search engines usually use keywords and metadata to provide a more useful vocabulary for Internet or onsite searching. With the increase in the number of periodicals that have articles online, web indexing is also becoming important for periodical websites.

Back-of-the-book-style web indexes may be called &quot;web site A-Z indexes&quot;. The implication with &quot;A-Z&quot; is that there is an alphabetical browse view or interface. This interface differs from that of a browse through layers of hierarchical categories (also known as a taxonomy) which are not necessarily alphabetical, but are also found on some web sites. Although an A-Z index could be used to index multiple sites, rather than the multiple pages of a single site, this is unusual.

Metadata web indexing involves assigning keywords, description or phrases to web pages or web sites within a metadata tag (or &quot;meta-tag&quot;) field, so that the web page or web site can be retrieved with a list. This method is commonly used by search engine indexing.

<doc id="33915" wikidata="Q312594" url="?curid=33915" title="William the Lion">
<text>William the Lion (), sometimes styled William I (; ) and also known by the nickname ( 1142 – 4 December 1214), reigned as King of Alba from 1165 to 1214. His almost 49-year-long reign was the longest for a Scottish monarch before the Union of the Crowns in 1603.

== Early life ==
William was born around 1142, during the reign of his grandfather King David I of Scotland. His parents were the king&#x27;s son Henry and Ada de Warenne. William was around 10 years old when his father died in 1152, making his elder brother Malcolm the heir apparent to their grandfather. From his father, William inherited the Earldom of Northumbria. David I died the next year, and William became heir presumptive to the new king, Malcolm IV. In 1157, William lost the Earldom of Northumbria to Henry II of England.

== Reign ==
Malcolm IV did not live for long, and upon his death on 9 December 1165 at age 24, William ascended the throne. The new monarch was crowned on 24 December 1165. His brother&#x27;s steward, constable, and chancellor remained in office, and William confirmed Malcolm IV&#x27;s last bequest to Dunfermline Abbey. In contrast to his deeply religious, frail brother, William was powerfully built, redheaded, and headstrong. He was an effective monarch whose reign was marred by his ill-fated attempts to regain control of his paternal inheritance of Northumbria from the Anglo-Normans.

After his accession to the throne William spent some time at the court of King Henry II; then, quarrelling with Henry, he arranged in 1168 the first definite treaty of alliance between France and Scotland.

William was then a key player in the Revolt of 1173–1174 against Henry II, which was led by Henry&#x27;s sons with some short-lived assistance from Louis VII of France. In 1174, at the Battle of Alnwick, during a raid in support of the revolt, William recklessly charged the English troops himself, shouting, &quot;Now we shall see which of us are good knights!&quot; He was unhorsed and captured by Henry&#x27;s troops led by Ranulf de Glanvill and taken in chains to Newcastle, then Northampton, and then transferred to Caen then Falaise in Normandy. Henry then sent an army to Scotland and occupied it. As ransom and to regain his kingdom, William had to acknowledge Henry as his feudal superior and agree to pay for the cost of the English army&#x27;s occupation of Scotland by taxing the Scots. The cost was equal to 40,000 Scottish marks (£26,000). The church in Scotland was also subjected to that of England. William acknowledged this by signing the Treaty of Falaise and was then allowed to return to Scotland. On 10 August 1175 he swore fealty to Henry II at York Castle and became his liege man.

The humiliation of the Treaty of Falaise triggered a revolt in Galloway which lasted until 1186 and prompted the construction of a castle at Dumfries. In 1179, meanwhile, William and his brother David personally led a force northwards into Easter Ross, establishing two further castles, north of the Beauly and Cromarty Firths: one on the Black Isle at Ederdour; and the other at Dunkeath, near the mouth of the Cromarty Firth opposite Cromarty. The aim was to discourage the Norse earls of Orkney from expanding beyond Caithness.

A further rising in 1181 involved Donald Meic Uilleim, descendant of King Duncan II. Donald briefly took over Ross; not until his death in 1187 was William able to reclaim Donald&#x27;s stronghold of Inverness. Further royal expeditions were required in 1197 and 1202 to fully neutralise the Orcadian threat.

William also quarrelled with Pope Alexander III, a quarrel which arose out of a double choice for the vacant bishopric of St Andrews. The king put forward his chaplain, Hugh, while the pope supported the archdeacon, John Scotus, who had been canonically elected. A hostile interchange followed; then after the death of Alexander in 1181 his successor, Pope Lucius III, consented to a compromise by which Hugh got the bishopric and John became bishop of Dunkeld. In 1188 William secured a papal bull which declared that the Church of Scotland was directly subject only to Rome, thus rejecting the claims to supremacy put forward by the English archbishop.

The Treaty of Falaise remained in force for the next fifteen years. Then the English king Richard the Lionheart, needing money to take part in the Third Crusade, agreed to terminate it in return for 10,000 silver marks (£6,500), on 5 December 1189. William then was able to address the turbulent chiefs in the outlying parts of his kingdom. His authority was recognized in Galloway which, hitherto, had been practically independent; he put an end to a formidable insurrection in Moray and Inverness; and a series of campaigns brought the far north, Caithness and Sutherland, under the power of the crown.

William attempted to purchase Northumbria from Richard in 1194, as he had a strong claim over it. However, his offer of 15,000 marks (£9,750) was rejected due to wanting the castles within the lands, which Richard was not willing to give. In 1200, William did homage for Northumbria, not for Scotland, to Richard&#x27;s successor, John, apparently to save face.

Despite the Scots regaining their independence, Anglo-Scottish relations remained tense during the first decade of the 13th century. In August 1209 King John decided to flex the English muscles by marching a large army to Norham (near Berwick), in order to exploit the flagging leadership of the ageing Scottish monarch. As well as promising a large sum of money, the ailing William agreed to his elder daughters marrying English nobles and, when the treaty was renewed in 1212, John apparently gained the hand of William&#x27;s only surviving legitimate son, and heir, Alexander, for his eldest daughter, Joan.

== Marriage and issue ==
Due to the terms of the Treaty of Falaise, Henry II had the right to choose William&#x27;s bride. In 1184, William attended Henry II&#x27;s court to request a marriage to Henry&#x27;s granddaughter Matilda of Saxony, daughter of Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony and Matilda of England. The proposal was referred to the pope and was forbidden on the grounds of consanguinity.

Henry instead chose Ermengarde de Beaumont, a great-granddaughter of King Henry I of England, although through an illegitimate line. They married at Woodstock Palace on 5 September 1186. Edinburgh Castle was her dowry and Henry II paid for the four days of festivities. After the wedding she was escorted to Scotland by Scottish nobles and Jocelin, Bishop of Glasgow.

The marriage was not very successful, and it was many years before they had an heir. William and Ermengarde&#x27;s children were:
# Margaret of Scotland, Countess of Kent (1193–1259), married Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent;
# Isabella of Scotland, Countess of Norfolk (1195–1263), married Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk;
# Alexander II of Scotland (1198–1249);
# Marjorie (1200–17 November 1244), married Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke.

Out of wedlock, William I had numerous illegitimate children, their descendants being among those who would lay claim to the Scottish crown.

By a daughter, name unknown, of Adam de Hythus:
# Margaret, married Eustace de Vesci, Lord of Alnwick.

By Isabel d&#x27;Avenel:
# Robert de London;
# Henry de Galightly, father of Patrick Galithly one of the competitors to the crown in 1291;
# Ada Fitzwilliam (c. 1164–1200), married Patrick I, Earl of Dunbar (c. 1152–1232); Ada predeceased her husband in 1200.
# Aufrica married William de Say, whose great-great-grandson Roger de Mandeville was one of the competitors to the crown in 1291;
# Isabella Mac William (born c. 1165) married Robert III de Brus (1183) then Robert de Ros (1191), Magna Carta suretor.

== Death and Legacy ==

William died on 4 December 1214 and was succeeded by his son Alexander.

Despite continued dependence on English goodwill, William&#x27;s reign showed much achievement. He threw himself into government with energy and diligently followed the lines laid down by his grandfather, David I. Anglo-French settlements and feudalization were extended, new burghs were founded (for example Perth in 1210), criminal law was clarified, the responsibilities of justices and sheriffs were widened, and trade grew. Traditionally, William is credited with founding Arbroath Abbey, the site of the later Declaration of Arbroath. The Bishopric of Argyll was established (c. 1192) in the same year as papal confirmation of the Scottish church by Pope Celestine III.

William was not known as &quot;the Lion&quot; during his own lifetime, and the title did not relate to his tenacious character or his military prowess. It was attached to him because of his flag or standard, a red lion rampant with a forked tail () on a yellow background. This (with the substitution of a &quot;double tressure fleury counter-fleury&quot; border instead of an orle) went on to become the Royal Banner of Scotland, still used today but quartered with those of England and of Ireland. It became attached to him because the chronicler John of Fordun called him the &quot;Lion of Justice&quot;.

<text>William the Conqueror (– 9 September 1087), sometimes called William the Bastard, was the first Norman king of England (as William I), reigning from 1066 until his death. A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.

William was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William quashed a rebellion and began to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointment of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and he secured control of the neighbouring county of Maine by 1062.

In the 1050s and early 1060s, William became a contender for the throne of England held by the childless Edward the Confessor, his first cousin once removed. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl Harold Godwinson, whom Edward named as king on his deathbed in January 1066. Arguing that Edward had previously promised the throne to him and that Harold had sworn to support his claim, William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066. He decisively defeated and killed Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts, William was crowned king on Christmas Day, 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but William&#x27;s hold was mostly secure on England by 1075, allowing him to spend the greater part of his reign in continental Europe.

William&#x27;s final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his son, Robert, and threatened invasions of England by the Danes. In 1086, he ordered the compilation of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, a survey listing all of the land-holdings in England along with their pre-Conquest and current holders. He died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in Caen. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, settling a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his domains into one empire but continued to administer each part separately. His lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to Robert, and England went to his second surviving son, William Rufus.

== Background ==

Norsemen first began raiding in what became Normandy in the late 8th century. Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when Rollo, one of the Viking leaders, and King Charles the Simple of France reached an agreement ceding the county of Rouen to Rollo. The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy. Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy. In an effort to improve matters, King Æthelred the Unready took Emma, sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy, as his second wife in 1002.

Danish raids on England continued, and Æthelred sought help from Richard, taking refuge in Normandy in 1013 when King Swein I of Denmark drove Æthelred and his family from England. Swein&#x27;s death in 1014 allowed Æthelred to return home, but Swein&#x27;s son Cnut contested Æthelred&#x27;s return. Æthelred died unexpectedly in 1016, and Cnut became king of England. Æthelred and Emma&#x27;s two sons, Edward and Alfred, went into exile in Normandy while their mother, Emma, became Cnut&#x27;s second wife.

After Cnut&#x27;s death in 1035, the English throne fell to Harold Harefoot, his son by his first wife, while Harthacnut, his son by Emma, became king in Denmark. England remained unstable. Alfred returned to England in 1036 to visit his mother and perhaps to challenge Harold as king. One story implicates Earl Godwin of Wessex in Alfred&#x27;s subsequent death, but others blame Harold. Emma went into exile in Flanders until Harthacnut became king following Harold&#x27;s death in 1040, and his half-brother Edward followed Harthacnut to England; Edward was proclaimed king after Harthacnut&#x27;s death in June 1042.

== Early life ==
William was born in 1027 or 1028 at Falaise, Duchy of Normandy, most likely towards the end of 1028. He was the only son of Robert I, son of Richard II. His mother, Herleva, was a daughter of Fulbert of Falaise, who may have been a tanner or embalmer. Herleva was possibly a member of the ducal household, but did not marry Robert. She later married Herluin de Conteville, with whom she had two sons – Odo of Bayeux and Count Robert of Mortain – and a daughter whose name is unknown. One of Herleva&#x27;s brothers, Walter, became a supporter and protector of William during his minority. Robert I also had a daughter, Adelaide, by another mistress.

Robert I succeeded his elder brother Richard III as duke on 6 August 1027. The brothers had been at odds over the succession, and Richard&#x27;s death was sudden. Robert was accused by some writers of killing Richard, a plausible but now unprovable charge. Conditions in Normandy were unsettled, as noble families despoiled the Church and Alan III of Brittany waged war against the duchy, possibly in an attempt to take control. By 1031 Robert had gathered considerable support from noblemen many of whom would become prominent during William&#x27;s life. They included the duke&#x27;s uncle Robert, the archbishop of Rouen, who had originally opposed the duke; Osbern, a nephew of Gunnor the wife of Richard I; and Gilbert of Brionne, a grandson of Richard I. After his accession, Robert continued Norman support for the English princes Edward and Alfred, who were still in exile in northern France.

Robert may have been briefly betrothed to a daughter of King Cnut, but no marriage took place. It is unclear whether William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession if Robert had had a legitimate son. Earlier dukes had been illegitimate, and William&#x27;s association with his father on ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert&#x27;s most likely heir. In 1034 the duke decided to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Although some of his supporters tried to dissuade him, he convened a council in January 1035 and had the assembled Norman magnates swear fealty to William as his heir before leaving for Jerusalem. He died in early July at Nicea, on his way back to Normandy.

=== Challenges ===

William faced several challenges on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: he was either seven or eight years old. He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as King Henry I of France, enabling him to succeed to his father&#x27;s duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke&#x27;s guardians were attempting to continue his father&#x27;s policies, but Archbishop Robert&#x27;s death in March 1037 removed one of William&#x27;s main supporters, and Normandy quickly descended into chaos.

The anarchy in the duchy lasted until 1047, and control of the young duke was one of the priorities of those contending for power. At first, Alan of Brittany had custody of the duke, but when Alan died in either late 1039 or October 1040, Gilbert of Brionne took charge of William. Gilbert was killed within months, and another guardian, Turchetil, was also killed around the time of Gilbert&#x27;s death. Yet another guardian, Osbern, was slain in the early 1040s in William&#x27;s chamber while the duke slept. It was said that Walter, William&#x27;s maternal uncle, was occasionally forced to hide the young duke in the houses of peasants, although this story may be an embellishment by Orderic Vitalis. The historian Eleanor Searle speculates that William was raised with the three cousins who later became important in his career – William fitzOsbern, Roger de Beaumont, and Roger of Montgomery. Although many of the Norman nobles engaged in their own private wars and feuds during William&#x27;s minority, the viscounts still acknowledged the ducal government, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy was supportive of William.

King Henry continued to support the young duke, but in late 1046 opponents of William came together in a rebellion centred in lower Normandy, led by Guy of Burgundy with support from Nigel, Viscount of the Cotentin, and Ranulf, Viscount of the Bessin. According to stories that may have legendary elements, an attempt was made to seize William at Valognes, but he escaped under cover of darkness, seeking refuge with King Henry. In early 1047 Henry and William returned to Normandy and were victorious at the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes near Caen, although few details of the fighting are recorded. William of Poitiers claimed that the battle was won mainly through William&#x27;s efforts, but earlier accounts claim that King Henry&#x27;s men and leadership also played an important part. William assumed power in Normandy, and shortly after the battle promulgated the Truce of God throughout his duchy, in an effort to limit warfare and violence by restricting the days of the year on which fighting was permitted. Although the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes marked a turning point in William&#x27;s control of the duchy, it was not the end of his struggle to gain the upper hand over the nobility. The period from 1047 to 1054 saw almost continuous warfare, with lesser crises continuing until 1060.

=== Consolidation of power ===

William&#x27;s next efforts were against Guy of Burgundy, who retreated to his castle at Brionne, which William besieged. After a long effort, the duke succeeded in exiling Guy in 1050. To address the growing power of the Count of Anjou, Geoffrey Martel, William joined with King Henry in a campaign against him, the last known cooperation between the two. They succeeded in capturing an Angevin fortress but accomplished little else. Geoffrey attempted to expand his authority into the county of Maine, especially after the death of Hugh IV of Maine in 1051. Central to the control of Maine were the holdings of the Bellême family, who held Bellême on the border of Maine and Normandy, as well as the fortresses at Alençon and Domfront. Bellême&#x27;s overlord was the king of France, but Domfront was under the overlordship of Geoffrey Martel and Duke William was Alençon&#x27;s overlord. The Bellême family, whose lands were quite strategically placed between their three different overlords, were able to play each of them against the other and secure virtual independence for themselves.

On the death of Hugh of Maine, Geoffrey Martel occupied Maine in a move contested by William and King Henry; eventually, they succeeded in driving Geoffrey from the county, and in the process, William secured the Bellême family strongholds at Alençon and Domfront for himself. He was thus able to assert his overlordship over the Bellême family and compel them to act consistently with Norman interests. However, in 1052 the king and Geoffrey Martel made common cause against William as some Norman nobles began to contest William&#x27;s increasing power. Henry&#x27;s about-face was probably motivated by a desire to retain dominance over Normandy, which was now threatened by William&#x27;s growing mastery of his duchy. William was engaged in military actions against his own nobles throughout 1053, as well as with the new Archbishop of Rouen, Mauger.

In February 1054 the king and the Norman rebels launched a double invasion of the duchy. Henry led the main thrust through the county of Évreux, while the other wing, under the king&#x27;s half-brother Odo, invaded eastern Normandy. William met the invasion by dividing his forces into two. The first, which he led, faced Henry. The second, which included some who became William&#x27;s firm supporters, such as Robert, Count of Eu, Walter Giffard, Roger of Mortemer, and William de Warenne, faced the other invading force. This second force defeated the invaders at the Battle of Mortemer. In addition to ending both invasions, the battle allowed the duke&#x27;s ecclesiastical supporters to depose Archbishop Mauger. Mortemer thus marked another turning point in William&#x27;s growing control of the duchy, although his conflict with the French king and the Count of Anjou continued until 1060. Henry and Geoffrey led another invasion of Normandy in 1057 but were defeated by William at the Battle of Varaville. This was the last invasion of Normandy during William&#x27;s lifetime. In 1058, William invaded the County of Dreux and took Tillières-sur-Avre and Thimert. Henry attempted to dislodge William, but the siege of Thimert dragged on for two years until Henry&#x27;s death. The deaths of Count Geoffrey and the king in 1060 cemented the shift in the balance of power towards William.

One factor in William&#x27;s favour was his marriage to Matilda of Flanders, the daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders. The union was arranged in 1049, but Pope Leo IX forbade the marriage at the Council of Rheims in October 1049. The marriage nevertheless went ahead in the early 1050s, possibly unsanctioned by the pope. According to a late source not generally considered to be reliable, papal sanction was not secured until 1059, but as papal-Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good, and Norman clergy were able to visit Rome in 1050 without incident, it was probably secured earlier. Papal sanction of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen – one by William and one by Matilda. The marriage was important in bolstering William&#x27;s status, as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories, with ties to the French royal house and to the German emperors. Contemporary writers considered the marriage, which produced four sons and five or six daughters, to be a success.

=== Appearance and character ===
No authentic portrait of William has been found; the contemporary depictions of him on the Bayeux Tapestry and on his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority. There are some written descriptions of a burly and robust appearance, with a guttural voice. He enjoyed excellent health until old age, although he became quite fat in later life. He was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina. Geoffrey Martel described him as without equal as a fighter and horseman. Examination of William&#x27;s femur, the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed, showed he was approximately tall.

There are records of two tutors for William during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of his literary education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, and there is little evidence that he sponsored scholarships or intellectual activities. Orderic Vitalis records that William tried to learn to read Old English late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up. William&#x27;s main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her – unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticised William for his greed and cruelty, but his personal piety was universally praised by contemporaries.

=== Norman administration ===

Norman government under William was similar to the government that had existed under earlier dukes. It was a fairly simple administrative system, built around the ducal household, a group of officers including stewards, butlers, and marshals. The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues. Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.

William cultivated close relations with the church in his duchy. He took part in church councils and made several appointments to the Norman episcopate, including the appointment of Maurilius as Archbishop of Rouen. Another important appointment was that of William&#x27;s half-brother, Odo, as Bishop of Bayeux in 1049 or 1050. He also relied on the clergy for advice, including Lanfranc, a non-Norman who rose to become one of William&#x27;s prominent ecclesiastical advisors from the late 1040s through the 1060s. William gave generously to the church; from 1035 to 1066, the Norman aristocracy founded at least twenty new monastic houses, including William&#x27;s two monasteries in Caen, a remarkable expansion of religious life in the duchy.

== English and continental concerns ==

In 1051 the childless King Edward of England appears to have chosen William as his successor. William was the grandson of Edward&#x27;s maternal uncle, Richard II of Normandy.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, in the &quot;D&quot; version, states that William visited England in the later part of 1051, perhaps to secure confirmation of the succession, or perhaps to secure aid for his troubles in Normandy. The trip is unlikely given William&#x27;s absorption in warfare with Anjou at the time. Whatever Edward&#x27;s wishes, it was likely that any claim by William would be opposed by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, a member of the most powerful family in England. Edward had married Edith, Godwin&#x27;s daughter, in 1043, and Godwin appears to have been one of the main supporters of Edward&#x27;s claim to the throne. By 1050, however, relations between the king and the earl had soured, culminating in a crisis in 1051 that led to the exile of Godwin and his family from England. During this exile, Edward offered the throne to William. Godwin returned from exile in 1052 with armed forces, and a settlement was reached between the king and the earl, restoring the earl and his family to their lands and replacing Robert of Jumièges, a Norman whom Edward had named Archbishop of Canterbury, with Stigand, the Bishop of Winchester. No English source mentions a supposed embassy by Archbishop Robert to William conveying the promise of the succession, and the two Norman sources that mention it, William of Jumièges and William of Poitiers, are not precise in their chronology of when this visit took place.

Count Herbert II of Maine died in 1062, and William, who had betrothed his eldest son Robert to Herbert&#x27;s sister Margaret, claimed the county through his son. Local nobles resisted the claim, but William invaded and by 1064 had secured control of the area. William appointed a Norman to the bishopric of Le Mans in 1065. He also allowed his son Robert Curthose to do homage to the new Count of Anjou, Geoffrey the Bearded. William&#x27;s western border was thus secured, but his border with Brittany remained insecure. In 1064 William invaded Brittany in a campaign that remains obscure in its details. Its effect, though, was to destabilise Brittany, forcing the duke, Conan II, to focus on internal problems rather than on expansion. Conan&#x27;s death in 1066 further secured William&#x27;s borders in Normandy. William also benefited from his campaign in Brittany by securing the support of some Breton nobles who went on to support the invasion of England in 1066.

Earl Godwin died in 1053. Harold succeeded to his father&#x27;s earldom, and another son, Tostig, became Earl of Northumbria. Other sons were granted earldoms later: Gyrth as Earl of East Anglia in 1057 and Leofwine as Earl of Kent sometime between 1055 and 1057. Some sources claim that Harold took part in William&#x27;s Breton campaign of 1064 and swore to uphold William&#x27;s claim to the English throne, but no English source reports this trip, and it is unclear if it actually occurred. It may have been Norman propaganda designed to discredit Harold, who had emerged as the main contender to succeed King Edward. Meanwhile, another contender for the throne had emerged – Edward the Exile, son of Edmund Ironside and a grandson of Æthelred II, returned to England in 1057. Although he died shortly after his return, he brought with him his family, which included two daughters, Margaret and Christina, and a son, Edgar the Ætheling.

In 1065 Northumbria revolted against Tostig, and the rebels chose Morcar, the younger brother of Edwin, Earl of Mercia, as earl. Harold, perhaps to secure the support of Edwin and Morcar in his bid for the throne, supported the rebels and persuaded King Edward to replace Tostig with Morcar. Tostig went into exile in Flanders with his wife Judith, who was the daughter of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders. Edward was ailing, and he died on 5 January 1066. It is unclear what exactly happened at Edward&#x27;s deathbed. One story, deriving from the &quot;Vita Ædwardi&quot;, a biography of Edward, claims that he was attended by his wife Edith, Harold, Archbishop Stigand, and Robert FitzWimarc, and that the king named Harold as his successor. The Norman sources do not dispute that Harold was named as the next king, but they declare that Harold&#x27;s oath and Edward&#x27;s earlier promise of the throne could not be changed on Edward&#x27;s deathbed. Later English sources stated that Harold had been elected as king by the clergy and magnates of England.

== Invasion of England ==
=== Harold&#x27;s preparations ===
Harold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward&#x27;s new Norman-style Westminster Abbey, although some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony. English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, performed the ceremony, while Norman sources state that the coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy. Harold&#x27;s claim to the throne was not entirely secure, as there were other claimants, perhaps including his exiled brother Tostig. King Harald Hardrada of Norway also had a claim to the throne as the uncle and heir of King Magnus I, who had made a pact with Harthacnut around 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed. The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations.

Harold&#x27;s brother Tostig made probing attacks along the southern coast of England in May 1066, landing at the Isle of Wight using a fleet supplied by Baldwin of Flanders. Tostig appears to have received little local support, and further raids into Lincolnshire and near the Humber met with no more success, so he retreated to Scotland. According to the Norman writer William of Jumièges, William had meanwhile sent an embassy to King Harold Godwinson to remind Harold of his oath to support William&#x27;s claim, although whether this embassy actually occurred is unclear. Harold assembled an army and a fleet to repel William&#x27;s anticipated invasion force, deploying troops and ships along the English Channel for most of the summer.

=== William&#x27;s preparations ===
William of Poitiers describes a council called by Duke William, in which the writer gives an account of a debate between William&#x27;s nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, it is unlikely that any debate took place: the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England. William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and King Sweyn II of Denmark. Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution. Although Alexander gave papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion. Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval. To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife for the duration of the invasion.
Throughout the summer, William assembled an army and an invasion fleet in Normandy. Although William of Jumièges&#x27;s claim that the ducal fleet numbered 3,000 ships is clearly an exaggeration, it was probably large and mostly built from scratch. Although William of Poitiers and William of Jumièges disagree about where the fleet was built – Poitiers states it was constructed at the mouth of the River Dives, while Jumièges states it was built at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme – both agree that it eventually sailed from Valery-sur-Somme. The fleet carried an invasion force that included, in addition to troops from William&#x27;s territories of Normandy and Maine, large numbers of mercenaries, allies, and volunteers from Brittany, northeastern France, and Flanders, together with smaller numbers from other parts of Europe. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There were probably other reasons for William&#x27;s delay, including intelligence reports from England revealing that Harold&#x27;s forces were deployed along the coast. William would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing. Harold kept his forces on alert throughout the summer, but with the arrival of the harvest season he disbanded his army on 8 September.

=== Tostig and Hardrada&#x27;s invasion ===
Tostig Godwinson and Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September 1066 and defeated the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford near York. King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at Pevensey Bay on 28 September. William then moved to Hastings, a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations. From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold&#x27;s return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line of communication with Normandy.

=== Battle of Hastings ===
After defeating Harald Hardrada and Tostig, Harold left much of his army in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion. He probably learned of William&#x27;s landing while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London for about a week before marching to Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about per day, for the distance of approximately . Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William&#x27;s scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy. Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about from William&#x27;s castle at Hastings.

The battle began at about 9 am on 14 October and lasted all day. While a broad outline is known, the exact events are obscured by contradictory accounts. Although the numbers on each side were about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few, if any, archers. The English soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge and were at first so effective that William&#x27;s army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William&#x27;s Breton troops panicked and fled, and some of the English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by Norman cavalry. During the Bretons&#x27; flight, rumours swept through the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William succeeded in rallying his troops. Two further Norman retreats were feigned, to draw the English into pursuit and expose them to repeated attacks by the Norman cavalry. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was Harold&#x27;s death, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumièges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold&#x27;s death by an arrow to the eye, but that may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories in which Harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head.

Harold&#x27;s body was identified the day after the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body. The English dead, including some of Harold&#x27;s brothers and his housecarls, were left on the battlefield. Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, Harold&#x27;s mother, offered the duke the weight of her son&#x27;s body in gold for it, but her offer was refused. William ordered the body thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Waltham Abbey, which Harold founded, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there.

=== March on London ===

William may have hoped the English would surrender following his victory, but they did not. Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the Ætheling as king, though their support for Edgar was only lukewarm. After waiting a short while, William secured Dover, parts of Kent, and Canterbury, while also sending a force to capture Winchester, where the royal treasury was. These captures secured William&#x27;s rear areas and his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed. William then marched to Southwark, across the Thames from London, which he reached in late November. Next, he led his forces around the south and west of London, burning along the way. He finally crossed the Thames at Wallingford in early December. Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to Berkhamsted soon afterwards, Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Ealdred also submitted. William then sent forces into London to construct a castle; he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.

== Consolidation ==

=== First actions ===

William remained in England after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnates. The remaining earls – Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton) – were confirmed in their lands and titles. Waltheof was married to William&#x27;s niece Judith, daughter of his half-sister Adelaide, and a marriage between Edwin and one of William&#x27;s daughters was proposed. Edgar the Ætheling also appears to have been given lands. Ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand. But the families of Harold and his brothers lost their lands, as did some others who had fought against William at Hastings. By March, William was secure enough to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof. He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, in charge of England along with another influential supporter, William fitzOsbern, the son of his former guardian. Both men were also named to earldoms – fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent. Although he put two Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English sheriffs. Once in Normandy the new English king went to Rouen and the Abbey of Fecamp, and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries.

While William was in Normandy, a former ally, Eustace, the Count of Boulogne, invaded at Dover but was repulsed. English resistance had also begun, with Eadric the Wild attacking Hereford and revolts at Exeter, where Harold&#x27;s mother Gytha was a focus of resistance. FitzOsbern and Odo found it difficult to control the native population and undertook a programme of castle-building to maintain their hold on the kingdom. William returned to England in December 1067 and marched on Exeter, which he besieged. The town held out for 18 days. After it fell to William he built a castle to secure his control. Harold&#x27;s sons were meanwhile raiding the southwest of England from a base in Ireland. Their forces landed near Bristol but were defeated by Eadnoth. By Easter, William was at Winchester, where he was soon joined by his wife Matilda, who was crowned in May 1068.

=== English resistance ===

In 1068 Edwin and Morcar rose in revolt, supported by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. Orderic Vitalis states that Edwin&#x27;s reason for revolting was that the proposed marriage between himself and one of William&#x27;s daughters had not taken place, but another reason probably included the increasing power of fitzOsbern in Herefordshire, which affected Edwin&#x27;s power within his own earldom. The king marched through Edwin&#x27;s lands and built Warwick Castle. Edwin and Morcar submitted, but William continued on to York, building York and Nottingham Castles before returning south. On his southbound journey, he began constructing Lincoln, Huntingdon, and Cambridge Castles. William placed supporters in charge of these new fortifications – among them William Peverel at Nottingham and Henry de Beaumont at Warwick – then returned to Normandy late in 1068.

Early in 1069, Edgar the Ætheling revolted and attacked York. Although William returned to York and built another castle, Edgar remained free, and in the autumn he joined up with King Sweyn. The Danish king had brought a large fleet to England and attacked not only York but Exeter and Shrewsbury. York was captured by the combined forces of Edgar and Sweyn. Edgar was proclaimed king by his supporters. William responded swiftly, ignoring a continental revolt in Maine, and symbolically wore his crown in the ruins of York on Christmas Day 1069. He then bought off the Danes. He marched to the River Tees, ravaging the countryside as he went. Edgar, having lost much of his support, fled to Scotland, where King Malcolm III was married to Edgar&#x27;s sister Margaret. Waltheof, who had joined the revolt, submitted, along with Gospatric, and both were allowed to retain their lands. William marched over the Pennines during the winter and defeated the remaining rebels at Shrewsbury before building Chester and Stafford Castles. This campaign, which included the burning and destruction of part of the countryside that the royal forces marched through, is usually known as the &quot;Harrying of the North&quot;; it was over by April 1070, when William wore his crown ceremonially for Easter at Winchester.

=== Church affairs ===

While at Winchester in 1070, William met with three papal legates – John Minutus, Peter, and Ermenfrid of Sion – who had been sent by the pope. The legates ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court. The historian David Bates sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal &quot;seal of approval&quot; for William&#x27;s conquest. The legates and the king then held a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganising the English church. Stigand and his brother, Æthelmær, the Bishop of Elmham, were deposed from their bishoprics. Some of the native abbots were also deposed, both at the council held near Easter and at a further one near Whitsun. The Whitsun council saw the appointment of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas of Bayeux as the new Archbishop of York, to replace Ealdred, who had died in September 1069. William&#x27;s half-brother Odo perhaps expected to be appointed to Canterbury, but William probably did not wish to give that much power to a family member. Another reason for the appointment may have been pressure from the papacy to appoint Lanfranc. Norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbots, and at the end of the process, only native English bishops remained in office, along with several continental prelates appointed by Edward the Confessor. In 1070 William also founded Battle Abbey, a new monastery at the site of the Battle of Hastings, partly as a penance for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to the dead. At an ecclesiastical council held in Lillebonne in 1080, he was confirmed in his ultimate authority over the Norman church.

== Troubles in England and on the Continent ==

=== Danish raids and rebellion ===

Although Sweyn had promised to leave England, he returned in early 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the Isle of Ely, where he joined up with Hereward the Wake, a local thegn. Hereward&#x27;s forces captured and looted Peterborough Abbey. William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070, allowing him to return to the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the town of Le Mans had revolted in 1069. Another concern was the death of Count Baldwin VI of Flanders in July 1070, which led to a succession crisis as his widow, Richilde, was ruling for their two young sons, Arnulf and Baldwin. Her rule was contested by Robert, Baldwin&#x27;s brother. Richilde proposed marriage to William fitzOsbern, who was in Normandy, and fitzOsbern accepted. But after he was killed in February 1071 at the Battle of Cassel, Robert became count. He was opposed to King William&#x27;s power on the continent, thus the Battle of Cassel upset the balance of power in northern France and cost William an important supporter.

In 1071 William defeated the last rebellion of the north. Earl Edwin was betrayed by his own men and killed, while William built a causeway to subdue the Isle of Ely, where Hereward the Wake and Morcar were hiding. Hereward escaped, but Morcar was captured, deprived of his earldom, and imprisoned. In 1072 William invaded Scotland, defeating Malcolm, who had recently invaded the north of England. William and Malcolm agreed to peace by signing the Treaty of Abernethy, and Malcolm probably gave up his son Duncan as a hostage for the peace. Perhaps another stipulation of the treaty was the expulsion of Edgar the Ætheling from Malcolm&#x27;s court. William then turned his attention to the continent, returning to Normandy in early 1073 to deal with the invasion of Maine by Fulk le Rechin, the Count of Anjou. With a swift campaign, William seized Le Mans from Fulk&#x27;s forces, completing the campaign by 30 March 1073. This made William&#x27;s power more secure in northern France, but the new count of Flanders accepted Edgar the Ætheling into his court. Robert also married his half-sister Bertha to King Philip I of France, who was opposed to Norman power.

William returned to England to release his army from service in 1073 but quickly returned to Normandy, where he spent all of 1074. He left England in the hands of his supporters, including Richard fitzGilbert and William de Warenne, as well as Lanfranc. William&#x27;s ability to leave England for an entire year was a sign that he felt that his control of the kingdom was secure. While William was in Normandy, Edgar the Ætheling returned to Scotland from Flanders. The French king, seeking a focus for those opposed to William&#x27;s power, proposed that Edgar be given the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer on the Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William. However, Edgar was forced to submit to William shortly thereafter, and he returned to William&#x27;s court. Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, turned his attentions to Brittany, leading to a revolt in 1075.

=== Revolt of the Earls ===

In 1075, during William&#x27;s absence, Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk, and Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, conspired to overthrow William in the &quot;Revolt of the Earls&quot;. Ralph was at least part Breton and had spent most of his life prior to 1066 in Brittany, where he still had lands. Roger was a Norman, son of William fitzOsbern, but had inherited less authority than his father held. Ralph&#x27;s authority seems also to have been less than his predecessors in the earldom, and this was likely the cause of his involvement in the revolt.

The exact reason for the rebellion is unclear. It was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger, held at Exning in Suffolk. Waltheof, the earl of Northumbria, although one of William&#x27;s favourites, was involved, and some Breton lords were ready to rebel in support of Ralph and Roger. Ralph also requested Danish aid. William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt. Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by Wulfstan, the Bishop of Worcester, and Æthelwig, the Abbot of Evesham. Ralph was bottled up in Norwich Castle by the combined efforts of Odo of Bayeux, Geoffrey de Montbray, Richard fitzGilbert, and William de Warenne. Ralph eventually left Norwich in the control of his wife and left England, ending up in Brittany. Norwich was besieged and surrendered, with the garrison allowed to go to Brittany. Meanwhile, the Danish king&#x27;s brother, Cnut, had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships, but Norwich had already surrendered. The Danes raided along the coast before returning home. William returned to England later in 1075 to deal with the Danish threat, leaving his wife Matilda in charge of Normandy. He celebrated Christmas at Winchester and dealt with the aftermath of the rebellion. Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison, where Waltheof was executed in May 1076. Before this, William had returned to the continent, where Ralph had continued the rebellion from Brittany.

=== Troubles at home and abroad ===

Earl Ralph had secured control of the castle at Dol, and in September 1076 William advanced into Brittany and laid siege to the castle. King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at the Battle of Dol in 1076, forcing him to retreat to Normandy. Although this was William&#x27;s first defeat in battle, it did little to change things. An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack. More serious was the retirement of Simon de Crépy, the Count of Amiens, to a monastery. Before he became a monk, Simon handed his county of the Vexin over to King Philip. The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William. William was able to make peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078.

In late 1077 or early 1078 trouble began between William and his eldest son, Robert. Although Orderic Vitalis describes it as starting with a quarrel between Robert and his younger brothers William and Henry, including a story that the quarrel was started when William and Henry threw water at Robert, it is much more likely that Robert was feeling powerless. Orderic relates that he had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuffed. The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men, many of them the sons of William&#x27;s supporters. Included among them were Robert of Belleme, William de Breteuil, and Roger, the son of Richard fitzGilbert. This band went to the castle at Remalard, where they proceeded to raid into Normandy. The raiders were supported by many of William&#x27;s continental enemies. William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard, but King Philip gave them the castle at Gerberoi, where they were joined by new supporters. William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079. After three weeks, the besieged forces sallied from the castle and took the besiegers by surprise. William was unhorsed by Robert and was only saved from death by an Englishman, Toki son of Wigod, who was himself killed. William&#x27;s forces were forced to lift the siege, and the king returned to Rouen. By 12 April 1080, William and Robert had reached an accommodation, with William once more affirming that Robert would receive Normandy when he died.

Word of William&#x27;s defeat at Gerberoi stirred up difficulties in northern England. In August and September 1079 King Malcolm of Scots raided south of the River Tweed, devastating the land between the River Tees and the Tweed in a raid that lasted almost a month. The lack of Norman response appears to have caused the Northumbrians to grow restive, and in the spring of 1080 they rebelled against the rule of Walcher, the Bishop of Durham and Earl of Northumbria. Walcher was killed on 14 May 1080, and the king dispatched his half-brother Odo to deal with the rebellion. William departed Normandy in July 1080, and in the autumn his son Robert was sent on a campaign against the Scots. Robert raided into Lothian and forced Malcolm to agree to terms, building the &#x27;new castle&#x27; at Newcastle upon Tyne while returning to England. The king was at Gloucester for Christmas 1080 and at Winchester for Whitsun in 1081, ceremonially wearing his crown on both occasions. A papal embassy arrived in England during this period, asking that William do fealty for England to the papacy, a request that he rejected. William also visited Wales in 1081, although the English and the Welsh sources differ on the purpose of the visit. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; states that it was a military campaign, but Welsh sources record it as a pilgrimage to St Davids in honour of Saint David. William&#x27;s biographer David Bates argues that the former explanation is more likely: the balance of power had recently shifted in Wales and William would have wished to take advantage of this to extend Norman power. By the end of 1081, William was back on the continent, dealing with disturbances in Maine. Although he led an expedition into Maine, the result was instead a negotiated settlement arranged by a papal legate.

=== Last years ===

Sources for William&#x27;s actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the historian David Bates, this probably means that little of note happened, and that because William was on the continent, there was nothing for the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; to record. In 1082, William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope and that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William&#x27;s vassals to join Odo in an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered tampering with the king&#x27;s authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William&#x27;s reign, his lands were not confiscated. In 1083, William&#x27;s son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Queen Matilda on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.

Maine continued to be difficult, with a rebellion by Hubert de Beaumont-au-Maine, probably in 1084. Hubert was besieged in his castle at Sainte-Suzanne by William&#x27;s forces for at least two years, but he eventually made peace with the king and was restored to favour. William&#x27;s movements during 1084 and 1085 are unclear – he was in Normandy at Easter 1084 but may have been in England before then to collect the danegeld assessed that year for the defence of England against an invasion by King Cnut IV of Denmark. Although English and Norman forces remained on alert throughout 1085 and into 1086, the invasion threat was ended by Cnut&#x27;s death in July 1086.

=== Changes in England ===


As part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built – among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower. These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures.

At first, most of the newly settled Normans kept household knights and did not settle their retainers with fiefs of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, a process known as subinfeudation. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was a departure from the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the hide.

By William&#x27;s death, after weathering a series of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy had been replaced by Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. Although some of the newly rich Normans in England came from William&#x27;s close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds. William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.

The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury says that the king also seized and depopulated many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal New Forest to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians have concluded that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the New Forest comprises poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic studies have shown that it was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.

=== Administration ===


After 1066, William did not attempt to integrate his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as duke. When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made – further evidence that the various parts of William&#x27;s lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.

William took over an English government that was more complex than the Norman system. England was divided into shires or counties, which were further divided into either hundreds or wapentakes. Each shire was administered by a royal official called a sheriff, who roughly had the same status as a Norman viscount. A sheriff was responsible for royal justice and collecting royal revenue. To oversee his expanded domain, William was forced to travel even more than he had as duke. He crossed back and forth between the continent and England at least 19 times between 1067 and his death. William spent most of his time in England between the Battle of Hastings and 1072; after that, he spent the majority of his time in Normandy. Government was still centred on William&#x27;s household; when he was in one part of his realms, decisions would be made for other parts of his domains and transmitted through a communication system that made use of letters and other documents. William also appointed deputies who could make decisions while he was absent, especially if the absence was expected to be lengthy. Usually, this was a member of William&#x27;s close family – frequently his half-brother Odo or his wife Matilda. Sometimes deputies were appointed to deal with specific issues.

William continued the collection of danegeld, a land tax. This was an advantage for William and the only universal tax collected by western European rulers during this period. It was an annual tax based on the value of landholdings and could be collected at differing rates. Most years saw the rate of two shillings per hide, but in crises, it could be increased to as much as six shillings per hide. Coinage across his domains continued to be minted in different cycles and styles. English coins were generally of high silver content, with high artistic standards, and were required to be re-minted every three years. Norman coins had a much lower silver content, were often of poor artistic quality, and were rarely re-minted. In England, no other coinage was allowed, while on the continent other coinage was considered legal tender. Nor is there evidence that many English pennies were circulating in Normandy, which shows little attempt to integrate the monetary systems of England and Normandy.

Besides taxation, William&#x27;s large landholdings throughout England strengthened his rule. As King Edward&#x27;s heir, he controlled all of the former royal lands. He also retained control of much of the lands of Harold and his family, which made the king the largest secular landowner in England by a wide margin.

=== Domesday Book ===

At Christmas 1085, William ordered the compilation of a survey of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout his kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted in a work now known as the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, its tax assessment, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included. The whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. William&#x27;s motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.

== Death and aftermath ==

William left England towards the end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the continent he married his daughter Constance to Duke Alan of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William&#x27;s son Robert, still allied with the French king, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of his saddle. He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened. The other, the &quot;De obitu Willelmi&quot;, or &quot;On the Death of William&quot;, has been shown to be a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.

William left Normandy to Robert, and the custody of England was given to William&#x27;s second surviving son, also called William, on the assumption that he would become king. The youngest son, Henry, received money. After entrusting England to his second son, the elder William sent the younger William back to England on 7 or 8 September, bearing a letter to Lanfranc ordering the archbishop to aid the new king. Other bequests included gifts to the Church and money to be distributed to the poor. William also ordered that all of his prisoners be released, including his half-brother Odo.

Disorder followed William&#x27;s death; everyone who had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired to be buried in his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations, the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.

William&#x27;s grave is marked by a marble slab with a Latin inscription dating from the early 19th century. The tomb has been disturbed several times since 1087, the first time in 1522 when the grave was opened on orders from the papacy. The intact body was restored to the tomb at that time, but in 1562, during the French Wars of Religion, the grave was reopened and the bones scattered and lost, with the exception of one thigh bone. This lone relic was reburied in 1642 with a new marker, which was replaced 100 years later with a more elaborate monument. This tomb was again destroyed during the French Revolution but was eventually replaced with the current ledger stone.

== Legacy ==

The immediate consequence of William&#x27;s death was a war between his sons Robert and William over control of England and Normandy. Even after the younger William&#x27;s death in 1100 and the succession of his youngest brother Henry as king, Normandy and England remained contested between the brothers until Robert&#x27;s capture by Henry at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106. The difficulties over the succession led to a loss of authority in Normandy, with the aristocracy regaining much of the power they had lost to the elder William. His sons also lost much of their control over Maine, which revolted in 1089 and managed to remain mostly free of Norman influence thereafter.

The impact on England of William&#x27;s conquest was profound; changes in the Church, aristocracy, culture, and language of the country have persisted into modern times. The Conquest brought the kingdom into closer contact with France and forged ties that lasted throughout the Middle Ages. Another consequence of William&#x27;s invasion was the sundering of the formerly close ties between England and Scandinavia. William&#x27;s government blended elements of the English and Norman systems into a new one that laid the foundations of the later medieval English kingdom. How abrupt and far-reaching the changes were is still a matter of debate among historians, with some such as Richard Southern claiming that the Conquest was the single most radical change in European history between the Fall of Rome and the 20th century. Others, such as H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, see the changes as much less radical. The historian Eleanor Searle describes William&#x27;s invasion as &quot;a plan that no ruler but a Scandinavian would have considered&quot;.

William&#x27;s reign has caused historical controversy since before his death. William of Poitiers wrote glowingly of William&#x27;s reign and its benefits, but the obituary notice for William in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; condemns William in harsh terms. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, Archbishop Matthew Parker saw the Conquest as having corrupted a purer English Church, which Parker attempted to restore. During the 17th and 18th centuries, some historians and lawyers saw William&#x27;s reign as imposing a &quot;Norman yoke&quot; on the native Anglo-Saxons, an argument that continued during the 19th century with further elaborations along nationalistic lines. These controversies have led to William being seen by some historians either as one of the creators of England&#x27;s greatness or as inflicting one of the greatest defeats in English history. Others have viewed him as an enemy of the English constitution, or alternatively as its creator.

== Family and children ==
William and his wife Matilda had at least nine children. The birth order of the sons is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters.

# Robert was born between 1051 and 1054, died on 10 February 1134. Duke of Normandy, married Sybilla, daughter of Geoffrey, Count of Conversano.
# Richard was born before 1056, died around 1075.
# William was born between 1056 and 1060, died on 2 August 1100. King of England, killed in the New Forest.
# Henry was born in late 1068, and died on 1 December 1135. King of England, married Edith, daughter of Malcolm III of Scotland. His second wife was Adeliza of Louvain.
# Adeliza (or Adelida, Adelaide) died before 1113, reportedly betrothed to Harold Godwinson, probably a nun of Saint Léger at Préaux.
# Cecilia (or Cecily) was born before 1066, died 1127, Abbess of Holy Trinity, Caen.
# Matilda was born around 1061, died perhaps about 1086. Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a daughter of William.
# Constance died 1090, married Alan IV, Duke of Brittany.
# Adela died 1137, married Stephen, Count of Blois.
# (Possibly) Agatha, the betrothed of Alfonso VI of León and Castile.

There is no evidence of any illegitimate children born to William.
