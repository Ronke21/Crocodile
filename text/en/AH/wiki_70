<text>The Second Book of Nephi (), usually referred to as Second Nephi or 2 Nephi, is the second book of the Book of Mormon, the primary religious text of the Latter-day Saint Movement. Narrated by Nephi, son of Lehi, unlike the first Book of Nephi, 2 Nephi contains little history of the Nephite people and focuses predominately on visions and prophecies of Nephi himself and other prophets, particularly Isaiah.

The book begins with Lehi&#x27;s blessings and final teachings to his family before his death. Lehi explores themes of cosmological dualism (&quot;opposition&quot;), the Fall of man, resurrection, and atonement. After Lehi&#x27;s death the family splits into two factions: the Nephites, led by Nephi, and the Lamanites led by Nephi&#x27;s older brother Laman. The Nephites are forced to flee their original settlement and the Lamanites are cursed by God with a &quot;skin of blackness&quot;. The Nephites build a temple and follow the Law of Moses. Nephi and his younger brother Jacob preach, extensively quoting and analyzing the Book of Isaiah, often word-for-word from the King James Version of the Bible.

== Structure ==
Second Nephi was originally called the Book of Nephi and was divided into 33 chapters. Later, Oliver Cowdery added First and Second to the titles of the books of Nephi. In the first five chapters, which comprise the narrative section of the book, Nephi continues with the family meeting begun in the end of First Nephi. Much of the rest of Second Nephi includes quotations from Isaiah and further teachings from Nephi and his brother Jacob. Joseph Spencer explains that the simple structure of 2 Nephi is as follows: the division of Lehi’s descendants (chapters 1–5), teachings concerning reconciliation with God (chapters 6–30), and discussion on baptism (chapters 31–33).

==Narration==

===Lehi&#x27;s last counsel===

Second Nephi begins with a reminder that Lehi had warned of Jerusalem’s destruction and that his family had been purposefully led to safety. In the narrative, Lehi receives a vision confirming that Jerusalem has been destroyed; his family also learns the &quot;promised land&quot; they were led to is their inheritance as long as they follow God.

Lehi advises each of his sons to follow Nephi’s leadership, particularly Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael. He then blesses Zoram, as a friend of Nephi, saying that his descendants will flourish if they are righteous. Lehi then blesses Jacob, promising that his suffering will be consecrated; he also speaks to him about the Atonement with a focus on opposition and how both good and bad things are important in life. He teaches all of his sons that the Fall of Man was necessary for humans to progress past their original innocent state and have children, emphasizing that all have their own right to choose for themselves. After blessing Jacob, Lehi speaks to Joseph. In his blessing, he says that Joseph&#x27;s descendants will not be completely destroyed. Further, he cites a prophecy from Joseph of Egypt, which is contained in the brass plates and predicts that God will prepare a seer named Joseph. This seer, Lehi explains, has ancestral connections to both Joseph of Egypt and Joseph, son of Lehi, and will bring the knowledge of the covenant back to Lehi’s descendants. Lehi also reveals that Joseph of Egypt prophesied of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt. Lehi proceeds to bless Laman and Lemuel’s children so that their people will never become extinct. Afterward, he blesses Ishmael’s sons, Sam, and Sam’s family. Nephi does not describe any specific personal blessings he might have received at this time.

===Division of the people===
Lehi dies sometime after giving these blessings to his family and Nephi follows the account with his own words. In his psalm, Nephi records his struggles with sin and remembers some of the times God has saved him. Later, Laman, Lemuel, and Ishmael’s descendants are upset about Nephi being chosen as their leader and try to kill him. He prays about Laman and Lemuel’s murmuring and dissent and is told by God to take his family into the wilderness. In response, he takes the brass plates, the Liahona, and Laban’s sword, and leaves with Zoram, Sam, Jacob, Joseph, and his sisters. This group becomes the Nephites. They work and are obedient to the commandments and build a temple modeled after Solomon’s. Nephi chooses not to be king but continues to help his people. He makes swords based on the sword of Laban for protection in case the Lamanites attack. The Lamanites are cut off from God, cursed, and given a “skin of blackness” to make them “loathsome” to the Nephites unless they repent. Nephi consecrates Jacob and Joseph as priests and teachers, and the Nephites &quot;live after the manner of happiness.&quot;

===Jacob&#x27;s sermon===
In chapters 6–10, Jacob gives a two-day sermon that includes many words from Isaiah 49:22–52:2 in which he invites the people to compare Isaiah’s teachings to their own experiences. He preaches about &quot;the Holy One of Israel,&quot; God’s plan, the consequences of sin, resurrection, judgment, deliverance from hell, and the righteous&#x27; inheritance of God’s kingdom. In his sermon, Jacob warns the prideful wealthy, those who think their intellect sets them above God’s teachings, and various others who ignore God; he states that in these conditions they cannot be saved. He then speaks of the Jews, Gentiles, and descendants of Lehi in the last days before Christ’s coming and explains that the Gentiles will be counted as part of the house of Israel. He also teaches that after Israel is scattered, descendants of the house of Israel who repent and believe will be subsequently restored to their lands. The land Lehi’s family has come to is a land of inheritance and is promised as a land of liberty. Jacob ends with the instruction to turn to God and choose eternal life.

===Nephi quotes Isaiah, prophesies, and gives final counsel===
Nephi too writes of likening the words of Isaiah to the Nephites and says that the purpose of the Mosaic covenant is to show that Christ will come. Nephi claims that his entire life and the purpose of his writings is to witness of Christ and be an example so people can receive the blessings of the covenant. Many of the next Isaiah quotations, found in chapters 12–24, focus on judgment, restoration, and the Messiah.

In chapters 25–33, Nephi himself prophesies, still including words from Isaiah. He continues with a focus on the Messiah and then turns to false churches of the future and people fighting against Zion, as well as the emergence of the Book of Mormon. He predicts that churches in the “last days” will be prideful and spread false teachings and warns churches against priestcraft, telling them not to keep the free blessings of the gospel away from anyone. Nephi explains that the &quot;great and abominable&quot; church will fall and as such records many warnings against sin and its consequences. Nephi also predicts that the Jews, Nephites, and the lost Israelites will eventually receive and have access to each others’ writings. He prophesies of the return of the Gospel to Lehi’s descendants and speaks again on restoration. He says that to be saved, one must repent, be baptized in the name of Christ, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. He explains again the importance of the words of Christ and ends by inviting the reader to pray in order to believe in Christ and know that his words are true.

== Interpretation ==

=== Break between First and Second Nephi ===
Different theories have emerged as to why Nephi&#x27;s two books seem to break in the middle of a family event. Frederick Axelgard, Latter-day Saint and Senior Fellow at the Wheatley Institute, suggests the account would be better divided at 2 Nephi 5, which generally marks the end of Nephi&#x27;s historical narrative. Political science professor and apologist Noel B. Reynolds writes that the first five chapters of Second Nephi seem to be establishing Nephi&#x27;s authority and leadership qualifications.

Alternatively, literary scholar Terryl Givens proposes the interruption of the timeline was purposeful to emphasize an important theme of covenants in the Book of Mormon. Lehi&#x27;s vision confirms Jerusalem and its temple have been destroyed, says Givens, and triggers subsequent explanations to show the family they are still a covenant people to God and that the Israelites will not be lost forever. These are ideas that Givens connects to Moroni&#x27;s introductory thematic statement on the purpose of the Book of Mormon. He also suggests that Lehi&#x27;s blessings to his children and many of the Isaiah quotations are aimed at this same purpose and show the family they are part of the covenant as long as they don&#x27;t reject the Messiah.

=== Dark skin of the Lamanites a curse===

2 Nephi 5:21 describes the Lamanites as being cursed and marked with a &quot;skin of blackness&quot; because of their unbelief in order to make them less attractive to the Nephites. In 2 Nephi 30:6, the Lamanites are promised to become &quot;pure and delightsome&quot; (a passage that was &quot;white and delightsome&quot; before 1981). In a book about Mormon conceptions of race, sociologist Armand Mauss writes that modern secular readers see these passages as referring to race, and interpret them as reflecting the 19th-century racism of the day. Mauss argues that &quot;white&quot; was &quot;almost always&quot; a synonym for pure and clean in the Book of Mormon&#x27;s original text, but acknowledges that these verses informed the prevailing image of Lamanites as savage Indians who ought to be assimilated among mid-19th-century Latter-day Saints. Mauss calls for a nonracist interpretation of the verses in 2 Nephi. Since the Nephites and Lamanites are both descended from Lehi, he argues, their main differences are cultural, not racial. 2 Nephi 26:33 states that &quot;all are alike unto God,&quot; specifically referring to &quot;black and white, bond and free.&quot; Mauss interprets it as a &quot;repudiation of racism in divine affairs.&quot; In another book on race and the early LDS Church, Max Mueller writes that this purported universalist idea is &quot;rooted in the limitations of whiteness as a universal racial category, a reality of which the Book of Mormon itself seems to be aware.&quot; In his &quot;Annotated Book of Mormon&quot;, Grant Hardy writes that modern readers are justifiably distressed by the Lamanites being marked with a dark skin. Hardy writes that skin color does not prevent the Lamanites from exceeding Nephites in righteousness, and the curse comes with a promise that their lineage will be preserved, while the Nephites eventually die out.

===Atonement in 2 Nephi===
Lehi&#x27;s discussion with Jacob in 2 Nephi 2 is doctrinally rich and frequently used in theological discussion of the atonement in Latter-day Saint thought. 2 Nephi 2 contains the first mention of &quot;atone&quot; in the Book of Mormon. Writing for &quot;Dialogue&quot;, Jacob Morgan cites two scriptures from 2 Nephi 2 to support his unorthodox argument that the atonement gave mankind the light of Christ, or a conscience, which prevents humans from choosing &quot;eternal death&quot; (verse 29). Having a conscience makes humans free to &quot;act for themselves&quot; (verse 26) and gives them agency. In his chapter on the atonement in the Book of Mormon, Nicholas J. Frederick, an associate professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University argues that ideas from multiple atonement theories are present in the Book of Mormon and gives two examples from 2 Nephi. He writes that 2 Nephi 2:6–10 can support the governmental theory of atonement, where Christ&#x27;s atonement satisfied the demands of justice. This passage does not mention Christ&#x27;s suffering in Gethsemane (wherein many Latter-day Saints believe the payment for sins occurred) but only his death and resurrection. Later, Jacob&#x27;s sermon in 2 Nephi 9:7–12 seems to support a Christus Victor theory, where Christ&#x27;s death was a ransom paid to Satan. Jacob describes how Christ&#x27;s atonement was infinite in 2 Nephi 9:25–26, and allows God to show mercy. Frederick gives a caveat that these interpretations may require imposing too much of previous theories on the text.

===The Fall in 2 Nephi===

In 2 Nephi 2, Lehi&#x27;s articulation of the fall of man reinterprets it as a necessary component of God&#x27;s plans for human salvation. 2 Nephi 2:18 identifies &quot;the serpent&quot; as the devil.

According to literary critic Michael Austin, 2 Nephi describes prelapsarian reproduction as impossible, making the fall a prerequisite for procreation. According to biblical scholar Julie Smith, 2 Nephi 2 can alternatively be interpreted as meaning reproduction was impossible only during the time when Eve had eaten the fruit but Adam had not.

The discussion in 2 Nephi 2, specifically verse 25, which states that &quot;Adam fell that men might be,&quot; is frequently used in LDS interpretation of the fall to see it as part of God&#x27;s plan. Some LDS thinkers take the idea further and say that Eve&#x27;s decision was &quot;wise,&quot; a stance that Smith calls the &quot;Wise Choice Theory&quot;. According to Smith, the &quot;classic statement of the Wise Choice Theory&quot; among Latter-day Saints is from a 1993 General Conference talk by apostle Dallin H. Oaks who stated that &quot;we celebrate Eve&#x27;s act and honor her wisdom and courage in the great episode called the Fall,&quot; and cited Brigham Young and Joseph Fielding Smith to aver that was formally a transgression of law but did not constitute sin. Most official Latter-day Saint discourse interprets Eve&#x27;s role in the fall &quot;overwhelmingly positive[ly]&quot;, religious studies scholar Susannia Morrill explains.

Smith argues that God&#x27;s curse in response to Adam and Eve&#x27;s partaking of the fruit makes it difficult to argue that their decision was wise, and that the argument that they were following a higher law requires them to take advice from the serpent. She questions the interpretation of considering Eve eating the fruit a transgression but not a sin. Smith argues this distinction does not exist in the Book of Mormon, and she sees no evidence that a transgression would be wise. She concludes that the &quot;Wise Choice Theory&quot; is not supported by the Book of Mormon.

Early Latter-day Saint leaders Orson Pratt, George Q. Cannon, and Brigham Young regarded Adam wisely chose to eat the fruit wise but thought Eve was not, and Smith argues that &quot;in the earliest layers of LDS interpretation, Eve’s choice was not seen as wise&quot;. Morrill, agreeing that the Book of Mormon text itself does not heroize Eve, reports that most Latter-day Saint women&#x27;s literature in the nineteenth century considered Eve &quot;a wise and knowing woman&quot; who acted as a &quot;savior figure&quot; by &quot;safely guid[ing] the course of human salvation on the right path&quot;.

=== Jacob&#x27;s sermon ===
Egyptologist and CES instructor John S. Thompson analyzed Jacob’s sermon and identified themes of judgment, clothing, remembrance, creation, fasting, sacrifice, usage of God’s name, repentance, and the Law of Moses. On another note, author Marilyn Arnold suggests that, based on the deliberate structure and language of his sermon, Jacob adopts his style from writings in the brass plates. Additionally, Jacob repeats words such as &quot;body,&quot; &quot;flesh,&quot; &quot;die,&quot; and &quot;death&quot; but applies them to his teachings in a way that shifts their connotations.

=== Nephi&#x27;s poetry ===
Independent scholar Matthew Nickerson identifies shared traits between what has been called &quot;the Psalm of Nephi&quot; and psalms of the Old Testament. Nephi’s words are specifically connected to the individual lament, each of which contains an invocation, complaint, confession of trust, petition, and vow of praise. Nickerson proposes that each of these elements can be identified, making Nephi’s psalm a true psalm. According to Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Hemming, Nephi&#x27;s psalm is associated with grief over his father’s death and tensions within the family.

Richard Rust explains that Nephi incorporates certain literary aspects such as rhythms and structures similar to those found in poetry. One example is when Nephi repeats words and phrases in a way that contributes to the poetic sounds of his writings. Some of the things he repeats include &quot;the Lord,&quot; &quot;commanded,&quot; and &quot;that I may walk...that I may be strict.&quot; Such repetition is emphatic, says Rust. Because of Nephi&#x27;s repetition and use of Hebrew structure—which presents and then satisfies an idea—his poetry is similar to Isaiah’s. Bible and Jewish Studies professor David Bokovoy claims another connection to biblical poetry in Nephi&#x27;s tendency to switch from third to first person. Bokovoy notes other examples in the Bible of the writer switching in the same passage from speaking about God at a distance to speaking to God in proximity. Additionally, Salleh and Hemming suggest that, based on the tone of the psalm, Nephi doesn’t have a lot of time to mourn over his parents&#x27; deaths before he has to flee from his brothers.

=== Early LDS interpretation ===
Second Nephi 28 mentions that priests of different churches will &quot;contend&quot; with each other and teach without the Holy Ghost. Early members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints saw many competing religions and began to interpret Joseph Smith&#x27;s visit to the Sacred Grove to ask God which church was right as fulfillment of this prophecy. Second Nephi 29 goes on to describe a new book of scripture that would be revealed but rejected by many people because they already had the Bible. According to early church leader Heber C. Kimball, the response of many ministers was often &quot;we need no more revelation,&quot; which he declared as fulfillment of the chapter 29 prophecy.

Joseph of Egypt&#x27;s prophecy quoted in Second Nephi 3 was also interpreted by early church members, who believed Joseph Smith to be &quot;the choice seer&quot; with the same name as his father.

=== The Isaiah chapters ===

==== Intertextuality ====
Nephi quotes extensively from the Book of Isaiah throughout 1 and 2 Nephi, with passages largely appearing as they do in the Bible. Elizabeth Fenton describes these passages as &quot;not-quite-exact copying,&quot; with differences being minor. J.N. Washburn, an independent scholar, cites that 199 of 433 verses from Isaiah appear with the same wording and proposes that Joseph Smith used the King James Bible version whenever it was close enough to the original meaning of the plates he was said to be translating and used the new translation when meaning differed. According to author H. Clay Gorton, 2 Nephi 21 is the only Isaiah-quoted chapter in the Book of Mormon that, when compared to the KJV, sustains no textual differences. In a similar vein, 2 Nephi 22 and Isaiah 12 are different only by one word. Gorton has concluded that, where Isaiah verses differ in the Book of Mormon, approximately 38% of those changes are extensive.

Philosopher Joseph Spencer calls Isaiah &quot;the honored keynote speaker of the small plates.&quot; Spencer also emphasizes that even beyond quotations, Jacob and Nephi&#x27;s teachings both seem to be built on further ideas of Isaiah&#x27;s. A scholar involved in early studies of the Book of Mormon, Sidney Sperry, suggests that by including Isaiah&#x27;s writings, Nephi points out the mission of Jesus Christ, the restoration of the house of Israel, and God’s judgments that follow. Additionally, Nephi says he &quot;delights&quot; in Isaiah but explains that a knowledge of Jewish tradition is needed to understand his writings, according to literary critic Michael Austin. Nephi admits he has chosen not to teach his people certain knowledge and traditions with which he is familiar as a former resident of Jerusalem.
==== Deutero-Isaiah ====
In more modern times, scholars have theorized based on variation in style and structure that more than one author wrote the book of Isaiah. These authors are referred to as Isaiah, Deutero-Isaiah, and Trito-Isaiah. Deutero-Isaiah is thought to be born after the time Lehi’s family would have left Jerusalem. Many of those writings which are considered to be part of Deutero-Isaiah are cited in Second Nephi as quotations from Isaiah. This implies that the Book of Mormon narrative disagrees that this section of Isaiah was written by someone other than its namesake. An LDS doctrine course teacher&#x27;s supplement cites the Book of Mormon as evidence that Isaiah wrote the whole book of Isaiah since pieces from throughout the book are said to be from the already compiled brass plates which Lehi&#x27;s sons took from Jerusalem around 600 BC.

==== Chiasmus ====
Joseph Spencer suggests that Isaiah appears as a sort of chiasmus in Nephi’s record, sandwiched between Jacob’s and Nephi’s explanations of his writings. In their explanations both men discuss reconciliation with God, contributing to its chiastic appearance. Additionally, Isaiah’s teachings as they appear in Second Nephi form a chiasmus: chapters 12–15 discuss destruction relating to the covenant people; chapter 16 contains a call to repentance, and chapters 17–22 follow themes of God’s covenant people returning to him.

==== Typology ====
Biblical typology is a practice of interpretation that suggests Old Testament events are types or representations of future fulfillment of prophecy. Isaiah&#x27;s writing was described in scripture as things that &quot;have been and will be,&quot; which aligns with typology&#x27;s idea that written prophecies apply both to events in the writer&#x27;s own day which create a type for the future, and to the latter days. Many of the prophecies quoted from Isaiah in Second Nephi regard Babylonian captivity, which Nephi believes to have already begun. Despite this understanding, Nephi also claims the prophecies will be useful in future times. According to Isaiah analyst and Latter-day Saint Avraham Gileadi, this can be viewed either as a contradiction in the text or with the lens of Nephi viewing Isaiah typologically.

==== Isaiah and the Charles Anthon visit ====
Second Nephi 27 quotes a prophecy from Isaiah 29 in which the disregarded messages from prophets are compared to a sealed book. The book is delivered to &quot;one who is learned,&quot; who says, &quot;I cannot [read it] for it is sealed.&quot; In the Pearl of Great Price, another Latter-day Saint book of scripture, Martin Harris&#x27;s visit to professor Charles Anthon with copied characters from the Book of Mormon is recorded. While records of the event vary between Anthon and Harris, Anthon&#x27;s response as reported by Harris was &quot;I cannot read a sealed book.&quot; Many Latter-day Saints see this visit as fulfilling Isaiah&#x27;s prophecy.

=== Cultural Reception ===
Nephi&#x27;s psalm has appeared in numerous works by LDS creators. One such example is &quot;Mazmuur Naafi: The Arabic Psalm of Nephi&quot; by Ahmed Jamal Qureshi. In this work of visual art, the psalm is translated into Arabic and shaped into a circle. The color of the piece, author Josh E. Probert explains, points to blue tiles found inside mosques. Around the circle with the psalm are four smaller circles. Inside the circles are the names Lehi, Nephi, Moroni, and Joseph as figures related to the Book of Mormon&#x27;s content. Nephi&#x27;s psalm has also been set to music, including &quot;I Love the Lord&quot; and &quot;Sometimes My Soul&quot; by John Tanner, as well as &quot;I Glory in My Jesus&quot; written by Millennial Choirs and Orchestras founders Brandon and Brett Stewart.

<text>The Book of Nephi: The Son of Nephi, Who Was the Son of Helaman is religious text of the Latter Day Saint movement. The book is usually referred to as Third Nephi or 3 Nephi, and is one of fifteen books that make up the Book of Mormon. This book was firstly called &quot;III Nephi&quot; in the 1879 edition and &quot;Third Nephi&quot; in the 1920 edition of the Book of Mormon. It contains an account of the visit of Jesus Christ to the inhabitants of ancient America. Jesus had told his disciples in Jerusalem according to the Bible in the Gospel of John, &quot;And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.&quot; In this book, Christ declares to those in ancient America that they were these &quot;other sheep&quot; of whom he spoke. The account of this visit is recorded beginning in chapter 11 of 3 Nephi.

==Narrative of Christ&#x27;s Visit==

Before Christ visits these people there is a giant storm, a tremendous earthquake, and darkness. Cities burn, cities sink into the sea, mountains are brought down and valleys brought up. There is sharp lightning, wind, and thunderings and many people die. After the great storm comes darkness and the voices of mourning for the dead. The darkness lasts for approximately three days, during which a voice is &quot;heard among all the inhabitants of the earth, upon all the face of this land, crying: Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth except that they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquities and abominations that they are fallen!&quot; (3 Nephi 9:1-2) The voice then lists cities &quot;and the inhabitants thereof&quot; he had destroyed because of their wickedness: Zarahemla (3 Nephi 9:3), Moroni (9:4), Moronihah (9:5), Gilgal (9:6), Onihah, Mocum, and Jerusalem (the New World city founded by the Lamanites, Amelekites, and Amulonites, not Jerusalem in Judaea) (9:7), Gadiandi, Gadiomnah, Jacob, and Gimgimno (9:8), Jacobugath (9:9), Laman, Josh, Gad, and Kishkumen (9:10), since &quot;there were none righteous among them&quot; (9:11). He asks, &quot;O all ye that are spared because you were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?&quot; (9:13) &quot;Yea, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall come unto me, ye shall have eternal life. Behold, my arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive, and blessed are those that come unto me.&quot; (9:14) &quot;Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name.&quot; (9:15)

After three days, the darkness clears. Jesus Christ is resurrected and the people gather to the land of Bountiful where stood a temple. A voice is heard from heaven which the people did not understand it at first, that &quot;did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.&quot; The people do not understand the voice a second time but it understand it a third time. The voice is the voice of God Almighty, the very Eternal Father proclaiming His Son Jesus Christ the risen Lord.

The resurrected Christ descends from the sky. He stands before them and calls them to come and sees the wounds in His hands and side. He heals them and teaches them precepts that were to guide their Church.

# He gave to Nephi and others that he called the power to baptize the people, using the words: &quot;Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.&quot; Then they were to be immersed in the water, and come out of the water again.
# There were to be no disputes about his doctrine, because contention is Satanic.
# Actions which stirred men to anger must be done away with. And Jesus said his doctrine came from the Father himself.
# Repentance from sin must accompany baptism. Salvation depends on believing in Jesus and being baptized. Anyone who does not believe in Jesus and is not baptized will be damned.
# Be reconciled with one&#x27;s brother before asked to be reconciled with Christ.
# Do not look on a woman with lust.
# Do not divorce your wife except on grounds of unfaithfulness.
# Do not swear oaths.
# Resist evil.
# When compelled to make a plaintiff whole in a civil suit, make more than full restitution.
# When pressed into labor, do twice the work that is compelled.
# Do not turn away anyone who asks to borrow.
# Love your enemies.
# Do not make a public display of alms-giving.
# Do not make a public display of prayer or use vain repetition.
# Do not visibly emphasize your misery when fasting.
# Do not judge.
# Ask God for all things through prayer with faith.
# Do not follow after false prophets.
# Jesus&#x27; words must be declared to the ends of the earth.
# Ye shall call the church in my name. (3 Nephi 27:7)
# Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house (3 Nephi 24:10)
# Never cease to pray in your hearts (3 Nephi 20:1)
# Suffer not any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood unworthily (3 Nephi 18:28)
# Ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not (3 Nephi 18:22)
# Always pray unto the Father in my name (3 Nephi 18:19)
# Keep my commandments, which the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you (3 Nephi 18:14)
# There shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give power that he shall break bread and bless it and give it unto the people of my church, unto all those who shall believe and be baptized in my name. And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even as I have broken bread and blessed it and given it unto you (3 Nephi 18:5-6)

<text>The Book of Nephi: Who Is the Son of Nephi—One of the Disciples of Jesus Christ, usually referred to as Fourth Nephi or 4 Nephi ( ), is one of the fifteen books that make up the Book of Mormon. This book was first called &quot;IV Nephi&quot; in the 1879 edition and &quot;Fourth Nephi&quot; in the 1920 edition of Book of Mormon.

Fourth Nephi is among the shorter books in the Book of Mormon, containing only a single chapter, but it covers almost three centuries of the history of the Nephites and the Lamanites (&quot;ca&quot; AD 35 to 321).

The book describes the period of time immediately following the visit of Jesus Christ to the Book of Mormon peoples, in which time the Nephites and the Lamanites are all converted to the Church of Christ. The Nephites stopped obeying the law of Moses and obeyed the commandments of Jesus instead. After the year AD 100, all the original disciples of Jesus had died, except for three which he allowed to live on and on until the end of human history. But new disciples were ordained to replace the ones that died. According to the record, &quot;surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God&quot; (4 Ne. 1:16). During this time the distinction between the Lamanites and Nephites disappears: &quot;neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God&quot; (4 Ne. 1:17).

The Nephi who recorded the coming of Jesus to America died, and the keeping of the plates passed to his son Amos. After that, the people started to get rich, and wear expensive clothing and jewelry, and divide themselves into rich and poor, and the communal sharing of private property came to an end. Then they formed churches which were really businesses for the purpose of gaining profits.

One of these churches began to persecute members of the True Church of Christ, casting them into prison (but the prison then broke in two), or casting them into fiery furnaces (but the victims walked out unscathed), or casting them into a lion&#x27;s den (but the victims played with the animals as if they were lambs). &quot;And they did smite upon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite again.&quot;

The people once again divided into Nephites and Lamanites, and although the Nephites remain righteous longer than the Lamanites, by AD 300, &quot;both the people of Nephi and the Lamanites had become exceedingly wicked one like unto another&quot; (4 Ne. 1:45).

The book concludes with Ammaron hiding the sacred records, which he ultimately delivered to Mormon.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Emperor Romanos III Argyros decides to retaliate upon the incursions of the Muslims on the eastern frontier. He leads a Byzantine expeditionary force (20,000 men) to secure Antioch. The Mirdasid emir Shibl al-Dawla Nasr of Aleppo sues for peace, but Romanos refuses to negotiate and leads his army against Aleppo, against the advice of his generals. The Byzantine army encamped near Azaz, where they were encircled by the Mirdasids&#x27; Bedouin troops, who cut off the Byzantines from food and water. 
* August 10 – Romanos orders a retreat to Antioch. As the army is exhausted from the heat and the lack of supplies, the retreat soon turns into a flight in panic. Romanos returns to Constantinople in humiliation, but his generals on the eastern frontier manage to salvage the situation: a Fatimid attack on Maraclea is repulsed, and Azaz itself is captured in December after a brief siege. In April/May 1031, Emir Nasr of Aleppo agreed to vassal and tributary status with Byzantium.

==== Europe ====
* June – Emperor Conrad II (the Elder) leads an invasion into Hungary. He plunders the lands west of the River Rába but suffers from the consequences of the scorched earth tactics used by the Hungarians. Conrad, threatened by starvation, is forced to retreat to Germany. King Stephen I pursued his forces, which were defeated and captured by the Hungarians at Vienna.
* July 29 – Battle of Stiklestad: King Olaf II Haraldsson (St. Olaf) attempts to reconquer Norway with help from King Anund Jakob of Sweden. He is defeated by a superior Norwegian peasant and Danish army (14,000 men). Olaf is killed in the battle. He is later canonized and becomes the patron saint of Norway and &quot;Rex perpetuum Norvegiae&quot; (&#x27;the eternal king of Norway&#x27;).
* The first mention is made of Tartu, Estonia, as Grand Prince Yaroslav I (the Wise) of Novgorod and Kyiv defeats the Estonians and finds a fort named Yuryev (modern-day Tartu). The Rus&#x27; will hold the fortress for 30 or 31 years.
* The first mention is made of Thalwil, Switzerland, derived from &quot;Tellewilare&quot; and indicates the early medieval origins of Thalwil as an Alemannic farmstead.
* Henry I revolts against his father, King Robert II (the Pious), in a civil war over power and property. Robert&#x27;s army is defeated, and he retreats to Beaugency.

==== Asia ====

<doc id="36487" wikidata="Q5690" url="?curid=36487" title="Sparta">
<text>Sparta was a prominent city-state in Laconia in ancient Greece. In antiquity, the city-state was known as Lacedaemon (), while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement in the valley of Evrotas river in Laconia, in southeastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.

Sparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military during the Greco-Persian Wars, in rivalry with the rising naval power of Athens. Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), from which it emerged victorious after the Battle of Aegospotami. The decisive Battle of Leuctra against Thebes in 371 BC ended the Spartan hegemony, although the city-state maintained its political independence until its forced integration into the Achaean League in 192 BC. The city nevertheless recovered much autonomy after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC and prospered during the Roman Empire, as its antiquarian customs attracted many Roman tourists. However, Sparta was sacked in 396 AD by the Visigothic king Alaric, and underwent a long period of decline, especially in the Middle Ages, when many of its citizens moved to Mystras. Modern Sparta is the capital of the southern Greek region of Laconia and a center for processing citrus and olives.

Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution, which were supposedly introduced by the semi-mythical legislator Lycurgus. His laws configured the Spartan society to maximize military proficiency at all costs, focusing all social institutions on military training and physical development. The inhabitants of Sparta were stratified as Spartiates (citizens with full rights), mothakes (free non-Spartiate people descended from Spartans), perioikoi (free non-Spartiates), and helots (state-owned enslaved non-Spartan locals), with helots making up the majority of the population. Spartiate men underwent the rigorous &quot;agoge&quot; training regimen, and Spartan phalanx brigades were widely considered to be among the best in battle. Free Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights than elsewhere in classical antiquity, though helots suffered harsh treatment at the hands of the Spartiates. Sparta was frequently a subject of fascination in its own day, as well as in Western culture following the revival of classical learning. The admiration of Sparta is known as Laconophilia. Bertrand Russell wrote:Sparta had a double effect on Greek thought: through the reality, and through the myth... The reality enabled the Spartans to defeat Athens in war; the myth influenced Plato&#x27;s political theory, and that of countless subsequent writers... [The] ideals that it favors had a great part in framing the doctrines of Rousseau, Nietzsche, and National Socialism.

==Names==

The ancient Greeks used one of three words to refer to the Spartan city-state and its location. First, &quot;Sparta&quot; refers primarily to the main cluster of settlements in the valley of the Eurotas River. The second word, &quot;Lacedaemon&quot; (), was often used as an adjective and is the name referenced in the works of Homer and the historians Herodotus and Thucydides. The third term, &quot;Laconice&quot; (), referred to the immediate area around the town of Sparta, the plateau east of the Taygetos mountains, and sometimes to all the regions under direct Spartan control, including Messenia.

The earliest attested term referring to Lacedaemon is the Mycenaean Greek , &quot;ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo&quot;, &quot;Lakedaimonian&quot;, written in Linear B syllabic script, the equivalent of the later Greek , &quot;Lakedaimonios&quot; (Latin: &quot;Lacedaemonius&quot;).

Herodotus seems to use &quot;Lacedaemon&quot; for the Mycenaean Greek citadel at Therapne, in contrast to the lower town of Sparta. This term could be used synonymously with Sparta, but typically it denoted the terrain in which the city was located. In Homer it is typically combined with epithets of the countryside: wide, lovely, shining and most often hollow and broken (full of ravines), suggesting the Eurotas Valley. &quot;Sparta&quot; on the other hand is described as &quot;the country of lovely women&quot;, an epithet for people.

The residents of Sparta were often called Lacedaemonians. This epithet utilized the plural of the adjective Lacedaemonius (Greek: ; Latin: &quot;Lacedaemonii&quot;, but also &quot;Lacedaemones&quot;). The ancients sometimes used a back-formation, referring to the land of Lacedaemon as &quot;Lacedaemonian country&quot;. As most words for &quot;country&quot; were feminine, the adjective was in the feminine: &quot;Lacedaemonia&quot; (, &quot;Lakedaimonia&quot;). Eventually, the adjective came to be used alone.

&quot;Lacedaemonia&quot; was not in general use during the classical period and before. It does occur in Greek as an equivalent of Laconia and Messenia during the Roman and early Byzantine periods, mostly in ethnographers and lexica of place names. For example, Hesychius of Alexandria&#x27;s &quot;Lexicon&quot; (5th century AD) defines Agiadae as a &quot;place in Lacedaemonia&quot; named after Agis. The actual transition may be captured by Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologiae&quot; (7th century AD), an etymological dictionary. Isidore relied heavily on Orosius&#x27; &quot;Historiarum Adversum Paganos&quot; (5th century AD) and Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot; (early 5th century AD), as did Orosius. The latter defines Sparta to be &quot;Lacedaemonia Civitas&quot;, but Isidore defines Lacedaemonia as founded by Lacedaemon, son of Semele, which is consistent with Eusebius&#x27; explanation. There is a rare use, perhaps the earliest of &quot;Lacedaemonia&quot;, in Diodorus Siculus&#x27; The Library of History, but probably with (&quot;chōra&quot;, &quot;country&quot;) suppressed.

Lakedaimona was until 2006 the name of a province in the modern Greek prefecture of Laconia.

==Geography==

Sparta is located in the region of Laconia, in the south-eastern Peloponnese. Ancient Sparta was built on the banks of the Eurotas, the largest river of Laconia, which provided it with a source of fresh water. The Eurotas valley was a natural fortress, bounded to the west by Mt. Taygetus (2,407 m) and to the east by Mt. Parnon (1,935 m). To the north, Laconia is separated from Arcadia by hilly uplands reaching 1000 m in altitude. These natural defenses worked to Sparta&#x27;s advantage and protected it from sacking and invasion. Though landlocked, Sparta had a vassal harbor, Gytheio, on the Laconian Gulf.

==Mythology==
Lacedaemon (Greek: ) was a mythical king of Laconia. The son of Zeus by the nymph Taygete, he married Sparta, the daughter of Eurotas, by whom he became the father of Amyclas, Eurydice, and Asine. As king, he named his country after himself and the city after his wife. He was believed to have built the sanctuary of the Charites, which stood between Sparta and Amyclae, and to have given to those divinities the names of Cleta and Phaenna. A shrine was erected to him in the neighborhood of Therapne.

Tyrtaeus, an archaic era Spartan writer, is the earliest source to connect the origin myth of the Spartans to the lineage of the hero Heracles; later authors, such as Diodorus Siculus, Herodotus, and Apollodorus, also made mention of Spartans understanding themselves to be descendants of Heracles.

==Archaeology of the classical period==

Thucydides wrote:

Suppose the city of Sparta to be deserted, and nothing left but the temples and the ground-plan, distant ages would be very unwilling to believe that the power of the Lacedaemonians was at all equal to their fame. Their city is not built continuously, and has no splendid temples or other edifices; it rather resembles a group of villages, like the ancient towns of Hellas, and would therefore make a poor show.

Until the early 20th century, the chief ancient buildings at Sparta were the theatre, of which, however, little showed above ground except portions of the retaining walls; the so-called Tomb of Leonidas, a quadrangular building, perhaps a temple, constructed of immense blocks of stone and containing two chambers; the foundation of an ancient bridge over the Eurotas; the ruins of a circular structure; some remains of late Roman fortifications; several brick buildings and mosaic pavements.

The remaining archaeological wealth consisted of inscriptions, sculptures, and other objects collected in the local museum, founded by Stamatakis in 1872 and enlarged in 1907. Partial excavation of the round building was undertaken in 1892 and 1893 by the American School at Athens. The structure has been since found to be a semicircular retaining wall of Hellenic origin that was partly restored during the Roman period.
In 1904, the British School at Athens began a thorough exploration of Laconia, and in the following year excavations were made at Thalamae, Geronthrae, and Angelona near Monemvasia. In 1906, excavations began in Sparta itself.

A &quot;small circus&quot; (as described by Leake) proved to be a theatre-like building constructed soon after 200 AD around the altar and in front of the Temple of Artemis Orthia. It is believed that musical and gymnastic contests took place here, as well as the famous flogging ordeal administered to Spartan boys (&quot;diamastigosis&quot;). The temple, which can be dated to the 2nd century BC, rests on the foundation of an older temple of the 6th century, and close beside it were found the remains of a yet earlier temple, dating from the 9th or even the 10th century. The votive offerings in clay, amber, bronze, ivory and lead dating from the 9th to the 4th centuries BC, which were found in great profusion within the precinct range, supply invaluable information about early Spartan art.
In 1907, the location of the sanctuary of Athena &quot;of the Brazen House&quot; (Χαλκίοικος, Chalkioikos) was determined to be on the acropolis immediately above the theatre. Though the actual temple is almost completely destroyed, the site has produced the longest extant archaic inscription in Laconia, numerous bronze nails and plates, and a considerable number of votive offerings. The city-wall, built in successive stages from the 4th to the 2nd century, was traced for a great part of its circuit, which measured 48 stades or nearly (Polyb. 1X. 21). The late Roman wall enclosing the acropolis, part of which probably dates from the years following the Gothic raid of 262 AD, was also investigated. Besides the actual buildings discovered, a number of points were situated and mapped in a general study of Spartan topography, based upon the description of Pausanias.

In terms of domestic archaeology, little is known about Spartan houses and villages before the Archaic period, but the best evidence comes from excavations at Nichoria in Messenia where postholes have been found. These villages were open and consisted of small and simple houses built with stone foundations and clay walls.

===Menelaion===
The Menelaion is a shrine associated with Menelaus, located east of Sparta, by the river Eurotas, on the hill Profitis Ilias (Coordinates: ). Built around the early 8th century BC, the Spartans believed it had been the former residence of Menelaus. In 1970, the British School in Athens started excavations around the Menelaion in an attempt to locate Mycenaean remains in the area. Among other findings, they uncovered the remains of two Mycenaean mansions and found the first offerings dedicated to Helen and Menelaus. These mansions were destroyed by earthquake and fire, and archaeologists consider them the possible palace of Menelaus himself.

Excavations made from the early 1990s to the present suggest that the area around the Menelaion in the southern part of the Eurotas valley seems to have been the center of Mycenaean Laconia. The Mycenaean settlement was roughly triangular in shape, with its apex pointed towards the north. Its area was approximately equal to that of the &quot;newer&quot; Sparta, but denudation has wreaked havoc with its buildings and nothing is left of its original structures save for ruined foundations and broken potsherds.

==History==
===Prehistory, &quot;dark age&quot; and archaic period===
The prehistory of Sparta is difficult to reconstruct because the literary evidence was written far later than the events it describes and is distorted by oral tradition. The earliest certain evidence of human settlement in the region of Sparta consists of pottery dating from the Middle Neolithic period, found in the vicinity of Kouphovouno some two kilometres () south-southwest of Sparta.

This civilization seems to have fallen into decline by the late Bronze Age, when, according to Herodotus, Macedonian tribes from the north (called Dorians by those they conquered) marched into the Peloponnese and, subjugating the local tribes, settled there. The Dorians seem to have set about expanding the frontiers of Spartan territory almost before they had established their own state. They fought against the Argive Dorians to the east and southeast, and also the Arcadian Achaeans to the northwest. The evidence suggests that Sparta, relatively inaccessible because of the topography of the Taygetan plain, was secure from early on: it was never fortified.

Nothing distinctive in the archaeology of the Eurotas River Valley identifies the Dorians or the Dorian Spartan state. The prehistory of the Neolithic, the Bronze Age and the Dark Age (the Early Iron Age) at this moment must be treated apart from the stream of Dorian Spartan history.

The legendary period of Spartan history is believed to fall into the Dark Age. It treats the mythic heroes such as the Heraclids and the Perseids, offering a view of the occupation of the Peloponnesus that contains both fantastic and possibly historical elements. The subsequent proto-historic period, combining both legend and historical fragments, offers the first credible history.

Between the 8th and 7th centuries BC the Spartans experienced a period of lawlessness and civil strife, later attested by both Herodotus and Thucydides. As a result, they carried out a series of political and social reforms of their own society which they later attributed to a semi-mythical lawgiver, Lycurgus. Several writers throughout antiquity, including Herodotus, Xenophon, and Plutarch have attempted to explain Spartan exceptionalism as a result of the so-called Lycurgan Reforms.

===Classical Sparta===
In the Second Messenian War, Sparta established itself as a local power in the Peloponnesus and the rest of Greece. During the following centuries, Sparta&#x27;s reputation as a land-fighting force was unequalled. At its peak around 500 BC, Sparta had some 20,000–35,000 citizens, plus numerous helots and perioikoi. The likely total of 40,000–50,000 made Sparta one of the larger Greek city-states; however, according to Thucydides, the population of Athens in 431 BC was 360,000–610,000, making it much larger.

In 480 BC, a small force led by King Leonidas (about 300 full Spartiates, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans, although these numbers were lessened by earlier casualties) made a legendary last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae against the massive Persian army, led by Xerxes. The Spartans received advance warning of the Persian invasion from their deposed king Demaratus, which prompted them to consult the Delphic oracle. According to Herodotus, the Pythia proclaimed that either one of the kings of Sparta had to die or Sparta would be destroyed. This prophecy was fulfilled after king Leonidas died in the battle. The superior weaponry, strategy, and bronze armour of the Greek hoplites and their phalanx fighting formation again proved their worth one year later when Sparta assembled its full strength and led a Greek alliance against the Persians at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC.
The decisive Greek victory at Plataea put an end to the Greco-Persian War along with Persian ambitions to expand into Europe. Even though this war was won by a pan-Greek army, credit was given to Sparta, who besides providing the leading forces at Thermopylae and Plataea, had been the de facto leader of the entire Greek expedition.

In 464 BC, a violent earthquake occurred along the Sparta faultline destroying much of what was Sparta and many other city-states in ancient Greece. This earthquake is marked by scholars as one of the key events that led to the First Peloponnesian War.

In later Classical times, Sparta along with Athens, Thebes, and Persia were the main powers fighting for supremacy in the northeastern Mediterranean. In the course of the Peloponnesian War, Sparta, a traditional land power, acquired a navy which managed to overpower the previously dominant flotilla of Athens, ending the Athenian Empire. At the peak of its power in the early 4th century BC, Sparta had subdued many of the main Greek states and even invaded the Persian provinces in Anatolia (modern day Turkey), a period known as the Spartan hegemony.

During the Corinthian War, Sparta faced a coalition of the leading Greek states: Thebes, Athens, Corinth, and Argos. The alliance was initially backed by Persia, which feared further Spartan expansion into Asia. Sparta achieved a series of land victories, but many of her ships were destroyed at the Battle of Cnidus by a Greek-Phoenician mercenary fleet that Persia had provided to Athens. The event severely damaged Sparta&#x27;s naval power but did not end its aspirations of invading further into Persia, until Conon the Athenian ravaged the Spartan coastline and provoked the old Spartan fear of a helot revolt.

After a few more years of fighting, in 387 BC the Peace of Antalcidas was established, according to which all Greek cities of Ionia would return to Persian control, and Persia&#x27;s Asian border would be free of the Spartan threat. The effects of the war were to reaffirm Persia&#x27;s ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta&#x27;s weakened hegemonic position in the Greek political system. Sparta entered its long-term decline after a severe military defeat to Epaminondas of Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra. This was the first time that a full strength Spartan army lost a land battle.

As Spartan citizenship was inherited by blood, Sparta increasingly faced a helot population that vastly outnumbered its citizens. The alarming decline of Spartan citizens was commented on by Aristotle.

===Hellenistic and Roman Sparta===

Sparta never fully recovered from its losses at Leuctra in 371 BC and the subsequent helot revolts. In 338, Philip II invaded and devastated much of Laconia, turning the Spartans out, though he did not seize Sparta itself. Even during its decline, Sparta never forgot its claim to be the &quot;defender of Hellenism&quot; and its Laconic wit. An anecdote has it that when Philip II sent a message to Sparta saying &quot;If I invade Laconia, I shall turn you out.&quot;, the Spartans responded with the single, terse reply: , &quot;if&quot;. When Philip created the League of Corinth on the pretext of unifying Greece against Persia, the Spartans chose not to join, since they had no interest in joining a pan-Greek expedition unless it were under Spartan leadership. Thus, upon defeating the Persians at the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander the Great sent to Athens 300 suits of Persian armour with the following inscription: &quot;Alexander, son of Philip, and all the Greeks except the Spartans, give these offerings taken from the foreigners who live in Asia&quot;.

Sparta continued to be one of the Peloponesian powers until its eventual loss of independence in 192 BC. During Alexander&#x27;s campaigns in the east, the Spartan king Agis III sent a force to Crete in 333 BC to secure the island for the Persian interest. Agis next took command of allied Greek forces against Macedon, gaining early successes, before laying siege to Megalopolis in 331 BC. A large Macedonian army under general Antipater marched to its relief and defeated the Spartan-led force in a pitched battle. More than 5,300 of the Spartans and their allies were killed in battle, and 3,500 of Antipater&#x27;s troops. Agis, now wounded and unable to stand, ordered his men to leave him behind to face the advancing Macedonian army so that he could buy them time to retreat. On his knees, the Spartan king slew several enemy soldiers before being finally killed by a javelin. Alexander was merciful, and he only forced the Spartans to join the League of Corinth, which they had previously refused.

During the Punic Wars, Sparta was an ally of the Roman Republic. Spartan political independence was put to an end when it was eventually forced into the Achaean League after its defeat in the decisive Laconian War by a coalition of other Greek city-states and Rome, and the resultant overthrow of its final king Nabis, in 192 BC. Sparta played no active part in the Achaean War in 146 BC when the Achaean League was defeated by the Roman general Lucius Mummius. Subsequently, Sparta became a free city under Roman rule, some of the institutions of Lycurgus were restored, and the city became a tourist attraction for the Roman elite who came to observe exotic Spartan customs.

In 214 AD, Roman emperor Caracalla, in his preparation for his campaign against Parthia, recruited a 500-man Spartan cohort (&quot;lokhos&quot;). Herodian described this unit as a &quot;phalanx&quot;, implying it fought like the old Spartans as hoplites, or even as a Macedonian phalanx. Despite this, a gravestone of a fallen legionary named Marcus Aurelius Alexys shows him lightly armed, with a pilos-like cap and a wooden club. The unit was presumably discharged in 217 after Caracalla was assassinated.

An exchange of letters in the deutero-canonical First Book of Maccabees expresses a Jewish claim to kinship with the Spartans:

The letters are reproduced in a variant form by Josephus. Jewish historian Uriel Rappaport notes that the relationship between the Jews and the Spartans expressed in this correspondence has &quot;intrigued many scholars, and various explanations have been suggested for the problems raised ... including the historicity of the Jewish leader and high priest Jonathan&#x27;s letter to the Spartans, the authenticity of the letter of Arius to Onias, cited in Jonathan&#x27;s letter, and the supposed &#x27;brotherhood&#x27; of the Jews and the Spartans.&quot; Rappaport is clear that &quot;the authenticity of [the reply] letter of Arius is based on even less firm foundations than the letter of Jonathan&quot;.

Spartans long spurned the idea of building a defensive wall around their city, believing they made the city&#x27;s men soft in terms of their warrior abilities. A wall was finally erected after 184 BCE, after the peak of the city-state&#x27;s power had come and gone.

===Postclassical and modern Sparta===
In 396 AD, Sparta was sacked by Visigoths under Alaric I.
According to Byzantine sources, some parts of the Laconian region remained pagan until well into the 10th century. The Tsakonian language still spoken in Tsakonia is the only surviving descendant of the ancient Doric language. In the Middle Ages, the political and cultural center of Laconia shifted to the nearby settlement of Mystras, and Sparta fell further in even local importance. Modern Sparta was re-founded in 1834, by a decree of King Otto of Greece.

==Structure of Classical Spartan society==
===Constitution===
Sparta was an oligarchy. The state was ruled by two hereditary kings of the Agiad and Eurypontid families, both supposedly descendants of Heracles and equal in authority, so that one could not act against the power and political enactments of his colleague.

The duties of the kings were primarily religious, judicial, and military. As chief priests of the state, they maintained communication with the Delphian sanctuary, whose pronouncements exercised great authority in Spartan politics. In the time of Herodotus c. 450 BC, their judicial functions had been restricted to cases dealing with heiresses (epikleroi), adoptions and the public roads (the meaning of the last term is unclear in Herodotus&#x27; text and has been interpreted in a number of ways). Aristotle describes the kingship at Sparta as &quot;a kind of unlimited and perpetual generalship&quot; (Pol. iii. 1285a), while Isocrates refers to the Spartans as &quot;subject to an oligarchy at home, to a kingship on campaign&quot; (iii. 24).

Civil and criminal cases were decided by a group of officials known as the ephors, as well as a council of elders known as the Gerousia. The Gerousia consisted of 28 elders over the age of 60, elected for life and usually part of the royal households, and the two kings. High state decisions were discussed by this council, who could then propose policies to the &quot;damos&quot;, the collective body of Spartan citizenry, who would select one of the alternatives by vote.

Royal prerogatives were curtailed over time. From the period of the Persian wars, the king lost the right to declare war and was accompanied in the field by two ephors. He was supplanted by the ephors also in the control of foreign policy. Over time, the kings became mere figureheads except in their capacity as generals. Political power was transferred to the ephors and Gerousia.

An assembly of citizens called the Ekklesia was responsible for electing men to the Gerousia for life.

===Citizenship===

The Spartan education process known as the &quot;agoge&quot; was essential for full citizenship. However, usually the only boys eligible for the &quot;agoge&quot; were Spartiates, those who could trace their ancestry to the original inhabitants of the city.

There were two exceptions. &quot;Trophimoi&quot; or &quot;foster sons&quot; were foreign students invited to study. The Athenian general Xenophon, for example, sent his two sons to Sparta as trophimoi. Also, the son of a helot could be enrolled as a &quot;syntrophos&quot; if a Spartiate formally adopted him and paid his way; if he did exceptionally well in training, he might be sponsored to become a Spartiate. Spartans who could not afford to pay the expenses of the &quot;agoge&quot; could lose their citizenship.

These laws meant that Sparta could not readily replace citizens lost in battle or otherwise, which eventually proved near fatal as citizens became greatly outnumbered by non-citizens, and even more dangerously by helots.

===Non citizens===
The other classes were the perioikoi, free inhabitants who were non-citizens, and the helots, state-owned serfs. Descendants of non-Spartan citizens were forbidden the &quot;agoge&quot;.

====Helots====

The Spartans were a minority of the Lakonian population. The largest class of inhabitants were the helots (in Classical Greek / &quot;Heílôtes&quot;).

The helots were originally free Greeks from the areas of Messenia and Lakonia whom the Spartans had defeated in battle and subsequently enslaved. In contrast to populations conquered by other Greek cities (e.g. the Athenian treatment of Melos), the male population was not exterminated and the women and children turned into chattel slaves. Instead, the helots were given a subordinate position in society more comparable to serfs in medieval Europe than chattel slaves in the rest of Greece. The Spartan helots were not only agricultural workers, but were also household servants, both male and female would be assigned domestic duties, such as wool-working. However, the helots were not the private property of individual Spartan citizens, regardless of their household duties, and were instead owned by the state through the &quot;kleros&quot; system.

Helots did not have voting or political rights. The Spartan poet Tyrtaios refers to Helots being allowed to marry and retaining 50% of the fruits of their labor. They also seem to have been allowed to practice religious rites and, according to Thucydides, own a limited amount of personal property.
Initially, helots couldn&#x27;t be freed but during the middle Hellenistic period, some 6,000 helots accumulated enough wealth to buy their freedom, for example, in 227 BC.

In other Greek city-states, free citizens were part-time soldiers who, when not at war, carried on other trades. Since Spartan men were full-time soldiers, they were not available to carry out manual labour. The helots were used as unskilled serfs, tilling Spartan land. Helot women were often used as wet nurses. Helots also travelled with the Spartan army as non-combatant serfs. At the last stand of the Battle of Thermopylae, the Greek dead included not just the legendary three hundred Spartan soldiers but also several hundred Thespian and Theban troops and a number of helots.

There was at least one helot revolt (c. 465–460 BC) that led to prolonged conflict. By the tenth year of this war the Spartans and Messenians had reached an agreement in which Messenian rebels were allowed to leave the Peloponnese. They were given safe passage under the terms that they would be re-enslaved if they tried to return. This agreement ended the most serious incursion into Spartan territory since their expansion in the seventh and eighth centuries BC. Thucydides remarked that &quot;Spartan policy is always mainly governed by the necessity of taking precautions against the helots.&quot; On the other hand, the Spartans trusted their helots enough in 479 BC to take a force of 35,000 with them to Plataea, something they could not have risked if they feared the helots would attack them or run away. Slave revolts occurred elsewhere in the Greek world, and in 413 BC 20,000 Athenian slaves ran away to join the Spartan forces occupying Attica. What made Sparta&#x27;s relations with her slave population unique was that the helots, precisely because they enjoyed privileges such as family and property, retained their identity as a conquered people (the Messenians) and also had effective kinship groups that could be used to organize rebellion.

As the Spartiate population declined and the helot population continued to grow, the imbalance of power caused increasing tension. According to Myron of Priene of the middle 3rd century BC:

Plutarch also states that Spartans treated the helots &quot;harshly and cruelly&quot;: they compelled them to drink pure wine (which was considered dangerous – wine usually being cut with water) &quot;...and to lead them in that condition into their public halls, that the children might see what a sight a drunken man is; they made them to dance low dances, and sing ridiculous songs...&quot; during &quot;syssitia&quot; (obligatory banquets).

Each year when the Ephors took office, they ritually declared war on the helots, allowing Spartans to kill them without risk of ritual pollution. This fight seems to have been carried out by &quot;kryptai&quot; (sing. κρύπτης &quot;kryptēs&quot;), graduates of the &quot;agoge&quot; who took part in the mysterious institution known as the &quot;Krypteia&quot;. Thucydides states:

The helots were invited by a proclamation to pick out those of their number who claimed to have most distinguished themselves against the enemy, in order that they might receive their freedom; the object being to test them, as it was thought that the first to claim their freedom would be the most high spirited and the most apt to rebel. As many as two thousand were selected accordingly, who crowned themselves and went round the temples, rejoicing in their new freedom. The Spartans, however, soon afterwards did away with them, and no one ever knew how each of them perished.

====Perioikoi====

The Perioikoi came from similar origins as the helots but occupied a significantly different position in Spartan society. Although they did not enjoy full citizen-rights, they were free and not subjected to the same restrictions as the helots. The exact nature of their subjection to the Spartans is not clear, but they seem to have served partly as a kind of military reserve, partly as skilled craftsmen and partly as agents of foreign trade. Perioikoic hoplites served increasingly with the Spartan army, explicitly at the Battle of Plataea, and although they may also have fulfilled functions such as the manufacture and repair of armour and weapons, they were increasingly integrated into the combat units of the Spartan army as the Spartiate population declined.

===Economy===

Full citizen Spartiates were barred by law from trade or manufacture, which consequently rested in the hands of the Perioikoi. This lucrative monopoly, in a fertile territory with a good harbors, ensured the loyalty of the perioikoi. Despite the prohibition on menial labor or trade, there is evidence of Spartan sculptors, and Spartans were certainly poets, magistrates, ambassadors, and governors as well as soldiers.

Allegedly, Spartans were prohibited from possessing gold and silver coins, and according to legend Spartan currency consisted of iron bars to discourage hoarding. Though the conspicuous display of wealth appears to have been discouraged, this did not preclude the production of very fine decorated bronze, ivory and wooden works of art as well as exquisite jewellery, attested in archaeology.

Allegedly as part of the Lycurgan Reforms in the mid-8th century BC, a massive land reform had divided property into 9,000 equal portions. Each citizen received one estate, a &quot;kleros&quot;, which was expected to provide his living. The land was worked by helots who retained half the yield. From the other half, the Spartiate was expected to pay his mess (&quot;syssitia&quot;) fees, and the &quot;agoge&quot; fees for his children. However, nothing is known of matters of wealth such as how land was bought, sold, and inherited, or whether daughters received dowries. However, from early on there were marked differences of wealth within the state, and these became more serious after the law of Epitadeus some time after the Peloponnesian War, which removed the legal prohibition on the gift or bequest of land. By the mid-5th century, land had become concentrated in the hands of a tiny elite, and the notion that all Spartan citizens were equals had become an empty pretence. By Aristotle&#x27;s day (384–322 BC) citizenship had been reduced from 9,000 to less than 1,000, then further decreased to 700 at the accession of Agis IV in 244 BC. Attempts were made to remedy this by imposing legal penalties upon bachelors, but this could not reverse the trend.

==Life in Classical Sparta==
===Birth and death===
Sparta was above all a militarist state, and emphasis on military fitness began virtually at birth. According to Plutarch after birth, a mother would bathe her child in wine to see whether the child was strong. If the child survived it was brought before the Gerousia by the child&#x27;s father. The Gerousia then decided whether it was to be reared or not. It is commonly stated that if they considered it &quot;puny and deformed&quot;, the baby was thrown into a chasm on Mount Taygetos known euphemistically as the &quot;Apothetae&quot; (Gr., &quot;ἀποθέται&quot;, &quot;Deposits&quot;). This was, in effect, a primitive form of eugenics. Plutarch is the sole historical source for the Spartan practice of systemic infanticide motivated by eugenics. Sparta is often viewed as being unique in this regard, however, anthropologist Laila Williamson notes: &quot;Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunter gatherers to high civilizations. Rather than being an exception, then, it has been the rule.&quot; There is controversy about the matter in Sparta, since excavations in the chasm only uncovered adult remains, likely belonging to criminals and Greek sources contemporary to Sparta does not mention systemic infanticide motivated solely by eugenics.

Spartan burial customs changed over time. The Archaic Spartan poet Tyrtaeus spoke of the Spartan war-dead as follows:

Never do his [the war-dead&#x27;s] name and good fame perish,&lt;br&gt;But even though he is beneath the earth he is immortal,&lt;br&gt;Young and old alike mourn him,&lt;br&gt;All the city is distressed by the painful loss,&lt;br&gt;and his tomb and children are pointed out among the people,&lt;br&gt;and his children&#x27;s children and his line after them.

When Spartans died, marked headstones would only be granted to soldiers who died in combat during a victorious campaign or women who died either in service of a divine office or in childbirth. These headstones likely acted as memorials, rather than as grave markers. Evidence of Spartan burials is provided by the Tomb of the Lacedaimonians in Athens. Excavations at the cemetery of classical Sparta, uncovered ritually pierced kantharoid-like ceramic vessels, the ritual slaughter of horses, and specific burial enclosures alongside individual &#x27;plots&#x27;. Some of the graves were reused over time.

In the Hellenistic Period, grander, two-storey monumental tombs are found at Sparta. Ten of these have been found for this period.

===Education===
When male Spartans began military training at age seven, they would enter the &quot;agoge&quot; system. The &quot;agoge&quot; was designed to encourage discipline and physical toughness and to emphasize the importance of the Spartan state. Boys lived in communal messes and, according to Xenophon, whose sons attended the &quot;agoge&quot;, the boys were fed &quot;just the right amount for them never to become sluggish through being too full, while also giving them a taste of what it is not to have enough.&quot; In addition, they were trained to survive in times of privation, even if it meant stealing. Besides physical and weapons training, boys studied reading, writing, music and dancing. Special punishments were imposed if boys failed to answer questions sufficiently &quot;laconically&quot; (i.e. briefly and wittily).

Spartan boys were expected to take an older male mentor, usually an unmarried young man. According to some sources, the older man was expected to function as a kind of substitute father and role model to his junior partner; however, others believe it was reasonably certain that they had sexual relations (the exact nature of Spartan pederasty is not entirely clear). Xenophon, an admirer of the Spartan educational system whose sons attended the &quot;agoge&quot;, explicitly denies the sexual nature of the relationship.

Some Spartan youth apparently became members of an irregular unit known as the &quot;Krypteia&quot;. The immediate objective of this unit was to seek out and kill vulnerable helot Laconians as part of the larger program of terrorising and intimidating the helot population.

Less information is available about the education of Spartan girls, but they seem to have gone through a fairly extensive formal educational cycle, broadly similar to that of the boys but with less emphasis on military training. Spartan girls received an education known as &quot;mousikē&quot;. This included music, dancing, singing and poetry. Choral dancing was taught so Spartan girls could participate in ritual activities, including the cults of Helen and Artemis. In this respect, classical Sparta was unique in ancient Greece. In no other city-state did women receive any kind of formal education.

===Military life===
At age 20, the Spartan citizen began his membership in one of the &quot;syssitia&quot; (dining messes or clubs), composed of about fifteen members each, of which every citizen was required to be a member. Here each group learned how to bond and rely on one another. The Spartans were not eligible for election for public office until the age of 30. Only native Spartans were considered full citizens and were obliged to undergo the training as prescribed by law, as well as participate in and contribute financially to one of the &quot;syssitia&quot;.

Sparta is thought to be the first city to practice athletic nudity, and some scholars claim that it was also the first to formalize pederasty. According to these sources, the Spartans believed that the love of an older, accomplished aristocrat for an adolescent was essential to his formation as a free citizen. The &quot;agoge&quot;, the education of the ruling class, was, they claim, founded on pederastic relationships required of each citizen, with the lover responsible for the boy&#x27;s training.

However, other scholars question this interpretation. Xenophon explicitly denies it, but not Plutarch.

Spartan men remained in the active reserve until age 60. Men were encouraged to marry at age 20 but could not live with their families until they left their active military service at age 30. They called themselves &quot;homoioi&quot; (equals), pointing to their common lifestyle and the discipline of the phalanx, which demanded that no soldier be superior to his comrades. Insofar as hoplite warfare could be perfected, the Spartans did so.

Thucydides reports that when a Spartan man went to war, his wife (or another woman of some significance) would customarily present him with his aspis (shield) and say: &quot;With this, or upon this&quot; (Ἢ τὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τᾶς, &quot;Èi tàn èi èpì tàs&quot;), meaning that true Spartans could only return to Sparta either victorious (with their shield in hand) or dead (carried upon it). This is almost certainly propaganda. Spartans buried their battle dead on or near the battle field; corpses were not brought back on their shield. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that it was less of a disgrace for a soldier to lose his helmet, breastplate or greaves than his shield, since the former were designed to protect one man, whereas the shield also protected the man on his left. Thus, the shield was symbolic of the individual soldier&#x27;s subordination to his unit, his integral part in its success, and his solemn responsibility to his comrades in arms – messmates and friends, often close blood relations.

According to Aristotle, the Spartan military culture was actually short-sighted and ineffective. He observed:

It is the standards of civilized men not of beasts that must be kept in mind, for it is good men not beasts who are capable of real courage. Those like the Spartans who concentrate on the one and ignore the other in their education turn men into machines and in devoting themselves to one single aspect of city&#x27;s life, end up making them inferior even in that.

One of the most persistent myths about Sparta that has no basis in fact is the notion that Spartan mothers were without feelings toward their off-spring and helped enforce a militaristic lifestyle on their sons and husbands. The myth can be traced back to Plutarch, who includes no less than 17 &quot;sayings&quot; of &quot;Spartan women&quot;, all of which paraphrase or elaborate on the theme that Spartan mothers rejected their own offspring if they showed any kind of cowardice. In some of these sayings, mothers revile their sons in insulting language merely for surviving a battle. These sayings purporting to be from Spartan women were far more likely to be of Athenian origin and designed to portray Spartan women as unnatural and so undeserving of pity.

===Agriculture, food, and diet===
Sparta&#x27;s agriculture consisted mainly of barley, wine, cheese, grain, and figs. These items were grown locally on each Spartan citizen&#x27;s kleros and were tended to by helots. Spartan citizens were required to donate a certain amount of what they yielded from their kleros to their syssitia, or mess. These donations to the syssitia were a requirement for every Spartan citizen. All the donated food was then redistributed to feed the Spartan population of that syssitia. The helots who tended to the lands were fed using a portion of what they harvested.

===Marriage===
Plutarch reports the peculiar customs associated with the Spartan wedding night:

The custom was to capture women for marriage... The so-called &#x27;bridesmaid&#x27; took charge of the captured girl. She first shaved her head to the scalp, then dressed her in a man&#x27;s cloak and sandals, and laid her down alone on a mattress in the dark. The bridegroom – who was not drunk and thus not impotent, but was sober as always – first had dinner in the messes, then would slip in, undo her belt, lift her and carry her to the bed.

The husband continued to visit his wife in secret for some time after the marriage. These customs, unique to the Spartans, have been interpreted in various ways. One of them decidedly supports the need to disguise the bride as a man in order to help the bridegroom consummate the marriage, so unaccustomed were men to women&#x27;s looks at the time of their first intercourse. The &quot;abduction&quot; may have served to ward off the evil eye, and the cutting of the wife&#x27;s hair was perhaps part of a rite of passage that signaled her entrance into a new life.

==Role of women==
===Political, social, and economic equality===
Spartan women, of the citizenry class, enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. The higher status of females in Spartan society started at birth; unlike Athens, Spartan girls were fed the same food as their brothers. Nor were they confined to their father&#x27;s house and prevented from exercising or getting fresh air as in Athens, but exercised and even competed in sports. Most important, rather than being married off at the age of 12 or 13, Spartan law forbade the marriage of a girl until she was in her late teens or early 20s. The reasons for delaying marriage were to ensure the birth of healthy children, but the effect was to spare Spartan women the hazards and lasting health damage associated with pregnancy among adolescents. Spartan women, better fed from childhood and fit from exercise, stood a far better chance of reaching old age than their sisters in other Greek cities, where the median age for death was 34.6 years or roughly 10 years below that of men.

Unlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore dresses (peplos) slit up the side to allow freer movement and moved freely about the city, either walking or driving chariots. Girls as well as boys exercised, possibly in the nude, and young women as well as young men may have participated in the Gymnopaedia (&quot;Festival of Nude Youths&quot;).

Another practice that was mentioned by many visitors to Sparta was the practice of &quot;wife-sharing&quot;. In accordance with the Spartan belief that breeding should be between the most physically fit parents, many older men allowed younger, more fit men, to impregnate their wives. Other unmarried or childless men might even request another man&#x27;s wife to bear his children if she had previously been a strong child bearer. For this reason many considered Spartan women polygamous or polyandrous. This practice was encouraged in order that women bear as many strong-bodied children as they could. The Spartan population was hard to maintain due to the constant absence and loss of the men in battle and the intense physical inspection of newborns.

Spartan women were also literate and numerate, a rarity in the ancient world. Furthermore, as a result of their education and the fact that they moved freely in society engaging with their fellow (male) citizens, they were notorious for speaking their minds even in public. Plato, in the middle of the fourth century, described women&#x27;s curriculum in Sparta as consisting of gymnastics and mousike (music and arts). Plato praised Spartan women&#x27;s ability when it came to philosophical discussion.

Most importantly, Spartan women had economic power because they controlled their own properties, and those of their husbands. It is estimated that in later Classical Sparta, when the male population was in serious decline, women were the sole owners of at least 35% of all land and property in Sparta. The laws regarding a divorce were the same for both men and women. Unlike women in Athens, if a Spartan woman became the heiress of her father because she had no living brothers to inherit (an &quot;epikleros&quot;), the woman was not required to divorce her current spouse in order to marry her nearest paternal relative.

===Historic women===
Many women played a significant role in the history of Sparta. Queen Gorgo, heiress to the throne and the wife of Leonidas I, was an influential and well-documented figure. Herodotus records that as a small girl she advised her father Cleomenes to resist a bribe. She was later said to be responsible for decoding a warning that the Persian forces were about to invade Greece; after Spartan generals could not decode a wooden tablet covered in wax, she ordered them to clear the wax, revealing the warning. Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Moralia&quot; contains a collection of &quot;Sayings of Spartan Women&quot;, including a laconic quip attributed to Gorgo: when asked by a woman from Attica why Spartan women were the only women in the world who could rule men, she replied &quot;Because we are the only women who are mothers of men&quot;. In 396, Cynisca, sister of the Eurypontid king Agesilaos II, became the first woman in Greece to win an Olympic chariot race. She won again in 392, and dedicated two monuments to commemorate her victory, these being an inscription in Sparta and a set of bronze equestrian statues at the Olympic temple of Zeus.

==Laconophilia==
Laconophilia is love or admiration of Sparta and its culture or constitution. Sparta was subject of considerable admiration in its day, even in rival Athens. In ancient times &quot;Many of the noblest and best of the Athenians always considered the Spartan state nearly as an ideal theory realised in practice.&quot; Many Greek philosophers, especially Platonists, would often describe Sparta as an ideal state, strong, brave, and free from the corruptions of commerce and money. The French classicist François Ollier in his 1933 book &quot;Le mirage spartiate&quot; (The Spartan Mirage) warned that a major scholarly problem is that all surviving accounts of Sparta were by non-Spartans who often excessively idealized their subject. The term &quot;Spartan Mirage&quot; has come to refer to &quot;idealized distortions and inventions regarding the character of Spartan society in the works of non-Spartan writers,&quot; beginning in Greek and Roman antiquity and continuing through the medieval and modern eras. These accounts of Sparta are typically associated with the social or political concerns of the writer. No accounts survive by the Spartans themselves, if such were ever written.
With the revival of classical learning in Renaissance Europe, Laconophilia re-appeared, for example in the writings of Machiavelli. The Elizabethan English constitutionalist John Aylmer compared the mixed government of Tudor England to the Spartan republic, stating that &quot;Lacedemonia [was] the noblest and best city governed that ever was&quot;. He commended it as a model for England. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau contrasted Sparta favourably with Athens in his &quot;Discourse on the Arts and Sciences&quot;, arguing that its austere constitution was preferable to the more sophisticated Athenian life. Sparta was also used as a model of austere purity by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France.

A German racist strain of Laconophilia was initiated by Karl Otfried Müller, who linked Spartan ideals to the supposed racial superiority of the Dorians, the ethnic sub-group of the Greeks to which the Spartans belonged. In the 20th century, this developed into Fascist admiration of Spartan ideals. Adolf Hitler praised the Spartans, recommending in 1928 that Germany should imitate them by limiting &quot;the number allowed to live&quot;. He added that &quot;The Spartans were once capable of such a wise measure... The subjugation of 350,000 Helots by 6,000 Spartans was only possible because of the racial superiority of the Spartans.&quot; The Spartans had created &quot;the first racialist state&quot;. Following the invasion of the USSR, Hitler viewed citizens of the USSR as like the helots under the Spartans: &quot;They [the Spartans] came as conquerors, and they took everything&quot;, and so should the Germans. A Nazi officer specified that &quot;the Germans would have to assume the position of the Spartiates, while... the Russians were the Helots.&quot;

Certain early Zionists, and particularly the founders of Kibbutz movement in Israel, were influenced by Spartan ideals, particularly in education. Tabenkin, a founding father of the Kibbutz movement and the Palmach strikeforce, prescribed that education for warfare &quot;should begin from the nursery&quot;, that children should from kindergarten be taken to &quot;spend nights in the mountains and valleys&quot;.

In modern times, the adjective &quot;Spartan&quot; means simple, frugal, avoiding luxury and comfort. The term &quot;laconic phrase&quot; describes the very terse and direct speech characteristic of the Spartans.

Sparta also features prominently in modern popular culture, most famously the Battle of Thermopylae (see Battle of Thermopylae in popular culture).

<doc id="36511" wikidata="Q490" url="?curid=36511" title="Milan">
<text>Milan ( , , ; ) is a city in northern Italy, regional capital of Lombardy, the largest city in Italy by urban population and the second-most-populous city proper in Italy after Rome. The city proper has a population of about 1.4 million, while its metropolitan city has 3.22 million residents. The urban area of Milan is the fourth-most-populous in the EU with 6.17 million inhabitants. According to national sources, the population within the wider Milan metropolitan area (also known as Greater Milan) is estimated between 7.5 million and 8.2 million, making it by far the largest metropolitan area in Italy and one of the largest in the EU. Milan is the economic capital of Italy, one of the economic capitals of Europe and a global financial centre.

Milan is a leading alpha global city, with strengths in the fields of art, chemicals, commerce, design, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media (communication), services, research, and tourism. Its business district hosts Italy&#x27;s stock exchange (), and the headquarters of national and international banks and companies. In terms of GDP, Milan is the wealthiest city in Italy, having also one of the largest economies among EU cities. Milan is viewed along with Turin as the southernmost part of the Blue Banana urban development corridor (also known as the &quot;European Megalopolis&quot;), and one of the Four Motors for Europe. Milan is a major international tourist destination, appearing among the most visited cities in the world, ranking second in Italy after Rome, fifth in Europe and sixteenth in the world. Milan is a major cultural centre, with museums and art galleries that include some of the most important collections in the world, such as major works by Leonardo da Vinci. It also hosts numerous educational institutions, academies and universities, with 11% of the national total of enrolled students.

Founded around 590 BC under the name Medhelanon by a Celtic tribe belonging to the Insubres group and belonging to the Golasecca culture, it was conquered by the ancient Romans in 222 BC, who Latinized the name of the city into Mediolanum. The city&#x27;s role as a major political centre dates back to the late antiquity, when it served as the capital of the Western Roman Empire. From the 12th century until the 16th century, Milan was one of the largest European cities and a major trade and commercial centre, as the capital of the Duchy of Milan, one of the greatest political, artistic and fashion forces in the Renaissance. Having become one of the main centres of the Italian Enlightenment during the early modern period, it then became one of the most active centres during the Restoration, until its entry into the unified Kingdom of Italy. From the 20th century onwards Milan became the industrial and financial capital of Italy. According to a 2024 study published in &quot;Nature&quot; and reported by &quot;The Economist&quot;, Milan was ranked as the most walkable city in the world.

Milan has been recognized as one of the world&#x27;s four fashion capitals. Many of the most famous luxury fashion brands in the world have their headquarters in the city, including: Armani, Prada, Versace, Valentino, Loro Piana and Zegna. It also hosts several international events and fairs, including Milan Fashion Week and the Milan Furniture Fair, which are among the world&#x27;s biggest in terms of revenue, visitors and growth. The city is served by many luxury hotels and is the fifth most starred in the world by Michelin Guide. It hosted the Universal Exposition in 1906 and 2015. In the field of sports, Milan is home to two of Europe&#x27;s most successful football teams, AC Milan and Inter Milan, and one of Europe&#x27;s main basketball teams, Olimpia Milano. Milan will host the Winter Olympic and Paralympic games for the first time in 2026, together with Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo.

== Toponymy ==
Milan was founded with the Celtic name of Medhelanon, later Latinized by the ancient Romans into Mediolanum. In Celtic language &quot;medhe-&quot; meant &quot;middle, centre&quot; and the name element &quot;-lanon&quot; is the Celtic equivalent of Latin &quot;-planum&quot; &quot;plain&quot;, meant &quot;(settlement) in the midst of the plain&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Delamarre 2003 https://archive.org/details/dictionnairedela00dela_348/page/n219 221–222&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or of &quot;place between watercourses&quot; (Celtic &quot;medhe&quot; = &quot;in the middle, central&quot;; &quot;land&quot; or &quot;lan&quot; = &quot;land&quot;), given the presence of the Olona, Lambro, Seveso rivers and the Nirone and Pudiga streams.

The Latin name &quot;Mediolanum&quot; comes from the Latin words &quot;medio&quot; (in the middle) and &quot;planus&quot; (plain). However, some scholars believe that &quot;lanum&quot; comes from the Celtic root &quot;lan&quot;, meaning an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the Welsh word &quot;llan&quot;, meaning &quot;a sanctuary or church&quot;, ultimately cognate to English/German &quot;Land&quot;) in which Celtic communities used to build shrines.

Hence &quot;Mediolanum&quot; could signify the central town or sanctuary of a Celtic tribe. Indeed, about sixty Gallo-Roman sites in France bore the name &quot;Mediolanum&quot;, for example: Saintes (&quot;Mediolanum Santonum&quot;) and Évreux (&quot;Mediolanum Aulercorum&quot;). In addition, another theory links the name to the &quot;scrofa semilanuta&quot; (&quot;half-woolly sow&quot;) an ancient emblem of the city, fancifully accounted for in Andrea Alciato&#x27;s &quot;Emblemata&quot; (1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the city walls, where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and the etymology of &quot;Mediolanum&quot; given as &quot;half-wool&quot;, explained in Latin and in French.

According to this theory, the foundation of Milan is credited to two Celtic peoples, the Bituriges and the Aedui, having as their emblems a ram and a boar; therefore &quot;The city&#x27;s symbol is a wool-bearing boar, an animal of double form, here with sharp bristles, there with sleek wool.&quot; Alciato credits Ambrose for his account.

== History ==

=== Celtic era ===
Around 590 BC a Celtic tribe belonging to the Insubres group and belonging to the Golasecca culture settled the city under the name Medhelanon. According to the legend reported by Livy (writing between 27 and 9 BC), the Gaulish king Ambicatus sent his nephew Bellovesus into northern Italy at the head of a party drawn from various Gaulish tribes; Bellovesus allegedly founded the settlement in the times of the Roman monarchy, during the reign of Tarquinius Priscus. Tarquin is traditionally recorded as reigning from 616 to 579 BC, according to ancient Roman historian Titus Livy.

Medhelanon, in particular, was developed around a sanctuary, which was the oldest area of the village. The sanctuary, which consisted of a wooded area in the shape of an ellipse with a central clearing, was aligned according to precise astronomical points. For this reason, it was used for religious gatherings, especially in particular celebratory moments. The sanctuary of Medhelanon was an ellipse with axes of and located near Piazza della Scala. The urban planning profile was based on these early paths, and on the shape of the sanctuary, reached, in some cases, up to the 19th century and even beyond. For example, the route of the modern Corso Vittorio Emanuele, Piazza del Duomo, Piazza Cordusio and Via Broletto, which is curvilinear, could correspond to the south side of the ellipse of the ancient sanctuary of Medhelanon.

One axis of the Medhelanon sanctuary was aligned towards the heliacal rising of Antares, while the other towards the heliacal rising of Capella. The latter coincided with a Celtic spring festival celebrated on 24 March, while the heliacal rising of Antares corresponded with 11 November, which opened and closed the Celtic year and which coincided with the point where the Sun rose on the winter solstice. About two centuries after the creation of the Celtic sanctuary, the first residential settlements began to be built around it. Medhelanon then transformed from a simple religious center to an urban and then military centre, thus becoming a real village.

The first homes were built just south of the Celtic sanctuary, near the modern Royal Palace of Milan. Subsequently, with the growth of the town centre, other important buildings for the Medhelanon community were built. First, a temple dedicated to the goddess Belisama was built, which was located near the modern Milan Cathedral. Then, near the modern Via Moneta, which is located near today&#x27;s Piazza San Sepolcro, a fortified building with military functions was built which was surrounded by a defensive moat.

=== Roman times ===
During the Roman Republic, the Romans, led by consul Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, fought the Insubres and captured the settlement in 222 BC. The chief of the Insubres then submitted to Rome, giving the Romans control of the settlement. The Romans eventually conquered the entirety of the region, calling the new province &quot;Cisalpine Gaul&quot; ()—&quot;Gaul this side of the Alps&quot;—and may have given the city its Latinized name of Mediolanum: in Gaulish &quot;*medio-&quot; meant &quot;middle, centre&quot; and the name element &quot;-lanon&quot; is the Celtic equivalent of Latin &quot;-planum&quot; &quot;plain&quot;, thus &quot;*Mediolanon&quot; (Latinized as &quot;Mediolānum&quot;) meant &quot;(settlement) in the midst of the plain&quot;. Mediolanum became the most important center of Cisalpine Gaul and, in the wake of economic development, in 49 BC, was elevated, within the &quot;Lex Roscia&quot;, to the status of &quot;municipium&quot;.

The ancient Celtic settlement was, from a topographic point of view, superimposed and replaced by the Roman one. The Roman city was then gradually superimposed and replaced by the medieval one. The urban center of Milan has therefore grown constantly and rapidly, until modern times, around the first Celtic nucleus. The original Celtic toponym Medhelanon then changed, as evidenced by a graffiti in Celtic language present on a section of the Roman walls of Milan which dates back to a period following the Roman conquest of the Celtic village, in Mesiolano. In 286, the Roman Emperor Diocletian moved the capital of the Western Roman Empire from Rome to Mediolanum. Diocletian himself chose to reside at Nicomedia in the Eastern Empire, leaving his colleague Maximian at Milan.

During the Augustan age Mediolanum was famous for its schools; it possessed a theatre and an amphitheatre (129.5 x 109.3 m), the third largest in Roman Italy after the Colosseum in Rome and the vast amphitheatre in Capua. A large stone wall encircled the city in Caesar&#x27;s time, and later was expanded in the late third century AD, by Maximian. Maximian built several gigantic monuments including the large circus (470 × 85 metres) and the &quot;thermae&quot; or Baths of Hercules, a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which few visible traces remain. Maximian increased the city area to 375 acres by surrounding it with a new, larger stone wall (about 4.5 km long) with many 24-sided towers. The monumental area had twin towers; the one included later in the construction of the convent of San Maurizio Maggiore remains 16.6 m high.

It was from Mediolanum that the Emperor Constantine issued what is now known as the Edict of Milan in AD 313, granting tolerance to all religions within the Empire, thus paving the way for Christianity to become the dominant religion of the Empire. Constantine was in Mediolanum to celebrate the wedding of his sister to the Eastern Emperor, Licinius. In 402, the Visigoths besieged the city and the Emperor Honorius moved the Imperial residence to Ravenna. In 452, Attila besieged the city, but the real break with the city&#x27;s Imperial past came in 539, during the Gothic War, when Uraias (a nephew of Witiges, formerly King of the Italian Ostrogoths) carried out attacks in Milan, with losses, according to Procopius, being about 300,000 men. The Lombards took Ticinum as their capital in 572 (renaming it &quot;Papia&quot; – the modern Pavia), and left early-medieval Milan to the governance of its archbishops.

=== Middle Ages ===

After the siege of the city by the Visigoths in 402, the imperial residence moved to Ravenna. Attila, King of the Huns, sacked and devastated the city in 452 AD. In 539 the Ostrogoths conquered and destroyed Milan during the Gothic War against Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. In the summer of 569 the Lombards (from whom the name of the Italian region Lombardy derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small Byzantine garrison left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule. Milan surrendered to Charlemagne and the Franks in 774.

The 11th century saw a reaction against the control of the Holy Roman Emperors. City-states emerged in northern Italy, an expression of the new political power of the cities and their will to fight against all feudal powers. Milan was no exception. It did not take long, however, for the Italian city-states to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers. The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked Frederick I Barbarossa for help. In a sally they captured Empress Beatrice and forced her to ride a donkey backward through the city until getting out. Frederick I Barbarossa brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162.

A period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its geographical position. During this time, the city was considered one of the largest European cities. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the Peace of Constance in 1183, Milan returned to the commune form of local government first established in the 11th century.

In 1395, Gian Galeazzo Visconti became the first Duke of Milan upon receiving the title from Wenceslaus, King of the Romans. In 1447 Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the Ambrosian Republic was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city. Both the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions worked together to bring about the Ambrosian Republic in Milan. Nonetheless, the Republic collapsed when, in 1450, Milan was conquered by Francesco I of the House of Sforza, which made Milan one of the leading cities of the Italian Renaissance. Under the House of Sforza, Milan experienced a period of great prosperity, which in particular saw the development of mulberry cultivation and silk processing.

Following this economic growth, works such as the Sforza Castle (already existing in the Visconti era under the name of Porta Giovia Castle, but re-adapted, enlarged and completed by the Sforza family) and the Ospedale Maggiore were completed. The Sforzas also managed to attract to Milan personalities such as Leonardo da Vinci, who redesigned and improved the function of the navigli and painted &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, and Bramante, who worked on the church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro, on the basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio and to the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, influencing the development of the Lombard Renaissance.

=== Early modern ===

Milan&#x27;s last independent ruler, Lodovico il Moro, requested the aid of Charles VIII of France against the other Italian states, eventually unleashing the Italian Wars. The king&#x27;s cousin, Louis of Orléans, took part in the expedition and realized most of Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to come back a few years later in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling Visconti family. At that time, Milan was also defended by Swiss mercenaries. After the victory of Louis&#x27;s successor François I over the Swiss at the Battle of Marignan, the duchy was promised to the French king François I. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor Charles V defeated François I at the Battle of Pavia in 1525, northern Italy, which included Milan, passed to Habsburg Spain.

In 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son Philip II and his brother Ferdinand I. Charles&#x27;s Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand&#x27;s Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The Great Plague of Milan in 1629–31, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by Alessandro Manzoni in his masterpiece &quot;The Betrothed&quot;. This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long pandemic of plague that began with the Black Death.

In 1700, the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of Charles II. After his death, the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701. In 1706, the French were defeated in Ramillies and Turin and were forced to yield northern Italy to the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1713–1714 the Treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain&#x27;s Italian possessions including Lombardy and its capital, Milan.

Napoleon invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the Cisalpine Republic. Later, he declared Milan capital of the Kingdom of Italy and was crowned King of Italy in the cathedral. After Napoleon&#x27;s occupation ended, the Congress of Vienna returned Lombardy and Milan to Austrian control in 1815.

=== Late modern and contemporary ===
On 18 March 1848 Milan effectively rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called &quot;Five Days&quot; (), that forced Field Marshal Radetzky to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering Kingdom of Piedmont–Sardinia sent troops to protect the insurgents and organised a plebiscite that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont–Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the Battle of Custoza on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy. About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new French Empire of Napoleon III to defeat Austria and establish a large Italian state in the region. At the Battle of Solferino in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the Quadrilateral line. Following this battle, Milan and the rest of Lombardy were incorporated into Piedmont-Sardinia, which then proceeded to annex all the other Italian statelets and proclaim the birth of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861.

The political unification of Italy enhanced Milan&#x27;s economic dominance over northern Italy. A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the Gotthard (1882) and Simplon (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the Orient Express that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy&#x27;s financial sphere, the city became the country&#x27;s leading financial centre. In May 1898, Milan was shaken by the Bava Beccaris massacre, a riot related to soaring cost of living.
Milan&#x27;s northern location in Italy closer to Europe, secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene. It was in Milan that Benito Mussolini built his political and journalistic careers, and his fascist Blackshirts rallied for the first time in the city&#x27;s Piazza San Sepolcro; here the future Fascist dictator launched his March on Rome on 28 October 1922. During the Second World War Milan&#x27;s large industrial and transport facilities suffered extensive damage from Allied bombings that often also hit residential districts. When Italy surrendered in 1943, German forces occupied and plundered most of northern Italy, fueling the birth of a massive resistance guerrilla movement. On 29 April 1945, the American 1st Armored Division was advancing on Milan but, before it arrived, the Italian resistance seized control of the city and executed Mussolini along with his mistress and several regime officers, that were later hanged and exposed in Piazzale Loreto, where one year before some resistance members had been executed.

During the post-war economic boom, the reconstruction effort and the Italian economic miracle attracted a large wave of internal migration (especially from rural areas of southern Italy) to Milan. The population grew from 1.3 million in 1951 to 1.7 million in 1967. During this period, Milan was rapidly rebuilt, with the construction of several innovative and modernist skyscrapers, such as the Torre Velasca and the Pirelli Tower, that soon became the symbols of this new era of prosperity. The economic prosperity was, however, overshadowed in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the so-called Years of lead, when Milan witnessed an unprecedented wave of street violence, labour strikes and political terrorism. The apex of this period of turmoil occurred on 12 December 1969, when a bomb exploded at the National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, killing 17 people and injuring 88.

In the 1980s, with the international success of Milanese houses (like Armani, Prada, Versace, Moschino and Dolce &amp; Gabbana), Milan became one of the world&#x27;s fashion capitals. The city saw also a marked rise in international tourism, notably from America and Japan, while the stock exchange increased its market capitalisation more than five-fold. This period led the mass media to nickname the metropolis &quot;Milano da bere&quot;, literally &quot;Milan to be drunk&quot;. But in the 1990s Milan was badly affected by Tangentopoli, a political scandal in which many politicians and businessmen were tried for corruption. The city was also affected by a severe financial crisis and a steady decline in textiles, automobile and steel production. Berlusconi&#x27;s Milano 2 and Milano 3 projects were the most important housing projects of the 1980s and 1990s in Milan and brought to the city new economical and social energy.

In the early 21st century Milan underwent a series of sweeping redevelopments over huge former industrial areas. Two new business districts, Porta Nuova and CityLife, were built in the space of a decade, radically changing the skyline of the city. Its exhibition centre moved to a much larger site in Rho. The long decline in traditional manufacturing has been overshadowed by a great expansion of publishing, finance, banking, fashion design, information technology, logistics and tourism. The city&#x27;s decades-long population decline seems to have partially reverted in recent years, as the gained about 100,000 new residents since the last census. The successful re-branding of the city as a global capital of innovation has been instrumental in its successful bids for hosting large international events such as 2015 Expo and 2026 Winter Olympics.

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===

Milan is located in the north-western section of the Po Valley, approximately halfway between the river Po to the south and the foothills of the Alps with the great lakes (Lake Como, Lake Maggiore and Lake Lugano) to the north, the Ticino river to the west and the Adda to the east. The city&#x27;s land is flat, the highest point being at above sea level.

The administrative covers an area of about , with a population, in 2013, of 1,324,169 and a population density of . The Metropolitan City of Milan covers and in 2015 had a population estimated at 3,196,825, with a resulting density of . A larger urban area, comprising parts of the provinces of Milan, Monza e Brianza, Como, Lecco and Varese is wide and has a population of 5.27 million with a density of .

The concentric layout of the city centre reflects the &quot;Navigli&quot;, an ancient system of navigable and interconnected canals, now mostly covered. The suburbs of the city have expanded mainly to the north, swallowing up many along the roads towards Varese, Como, Lecco and Bergamo. In the 21st century the Navigli region of Milan is a highly active area with a large number of residential units, bars and restaurants. It is also a well-known centre for artists.

=== Climate ===

Milan features a mid-latitude, four-season humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), according to the Köppen climate classification. Milan&#x27;s climate is similar to much of Northern Italy&#x27;s inland plains, with hot, humid summers and cold, foggy winters. The Alps and Apennine Mountains form a natural barrier that protects the city from the major circulations coming from northern Europe and the sea.

During winter daily average temperatures can fall below freezing () and accumulations of snow can occur: the historic average of Milan&#x27;s area is in the period between 1961 and 1990, with a record of in January 1985. In the suburbs the average can reach . The city receives on average seven days of snow per year.

The city was often shrouded in thick cloud or fog during winter, although the removal of rice paddies from the southern neighbourhoods and the urban heat island effect have greatly reduced this occurrence since the turn of the 21st century. Occasionally, the Foehn winds cause the temperatures to rise unexpectedly: on 22 January 2012 the daily high reached while on 22 February 2012 it reached . Air pollution levels rise significantly in wintertime when cold air clings to the soil, causing Milan to be one of Europe&#x27;s most polluted cities.

Summers in Milan are hot and humidity levels are high with peak temperatures reaching above . Due to the high humidity, urban heat effect and lack of wind, nighttimes often remain muggy during the summer months. Usually the summer enjoys clearer skies with an average of more than 13 hours of daylight: when precipitation occurs though, it is more likely to be accompanied by thunderstorms and hail. Springs and autumns are generally pleasant, with temperatures ranging between ; these seasons are characterized by higher rainfall, especially in April and May. Relative humidity typically ranges between 45% (comfortable) and 95% (very humid) throughout the year, rarely dropping below 27% (dry) and reaching as high as 100%. Wind is generally absent: over the course of the year typical wind speeds vary from (calm to gentle breeze), rarely exceeding (fresh breeze), except during summer thunderstorms when winds can blow strong. In the spring, gale-force windstorms may happen, generated either by Tramontane blowing from the Alps or by Bora-like winds from the north. Due to its geographic location surrounded by mountains on 3 sides, Milan is among the least windy cities in Europe.

== Administration ==

=== Municipal government ===

The legislative body of the Italian is the City Council (&quot;Consiglio Comunale&quot;), which in cities with more than one million population is composed by 48 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, at the same time of the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (&quot;Giunta Comunale&quot;), composed by 12 assessors, that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor. The current mayor of Milan is Giuseppe Sala, an independent leading a centre-left alliance led by the Democratic Party.

The municipality of Milan is subdivided into nine administrative Borough Councils (&quot;Consigli di Municipio&quot;), down from the former twenty districts before the 1999 administrative reform. Each Borough Council is governed by a Council (&quot;Consiglio&quot;) and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114), the Municipal Statute and several laws, notably the Legislative Decree 267/2000 or Unified Text on Local Administration (&quot;Testo Unico degli Enti Locali&quot;). After the 2016 administrative reform, the Borough Councils have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics and are responsible for running most local services, such as schools, social services, waste collection, roads, parks, libraries and local commerce; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding to finance local activities.

=== Metropolitan city ===
Milan is the capital of the eponymous Metropolitan city. According to the last governmental dispositions concerning administrative reorganisation, the urban area of Milan is one of the 15 Metropolitan municipalities (&quot;città metropolitane&quot;), new administrative bodies fully operative since 1 January 2015. The new Metro municipalities, giving large urban areas the administrative powers of a province, are conceived for improving the performance of local administrations and to slash local spending by better co-ordinating the municipalities in providing basic services (including transport, school and social programs) and environment protection. In this policy framework, the Mayor of Milan is designated to exercise the functions of Metropolitan mayor (&quot;Sindaco metropolitano&quot;), presiding over a Metropolitan Council formed by 24 mayors of municipalities within the Metro municipality. The Metropolitan City of Milan is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor (&quot;Sindaco metropolitano&quot;) and by the Metropolitan Council (&quot;Consiglio metropolitano&quot;). Since 21 June 2016, Giuseppe Sala, as mayor of the capital city, has been the mayor of the Metropolitan City.

=== Regional government ===
Milan is also the capital of Lombardy, one of the twenty regions of Italy. Lombardy is by far the most populated region of Italy, with more than ten million inhabitants, almost one sixth of the national total. It is governed by a Regional Council, composed of 80 members elected for a five-year term. On 26 March 2018, a list of candidates of the centre-right coalition, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Attilio Fontana, largely won the regional election, defeating a coalition of socialists, liberals and ecologists and a third-party candidate from the populist Five Stars Movement. The conservatives have governed the region almost uninterruptedly since 1970. The regional council has 48 members from the centre-right coalition, 18 from the centre-left coalition and 13 from the Five Star Movement. The seat of the regional government is Palazzo Lombardia that, standing at , is the fifth-tallest building in Milan.

== Cityscape ==

=== Skyline ===
=== Architecture ===



The architectural and artistic presence in Milan represents one of the attractions of the Lombard capital. Milan has been among the most important Italian centers in the history of architecture, has made important contributions to the development of art history, and has been the cradle of a number of modern art movements.

There are only few remains of the ancient Roman city, notably the well-preserved Colonne di San Lorenzo. During the second half of the 4th century, Saint Ambrose, as bishop of Milan, had a strong influence on the layout of the city, reshaping the centre (although the cathedral and baptistery built in Roman times are now lost) and building the great basilicas at the city gates: Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, San Nazaro in Brolo, San Simpliciano and Sant&#x27;Eustorgio, which still stand, refurbished over the centuries, as some of the finest and most important churches in Milan. Milan&#x27;s Cathedral, built between 1386 and 1877, is the largest church in the Italian Republic—the larger St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica is in the State of Vatican City, a sovereign state—and the third largest in the world, as well as the most important example of Gothic architecture in Italy. The gilt bronze statue of the Virgin Mary, placed in 1774 on the highest pinnacle of the Duomo, soon became one of the most enduring symbols of Milan.

In the 15th century, when the Sforza ruled the city, an old Viscontean fortress was enlarged and embellished to become the Castello Sforzesco, the seat of an elegant Renaissance court surrounded by a walled hunting park. Notable architects involved in the project included the Florentine Filarete, who was commissioned to build the high central entrance tower, and the military specialist Bartolomeo Gadio. The alliance between Francesco Sforza and Florence&#x27;s Cosimo de&#x27; Medici bore to Milan Tuscan models of Renaissance architecture, apparent in the Ospedale Maggiore and Bramante&#x27;s work in the city, which includes Santa Maria presso San Satiro (a reconstruction of a small 9th-century church), the tribune of Santa Maria delle Grazie and three cloisters for Sant&#x27;Ambrogio. The Counter-Reformation in the 16th to 17th centuries was also the period of Spanish domination and was marked by two powerful figures: Saint Charles Borromeo and his cousin, Cardinal Federico Borromeo. Not only did they impose themselves as moral guides to the people of Milan, but they also gave a great impulse to culture, with the creation of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, in a building designed by Francesco Maria Richini, and the nearby Pinacoteca Ambrosiana. Many notable churches and Baroque mansions were built in the city during this period by the architects, Pellegrino Tibaldi, Galeazzo Alessi and Richini himself.

Empress Maria Theresa of Austria was responsible for the significant renovations carried out in Milan during the 18th century. This urban and artistic renewal included the establishment of Teatro alla Scala, inaugurated in 1778, and the renovation of the Royal Palace. The late 1700s Palazzo Belgioioso by Giuseppe Piermarini and Royal Villa of Milan by Leopoldo Pollack, later the official residence of Austrian viceroys, are often regarded among the best examples of Neoclassical architecture in Lombardy. The Napoleonic rule of the city in 1805–1814, having established Milan as the capital of a satellite Kingdom of Italy, took steps to reshape it accordingly to its new status, with the construction of large boulevards, new squares (Porta Ticinese by Luigi Cagnola and Foro Bonaparte by Giovanni Antonio Antolini) and cultural institutions (Art Gallery and the Academy of Fine Arts). The massive Arch of Peace, situated at the bottom of Corso Sempione, is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. In the second half of the 19th century, Milan quickly became the main industrial centre of the new Italian nation, drawing inspiration from the great European capitals that were hubs of the Second Industrial Revolution. The great Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, realised by Giuseppe Mengoni between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate Vittorio Emanuele II, is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the Burlington Arcade in London. Several other arcades such as the Galleria del Corso, built between 1923 and 1931, complement it. Another late-19th-century eclectic monument in the city is the Cimitero Monumentale graveyard, built in a Neo-Romanesque style between 1863 and 1866.

The tumultuous period of early 20th century brought several, radical innovations in Milanese architecture. Art Nouveau, also known as &quot;Liberty&quot; in Italy, is recognisable in Palazzo Castiglioni, built by architect Giuseppe Sommaruga between 1901 and 1903. Other examples include Hotel Corso, Casa Guazzoni with its wrought iron and staircase, and Berri-Meregalli house, the latter built in a traditional Milanese Art Nouveau style combined with elements of neo-Romanesque and Gothic revival architecture, regarded as one of the last such types of architecture in the city. A new, more eclectic form of architecture can be seen in buildings such as Castello Cova, built the 1910s in a distinctly neo-medieval style, evoking the architectural trends of the past. An important example of Art Deco, which blended such styles with Fascist architecture, is the huge Central railway station inaugurated in 1931.

The post-World War II period saw rapid reconstruction and fast economic growth, accompanied by a nearly two-fold increase in population. In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city&#x27;s architectural history, including Gio Ponti&#x27;s Pirelli Tower (1956–60), Velasca Tower (1956–58), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low-quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably Porta Nuova in downtown Milan and FieraMilano in the suburb of Rho. In addition, the old exhibition area is being completely reshaped according to the Citylife regeneration project, featuring residencial areas, museums, an urban park and three skyscrapers designed by international architects, and after whom they are named: the Isozaki Arata—when completed, the tallest building in Italy, the twisted Hadid Tower, and the curved Libeskind Tower.

Two business districts dominate Milan&#x27;s skyline: &quot;Porta Nuova&quot; in the north-east (boroughs No. 9 and 2) and &quot;CityLife&quot; (borough No. 8) in the north-west part of the commune. The tallest buildings include the Unicredit Tower at 231 m (though only 162 m without the spire), and the 209 m Allianz Tower, a 50-story tower.

=== Parks and gardens ===

The largest parks in the central area of Milan are Sempione Park, at the north-western edge, and Montanelli Gardens, situated north-east of the city. English-style Sempione Park, built in 1890, contains the Civic Arena, the Civic Aquarium of Milan (which is the third oldest aquarium in Europe), a steel lattice panoramic tower, an art exhibition centre, a Japanese garden and a public library. The Montanelli gardens, created in the 18th century, hosts the Natural History Museum of Milan and a planetarium. Slightly away from the city centre, heading east, Forlanini Park is characterised by a large pond and a few preserved shacks which remind of the area&#x27;s agricultural past. In recent years Milan&#x27;s authorities pledged to develop its green areas: they planned to create twenty new urban parks and extend the already existing ones, and announced plans to plant three million trees by 2030.

Also notable is Monte Stella (&quot;Starmount&quot;), also informally called Montagnetta di San Siro (&quot;Little mountain of San Siro&quot;), an artificial hill and surrounding city park in Milan. The hill was created using the debris from the buildings that were bombed during World War II, as well as from the last remnants of the Spanish walls of the city, demolished in the mid 20th century. Even at only height, the hill provides a panoramic view of the city and hinterland, and in a clear day, the Alps and Apennines can be distinguished from atop. A notable area of the park is called &quot;Giardino dei Giusti&quot; (Garden of the Just), which is a memorial to distinguished opponents of genocide and crimes against humanity; each tree in the garden is dedicated to one such person. Notable people who have been dedicated a tree in the Giardino dei Giusti include Moshe Bejski, Andrej Sakharov, Svetlana Broz, and Pietro Kuciukian.

The Orto Botanico di Brera a botanical garden located behind Palazzo Brera at Via Brera 28 in the center of Milan, is another major park in the city. The garden consists primarily of rectangular flower-beds, trimmed in brick, with elliptical ponds from the 18th century, and specula and greenhouse from the 19th century (now used by the Academy of Fine Arts). It contains one of the oldest &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; trees in Europe, as well as mature specimens of &quot;Firmiana platanifolia&quot;, &quot;Juglans nigra&quot;, &quot;Pterocarya fraxinifolia&quot;, and &quot;Tilia&quot;.

In addition, even though Milan is located in one of the most urbanised regions of Italy, it is surrounded by a belt of green areas and features numerous gardens even in its very centre. The farmlands and woodlands north (Parco Nord Milano since 1975) and south (Parco Agricolo Sud Milano since 1990) of the urban area have been protected as regional parks. West of the city, the Parco delle Cave (Sand pit park) has been established on a neglected site where gravel and sand used to be extracted, featuring artificial lakes and woods.

== Demographics ==
The official estimated population of the City of Milan was 1,417,597 as of 31 December 2023, according to the municipality&#x27;s statistical office.

Mid-2024 estimates suggest that 3,251,166 people lived in Milan province-level municipality. The population of Milan today is lower than its historical peak. With rapid industrialization in post-war years, the population of Milan peaked at 1,743,427 in 1973. Thereafter, during the following decades, about one third of the population moved to the outer belt of suburbs and new satellite settlements that grew around the city proper.

Today, Milan&#x27;s conurbation extends well beyond the borders of the city proper and of its special-status provincial authority: its contiguous built-up urban area was home to 5.27 million people in 2015, while its wider metropolitan area, the largest in Italy and fourth largest in the EU, is estimated to have a population of more than 8.2 million.

=== Foreign residents ===


As of 2023, some 301,149 foreign residents lived in the municipality of Milan, representing 21.2% of the total resident population. These figures suggest that the immigrant population has more than doubled in the last 15 years.

After World War II, Milan experienced two main waves of immigration: the first, dating from the 1950s to the early 1970s, saw a large influx of migrants from poorer and rural areas within Italy; the second, starting from the late 1980s, has been characterized by the preponderance of foreign-born immigrants.

The early period coincided with the so-called Italian economic miracle of postwar years, an era of extraordinary growth based on rapid industrial expansion and great public works, that brought to the city a large influx of over 400,000 people, mainly from rural and underdeveloped Southern Italy.

Decades of continuing high immigration have made the city one of the most cosmopolitan and multicultural in Italy. Immigrants came mainly from Africa (in particular Eritreans, Egyptians, Moroccans, Senegalese and Nigerian), and the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (notably Albanians, Romanians, Ukrainians, Macedonians, Moldovans, and Russians), in addition to a growing number of Asians (in particular Chinese, Sri Lankans and Filipinos) and Latin Americans (Mainly South Americans). At the beginning of the 1990s, Milan already had a population of foreign-born residents of approximately 58,000 (or 4% of the then population), that rose rapidly to over 117,000 by the end of the decade (about 9% of the total).

Milan is home to the second-largest Far East Asian community in Europe after Paris, with the Philippines and China, making up about a quarter of its foreign population (around 76,000 out of 301,000 in 2023). Another 4,000 foreigners come from other East Asian countries; notably, Milan hosts more than 2,000 Japanese nationals and 1,000 Koreans, excluding those who also hold Italian citizenship. Foreigners holding East-Asian citizenship thus make up around 5.36% of the city&#x27;s population. Milan notably hosts the oldest and largest (along with Prato) Chinese community in Italy, with around 37,000 people in 2023, excluding Italians of Chinese descent such as immigrants who have acquired Italian citizenship or their descendants. Situated in the 8th district, and centered on Via Paolo Sarpi, an important commercial avenue, the Milanese Chinatown was originally established in the 1920s by immigrants from Wencheng County, in the Zhejiang, and used to operate small textile and leather workshops. Milan also hosts a Japanese International school as well as various Chinese schools throughout the city.

The city also hosts an historical African community originating from the Horn of Africa. As of 2023, there were around 4,000 Eritrean, Ethiopian or Somali-born people living in Milan, the overwhelming majority being double-citizens of Italy. and not counting second and third generation migrants. The three countries were all Italian colonies at a time, from 1869 (Eritrea) to 1943 (East African campaign). Due to the historical links with Italy, a small community originating from the Horn of Africa has established its presence near Porta Venezia district starting from the 1970s. It is estimated that in the &quot;Asmarina&quot; area (Little Asmara) there are around 2,000-2,500 people from the Horn of Africa still living there, along with multiple restaurants, institutes as well as an Ethiopian Church.

Another notable area with a large presence of foreign residents coming from a specific country is the so-called &quot;quadrilatero di San Siro&quot; or &quot;San Siro casbah&quot; in reference to the large Arab-speaking populaition living in the area. The neighbourhood, consisting of around 6,000 municipal flats, is characterised by the fact of having an estimated 25% share of Arab-speaking inhabitants, mostly hailing from Egypt. The area has often been described as a &quot;banlieue&quot; within Milan and has historically had a higher crime rate than the rest of the city. Nevertheless, in recent years many projects have been presented so as to mitigate the marginalisation of its inhabitants. Other areas hosting large Arabic-speaking populations include Maciachini-Imbonati, Corvetto, Comasina and piazza Arcole.

Milan has a substantial English-speaking community (around 4,500 US citizens, British, Irish and Australian expatriates, excluding double-citizens), and several English schools and English-language publications, such as &quot;Hello Milano&quot;, &quot;Where Milano&quot; and &quot;Easy Milano&quot;.

=== Religion ===

Milan&#x27;s population, like that of Italy as a whole, is mostly Catholic. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Milan. Greater Milan is also home to Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist communities.

Milan has been a Christian-majority city since the late Roman Empire. Its religious history was marked by the figure of St. Ambrose, whose heritage includes the Ambrosian Rite (Italian: &quot;Rito ambrosiano&quot;), used by some five million Catholics in the greater part of the Archdiocese of Milan, which consider the largest in Europe. The Rite varies slightly from the canonical Roman Rite liturgy, with differences in the mass, liturgical year (Lent starts four days later than in the Roman Rite), baptism, rite of funerals, priest clothes and sacred music (use of the Ambrosian chant rather than Gregorian).

In addition, the city is home to the largest Orthodox community in Italy. Lombardy is the seat of at least 78 Orthodox parishes and monasteries, the vast majority of them located in the area of Milan. The main Romanian Orthodox church in Milan is the Catholic church of Our Lady of Victory (Chiesa di Santa Maria della Vittoria), currently granted for use to the local Romanian community. Similarly, the point of reference for the followers of the Russian Orthodox Church is the Catholic church of San Vito in Pasquirolo.

The Jewish community of Milan is the second largest in Italy after Rome, with about 10,000 members, mainly Sephardi. The main city synagogue, Hechal David u-Mordechai Temple, was built by architect Luca Beltrami in 1892 and is also the community&#x27;s main headquarters, is located in Via della Guastalla. The interior was renovated in 1997.

Milan hosts also one of the largest Muslim communities in Italy, and the city saw the construction of the country&#x27;s first new mosque featuring a dome and minaret, since the destruction of the ancient mosques of Lucera in the year 1300. In 2014 the City Council agreed on the construction of a new mosque amid bitter political debate, since it is strenuously opposed by right-wing parties such as the Northern League. As of 2018, the Muslim population is estimated at 9% of the city&#x27;s population.

Currently, accurate statistics on the Hindu and Sikh presence in Milan metro area are not available; however, various sources estimate that about 40% of the total Indian population living in Italy, or about 50,000 individuals, reside in Lombardy, where a number of Hindu and Sikh temples exist and where they form the largest such communities in Europe after the ones in Britain.

<doc id="36517" wikidata="Q93346" url="?curid=36517" title="The Who">
<text>The Who are an English rock band formed in London in 1964. Their classic lineup (1964–1978) consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. Considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large public address systems, the use of synthesizers, Entwistle&#x27;s and Moon&#x27;s influential playing styles, Townshend&#x27;s feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

The Who evolved from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; (1965), reached the UK top ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including &quot;My Generation&quot; (1965), &quot;Substitute&quot; and &quot;Happy Jack&quot; (both 1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;, their only US top ten single. The group&#x27;s 1969 concept album &quot;Tommy&quot; included the single &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; and was a critical and commercial success.

Further festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up the album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; (1971), including the hits &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, and &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;. The group released another concept album, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of &quot;Tommy&quot; (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of &quot;Who Are You&quot; (1978) was overshadowed by Moon&#x27;s death shortly after.

Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a film adaptation of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; and the retrospective rockumentary &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; (both 1979). The band embarked on the It&#x27;s Hard Tour in support of their 1982 album, &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot;. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 with Simon Phillips on drums and a tour of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; in 1996–1997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle&#x27;s death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with &quot;Endless Wire&quot;. Since Entwistle&#x27;s death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, and Pete&#x27;s brother Simon Townshend on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2019, the group released their twelfth studio album &quot;Who&quot; and supported the album with their Moving On! Tour with a symphony orchestra.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The founding members of the Who, Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend and John Entwistle, grew up in Acton, London and attended Acton County Grammar School. Townshend&#x27;s father, Cliff, played saxophone and his mother, Betty, had sung in the entertainment division of the Royal Air Force during World War II, and both supported their son&#x27;s interest in rock and roll. Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County, and formed a trad jazz group; Entwistle also played French horn in the Middlesex Schools&#x27; Symphony Orchestra. Both were interested in rock, and Townshend particularly admired Cliff Richard&#x27;s début single, &quot;Move It&quot;. Entwistle moved to guitar, but struggled with it due to his large fingers, and moved to bass on hearing the guitar work of Duane Eddy. He was unable to afford a bass and built one at home. After Acton County, Townshend attended Ealing Art College, a move he later described as profoundly influential on the course of the Who.

Daltrey, who was in the year above, had moved to Acton from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in at the school, and discovered gangs and rock and roll. He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site. In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to evolve into the Who. The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well as the music.

Daltrey spotted Entwistle by chance on the street carrying a bass and recruited him into the Detours. In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist, Daltrey on rhythm guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals. The band played instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures, and a variety of pop and trad jazz covers. Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, &quot;ran things the way he wanted them&quot;. Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by Doug Sandom, though he was older than the rest of the band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years.

Dawson left after frequently arguing with Daltrey and was briefly replaced by Gabby Connolly, before Daltrey moved to lead vocals. Townshend, with Entwistle&#x27;s encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend&#x27;s mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce, who started booking the band as a support act. The Detours were influenced by the bands they supported, including Screaming Lord Sutch, Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, Shane Fenton and the Fentones, and Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. The Detours were particularly interested in the Pirates as they also only had one guitarist, Mick Green, who inspired Townshend to combine rhythm and lead guitar in his style. Entwistle&#x27;s bass became more of a lead instrument, playing melodies. In February 1964, the Detours became aware of the group Johnny Devlin and the Detours, and changed their name. Townshend and his house-mate Richard Barnes spent a night considering names, focusing on a theme of joke announcements, including &quot;No One&quot; and &quot;the Group&quot;. Townshend preferred &quot;the Hair&quot;, and Barnes liked &quot;the Who&quot; because it &quot;had a pop punch&quot;. Daltrey chose &quot;the Who&quot; the next morning.

=== 1964–1978 ===
==== Early career ====

By the time the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, including at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square. They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not speak to each other again for 14 years.

During a gig with a stand-in drummer in late April at the Oldfield, the band first met Keith Moon. Moon grew up in Wembley, and had been drumming in bands since 1961. He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time. Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.
The Who changed managers to Peter Meaden. He decided that the group would be ideal to represent the growing mod movement in Britain which involved fashion, scooters and music genres such as rhythm and blues, soul and modern jazz. He renamed the group the High Numbers, dressed them up in mod clothes, secured a second, more favourable audition with Fontana and wrote the lyrics for both sides of their single &quot;Zoot Suit&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;m the Face&quot; to appeal to mods. The tune for &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; was &quot;Misery&quot; by the Dynamics, and &quot;I&#x27;m the Face&quot; borrowed from Slim Harpo&#x27;s &quot;I Got Love If You Want It&quot;. Although Meaden tried to promote the single, it failed to reach the top 50 and the band reverted to calling themselves the Who. The group none of whom played their instruments conventionally began to improve their stage image; Daltrey started using his microphone cable as a whip on stage, and occasionally leapt into the crowd; Moon threw drumsticks into the air mid-beat; Townshend mimed machine-gunning the crowd with his guitar while jumping on stage and playing guitar with a fast arm-windmilling motion, or stood with his arms aloft allowing his guitar to produce feedback in a posture dubbed &quot;the Bird Man&quot;.

Meaden was replaced as manager by two filmmakers, Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. They were looking for a young, unsigned rock group that they could make a film about, and had seen the band at the Railway Hotel in Wealdstone, which had become a regular venue for them. Lambert related to Townshend and his art school background, and encouraged him to write songs. In August, Lambert and Stamp made a promotional film featuring the group and their audience at the Railway. The band changed their set towards soul, rhythm and blues and Motown covers, and created the slogan &quot;Maximum R&amp;B&quot;.

In June 1964, during a performance at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke the head of his guitar on the low ceiling of the stage. Angered by the audience&#x27;s laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who&#x27;s live set.

==== First singles and &quot;My Generation&quot; ====

By late 1964, the Who were becoming popular in London&#x27;s Marquee Club, and a rave review of their live act appeared in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Lambert and Stamp attracted the attention of the American producer Shel Talmy, who had produced the Kinks. Townshend had written a song, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;, that deliberately sounded like the Kinks to attract Talmy&#x27;s attention. Talmy saw the group in rehearsals and was impressed. He signed them to his production company, and sold the recording to the US arm of Decca Records, which meant that the group&#x27;s early singles were released in Britain on Brunswick Records, one of UK Decca&#x27;s labels for US artists. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; was recorded in early November 1964 at Pye Studios in Marble Arch with the Ivy League on backing vocals, and Jimmy Page played fuzz guitar on the B-side, &quot;Bald Headed Woman&quot;.

&quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; became popular with pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline. Pirate radio was important for bands as there were no commercial radio stations in the UK and BBC Radio played little pop music. The group gained further exposure when they appeared on the television programme &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; Lambert and Stamp were tasked with finding &quot;typical teens&quot;, and invited the group&#x27;s regular audience from the Goldhawk Social Club. Enthusiastic reception on television and regular airplay on pirate radio helped the single slowly climb the charts in early 1965 until it reached the top 10. In early 1965, the Who made their first appearance on the television music show, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, at the BBC&#x27;s Dickenson Road Studios in Manchester, with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;.

The follow-up single, &quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere&quot;, by Townshend and Daltrey, features guitar noises such as pick sliding, toggle switching and feedback, which was so unconventional that it was initially rejected by the US arm of Decca. The single reached the top 10 in the UK and was used as the theme song to &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;

The transition to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did not sit well with Daltrey, and a recording session of R&amp;B covers went unreleased. The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the West End of London. The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon&#x27;s amphetamines down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked, but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted Richard Cole as a roadie.

The next single, &quot;My Generation&quot;, followed in October. Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it was turned into a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle. The song used gimmicks such as a vocal stutter to simulate the speech of a mod on amphetamines, and two key changes. Townshend insisted in interviews that the lyrics &quot;Hope I die before I get old&quot; were not meant to be taken literally. Peaking at No. 2, &quot;My Generation&quot; is the group&#x27;s highest-charting single in the UK. The debut album &quot;My Generation&quot; was released in late 1965. Among original material by Townshend, including the title track and &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;, the album has several James Brown covers from the session earlier that year that Daltrey favoured.

After &quot;My Generation&quot;, the Who fell out with Talmy, which meant an abrupt end to their recording contract. The resulting legal acrimony resulted in Talmy holding the rights to the master tapes, which prevented the album from being reissued until 2002. The Who were signed to Robert Stigwood&#x27;s label, Reaction, and released &quot;Substitute&quot;. Townshend said he wrote the song about identity crisis, and as a parody of the Rolling Stones&#x27;s &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown&quot;. It was the first single to feature him playing an acoustic twelve-string guitar. Talmy took legal action over the B-side, &quot;Instant Party&quot;, and the single was withdrawn. A new B-side, &quot;Waltz for a Pig&quot;, was recorded by the Graham Bond Organisation under the pseudonym &quot;the Who Orchestra&quot;.

In 1966 the Who released &quot;I&#x27;m a Boy&quot;, about a boy dressed as a girl, taken from an abortive collection of songs called &quot;Quads&quot;; &quot;Happy Jack&quot;; and an EP, &quot;Ready Steady Who&quot;, that tied in with their regular appearances on &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; The group continued to have conflict; on 20 May, Moon and Entwistle were late to a gig having been on the &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; set with the Beach Boys&#x27; Bruce Johnston. During &quot;My Generation&quot;, Townshend attacked Moon with his guitar; Moon suffered a black eye and bruises, and he and Entwistle left the band, but changed their minds and rejoined a week later. Moon kept looking for other work, and Jeff Beck had him play drums on his song &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; (with Page, John Paul Jones and Nicky Hopkins) because he was &quot;trying to get Keith out of the Who&quot;.

==== &quot;A Quick One&quot; and &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; ====
To alleviate financial pressure on the band, Lambert arranged a song-writing deal which required each member to write two songs for the next album. Entwistle contributed &quot;Boris the Spider&quot; and &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; and found a niche role as second songwriter. The band found they needed to fill an extra ten minutes, and Lambert encouraged Townshend to write a longer piece, &quot;A Quick One, While He&#x27;s Away&quot;. The suite of song fragments is about a girl who has an affair while her lover is away, but is ultimately forgiven. The album was titled &quot;A Quick One&quot; (&quot;Happy Jack&quot; in the US), and reached No. 4 in the UK charts. It was followed in 1967 by the UK Top 5 single &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot;.

By 1966, &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; had ended, the mod movement was becoming unfashionable, and the Who found themselves in competition on the London circuit with groups including Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group&#x27;s future, and arranged a deal with promoter Frank Barsalona for a short package tour in New York. The group&#x27;s performances, which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums, were well received, and led to their first major US appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival. The group, especially Moon, were not fond of the hippie movement, and thought their violent stage act would stand in sharp contrast to the peaceful atmosphere of the festival. Hendrix was also on the bill, and was also going to smash his guitar on stage. Townshend verbally abused Hendrix and accused him of stealing his act, and the pair argued about who should go on stage first, with the Who winning the argument. The Who brought hired equipment to the festival; Hendrix shipped over his regular touring gear from Britain, including a full Marshall stack. According to biographer Tony Fletcher, Hendrix sounded &quot;so much better than the Who it was embarrassing&quot;. The Who&#x27;s appearance at Monterey gave them recognition in the US, and &quot;Happy Jack&quot; reached the top 30.

The group followed Monterey with a US tour supporting Herman&#x27;s Hermits. The Hermits were a straightforward pop band and enjoyed drugs and practical jokes. They bonded with Moon, who was excited to learn that cherry bombs were legal to purchase in Alabama. Moon acquired a reputation of destroying hotel rooms while on tour, with a particular interest in blowing up toilets. Entwistle said the first cherry bomb they tried &quot;blew a hole in the suitcase &quot;and&quot; the chair&quot;. Moon recalled his first attempt to flush one down the toilet: &quot;[A]ll that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable. I never realised dynamite was so powerful.&quot; After a gig in Flint, Michigan on Moon&#x27;s 21st birthday on 23 August 1967, the entourage caused $24,000 of damage at the hotel, and Moon knocked out one of his front teeth. Daltrey later said that the tour brought the band closer, and as the support act, they could turn up and perform a short show without any major responsibilities.
After the Hermits tour, the Who recorded their next single, &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;, which Townshend had written in 1966 but had avoided recording until he was sure it could be produced well. Townshend called it &quot;the ultimate Who record&quot;, and was disappointed it reached only No. 10 in the UK. It became their best selling single in the US, reaching No. 9. The group toured the US again with Eric Burdon and the Animals, including an appearance on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, miming to &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot;. Moon bribed a stage hand to put explosives in his drum kit, who loaded it with ten times the expected quantity. The resulting detonation threw Moon off his drum riser and his arm was cut by a flying piece of a cymbal. Townshend&#x27;s hair was singed and his left ear left ringing, and a camera and studio monitor were destroyed.

The next album was &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; a concept album parodying pirate radio, which had been outlawed in August 1967 by the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act 1967. It included humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs, a mini rock opera called &quot;Rael&quot;, and &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot;. The Who declared themselves a pop art group and thus viewed advertising as an artform; they recorded a wide variety of radio advertisements, such as for canned milkshakes and the American Cancer Society, in defiance of the rising anti-consumerist ethos of the hippie counterculture. Townshend stated, &quot;We don&#x27;t change offstage. We live pop art.&quot; Later that year, Lambert and Stamp formed a record label, Track Records, with distribution by Polydor. As well as signing Hendrix, Track became the imprint for all the Who&#x27;s UK output until the mid-1970s.

The group started 1968 by touring Australia and New Zealand with the Small Faces. The groups had trouble with the local authorities and the &quot;New Zealand Truth&quot; called them &quot;unwashed, foul-smelling, booze-swilling no-hopers&quot;. After an incident that took place on a flight to Sydney, the band were briefly arrested in Melbourne and then forced to leave the country; Prime Minister John Gorton sent a telegram to the Who telling them never to return to Australia. The Who would not return to Australia again until 2004. They continued to tour across the US and Canada during the first half of the year.

==== &quot;Tommy&quot;, Woodstock, Isle of Wight and &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; ====
By 1968, the Who had started to attract attention in the underground press. Townshend had stopped using drugs and became interested in the teachings of Meher Baba. In August, he gave an interview to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Jann Wenner describing in detail the plot of a new album project and its relationship to Baba&#x27;s teachings. The album went through several names during recording, including &quot;Deaf Dumb and Blind Boy&quot; and &quot;Amazing Journey&quot;; Townshend settled on &quot;Tommy&quot; for the album about the life of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and his attempt to communicate with others. Some songs, such as &quot;Welcome&quot; and &quot;Amazing Journey&quot;, were inspired by Baba&#x27;s teaching, and others came from observations within the band. &quot;Sally Simpson&quot; is about a fan who tried to climb on stage at a gig by the Doors that they attended and &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; was written so that &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Nik Cohn, a pinball enthusiast, would give the album a good review. Townshend later said, &quot;I wanted the story of &quot;Tommy&quot; to have several levels ... a rock singles level and a bigger concept level&quot;, containing the spiritual message he wanted as well as being entertaining. The album was projected for a Christmas 1968 release but recording stalled after Townshend decided to make a double album to cover the story in sufficient depth.

By the end of the year, 18 months of touring had led to a well-rehearsed and tight live band, which was evident when they performed &quot;A Quick One While He&#x27;s Away&quot; at &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; television special. The Stones considered their own performance lacklustre, and the project was never broadcast. The Who had not released an album in over a year, and had not completed the recording of &quot;Tommy&quot;, which continued well into 1969, interspersed with gigs at weekends. Lambert was a key figure in keeping the group focused and getting the album completed, and typed up a script to help them understand the story and how the songs fitted together.
The album was released in May with the accompanying single, &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, a debut performance at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s, and a tour, playing most of the new album live. &quot;Tommy&quot; sold 200,000 copies in the US in its first two weeks, and was a critical success, &quot;Life&quot; saying, &quot;for sheer power, invention and brilliance of performance, &quot;Tommy&quot; outstrips anything which has ever come out of a recording studio&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; declared: &quot;Surely the Who are now the band against which all others are to be judged.&quot; Daltrey had significantly improved as a singer, and set a template for rock singers in the 1970s by growing his hair long and wearing open shirts on stage. Townshend had taken to wearing a boiler suit and Doctor Martens shoes.

In August, the Who performed at the Woodstock Festival, despite being reluctant and demanding $13,000 up front. Pete Townshend gave journalist Robert Christgau a lift to Woodstock. The group were scheduled to appear on Saturday night, 16 August, but the festival ran late and they did not take to the stage until 5am on Sunday; they played most of &quot;Tommy&quot;. During their performance, Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman interrupted the set to give a political speech about the arrest of John Sinclair; Townshend kicked him off stage, shouting: &quot;Fuck off my fucking stage!&quot; During &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot;, the sun rose almost as if on cue; Entwistle later said, &quot;God was our lighting man&quot;. At the end, Townshend threw his guitar into the audience. The set was professionally recorded and filmed, and portions appear on the &quot;Woodstock&quot; film, &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;.

Woodstock has been regarded as culturally significant, but the Who were critical of the event. Roadie John &quot;Wiggie&quot; Wolff, who arranged the band&#x27;s payment, described it as &quot;a shambles&quot;. Daltrey declared it as &quot;the worst gig ever played&quot; and Townshend said, &quot;I thought the whole of America had gone mad.&quot; A more enjoyable appearance came a few weeks later at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival in England, which Townshend described as &quot;a great concert for&quot; the band. According to Townshend, at the end of the Isle of Wight gig the field was covered in rubbish left by fans (which the band&#x27;s roadies helped to clear up), which inspired the line &quot;teenage wasteland&quot; from their single &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;.
By 1970, the Who were widely considered one of the best and most popular live rock bands; Chris Charlesworth described their concerts as &quot;leading to a kind of rock nirvana that most bands can only dream about&quot;. They decided a live album would help demonstrate how different the sound at their gigs was to &quot;Tommy&quot;, and set about listening to the hours of recordings they had accumulated. Townshend baulked at the prospect of doing so, and demanded that all the tapes be burned. Instead, they booked two shows, one in Leeds on 14 February, and one in Hull the following day, with the intention of recording a live album. Technical problems from the Hull gig resulted in the Leeds gig being used, which became &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;. The album is viewed by several critics including &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; and the BBC, as one of the best live rock albums of all time.

The &quot;Tommy&quot; tour included shows in European opera houses and saw the Who become the first rock act to play at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. In March the Who released the UK top 20 hit &quot;The Seeker&quot;, continuing a theme of issuing singles separate to albums. Townshend wrote the song to commemorate the common man, as a contrast to the themes on &quot;Tommy&quot;. The tour included their second appearance at the Isle of Wight Festival. A record attendance in England which the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; estimated at between 600,000 and 700,000 people, the Who began their set at 2:00 A.M. on Sunday 30 August.

==== &quot;Lifehouse&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; ====

&quot;Tommy&quot; secured the Who&#x27;s future, and made them millionaires. The group reacted in different ways Daltrey and Entwistle lived comfortably, Townshend was embarrassed at his wealth, which he felt was at odds with Meher Baba&#x27;s ideals, and Moon spent frivolously.

During the latter part of 1970, Townshend conceived a follow-up &quot;Tommy&quot;: &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, which was to be a multi-media project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned &quot;Lifehouse&quot;. Entwistle was the first member of the group to release a solo album, &quot;Smash Your Head Against the Wall&quot;, in May 1971.

Recording at the Record Plant in New York City in March 1971 was abandoned when Lambert&#x27;s addiction to hard drugs interfered with his ability to produce. The group restarted with Glyn Johns in April. The album was mostly &quot;Lifehouse&quot; material, with one unrelated song by Entwistle, &quot;My Wife&quot;, and was released as &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; in August. The album reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the US. &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; are early examples of synthesizer use in rock, featuring keyboard sounds generated in real time by a Lowrey organ; on &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, it was further processed through a VCS3 synthesizer. The synthesizer intro to &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; was programmed based on Meher Baba&#x27;s vital stats, and the track featured a violin solo by Dave Arbus. The album was a critical and commercial success, and has been certified 3× platinum by the RIAA. The Who continued to issue &quot;Lifehouse&quot;-related material over the next few years, including the singles &quot;Let&#x27;s See Action&quot;, &quot;Join Together&quot; and &quot;Relay&quot;.

The band went back on tour, and &quot;Baba O&#x27; Riley&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; became live favourites. In November they performed at the newly opened Rainbow Theatre in London for three nights, continuing in the US later that month, where Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the Who as &quot;the Greatest Show on Earth&quot;. The tour was slightly disrupted at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on 12 December when Moon passed out over his kit after overdosing on brandy and barbiturates. He recovered and completed the gig, playing to his usual strength.

==== &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, &quot;Tommy&quot; film and &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; ====
After touring &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, and needing time to write a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group activity until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, &quot;Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!&quot;, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend&#x27;s projects were getting pretentious. Moon&#x27;s behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, and a desire to party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group&#x27;s finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper&#x27;s 2014 retrospective documentary, &quot;Lambert &amp; Stamp&quot;. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of &quot;Tommy&quot; with Lou Reizner.

By 1973, the Who turned to recording the album &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; about mod and its subculture, set against clashes with Rockers in early 1960s Britain. The story is about a boy named Jimmy, who undergoes a personality crisis, and his relationship with his family, friends and mod culture. The music features four themes, reflecting the four personalities of the Who. Townshend played multi-tracked synthesizers, and Entwistle played several overdubbed horn parts. By the time the album was being recorded, relationships between the band and Lambert and Stamp had broken down irreparably, and Bill Curbishley replaced them. The album reached No. 2 in both the UK and US.

The Quadrophenia tour started in Stoke on Trent in October and was immediately beset with problems. Daltrey resisted Townshend&#x27;s wish to add Joe Cocker&#x27;s keyboardist Chris Stainton (who played on the album) to the touring band. As a compromise, Townshend assembled the keyboard and synthesizer parts on backing tapes, as such a strategy had been successful with &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;. The technology was not sophisticated enough to deal with the demands of the music; added to this issue, tour rehearsals had been interrupted due to an argument that culminated in Daltrey punching Townshend and knocking him out cold. At a gig in Newcastle, the tapes completely malfunctioned, and an enraged Townshend dragged sound-man Bob Pridden on-stage, screamed at him, kicked all the amps over and partially destroyed the backing tapes. The show was abandoned for an &quot;oldies&quot; set, at the end of which Townshend smashed his guitar and Moon kicked over his drumkit. &quot;The Independent&quot; described this gig as one of the worst of all time. The US tour started on 20 November at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California; Moon passed out during &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; and during &quot;Magic Bus&quot;. Townshend asked the audience, &quot;Can anyone play the drums? I mean somebody good.&quot; An audience member, Scot Halpin, filled in for the rest of the show. After a show in Montreal, the band (except for Daltrey, who retired to bed early) caused so much damage to their hotel room, including destroying an antique painting and ramming a marble table through a wall, that federal law enforcement arrested them.
By 1974, work had begun in earnest on a &quot;Tommy&quot; film. Stigwood suggested Ken Russell as director, whose previous work Townshend had admired. The film featured a star-studded cast, including the band members. David Essex auditioned for the title role, but the band persuaded Daltrey to take it. The cast included Ann-Margret, Oliver Reed, Eric Clapton, Tina Turner, Elton John and Jack Nicholson. Townshend and Entwistle worked on the soundtrack for most of the year, handling the bulk of the instrumentation. Moon had moved to Los Angeles, so they used session drummers, including Kenney Jones (who would later join the Who). Elton John used his own band for &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;. Filming was from April until August. 1,500 extras appeared in the &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; sequence.

The film premiered on 18 March 1975 to a standing ovation. Townshend was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. &quot;Tommy&quot; was shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, but not in the main competition. It won the award for Rock Movie of the Year in the First Annual Rock Music Awards and generated over $2 million in its first month. The soundtrack reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.
Work on &quot;Tommy&quot; took up most of 1974, and live performances by the Who were restricted to a show in May at the Valley, the home of Charlton Athletic, in front of 80,000 fans, and a few dates at Madison Square Garden in June. Towards the end of the year, the group released the out-takes album &quot;Odds &amp; Sods&quot;, which featured several songs from the aborted &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project.

In 1975, Daltrey and Townshend disagreed about the band&#x27;s future and criticised each other via interviews in the music paper &quot;New Musical Express&quot;. Daltrey was grateful that the Who had saved him from a career as a sheet-metal worker and was unhappy at Townshend not playing well; Townshend felt the commitment of the group prevented him from releasing solo material. The next album, &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot;, had introspective songs from Townshend that dealt with disillusionment such as &quot;However Much I Booze&quot; and &quot;How Many Friends&quot;; they resembled his later solo work. Entwistle&#x27;s &quot;Success Story&quot; gave a humorous look at the music industry, and &quot;Squeeze Box&quot; was a hit single. The group toured from October, playing little new material and few &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; numbers, and reintroducing several from &quot;Tommy&quot;. The American leg of the tour began in Houston to a crowd of 18,000 at The Summit Arena, and was supported by Toots and the Maytals. On 6 December 1975, the Who set the record for largest indoor concert at the Pontiac Silverdome, attended by 78,000. On 31 May 1976, they played a second concert at the Valley which was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s loudest concert at over 120 dB. Townshend had become fed up of touring but Entwistle considered live performance to be at a peak.

==== &quot;Who Are You&quot; and Moon&#x27;s death ====
After the 1976 tour, Townshend took most of the following year off to spend time with his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols&#x27; Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, &quot;Who Are You&quot;.

The group reconvened in September 1977, but Townshend announced there would be no live performances for the immediate future, a decision that Daltrey endorsed. By this point, Moon was so unhealthy that the Who conceded it would be difficult for him to cope with touring. The only gig that year was an informal show on 15 December at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, London, filmed for the documentary &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;. The band had not played for 14 months, and their performance was so weak that the footage was unused. Moon&#x27;s playing was particularly lackluster and he had gained a lot of weight, though Daltrey later said, &quot;even at his worst, Keith Moon was amazing.&quot;

Recording of &quot;Who Are You&quot; started in January 1978. Daltrey clashed with Johns over the production of his vocals, and Moon&#x27;s drumming was so poor that Daltrey and Entwistle considered firing him. Moon&#x27;s playing improved, but on one track, &quot;Music Must Change&quot;, he was replaced as he could not play in time. In May, the Who filmed another performance at Shepperton Sound Studios for &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;. This performance was strong, and several tracks were used in the film. It was the last gig Moon performed with the Who.

The album was released on 18 August, and became their biggest and fastest seller to date, peaking at No. 6 in the UK and No. 2 in the US. Instead of touring, Daltrey, Townshend and Moon did a series of promotional television interviews, and Entwistle worked on the soundtrack for &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;.

On 6 September, Moon attended a party held by Paul McCartney to celebrate Buddy Holly&#x27;s birthday. Returning to his flat, Moon took 32 tablets of clomethiazole which had been prescribed to combat his alcohol withdrawal. He passed out the following morning and was discovered dead later that day.

=== 1978–1983 ===
The day after Moon&#x27;s death, Townshend issued the statement: &quot;We are more determined than ever to carry on, and we want the spirit of the group to which Keith contributed so much to go on, although no human being can ever take his place.&quot; Drummer Phil Collins, having a temporary break from Genesis after his first marriage had failed, was at a loose end and asked to replace Moon, but Townshend had already asked Kenney Jones, who had previously played with the Small Faces and Faces. Jones officially joined the band in November 1978. John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick joined the live band as an unofficial keyboardist. On 2 May 1979, the Who returned to the stage with a concert at the Rainbow Theatre, followed by the Cannes Film Festival in France and dates at Madison Square Garden in New York.

The &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; film was released that year. It was directed by Franc Roddam in his feature-directing début, and had straightforward acting rather than musical numbers as in &quot;Tommy&quot;. John Lydon was considered for Jimmy, but the role went to Phil Daniels. Sting played Jimmy&#x27;s friend and fellow mod, the Ace Face. The soundtrack was Jones&#x27; first appearance on a Who record, performing on newly written material not on the original album. The film was a critical and box office success in the UK and appealed to the growing mod revival movement. The Jam were influenced by the Who, and critics noticed a similarity between Townshend and the group&#x27;s leader, Paul Weller.

&quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; was also completed in 1979. It was a retrospective of the band&#x27;s career, directed by Jeff Stein. The film included footage of the band at Monterey, Woodstock and Pontiac, and clips from the Smothers Brothers&#x27; show and &quot;Russell Harty Plus&quot;. Moon had died one week after seeing the rough cut with Daltrey. The film contains the Shepperton concert, and an audio track of him playing over silent footage of himself was the last time he ever played the drums.

In December, the Who became the third band, after the Beatles and the Band, to appear on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. The article, by Jay Cocks, said the band had outpaced, outlasted, outlived and outclassed all of their rock band contemporaries.

==== Cincinnati tragedy ====

On 3 December 1979, a crowd crush at a Who gig at the Riverfront Coliseum, Cincinnati killed 11 fans. This was partly due to the festival seating, where the first to enter get the best positions. Some fans waiting outside mistook the band&#x27;s soundcheck for the concert, and attempted to force their way inside. As only a few entrance doors were opened, a bottleneck situation ensued with thousands trying to gain entry, and the crush became deadly.

The Who were not told until after the show because civic authorities feared crowd problems if the concert were cancelled. The band were deeply shaken upon learning of it and requested that appropriate safety precautions be taken in the future. The following evening, in Buffalo, New York, Daltrey told the crowd that the band had &quot;lost a lot of family last night and this show&#x27;s for them&quot;.

==== Change and break-up ====
Daltrey took a break in 1980 to work on the film &quot;McVicar&quot;, in which he took the lead role of bank robber John McVicar. The soundtrack album is a Daltrey solo album, though all members of the Who are included in the supporting musicians, and was his most successful solo release.

The Who released two studio albums with Jones as drummer, &quot;Face Dances&quot; (1981) and &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; (1982). &quot;Face Dances&quot; produced a US top 20 and UK top ten hit with the single &quot;You Better You Bet&quot;, whose video was one of the first shown on MTV. Both &quot;Face Dances&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; sold well and the latter received a five-star review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The single &quot;Eminence Front&quot; from &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; was a hit, and became a regular at live shows. By this time Townshend had fallen into depression, wondering if he was no longer a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, &quot;Empty Glass&quot; (1980). Jones&#x27; drumming style was very different from Moon&#x27;s and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.
Townshend wanted the Who to stop touring and become a studio act; Entwistle threatened to quit, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t intend to get off the road ... there&#x27;s not much I can do about it except hope they change their minds.&quot; Townshend did not change his mind, and so the Who embarked on a farewell tour of the US and Canada with the Clash as support, ending in Toronto on 17 December 1982.

Townshend spent part of 1983 writing material for a Who studio album owed to Warner Bros. Records from a contract in 1980, but he found himself unable to generate music appropriate for the Who and at the end of 1983 paid for himself and Jones to be released from the contract. On 16 December 1983, Townshend announced at a press conference that he was leaving the Who, effectively ending the band.

After the Who break-up, Townshend focused on solo albums such as &quot;White City: A Novel&quot; (1985), &quot;The Iron Man&quot; (1989, featuring Daltrey and Entwistle and two songs credited to the Who), and &quot;Psychoderelict&quot; (1993).

=== Reunions ===
In July 1985, the Who performed at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London. The BBC transmission truck blew a fuse during the set, temporarily interrupting the broadcast. At the 1988 Brit Awards, at the Royal Albert Hall, the band were given the British Phonographic Industry&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. The short set they played there was the last time Jones played with the Who until 2014.

==== 1989 tour ====
In 1989, the band embarked on a 25th-anniversary &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; reunion tour with Simon Phillips on drums and Steve &quot;Boltz&quot; Bolton as a second guitarist. Townshend had announced in 1987 that he suffered from tinnitus and alternated acoustic, rhythm and lead guitar to preserve his hearing. Their two shows at Sullivan Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, sold 100,000 tickets in less than eight hours, beating previous records set there by U2 and David Bowie. The tour was briefly marred at a gig in Tacoma, Washington, where Townshend injured his hand on-stage. Some critics disliked the tour&#x27;s over-produced and expanded line-up, calling it &quot;The Who on Ice&quot;; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the tour &quot;tarnished the reputation of the Who almost irreparably&quot;. The tour included most of &quot;Tommy&quot; and included such guests as Phil Collins, Billy Idol and Elton John. A 2-CD live album, &quot;Join Together&quot;, was released in 1990.

==== Partial reunions ====
In 1990, the Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group have a featured collection in the hall&#x27;s museum, including one of Moon&#x27;s velvet suits, a Warwick bass of Entwistle&#x27;s, and a drumhead from 1968.

In 1991, the Who recorded a cover of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Alright for Fighting&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John &amp; Bernie Taupin&quot;. It was the last studio recording to feature Entwistle. In 1994, Daltrey turned 50 and celebrated with two concerts at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. The shows included guest spots by Entwistle and Townshend. Although all three surviving original members of the Who attended, they appeared on stage together only during the finale, &quot;Join Together&quot;, with the other guests. Daltrey toured that year with Entwistle, Zak Starkey on drums and Simon Townshend filling in for his brother as guitarist.

=== Re-formation ===
==== Revival of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; ====
In 1996, Townshend, Entwistle and Daltrey performed &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; with guests and Starkey on drums at Hyde Park. The performance was narrated by Daniels, who had played Jimmy in the 1979 film. This was the first live performance of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; in its entirety. Despite technical difficulties the show led to a six-night residency at Madison Square Garden and a US and European tour through 1996 and 1997. Townshend played mostly acoustic guitar, but eventually was persuaded to play some electric. In 1998, VH1 ranked the Who ninth in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

==== Charity shows and Entwistle&#x27;s death ====
In late 1999, the Who performed as a five-piece for the first time since 1985, with Bundrick on keyboards and Starkey on drums. The first show in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena was partially broadcast on TV and the Internet and released as the DVD &quot;The Vegas Job&quot;. They then performed acoustic shows at Neil Young&#x27;s Bridge School Benefit at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, followed by gigs at the House of Blues in Chicago and two Christmas charity shows at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London. Critics were delighted to see a rejuvenated band with a basic line-up comparable to the tours of the 1960s and 1970s. Andy Greene in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the 1999 tour better than the final one with Moon in 1976.

The band toured the US and UK from June to October 2000, to generally favourable reviews, culminating in a charity show at the Royal Albert Hall for the Teenage Cancer Trust with guest performances from Paul Weller, Eddie Vedder, Noel Gallagher, Bryan Adams and Nigel Kennedy. Stephen Tomas Erlewine described the gig as &quot;an exceptional reunion concert&quot;. In October 2001 the band performed at The Concert for New York City at Madison Square Garden for families of firefighters and police who had lost their lives following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center; with &quot;Forbes&quot; describing their performance as a &quot;catharsis&quot; for the law enforcement in attendance. Earlier that year the band were honoured with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

The Who played concerts in the UK in early 2002 in preparation for a full US tour. On 27 June, the day before the first date, Entwistle, 57, was found dead of a heart attack at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. Cocaine was a contributing factor.

==== After Entwistle: Tours and &quot;Endless Wire&quot; ====
Entwistle&#x27;s son, Christopher, gave a statement supporting the Who&#x27;s decision to carry on. The US tour began at the Hollywood Bowl with touring bassist Pino Palladino. Townshend dedicated the show to Entwistle, and ended with a montage of pictures of him. The tour lasted until September. The loss of a founding member of the Who caused Townshend to re-evaluate his relationship with Daltrey, which had been strained over the band&#x27;s career. He decided their friendship was important, and this ultimately led to writing and recording new material.

To combat bootlegging, in 2002 the band began to release the Encore Series of official soundboard recordings via themusic.com. An official statement read: &quot;to satisfy this demand they have agreed to release their own official recordings to benefit worthy causes&quot;. In 2004, the Who released &quot;Old Red Wine&quot; and &quot;Real Good Looking Boy&quot; (with Palladino and Greg Lake, respectively, on bass guitar) on a singles anthology, &quot;The Who: Then and Now&quot;, and went on an 18-date tour of Japan, Australia, the UK and the US, including a return appearance at the Isle of Wight. Later that year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Who No. 29 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

The Who announced in 2005 that they were working on a new album. Townshend posted a novella called &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot; on his blog, which developed into a mini-opera called &quot;Wire &amp; Glass&quot;, forming the basis for the album. &quot;Endless Wire&quot;, released in 2006, was the first full studio album of new material since 1982&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; and contained the band&#x27;s first mini-opera since &quot;Rael&quot; in 1967. The album reached No. 7 in the US and No. 9 in the UK. Starkey was invited to join Oasis in April 2006 and the Who in November 2006, but he declined and split his time between the two.

In November 2007, the documentary &quot;Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who&quot; was released, featuring unreleased footage of the 1970 Leeds appearance and a 1964 performance at the Railway Hotel when the group were the High Numbers. &quot;Amazing Journey&quot; was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award.

The Who toured in support of &quot;Endless Wire&quot;, including the BBC Electric Proms at the Roundhouse in London in 2006, headlining the 2007 Glastonbury Festival, a half-time appearance at the Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 and being the final act at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games. In November 2012, the Who released &quot;Live at Hull&quot;, an album of the band&#x27;s performance the night after the &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; gig.

==== Quadrophenia and More ====
In 2010, the Who performed &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; with parts played by Vedder and Tom Meighan at the Royal Albert Hall as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust series of 10 gigs. A planned tour for early 2010 was jeopardised by the return of Townshend&#x27;s tinnitus. He experimented with an in-ear monitoring system that was recommended by Neil Young and his audiologist.

The &quot;Quadrophenia and More&quot; tour started in November 2012 in Ottawa with keyboardists John Corey, Loren Gold and Frank Simes, the last of whom was also musical director. In February 2013, Starkey pulled a tendon and was replaced for a gig by Scott Devours, who performed with less than four hours&#x27; notice. The tour moved to Europe and the UK, and ended at the Wembley Arena in July 2013.

==== &quot;The Who Hits 50!&quot; and beyond ====

In October 2013, Townshend announced the Who would stage their final tour in 2015, performing in locations they have never played before. Daltrey clarified that the tour was unrelated to the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary and indicated that he and Townshend were considering recording new material. Daltrey stated, &quot;We can&#x27;t go on touring forever ... it could be open-ended, but it will have a finality to it.&quot;

Jones reunited with the Who in June 2014 at a charity gig for Prostate Cancer UK his Hurtwood Polo Club, alongside Jeff Beck, Procol Harum and Mike Rutherford. Later that month, the Who announced plans for a world tour with a possible accompanying album. In September, the Who released the song &quot;Be Lucky&quot;, which was included on the compilation &quot;The Who Hits 50!&quot; in October. That November, the group released a virtual reality app co-designed by Daltrey&#x27;s son, Jamie, featuring events and images from the band&#x27;s history.

The Who headlined 2015&#x27;s Hyde Park Festival in June, and two days later, the Glastonbury Festival. Townshend suggested to &quot;Mojo&quot; that it could be the group&#x27;s last UK gig. To coincide with the Who&#x27;s 50th anniversary, all studio albums, and the new compilation &quot;The Who Hits 50!&quot;, were reissued on vinyl. In September 2015, all remaining US tour dates were cancelled after Daltrey contracted viral meningitis. Then Townshend promised the band would come back &quot;stronger than ever&quot;.
The Who embarked on the Back to the Who Tour 51! in 2016, a continuation of the previous year&#x27;s tour. This included a return visit to the Isle of Wight Festival (at the Seaclose Park in Newport) on 11 June opening date. After 13 concerts, it concluded with a performance at the Desert Trip festival at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California on 16 October. In November, the Who announced that five UK dates the following April (previously scheduled for that August and September) would include a full live performance of &quot;Tommy&quot;. The five-date tour was renamed &quot;2017 Tommy &amp; More&quot; and included the largest selections from the album since 1989. Two preliminary concerts at the Royal Albert Hall for the Teenage Cancer Trust on 30 March and 1 April featured &quot;Tommy&quot; in full.

In January 2019, the band announced the Moving On! Tour. The tour began on 7 May in Grand Rapids, Michigan, but was interrupted during a show in Houston, Texas on 26 September 2019 after Daltrey lost his voice. The tour was cut short in March 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ten shows in Ireland and the United Kingdom were eventually rescheduled for March 2021, but those were canceled a month before the fact in February 2021.

On 6 December 2019, the Who released their first studio album in thirteen years, &quot;Who&quot;, to critical and commercial success.

==== The Who Hits Back ====
In February 2022, the band announced they would embark on a new North American tour entitled &quot;The Who Hits Back&quot; beginning 22 April 2022 in Hollywood, Florida and concluding 5 November 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The tour resumed on 14 June 2023 in Barcelona, Spain and ended on 28 August 2023 in Sandringham, England.

== Musical style and equipment ==
The Who have been regarded primarily as a rock band, yet have taken influence from several other styles of music during their career. The original group played a mixture of trad jazz and contemporary pop hits as the Detours, and R&amp;B in 1963. The group moved to a mod sound the following year, particularly after hearing the Small Faces fuse Motown with a harsher R&amp;B sound. The group&#x27;s early work was geared towards singles, though it was not straightforward pop. In 1967, Townshend coined the term &quot;power pop&quot; to describe the Who&#x27;s style. Like their contemporaries, the group were influenced by the arrival of Hendrix, particularly after the Who and the Experience met at Monterey. This and lengthy touring strengthened the band&#x27;s sound. In the studio, they began to develop softer pieces, particularly from &quot;Tommy&quot; onwards, and turned their attention towards albums more than singles.
From the early 1970s, the band&#x27;s sound included synthesizers, particularly on &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. Although groups had used synthesizers before, the Who were one of the first to integrate the sound into a basic rock structure. In &quot;By Numbers&quot; the group&#x27;s style had scaled back to more standard rock, but synthesisers regained prominence on &quot;Face Dances&quot;.

Townshend and Entwistle were instrumental in making extreme volumes and distortion standard rock practices. The Who were early adopters of Marshall Amplification. Entwistle was the first member to get two 4×12 speaker cabinets, quickly followed by Townshend. The group used feedback as part of their guitar sound, both live and in the studio. In 1967, Townshend changed to using Sound City amplifiers, customised by Dave Reeves, then in 1970 to Hiwatt. The group were the first to use 1000-watt PA systems for live gigs, which led to competition from bands such as the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd.

Throughout their careers, the members of the Who have said their live sound has never been captured as they wished on record. Live gigs and the audience have always been important to the group. &quot;Irish&quot; Jack Lyons said, &quot;The Who weren&#x27;t a joke, they were fucking real, and so were we.&quot;

=== Vocals ===
Daltrey initially based his style on Motown and rock and roll, but from &quot;Tommy&quot; onwards he tackled a wider range of styles. His trademark sound with the band, as noted in 1983, has been a characteristic scream, as heard at the end of &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;.

Group backing vocals are prominent in the Who. After &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; used session men for backing vocals, Townshend and Entwistle resolved to do better themselves on subsequent releases, producing strong backing harmonies. Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle sang lead on various songs, and occasionally Moon joined in. &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; featured Daltrey and Townshend sharing the lead vocals on several songs, and biographer Dave Marsh considers the contrast between Daltrey&#x27;s strong, guttural tone and Townshend&#x27;s higher and gentler sound to be one of the album&#x27;s highlights.

Daltrey&#x27;s voice is negatively affected by marijuana smoke, to which he says he is allergic. On 20 May 2015, during a Who concert at Nassau Coliseum, he smelled a joint burning and told the smoker to put it out or &quot;the show will be over&quot;. The fan obliged, without taking Pete Townshend&#x27;s advice that &quot;the quickest way&quot; to extinguish a joint is &quot;up your fucking arse&quot;.

=== Guitars ===

Townshend considered himself less technical than guitarists such as Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck and wanted to stand out visually instead. His playing style evolved from the banjo, favouring down strokes and using a combination of the plectrum and fingerpicking. His rhythm playing frequently used seventh chords and suspended fourths, and he is associated with the power chord, an easy-to-finger chord built from the root and fifth that has since become a fundamental part of the rock guitar vocabulary. Townshend also produced noises by manipulating controls on his guitar and by allowing the instrument to feedback.

In the group&#x27;s early career, Townshend favoured Rickenbacker guitars as they allowed him to fret rhythm guitar chords easily and move the neck back and forwards to create vibrato. From 1968 to 1973, he favoured a Gibson SG Special live, and later used customised Les Pauls in different tunings.
In the studio for &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; and thereafter, Townshend used a 1959 Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins hollow-body guitar, a Fender Bandmaster amp and an Edwards volume pedal, all gifts from Joe Walsh. Townshend started his career with an acoustic guitar and has regularly recorded and written with a Gibson J-200.

=== Bass ===
A distinctive part of the original band&#x27;s sound was Entwistle&#x27;s lead bass playing, while Townshend concentrated on rhythm and chords. Entwistle&#x27;s was the first popular use of Rotosound strings in 1966, trying to find a piano-like sound. His bassline on &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; was described by Who biographer John Atkins as &quot;a contribution of its own without diminishing the guitar lines&quot;; he described his part on &quot;The Real Me&quot; from &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, recorded in one take, as &quot;a bass solo with vocals&quot;. Entwistle&#x27;s basses include a &quot;Frankenstein&quot; assembled from five Fender Precision and Jazz basses, and Warwick, Alembic, Gretsch and Guild basses.

=== Drums ===
Moon further strengthened the reversal of traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as the Kinks&#x27; Mick Avory and the Shadows&#x27; Brian Bennett, who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.

Jones&#x27; concise, supportive drumming style was in sharp contrast to Moon&#x27;s. The Who were initially enthusiastic about working with a completely different drummer. Townshend later stated, &quot;we&#x27;ve never really been able to replace Keith&quot; and Daltrey ultimately believed Jones was not right for the band, while still speaking highly of him as a friend and drummer. Starkey knew Moon from childhood and Moon gave him his first drum kit. Starkey has been praised for his playing style which echoes Moon&#x27;s without being a copy.

=== Songwriting ===
Townshend focused on writing meaningful lyrics inspired by Bob Dylan, whose words dealt with subjects other than boy–girl relationships that were common in rock music; in contrast to Dylan&#x27;s intellectualism, Townshend believed his lyrics should be about things kids could relate to. Early material focused on the frustration and anxiety shared by mod audiences, which Townshend said was a result of &quot;searching for niche&quot;. By &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;, he began to work narrative and characters into songs, which he fully developed by &quot;Tommy&quot;, including spiritual themes influenced by Baba. From the mid-1970s onwards, his songs tended to be more personal, which influenced his decision to go solo.

Entwistle&#x27;s songs, by contrast, typically feature black humour and darker themes. His two contributions to &quot;Tommy&quot; (&quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; and &quot;Fiddle About&quot;) appeared because Townshend did not believe he could write songs as &quot;nasty&quot; as Entwistle&#x27;s.

== Personal relationships ==
The Who are perceived as having had a poor working relationship. In the original band, Doug Sandom acted as the peacemaker and settled disputes. Moon, by contrast, was as volatile as Daltrey and Townshend. Entwistle was too passive to become involved in arguments. The group established their live reputation and stage show in part out of insecurity and aggression amongst its members, and Townshend recalled that all decisions had to be made democratically &quot;because we always disagreed&quot;.

The only genuine friendship in the band during the 1960s was between Entwistle and Moon. The pair enjoyed each other&#x27;s sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing. Journalist Richard Green noted a &quot;chemistry of playfullness that would go beyond playfullness&quot;. Their relationship diminished somewhat when Entwistle got married in 1967, though they still socialised on tour. When Moon was destroying toilets in hotels, Entwistle admitted he &quot;was standing behind him with the matches&quot;.

The group regularly argued in the press, though Townshend said disputes were amplified in print and the group simply found it difficult to agree on things. &quot;Tommy&quot; mutually benefitted Townshend and Daltrey&#x27;s standing in the band because of the former&#x27;s songwriting and the latter&#x27;s stage presence, yet even this did not make them close friends. The pair quarrelled, particularly in the mid-1970s, over the group&#x27;s direction. During his time with the band, Jones was subject to intermittent criticism from Daltrey.

Entwistle&#x27;s death in 2002 came as a shock to both Townshend and Daltrey, and caused them to re-evaluate their relationship. Townshend has said that he and Daltrey have since become close friends. In 2015, Townshend confirmed their friendship was still strong, adding their acceptance of each other&#x27;s differences &quot;brought us to a really genuine and compassionate relationship, which can only be described as love&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The Who are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their appearances at Monterey and Woodstock helped give them a reputation as one of the greatest live rock acts and they have been credited with originating the &quot;rock opera&quot;.

The group&#x27;s contributions to rock include the power chord, windmill strum and the use of non-musical instrument noise such as feedback. The band influenced fashion from their earliest days with their embrace of pop art and the use of the Union Jack for clothing. The guitar-smashing incident at the Railway Hotel in 1964 is one of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

Pink Floyd began to use feedback from their early shows in 1966, inspired by the Who, whom they considered a formative influence. Shortly after arriving in London in 1966, Jimi Hendrix visited Marshall&#x27;s music shop demanding an amp setup like Townshend&#x27;s and manipulated electronic noises in ways that Townshend had pioneered. The Beatles were fans and socialised with Moon in particular during the mid-1960s. In 1965, Paul McCartney said the Who &quot;are the most exciting thing around&quot; and was inspired to write &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; in the group&#x27;s &quot;heavy&quot; style; John Lennon borrowed the acoustic guitar style in &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; for &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;.

The loud volume of the band&#x27;s live show influenced the approach of hard rock and heavy metal. Proto-punk, punk rock, and alternative rock bands such as the MC5, the Stooges, the Ramones the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and Green Day cite the Who as an influence. An early influence on Queen, guitarist Brian May referred to the Who as being &quot;among our favourite groups&quot;. The Who inspired mod revival bands, particularly the Jam, which helped other groups influenced by the Who become popular. The Who influenced hard rock bands such as Guns N&#x27; Roses. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by the Who. The Who have also influenced pop rock band Panic! at the Disco.

The Who have inspired many tribute bands; Daltrey has endorsed the Whodlums, who raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Many bands have covered Who songs; Elton John&#x27;s version of &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; reached No. 7 in the UK.

=== Media ===
During the Who&#x27;s hiatuses in the 1980s and 90s, Townshend developed his skills as a music publisher to be financially successful from the Who without recording or touring. He countered criticism of &quot;selling out&quot; by saying that licensing the songs to other media allows a wider exposure and widens the group&#x27;s appeal.

The American police procedural franchise &quot;CSI&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;) feature Who songs as theme music, &quot;Who Are You&quot;, &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; and &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; respectively. The group&#x27;s songs have featured in other popular TV series such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;Top Gear&quot;, which had an episode where the presenters were tasked with being roadies for the band.

Rock-oriented films such as &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, &quot;School of Rock&quot; and &quot;Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny&quot; refer to the band and feature their songs, and other films have used the band&#x27;s material in their soundtracks, including &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (which used &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot;) and &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (which used a take of &quot;My Generation&quot; recorded for the BBC). Several of the band&#x27;s tracks have appeared in the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot; and its sequels.

=== Awards and nominations ===

The Who have received many awards and accolades from the music industry for their recordings and their influence. They received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988, and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001.

The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 where their display describes them as &quot;prime contenders, in the minds of many, for the title of World&#x27;s Greatest Rock Band&quot;, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.

The single &quot;My Generation&quot; and the albums &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; have each been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2008, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey received Kennedy Center Honors as members of the Who. In 2009, &quot;My Generation&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; at number 28, &quot;Tommy&quot; at number 96, &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; at number 113, &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; at number 170, &quot;My Generation&quot; at number 236, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; at number 266, and &quot;A Quick One&quot; at number 383. And in 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;My Generation&quot; at number 11, &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; at number 133, &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; at number 258, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; at number 340, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; at number 371. The same publication ranked them the 29th greatest artist of all time. Eddie Vedder wrote in tribute: The Who began as spectacle. They became spectacular. Early on, the band was in pure demolition mode; later, on albums like &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, it coupled that raw energy with precision and desire to complete musical experiments on a grand scale. They asked, &quot;What were the limits of rock &amp; roll? Could the power of music actually change the way you feel?&quot; Pete Townshend demanded that there be spiritual value in music. They were an incredible band whose main songwriter happened to be on a quest for reason and harmony in his life. He shared that journey with the listener, becoming an inspiration for others to seek out their own path. They did all this while also being in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s loudest band...

The songwriter-listener relationship grows deeper after all the years. Pete saw that a celebrity in rock is charged by the audience with a function, like, &quot;You stand there and we will know ourselves.&quot; Not &quot;You stand there and we will pay you loads of money to keep us entertained as we eat our oysters.&quot; He saw the connection could be profound. He also realized the audience may say, &quot;When we&#x27;re finished with you, we&#x27;ll replace you with somebody else.&quot; For myself and so many others (including shopkeepers, foremen, professionals, bellboys, gravediggers, directors, musicians), they won&#x27;t be replaced. Yes, Pete, it&#x27;s true, music can change you.

<text>A cartel is a group of independent market participants who collude with each other as well as agreeing not to compete with each other in order to improve their profits and dominate the market. A cartel is an organization formed by producers to limit competition and increase prices by creating artificial shortages through low production quotas, stockpiling, and marketing quotas. Jurisdictions frequently consider cartelization to be anti-competitive behavior, leading them to outlaw cartel practices.

Cartels are inherently unstable due to the temptation by members of the cartel to cheat and defect on each other by improving their individual profits, which may lead to falling prices for all members. The doctrine in economics that analyzes cartels is cartel theory. Cartels are distinguished from other forms of collusion or anti-competitive organization such as corporate mergers. 

Advancements in technology or the emergence of substitutes can undermine cartel pricing power, leading to the breakdown of the cooperation needed to sustain the cartel. Outside actors often respond to the undersupply of a good by bolstering their own production of the good, investing in technologies that use the good more efficiently, or by investing in substitutes. 

Examples of domestic cartels include the United States Gunpowder Trade Association (which was dissolved by U.S. courts in 1912) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association which restricts the kind of compensation that collegiate athletes can receive. Examples of international cartels include the OPEC cartel to collude on oil production and the International Rubber Regulation Agreement to collude on rubber production.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;cartel&quot; comes from the Italian word &quot;&quot;, which means a &quot;leaf of paper&quot; or &quot;placard&quot;, and is itself derived from the Latin &quot;charta&quot; meaning &quot;card&quot;. The Italian word became &quot;cartel&quot; in Middle French, which was borrowed into English. In English, the word was originally used for a written agreement between warring nations to regulate the treatment and exchange of prisoners from the 1690s onward. From 1899 onwards, the usage of the word became generalized as to mean any intergovernmental agreement between rival nations.

The use of the English word cartel to describe an economic group rather than international agreements was derived much later in the 1800s from the German &quot;Kartell&quot;, which also has its origins in the French &quot;cartel&quot;. It was first used between German railway companies in 1846 to describe tariff- and technical standardization efforts. The first time the word was referred to describe a kind of restriction of competition was by the Austro-Hungarian political scientist Lorenz von Stein, who wrote on tariff cartels:

== History ==
Cartels have existed since ancient times. Guilds in the European Middle Ages, associations of craftsmen or merchants of the same trade, have been regarded as cartel-like. Tightly organized sales cartels existed in the mining industry of the late Middle Ages, like the 1301 salt syndicate in France and Naples, or the Alaun cartel of 1470 between the Papal State and Naples. Both unions had common sales organizations for overall production called the &quot;Societas Communis Vendicionis&quot; (&#x27;Common Sales Society&#x27;).

Laissez-faire (liberal) economic conditions dominated Europe and North America in the 18th and 19th centuries. Around 1870, cartels first appeared in industries formerly under free-market conditions. Although cartels existed in all economically developed countries, the core area of cartel activities was in central Europe. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary were nicknamed the &quot;lands of the cartels&quot;. Cartels were also widespread in the United States during the period of robber barons and industrial trusts.

The creation of cartels increased globally after World War I. They became the leading form of market organization, particularly in Europe and Japan. In the 1930s, authoritarian regimes such as Nazi Germany, Italy under Mussolini, and Spain under Franco used cartels to organize their corporatist economies. Between the late 19th century and around 1945, the United States was ambivalent about cartels and trusts. There were periods of both opposition to market concentration and relative tolerance of cartels. During World War II, the United States strictly turned away from cartels. After 1945, American-promoted market liberalism led to a worldwide cartel ban, where cartels continue to be obstructed in an increasing number of countries and circumstances.

== Types ==
Cartels have many structures and functions that ideally enable corporations to navigate and control market uncertainties and gain collusive profits within their industry. A typical cartel often requires what competition authorities refer to as a CAU (Contact, Agreement or Understanding). Typologies have emerged to distinguish distinct forms of cartels:
* Selling or buying cartels unite against the cartel&#x27;s customers or suppliers, respectively. The former type is more frequent than the latter.
* Domestic cartels only have members from one country, whereas international cartels have members from more than one country. There have been full-fledged international cartels that have comprised the whole world, such as the international steel cartel of the period between World War I and II.
* Price cartels engage in price fixing, normally to raise prices for a commodity above the competitive price level. The loosest form of a price cartel can be recognized in tacit collusion (implicit collusion), wherein smaller enterprises individually devise their prices and market shares in response to the same market conditions, without direct communication, resulting in a less competitive outcome. This type of collusion is generally legal and can achieve a monopolistic outcome.
* Quota cartels distribute proportional shares of the market to their members.
* Common sales cartels sell their joint output through a central selling agency (in French: &quot;&quot;). They are also known as syndicates (French: &quot;syndicat industriel&quot;).
* Territorial cartels distribute districts of the market to be used only by individual participants, which act as monopolists.
* Submission cartels control offers given to public tenders. They use bid rigging: bidders for a tender agree on a bid price. They then do not bid in unison, or share the return from the winning bid among themselves.
* Technology and patent cartels share knowledge about technology or science within themselves while they limit the information from outside individuals.
* Condition cartels unify contractual terms – the modes of payment and delivery, or warranty limits.
* Standardization cartels implement common standards for sold or purchased products. If the members of a cartel produce different sorts or grades of a good, conversion factors are applied to calculate the value of the respective output.
* Compulsory cartels, also called &quot;forced cartels&quot;, are established or maintained by external pressure. Voluntary cartels are formed by the free will of their participants.

== Effects ==
A survey of hundreds of published economic studies and legal decisions of antitrust authorities found that the median price increase achieved by cartels in the last 200 years is about 23 percent. Private international cartels (those with participants from two or more nations) had an average price increase of 28 percent, whereas domestic cartels averaged 18 percent. Less than 10 percent of all cartels in the sample failed to raise market prices.

In general, cartel agreements are economically unstable in that there is an incentive for members to cheat by selling at below the cartel&#x27;s agreed price or selling more than the cartel&#x27;s production quotas. Many cartels that attempt to set product prices are unsuccessful in the long term because of cheating punishment mechanisms such as price wars or financial punishment. An empirical study of 20th-century cartels determined that the mean duration of discovered cartels is from 5 to 8 years and overcharged by approximately 32%. This distribution was found to be bimodal, with many cartels breaking up quickly (less than a year), many others lasting between five and ten years, and still some that lasted decades. Within the industries that have operating cartels, the median number of cartel members is 8. Once a cartel is broken, the incentives to form a new cartel return, and the cartel may be re-formed. Publicly known cartels that do not follow this business cycle include, by some accounts, OPEC.

Cartels often practice price fixing internationally. When the agreement to control prices is sanctioned by a multilateral treaty or protected by national sovereignty, no antitrust actions may be initiated. OPEC countries partially control the price of oil.

== Organization ==
Drawing upon research on organizational misconduct, scholars in economics, sociology and management have studied the organization of cartels. They have paid attention to the way cartel participants work together to conceal their activities from antitrust authorities. Even more than reaching efficiency, participating firms need to ensure that their collective secret is maintained. “However, the orchestrator, often the vendor with all information, typically remains unnoticed by antitrust authorities, raising questions about the culpability of unaware distributors.”

== Cartel theory versus antitrust concept ==
The scientific analysis of cartels is based on cartel theory. It was pioneered in 1883 by the Austrian economist Friedrich Kleinwächter and in its early stages was developed mainly by German-speaking scholars. These scholars tended to regard cartels as an acceptable part of the economy. At the same time, American lawyers increasingly turned against trade restrictions, including all cartels. The Sherman act, which impeded the formation and activities of cartels, was passed in the United States in 1890. The American viewpoint, supported by activists like Thurman Arnold and Harley M. Kilgore, eventually prevailed when governmental policy in Washington could have a larger impact in World War II.

== Legislation and penalties ==
Because cartels are likely to have an impact on market positions, they are subjected to competition law, which is executed by governmental competition regulators. Very similar regulations apply to corporate mergers. A single entity that holds a monopoly is not considered a cartel but can be sanctioned through other abuses of its monopoly.

Prior to World War II, members of cartels could sign contracts that were enforceable in courts of law except in the United States. Before 1945, cartels were tolerated in Europe and specifically promoted as a business practice in German-speaking countries. In &quot;U.S. v. National Lead Co. et al.&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States noted the testimony of individuals who cited that a cartel, in its versatile form, is 

The first legislation against cartels to be enforced was the Sherman Act 1890, which also prohibits price fixing, market-sharing, output restrictions and other anti-competitive conduct. Section 1 and 2 of the Act outlines the law in regards to cartels,Section 1:

Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.

Section 2:

Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100 million if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1 million, or by imprisonment not exceeding ten years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.

In practice, detecting and desisting cartels is undertaken through the use of economic analysis and leniency programmes. Economic analysis is implemented to identify any discrepancies in market behaviour between both suspected and unsuspected cartel engaged firms. A structural approach is done in the form of screening already suspicious firms for industry traits of a typical cartel price path. A typical path often includes a formation phase in which prices decline, followed by a transition phase in which prices tend to rise, and end with a stationary phase in which price variance remains low. Indicators such as price changes alongside import rates, market concentration, time period of permanent price changes and stability of companies&#x27; market shares are used as economic markers to help supplement the search for cartel behaviour. On the contrary, when aiming to create suspicion around potential cartels, a behavioural approach is often used to identify behavioural collusive patterns, to initiate further economic analysis into identifying and prosecuting those involved in the operations. For example, studies have shown that industries are more likely to experience collusion where there are fewer firms, products are homogeneous and there is a stable demand.

=== Leniency programmes ===
Leniency programmes were first introduced in 1978 in the US, before being successfully reformed in 1993. The underlying principle of a leniency program is to offer discretionary penalty reductions for corporations or individuals who are affiliated with cartel operations, in exchange for their cooperation with enforcement authorities in helping to identify and penalise other participating members. According to the Australian Department of Justice, the following 6 conditions must be met for admission into a leniency program:

# The corporation is the first one to come forward and qualify for leniency with respect to the illegal activity being reported;
# The Division, at the time the corporation comes in, does not yet have evidence against the company that is likely to result in a sustainable conviction;
# The corporation, upon its discovery of the illegal activity being reported, took prompt and effective action to terminate its part in the activity;
# The corporation reports the wrongdoing with candor and completeness and provides full, continuing and complete cooperation that advances the Division in its investigation;
# The confession of wrongdoing is truly a corporate act, as opposed to isolated confessions of individual executives or officials;
# Where possible, the corporation makes restitution to injured parties; and
# The Division determines that granting leniency would not be unfair to others, considering the nature of the illegal activity, the confessing corporation&#x27;s role in it, and when the corporation comes forward.

The application of leniency programme penalties varies according to individual countries policies and are proportional to cartel profits and years of infringement. However, typically the first corporation or individual to cooperate will receive the most reduced penalty in comparison to those who come forward later. The effectiveness of leniency programmes in destabilising and deterring cartels is evidenced by the decreased formation and discovery of cartels in the US since the introduction of the programmes in 1993. Some prosecuted examples include:

* Lysine Cartel: An employee of Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) alerted authorities of the existence of the cartel within the Lysine industry.
* Stainless steel: Buyers of the product complained to the European Commission (EC) about price spikes.
* Sodium gluconate: Defendants in the lysine case informed authorities of collusive behaviours between corporations in this industry.

=== Price fixing ===
Today, price fixing by private entities is illegal under the antitrust laws of more than 140 countries. The commodities of prosecuted international cartels include lysine, citric acid, graphite electrodes, and bulk vitamins. In many countries, the predominant belief is that cartels are contrary to free and fair competition, considered the backbone of political democracy. Maintaining cartels continues to become harder for cartels. Even if international cartels cannot be regulated as a whole by individual nations, their individual activities in domestic markets are affected.

Unlike other cartels, export cartels are legal in virtually all jurisdictions, despite their harmful effects on affected markets.

* The Phoebus cartel was established by lighting manufacturers in the early 20th century to control the pricing and lifespan of incandescent light bulbs.
* The Quinine cartel existed among producers of the anti-malarial drug Quinine to control production rates and pricing, operating in the early 20th century with two incarnations. During the early years of its operation, Quinine was the only viable medical treatment for malaria.
* The British Valve Association existed among British manufacturers of vacuum tubes to regulate the pricing, electrode structure, and part numbering system for its members.
* The Seven Sisters was the name for the consortium of seven transnational oil companies which dominated the global petroleum industry from the 1940s to the 1970s. The contemporary equivalent is OPEC, an international organization of petroleum producing nations that sets production targets and prices among its members.
* The Swiss Cheese Union, an industry organization of cheese producers, functioned as a cartel through the extent of its control on cheese production in the 20th century.
* Between 1995 and 2004, several of the largest elevator manufacturers operated a market-rigging cartel, including ThyssenKrupp, Kone, and Otis, which were fined by the European Union in 2007.
* The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, a government-sanctioned private organization that regulates the production and marketing of maple syrup in Quebec.
* The aluminium industry was characterized by substantial cartelization from the start of the 20th century to 1980. The first aluminium cartel was the Aluminium Association, founded in 1901.

<doc id="36527" wikidata="Q49800" url="?curid=36527" title="Cohabitation">
<text>Cohabitation is an arrangement where people who are not married, usually couples, live together. They are often involved in a romantic or sexually intimate relationship on a long-term or permanent basis. Such arrangements have become increasingly common in Western countries since the late 20th century, led by changing social views, especially regarding marriage.

More broadly, the term &quot;cohabitation&quot; can mean any number of people living together. To &quot;cohabit&quot;, in a broad sense, means to &quot;exist together&quot;. The origin of the term comes from the mid 16th century, being used as early as 1530. It&#x27;s from the Latin &quot;cohabitare&quot;, from &quot;co&quot;- &#x27;together&#x27; + &quot;habitare&quot; &#x27;dwell&#x27;.

==Social changes leading to increase==

Cohabitation is a common pattern among people in the Western world.

In Europe, the Scandinavian countries began this trend, although many countries have since followed. Mediterranean Europe has traditionally been very conservative, with religion playing a strong role. Until the mid-1990s, cohabitation levels remained low in this region, but have since increased; for example, in Portugal the majority of children have been born of unwed parents since 2015, constituting 60% of the total in 2021.

In the United States, over the past few decades there has been an increase in unmarried couples cohabiting. Historically, Western countries have been influenced by Christian doctrine on sex, which opposes unmarried cohabitation. As social norms have changed, such beliefs have become less widely held and some Christian denominations view cohabitation as a precursor to marriage. Pope Francis has performed the marriages of cohabiting couples who had children, while former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the archbishop of York John Sentamu have expressed tolerance of cohabitation.

In recent decades, high rates of participation of women in the workforce and the widespread availability of highly effective long acting reversible contraceptives has led to women making individual choices over their reproduction with decreased reliance on male partners for financial stability. All these changes favored alternative living arrangements to marriage.

In Central and Eastern Europe, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, there were major political changes, such as the fall of Communist governments. These societies entered a new era of increased social freedom, less rigid rules, and less authoritarian governments. They interacted with Western Europe and some became members of the European Union. As a result, the patterns of family life started to change: marriage rates have declined, and marriage was postponed to a later age. Cohabitation and births to unmarried mothers increased, and in some countries the increase was quick.

The &quot;deinstitutionalization of marriage&quot; refers to the weakening of the social and legal norms that regulate peoples&#x27; behavior in regard to marriage. The rise in cohabitation is part of other major social changes such as higher divorce rate, older age at first marriage and childbearing, and more births outside marriage. Factors such as secularization, increased participation of women in the labor force, changes in the meaning of marriage, risk reduction, individualism, and changing views on sexuality have been cited as contributing to these social changes. There has also been a change in modern sexual ethics, with a focus on consent, rather than marital status (i.e. decriminalization of adultery and fornication; criminalization of marital rape), reflecting new concepts on the role and purpose of sexual interaction, and new conceptualizations of female sexuality and of self-determination. There have been objections against the legal and social regulation of female sexuality; with such regulations being often seen as violations of women&#x27;s rights. In addition, some individuals may feel that marriage is unnecessary or outdated, leading to couples not formalizing their relation. For instance, in the European Values Study (EVS) of 2008, the percentage of respondents who agreed with the assertion that &quot;Marriage is an outdated institution&quot; was 37.5% in Luxembourg, 35.4% in France, 34.3% in Belgium, 31.2% in Spain, 30.5% in Austria, 29.2% in Germany, 27.7% in Switzerland, 27.2% in Bulgaria, 27.0% in the Netherlands, 25.0% in Slovenia.

The fact that many couples choose to live together without formalizing their relation is also recognized by the European Union. A 2004 directive forbids EU members from denying entry or residence of partners &quot;with whom the Union citizen has a durable relationship, duly attested.&quot;

==Reasons for cohabitation in the United States==
Cohabitation in the United States is often a part of the dating process. In fact, &quot;cohabitation is increasingly becoming the first coresidential union formed among young adults&quot;.
By 1996, more than two-thirds of married couples in the US said that they lived together before getting married. &quot;In 1994, there were 3.7 million cohabiting couples in the United States.&quot; This is a major increase from a few decades earlier. According to Dr. Galena Rhoades, &quot;Before 1970, living together outside marriage was uncommon, but by the late 1990s at least 50% to 60% of couples lived together premaritally.&quot;

People may live together for a number of reasons. Cohabitants could live together to save money, or because of the convenience of living with another, or a need to find housing.
Lower income individuals facing financial uncertainty may delay or avoid marriage, not only because of the cost of a wedding but also because of fear of financial hardship if a marriage were to end in divorce.

When responding to a survey of the reasons for cohabitation, most couples listed reasons such as spending more time together, convenience-based reasons, and testing their relationships, while few gave the reason that they do not believe in marriage. The extremely high costs of housing and tight budgets of the economy are also factors that can lead a couple to cohabitation.

Sixty percent of all marriages are preceded by a period of cohabitation. Researchers suggest that couples live together as a way of trying out marriage to test compatibility with their partners, while still having the option of ending the relationship without legal implications. In 1996, &quot;More than three-quarters of all cohabitors report[ed] plans to marry their partners, which implies that most of them viewed cohabitation as a prelude to marriage.&quot; Cohabitation shares many qualities with marriage. Often couples who are cohabiting share a residence, personal resources, exclude intimate relations with others, and more than 10% of cohabiting couples have children. &quot;Many young adults believe cohabitation is a good way to test their relationships prior to marriage.&quot; Couples who have plans to marry before moving in together or who are engaged before cohabiting typically marry within two years of living together. The state of cohabitation of a couple often ends either in marriage or in break-up; according to a 1996 study about 10% of cohabiting unions remained in this state more than five years. According to a survey done by The National Center for Health Statistics, &quot;over half of marriages from 1990-1994 among women began as cohabitation.&quot;

Cohabitation can be an alternative to marriage in situations where marriage is not possible for legal or religious reasons (such as same-sex, interracial or interreligious marriages).

Cohabitation, sometimes called de facto marriage, is becoming a more common substitute for conventional marriage. Common-law marriage in the United States can still be contracted in nine US states, and in two others under restriction. This helps provide the surviving partner a legal basis for inheriting the decedent&#x27;s belongings in the event of the death of their cohabiting partner. In modern cohabiting relationships, forty percent of households include children, giving an idea of how cohabitation could be considered a new normative type of family dynamic. In 2012, 41% of all births in the US were to unmarried women. In three states (Mississippi – 55%, Louisiana – 53%, and New Mexico – 52%) births outside marriage were in the majority; the lowest percentage of births outside marriage was in Utah, at 19%. During the period 2006–2010, 58% of births outside marriage were to cohabiting parents.

==Contemporary objections to cohabitation==

Contemporary objections to cohabiting couples include religious opposition to non-marital unions, social pressure for couples to get married, and potential effects of cohabitation on a child&#x27;s development.

The rise in the number of cohabiting couples and children born out of wedlock in the Western world has made cohabitation a strong focus of sociological research. The rise in cohabiting couples in the United States, from around 450,000 in 1960 to 7.5 million in 2011 has been accompanied by US research performed on child development within cohabiting households. Opponents of cohabitation say non-marital parenting is an unsuitable environment for a child&#x27;s development. One study from 2002 correlated lower numeracy skills and higher delinquency to children of cohabiting couples; however, recent studies that control for factors including poverty, the educational level of parents and violence in the home show children of cohabiting couples are developmentally similar to peers of comparable married couples.

===Effect on children===

In 2001, researchers compared teenage children in the United States living in a cohabiting household (a single mother and her boyfriend who was not related to the teenager) against peers in single-parent households. The results showed white and Hispanic teenagers had lower performance in school, greater risk of suspension or expulsion than peers from single-parent households, and the same rate of behavioral and emotional problems.

A study on the 1995 and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth found increases in both the prevalence and duration of unmarried cohabitation. The study found that 40% of children in the United States would live in a cohabiting household by age 12, and children born to single mothers were more likely than those born to married mothers to live in a cohabiting household. The percentage of women ages 19–44 who had ever cohabited increased from 45% in 1995 to 54% in 2002.

In 2002, 63% of women who graduate from high school were found to spend some time cohabiting, compared to only 45% of women with a four-year college degree. Cohabiting couples who have children often get married. One study found that children born of parents who cohabit are 90% more likely to end up living in households with married parents than children born to single mothers. 67% of unmarried Hispanic mothers are expected to marry, while 40% of African American mothers are expected to marry.

===Religious views===

Studies have found that religious affiliation correlates with cohabitation and marriage entry. People frequently cite religious reasons for their opposition to cohabitation. The Roman Catholic Church and nearly all mainstream Protestant denominations around the world oppose cohabitation and consider it to be the sin of fornication. However, others, such as the Church of England &quot;welcome cohabiting couples in the Church and encourage them to regard cohabitation as a prelude to Christian marriage.&quot;

Religion can also lead to societal pressures against cohabitation especially within highly religious communities. Some couples may refrain from cohabitation because one or both partners fear disappointing or alienating conservative family members. Young adults who grew up in families that oppose cohabitation have lower rates than their peers.

The increase in cohabitation in the United States and other developed nations has been linked to the secularization of those countries. Researchers have noted that changes in the religious demographics of a society have accompanied the rise in cohabitation.

Non-marital and same-sex relationships are forbidden by the Islamic law of Zina, and cohabitation is against the law in many Muslim majority countries including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Yemen.

==Effects on marriage and family life==

===Likelihood of split===

Conflicting studies on the effect of cohabitation on subsequent marriage have been published. In countries where the majority of people disapprove of unmarried individuals living together, or a minority of the population cohabits before marriage, marriages resulting from cohabitation are more prone to divorce. But in a study on European countries, those where around half of the population cohabits before marriage, cohabitation is not selective of divorce-prone individuals, and no difference in couples that have cohabited before and after marriage is observed. In countries such as Italy, the increased risk of marital disruption for people who experienced premarital cohabitation can be entirely attributed to the selection of the most divorce-prone into cohabitation.

In 2002, the CDC found that for married couples the likelihood percentage of the relationship ending after five years is 20%, for unmarried cohabitators the likelihood percentage is 49%. After 10 years the likelihood percentage for the relationship to end is 33% for married couples and 62% for unmarried cohabitators. One German study found that in regions with high rates of childbirth to cohabitating parents, no negative effect is observed in cohabitation. The study states &quot;union stability of cohabiting mothers is positively related to their prevalence&quot;.

A 2004 study of 136 couples (272 individuals) from researchers at the University of Denver found differences among couples that cohabited before engagement, after engagement, or not until marriage. The longitudinal study collected survey data before marriage and 10 months into marriage, with findings suggesting those who cohabit before engagement are at greater risk for poor marital outcomes than those who cohabit only after engagement or at marriage.
A follow-up survey by the researches of over 1,000 married men and women married in the past 10 years found those who moved in with a lover before engagement or marriage reported significantly lower quality marriages and a greater possibility of a separation than other couples.
About 20% of those who cohabited before getting engaged had since suggested splitting – compared with only 12% of those who only moved in together after getting engaged and 10% who did not cohabit prior to marriage. 

Another 2004 study of 92 couples linked communication to cohabitation and instability. They found that married couples who cohabited before they were married had more negative problem-solving and communication skills. They also found that those who had cohabited expressed more (verbal) aggression throughout their conversations. This negative communication could be contributing to the cohabitation effect and causing a larger amount of marital instability.

The researchers from Denver suggest that relationships with pre-engagement cohabitation &quot;may wind up sliding into marriage&quot;, whereas those that only cohabit post engagement or marriage make a more clear decision. This could explain their 2006 study of 197 heterosexual couples finding that men who cohabited with their spouse before engagement were less dedicated than men who cohabited only after engagement or not at all before marriage.
In some heterosexual couples, women are more likely to understand cohabitation as an intermediary step preceding marriage, and men more likely to perceive it without an explicit connection to marriage.

An analysis of data from the CDC&#x27;s National Survey of Family Growth data from 1988, 1995, and 2002 suggests that the positive relationship between premarital cohabitation and marital instability has weakened for more recent birth and marriage cohorts, as the total number of couples cohabiting before marriage has increased.

Later CDC work found that between 2002 and 2006-2010, the number of couples in opposite-sex cohabiting relationships increased from 9.0% to 11.2% for women, and from 9.2% to 12.2% for men.
Drawing on the 2006–2008 data, Princeton University researchers examined whether and to what extent variation in premarital cohabitation experiences influence marital stability. They found that the relationship between cohabitation and marital instability is complex and depends in part on marriage cohort, race/ethnicity, and marriage plans. Their analyses reveal that a &#x27;cohabitation effect&#x27; exists only for women married prior to 1996, and that, until marriage plans are considered, there is no cohabitation effect among women married since 1996.

Recent research from 2011 by the Pew Research Center has found that the number of couples that cohabit before marriage has increased. 44% of adults (and more than half of 30- to 49-year-olds) say they have cohabited at some point. Nearly two-thirds of adults who ever cohabited (64%) say they thought about it as a step toward marriage. The report also notes a trend toward rising public acceptance of cohabiting couples over the years. Most Americans now say the rise in unmarried couples living together either makes no difference to society (46%) or is good for society (9%).

A 2012 study found that, among cohabiting individuals, those who were engaged prior to cohabitation or had &quot;definite plans for marriage&quot; were linked to lower risks of marital instability among women, but the relationship was not observed with men.

One study on low to moderate income couples living with minor children found that respondents who became sexually involved within the first month of their relationship were correlated to lower scores of relationship quality among women. Another study found respondents to a mail-in survey self-reported higher levels of commitment in the cohabiting group, as well as lower relationship satisfaction and more negative communication.

A 2018 study found that cohabiting before marriage was linked to a lower risk of divorce during the first year of marriage, but a greater risk of divorce in the long run. However, a report published by the Council on Contemporary Families that same year found that couples who cohabited before marriage were less likely to divorce than couples who did not.

===Abuse and infidelity===

University of Chicago sociologist Linda Waite found that &quot;16 percent of cohabiting women reported that arguments with their partners became physical during the past year, while only 5 percent of married women had similar experiences.&quot; Most cohabiting couples have a faithful relationship, but Waite&#x27;s surveys also demonstrated that 20% of cohabiting women reported having secondary sex partners, compared to only 4% of married women.

According to an article by Judith Treas and Deirdre Giesen, cohabiting couples are twice as likely to experience infidelity within the relationship than married couples.

=== Fertility ===
Regarding cohabitation as a fertility factor, a large survey in the United States came to the result that married women had an average of 1.9 children, compared to 1.3 among those cohabiting. The corresponding numbers for men were 1.7 and 1.1, respectively. The difference of 0.6 children for both sexes was expected to decrease to between 0.2 and 0.3 over the lifetime when correcting for the confounder that married people have their children earlier in life.

A study of the United States and multiple countries in Europe came to the result that women who continue to cohabit after birth have significantly lower probability of having a second child than married women in all countries except those in Eastern Europe. Another study, on the contrary, came to the result that cohabiting couples in France have equal fertility as married ones. Also, Russians have a higher fertility within cohabitation, while Romanians rather tend to have childless marriages.

Survey data from 2003 in Romania came to the result that marriage equalized the total fertility rate among both highly educated and low educated people to approximately 1.4. Among those cohabiting, on the other hand, lower level of education increased fertility rate to 1.7, and a higher level of education decreased it to 0.7. On the other hand, another study came to the result that Romanian women with little education have about equal fertility in marital and cohabiting partnerships.

===Financial effects===

In the United States, married couples that submit a combined tax return may face a marriage penalty, where tax credits for low-income single earners are not applied to the combined income.
In October 1998, Senate GOP leader Trent Lott decided to pull a bill to abolish &quot;the marriage penalty, which in the tax code reflects the fact that married couples who both work for wages frequently pay more in taxes than if they earned the same amount of income but weren&#x27;t married. And the more equal the incomes of the couple, the steeper the marriage tax penalty.&quot; The earned income tax credit (EITC) is cash welfare for low-income workers, but the problem is the EITC is not for married couples because they have to combine their wages, which again leads to &quot;the marriage penalty&quot;. If couples do not get married then their wages do not have to combine and the EITC in a way is &quot;paying for&quot; low-income couples not to marry. Opponents of cohabitation believe that some cohabiting couples choose not to marry because they would suffer a tax penalty.

Despite the perceived disincentive to marry that the EITC provides, cohabiting couples suffer many financial losses as their unions are not recognized with the same legal and financial benefits as those who are legally married. These financial penalties can include the costs of separate insurance policies and the costs of setting up legal protections similar to those that are automatically granted by the state upon marriage.

===No effect===

A conflicting study, published by the National Center for Health Statistics, with a sample of 12,571 people, concludes that &quot;those who live together after making plans to marry or getting engaged have about the same chances of divorcing as couples who never cohabited before marriage&quot;.

Additionally, William Doherty, a professor in the Department of Family Social Science at the University of Minnesota has remarked that in his research he has found that &quot;committed cohabiting relationships seem to confer many of the benefits of marriage&quot;.

A 2003 study by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that &quot;The differences in measured outcomes for those from direct and indirect marriages appear to be entirely attributable to other factors.&quot; The study concluded that the evidence suggests that premarital cohabitation has &quot;little impact one way or the other&quot; on the chances of any subsequent marriage surviving.

==By region==

===Americas===

====Canada====

Canadian laws on the recognition of unmarried cohabitation for legal purposes vary significantly by province/territory; and in addition to this, federal regulations also have an impact across the country (see Common-law marriage#Canada). Family formation has undergone significant changes in Canada during the last decades of the 20th century, but the patterns vary widely across the country, suggesting differing cultural norms in different regions. From 1995, births to cohabiting parents have increased, particularly in Quebec. In Canada, it is difficult to obtain exact data on the percentage of births outside marriage, because data on the marital status of mothers is collected differently across the provinces and territories of Canada, and in some (such as Alberta) it is not broken down in detail in regard to whether the mother was legally married at the birth of her child. As of 2012, the statistical category of &quot;single mothers&quot; (defined as &quot;never married&quot; at the time of the birth) encompassed 28.3% of mothers, the category &quot;divorced&quot; (i.e. mothers who were unmarried at the time of birth, but had been previously married during their lives) encompassed 1%, while for 10% of mothers the marital status was unknown (&quot;not stated&quot;). There are, however, very significant differences by province/territory; for example in 2012, 77.8% of births in Nunavut were listed to &quot;single mothers&quot;, by contrast, less than 20% of mothers in Ontario were listed in this category. Latest data from the Quebec Statistical Institute shows that as of 2015, in Quebec, 63% of children were born to unmarried women. In Canada, legal issues regarding cohabitation are complicated by the fact that family law in this regard differs by province/territory, which is confusing to the public,
as this contrasts to criminal law which is uniform across Canada, as well as to marriage and divorce law, which is also the same across the country, under the 1986 &quot;Divorce Act (Canada)&quot; (although provinces/territories have jurisdiction over some marital issues, including the solemnization of marriage, spousal and child support, and property division). The marital status of Canadians also varies by province/territory: in 2011, 46.4% of the population aged 15 and over was legally married; ranging from the lowest percentage of married people in Nunavut (29.7%), Northwest Territories (35.0%), Quebec (35.4%), and Yukon (37.6%); to highest in Newfoundland and Labrador (52.9%), Prince Edward Island (51.7%), Ontario (50.3%) and Alberta (50.2%). While Quebec is known for liberal family formation and cohabitation, this is a recent development: during the first half of the 20th century, family life in the province was conservative and strongly dominated by Roman Catholicism; before 1968, there was no provincial divorce legislation in Quebec, and spouses could only end their marriage if they obtained a private act of Parliament. One explanation of the high rates of cohabitation in Quebec is that the traditionally strong social control of the church and Catholic doctrine over people&#x27;s private relations and sexual morality has led the population to rebel against traditional, conservative social values. While some provinces were early to modernize family law, in others this only occurred in the 1990s and the 21st century, such as in Alberta, through the &quot;Family Law Act (Alberta)&quot; which came into force in 2005. This Act overhauled family legislation, replacing the &quot;Domestic Relations Act&quot;, the &quot;Maintenance Order Act&quot;, the &quot;Parentage and Maintenance Act&quot;, and parts of the &quot;Provincial Court Act&quot; and the &quot;Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act&quot;, which were seen as outdated. Also, the &quot;Adult Interdependent Relationships Act&quot; (S.A. 2002, c. A-4.5) amended 69 Alberta laws. The Canadian Prairies provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan have strong common-law spousal. regulations, imposing rights and obligations on common-law couples. Nova Scotia has also been very slow to advance family law – it was only in 1999 that this province abolished discrimination against &quot;illegitimate&quot; children with regard to inheritance (through section 16 of &quot;NS Intestate Succession Act&quot; amended in 1999). In general, provinces in Western Canada give more rights to common-law spouses than those in Atlantic Canada and in Quebec. This may seem paradoxical, because the eastern provinces have the strongest tradition of cohabitation; according to a study &quot;unmarried cohabitation seems to be more common in Eastern Canada than in Western Canada, which might be related to internal and international migration&quot;. (as of 2012, 48% of births in New Brunswick, 47.1% in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 45.2% in Nova Scotia, were listed to &quot;single mothers&quot;, way above the national average). In British Columbia, the &quot;Family Law Act&quot; came into force in 2013.

====United States====
Cohabitation in the United States became common in the late 20th century. , 4.85 million unmarried couples were living together, and , about half of all women aged 15 to 44 had lived unmarried with a partner. In 2007, it is estimated that 6.4 million households were maintained by two opposite sex persons who said they were unmarried. In 2012, the General Social Survey found that public disapproval of cohabitation had dropped to 20% of the population.

Researchers at the National Center for Family and Marriage Research estimated in 2011 that 66% of first marriages are entered after a period of cohabitation. According to the 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau, the proportion of 30- to 44-year-olds living together has almost doubled since 1999, from 4% to 7%. Fifty-eight percent of women aged 19 to 44 had ever cohabited in data collected in 2006–08, while in 1987 only 33% had. Cohabitation is more prevalent among those with less education. &quot;Among women ages 19 to 44, 73% of those without a high school education have ever cohabited, compared with about half of women with some college (52%) or a college degree (47%),&quot; note the Pew study&#x27;s authors, Richard Fry and D&#x27;Vera Cohn.

Before the mid-20th century, laws against cohabitation, fornication, adultery and other such behaviors were common in the US (especially in Southern and Northeastern states), but these laws have been gradually abolished or struck down by courts as unconstitutional.
As of December 2023, cohabitation of unmarried couples remains illegal in two states (Mississippi and North Carolina), while as of 2023 fornication remains illegal in two states (Georgia and South Carolina). These laws are almost never enforced and are now believed to be unconstitutional since the legal decision &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; in 2003. However, these laws may have indirect effects. For example, one consequence may be that one may not claim their partner as a dependent (for a tax exemption), whereas in the other states it may be possible to do so after meeting four criteria: residency, income, support and status.

In 2006, in North Carolina, Pender County Superior Court judge Benjamin G. Alford ruled that North Carolina&#x27;s cohabitation law is unconstitutional. However, the Supreme Court of North Carolina has never had the opportunity to rule on it, so the law&#x27;s statewide constitutionality remains unclear.

On 13 December 2013, US Federal judge Clark Waddoups ruled in &quot;Brown v. Buhman&quot; that the portions of Utah&#x27;s anti-polygamy laws which prohibit multiple cohabitation were unconstitutional, but also allowed Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses. This decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, thus effectively recriminalizing polygamy as a felony. In 2020, Utah voted to downgrade polygamy from a felony to an infraction, but it remains a felony if force, threats or other abuses are involved. Unlawful cohabitation, where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), had been a major tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 Edmunds Act.

====Latin America====

Cohabitation in Latin America is becoming more common. Indeed, although this is a largely Roman Catholic region, it has the highest rates of non-marital childbearing in the world (55–74% of all children in this region are born to unmarried parents). In Mexico, 18.7% of all couples were cohabiting . Among young people, the figures are much higher.

As of 2000, in Argentina 58% of births were to unmarried women.
The percentage of births outside marriage has increased throughout Latin America during the past decades, and there is also a relation to place of residence: women living in the capital city are more likely to have children outside marriage than those living in other parts of the country. Recent data shows figures for non-marital childbearing to be 74% for Colombia, 69% for Peru, 68% for Chile, 66% for Brazil and 55% for Mexico.

===Asia===
====Nepal====
In Nepal, living together is socially acceptable only after marriage. However, cohabitation is an emerging trend in urban areas of Nepal. Reports have shown that there may be significant number of unmarried couples cohabiting in cities, especially in the capital, Kathmandu. Even when unmarried couples cohabit they either prefer to remain anonymous or pose themselves as a married couple. Cohabitation is not recognized by the law of Nepal and there is no special provision to secure the right of cohabitants in Nepalese law.

====Bangladesh====
In Bangladesh, there are no laws prohibiting cohabitation but it is still socially unacceptable. However, cohabitation is becoming more common in urban areas due to western influence. An unmarried couple may feel immense pressure to marry by their family, and will probably choose to live as if they were married and, if exposed, can be expelled from housing or university. Cohabitation has become tolerant in recent years, especially among youths.

====China====
In China, cohabitation has become popular among young adults. One study shows that the cohabitation rate before first marriage was over 20% for those born after 1977. Another recent study shows that cohabitation increases the divorce likelihood for those married in the early-reform period, but premarital cohabitation has no effect on divorce for those married in the late-reform period in China.

====India====
Cohabitation in India had been historically a taboo in traditional Hindu and Muslim societies. However, recently, this is more acceptable and relatively frequent in the middle and upper classes in the major cities and other urban areas, but is not as common in rural areas and smaller rural towns which are more social conservative. Legally recognised as Live-in relationships, they have been legal in India ever since independence. Recent Indian court rulings have ascribed some rights to long-term cohabiting partners. Female live-in partners have protection rights under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 subject to following conditions as laid by Honourable Supreme Court of India in case of &quot;D. Velusamy v D. Patchaiammal&quot;:

# The couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses.
# They must be of legal age to marry.
# They must be otherwise qualified to enter into a legal marriage, including being unmarried.
# They must have voluntarily cohabited and held themselves out to the world as being akin to spouses for a significant period of time.

On 12 June 2020, the Uttarakhand High Court reiterated in the case of Madhu Bala v. State of Uttarakhand and others (Habeas Corpus Petition No. 8 of 2020) that consensual cohabitation between two adults of the same-sex is legal and akin to an opposite sex relationship.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, an Islamic penal code proposed in 2005 would have made cohabitation punishable by up to two years in prison, but failed to pass. The practice is still frowned upon, and many low-end hotels and boarding houses have been raided by police for allowing unmarried couples to share a room.

====Japan====
In Japan, according to M. Iwasawa at the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, less than 3% of females between 25–29 are currently cohabiting, but more than one in five have had some experience of an unmarried partnership, including cohabitation. A more recent Iwasawa study has shown that there has been a recent emergence of non-marital cohabitation. Couples born in the 1950s cohort showed an incidence of cohabitation of 11.8%, where the 1960s and 1970s cohorts showed cohabitation rates of 30%, and 53.9% respectively. The split between urban and rural residence for people who had cohabited is indicates 68.8% were urban and 31.2% were rural.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, around 2.4 million Filipinos were cohabiting . The 2000 census placed the percentage of cohabiting couples at 19%. The majority of individuals are between the ages of 20–24. Poverty was often the main factor in decision to cohabit.

====Iran====
In Iran, the cohabitation of two people is known as &#x27;white marriage&#x27;. According to researchers, the number of white marriages in Iranian metropolises is increasing.&lt;ref name=article/370805&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Iranian law, which is based on Islamic Sharia law, the cohabitation of a man and a woman outside the framework of official marriage is a crime.

It is estimated that the duration of a cohabitation in Iran is between one and three years. 

Cohabitation has no place in Iran from traditional social, legal and religious points of view. However, cohabitation in Iran can be explained by considering recent cultural changes in Iranian society, including the growth of individualism, modernity, and fluid relationships, and the gaps and conflicts between values.

Various factors such as economic crises and cultural and social changes in cities are reasons for the increase in the number of cohabitation in Iran. In other words, the emergence of capitalism, the increase of job insecurity, the emergence of moral liberalism, the revision of cultural traditions, the anonymity of people in cities, the elimination of the concepts and functions of neighborhoods, changes in family structures and the emergence of temporary relationships are among the major reasons for white marriage in Iran.

New research published by social anthropologist Kameel Ahmady and his team under the title &quot;House with Open Door&quot;: &quot;A Comprehensive Research Study on White Marriage (Cohabitation) in Iran&quot; reveals the previously concealed and multi-dimensional aspects of this phenomenon at the macro level, focusing on the Tehran, Mashhad and Isfahan metropolitan areas. The research pieces argues that this phenomenon is more prevalent among educated and post-graduate young people who have migrated to metropolitan areas for work and education.

===Europe===
In the European Union, cohabitation is very common. In 2014, 42% of all births in the 28 EU countries were nonmarital. In the following European countries the majority of births occur outside marriage: Iceland (69.9% in 2016), France (59.7% in 2016), Bulgaria (58.6% in 2016), Slovenia (58.6% in 2016), Norway (56.2% in 2016), Estonia (56.1% in 2016), Sweden (54.9% in 2016), Denmark (54% in 2016), Portugal (52.8% in 2016), and the Netherlands (50.4% in 2016).
While couples of all ages cohabit, the phenomenon is much more common among younger people. In late 2005, 21% of families in Finland consisted of cohabiting couples (all age groups). Of couples with children, 18% were cohabiting. Of ages 18 and above in 2003, 13.4% were cohabiting. Generally, cohabitation amongst Finns is most common for people under 30. Legal obstacles for cohabitation were removed in 1926 in a reform of the Criminal Code, while the phenomenon was socially accepted much later on. In France, 17.5% of couples were cohabiting as of 1999.

====Britain====

In Britain today, nearly half of babies are born to people who are not married (in the United Kingdom 47.3% in 2011; in Scotland in 2012 the proportion was 51.3%). It is estimated that by 2016, the majority of births in the UK will be to unmarried parents.

The Victorian era of the late 19th century is famous for the Victorian standards of personal morality. Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards and rejected cohabitation. They have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as Henry Mayhew decried high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births in London slums. However new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite low—under 5% – for the working class and the urban poor.

Falling marriage rates and increased births outside marriage have become a political issue, with questions of whether the government should promote marriage or focus on the status of a parent rather than a spouse; the Conservative Party support the former whilst Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats support the latter. There are also differences between England and Wales and Scotland, with the latter being more accepting of cohabitation.

====Bulgaria====

In Bulgaria, there has been a rapid increase in cohabitation after the fall of Communism. The transition from communism to market economy had a great impact on the demographic behavior of the population. After the fall of Communism, the legal and social pressure to get married has declined, and the population has started to experience new life styles. As of 2014, 58.8% of children were born to unmarried mothers.

====Czech Republic====

The marriage rates in Czech Republic have fallen dramatically during the past decades. In the 1970s to 1980s, about 96–97% of women married; in 2000 it was estimated that only 75% of women would ever marry. The age at first marriage for women has increased from being in the range of 21.4–21.8 years in the 1970s and 1980s, to being 29.6 in 2011. In the early 1990s, predictions were made by some Czech demographers that cohabitation would increase during the next decades; and indeed, there has been a marked increase in the number of people who live in non-marital couple relations. In 2016, 48.6% of births were to unmarried women.

====Germany====
Until the 1980s, it was illegal for unmarried couples to cohabitate, which made it impossible for many same-sex couples to live together. At this point the Bundesgerichtshof ruled that cohabitation could not be banned as it was protected by the Basic Law.
As in other western societies, patterns of family life have been changing in Germany during the past decades. This has not created a moral panic, but has been seen more as an ongoing social evolution. Cohabitation, divorce rates, lone parents, and people&#x27;s reluctance to marry or to have children have increased. However, with regards to family formation and long term cohabitation instead of marriage, there are very strong differences between the regions of former West Germany and East Germany (which was formally Communist). Significantly more children are born out of wedlock in eastern Germany than in western Germany. In 2012, in eastern Germany 61.6% of births were to unmarried women, while in western Germany only 28.4% were. A longitudinal survey found that union stability was significantly higher for cohabiting mothers in eastern Germany than western Germany, due to differences in German society.

====Greece====
In Greece, family dynamics remain conservative. The principal form of partnership is marriage, and extramarital childbearing and long term cohabitation are not widespread. For instance, in 2016 only 9.4% of births were outside marriage, which is the lowest percentage among the European Union member states. Religion in Greece plays a very important role in society; it was only in 1983 that civil marriage was introduced in the country. The new laws modernized family law, abolished dowry, and provided for equal rights for &quot;illegitimate&quot; children. According to a 2008 study: &quot;Greek society still remains conservative and birthing outside marriage, although protected by law, remains in many ways socially unacceptable.&quot; Despite this, there have been further legal changes providing for a modern &quot;western&quot; outlook on family life, including Law 3719/2008 dealing with family issues, including Article 14 of the law, which reduced the separation period (necessary before a divorce in certain circumstances) from four years to two years.

====Hungary====
The literature on second demographic transition argues as well that highly educated women are more prone to engage in cohabitation, although the reasons are different: they are less concerned with respecting the societal norms. Some scholars argued that cohabitation is very similar to being single in the sense of not giving up independence and personal autonomy.

In Hungary, cohabitation was an uncommon phenomenon until the late 1980s and it was largely confined to the divorced or widowed individuals. Among the ethnic groups, Gypsy/Roma tended to have higher rates of cohabitation, mainly due to their reluctance to register their marriages officially. Since the 1980s, cohabitation became much more frequent among all ethnic groups and it has been argued to have strongly influenced the decline in fertility. In 2015, 47.9% of births were to unmarried women.

====Ireland====

Cohabitation in Ireland has increased in recent years, and 36.6% of births were to unmarried women in 2016. Until a few decades ago, women who had children outside marriage were severely stigmatized and often detained in Magdalene laundries. The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 gives some rights to unmarried cohabitants (under this act same-sex couples can enter into civil partnerships, while long term unmarried couples – both heterosexual and same sex – who have not registered their relation have some limited rights and obligations).

====Italy====

In Italy, where Roman Catholicism had a historically strong presence, cohabitation is not as common as in other countries of Europe, yet it has increased in recent years. There are significant regional differences, with non-marital unions being more common in Northern Italy than in Southern Italy. A study published in 2006 found that long term cohabitation was still novel to Italy, though more common among young people. As of 2015, the share of births outside marriage was 28.7%, but this varied by statistical regions as follows: Central Italy (33.8%), Northeast Italy (33.1%), Northwest Italy (31.3%), Insular Italy (24.2%), and South Italy (20.3%).

====The Netherlands====

Dutch researchers have found that research participants see cohabitation as a risk-reduction strategy in a country with high relationship instability. As of 2016, 50.4% births were to unmarried women.

====Norway====

Cohabitation is a common type of partnership in Norway. Cohabitants have some rights if they have joint children, or if they have lived together for five years. Cohabitants can also regulate their relationship through a cohabitation agreement. In Norway, in 2016, 56.2% of children were born outside marriage.

====Poland====
In Poland, after the fall of Communism, the influence of religion has increased. Indeed, Poland has one of the most religious populations in Europe (see religion in Europe). Cohabitation in Poland has traditionally been associated with the lower social classes, but in recent years an increase has been seen among the more educated. Family structure in Poland remains traditional: Marriages are contracted at relatively young ages, and the incidence of divorce is relatively low (by European standards). The exact incidence of cohabitation is not well established, but it is quite low compared to other Western countries. However, Poland is not completely &#x27;immune&#x27; to Western influence and, in 2016, 25% of children were born outside marriage.

====Slovakia====
Slovakia is more conservative and religious than neighboring Czech Republic. The principal form of partnership is marriage, but extramarital childbearing and cohabitation are slowly spreading, yet this trend is not without criticism; and some view these phenomena as a threat to traditional values. In 2016, 40.2% of births were to unmarried women. Fertility in Slovakia has been described in a 2008 study as &quot;between tradition and modernity&quot;.

====Switzerland====
Switzerland has a tradition of strong conservatism; which can be seen in its legal and social history: in Europe, Switzerland was one of the last countries to establish gender equality in marriage: married women&#x27;s rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a referendum, who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving). Adultery was decriminalized in 1989. Until the late 20th century, most cantons had regulations banning unmarried cohabitation of couples; the last canton to end such prohibition was Valais, in 1995. As of 2015, 22.5% of births were to unmarried women.
Births outside marriage are most common in the French speaking part (highest percentage in the cantons of Vaud, Neuchâtel, Geneva, Jura) and least common in the eastern German speaking cantons (lowest percentage in the cantons of St. Gallen, Zug, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Appenzell Ausserrhoden).

====Spain====

Spanish society has undergone major changes since the fall of the Franco regime. Important legal changes which have occurred throughout the 1970s and 1980s include legalization of divorce, decriminalization of adultery, gender equality in family law, and removing the ban on contraception. The liberalization of the political climate has allowed for alternative family formation. In the mid-1990s, cohabitation in Spain was still described as a &quot;marginal&quot; phenomenon, but since the 1990s, cohabitation has increased dramatically in Spain. In Spain, in 2016, 45.9% of births were outside marriage. As in other countries, there are regional differences: in 2011, in Catalonia the figure was 42% – highest in mainland Spain in that year (Canary Islands 59% and Balearic Islands 43.5% were highest) while in Murcia it was only 30.7% (lowest).

====Russia====

In Russia, many couples express a desire to cohabit before marriage, then register a civil marriage, and then at a later stage have a large church wedding.

===Middle East===
The cohabitation rate in West Asian countries is much lower than in European countries. In some parts of the continent it is however becoming more common for young people. As of 1994, the rate of premarital cohabitation in Israel was 25%.

Cohabitation is illegal according to Sunni sharia law. Cohabitation, Bi&#x27;ah, is a legal status, &quot;Yadua BetTzibbur&quot;, by the Jews Halakha (Halacha) religious Law.

==== Kuwait ====
Some legal recognition is extended to former common-law unions in Kuwait. Kuwaiti Family law applies the law of the father&#x27;s, husband&#x27;s or male partner&#x27;s country in case of expatriate familial disputes. Hence, if the father&#x27;s country of nationality recognises common-law marriages (like the United Kingdom), matters such as child support dues and maintenance can be considered in a Kuwaiti court. However, out-of-marriage sexual intercourse is an offence punishable in Kuwait with a prison sentence between 6 months and 6 years if caught in action by an official or an administrative deportation order. This meaning that common-law marriage recognition can only be practically seen in exceptional cases like where the illegitimate child was born aboard and/or former couples who have since expatriated to Kuwait. Single expat parents including expat mothers can legally sponsor their children for residency permits. Couples where one or both parties are Kuwaiti are covered by local family law and hence do not have recourse to the limited recognition of common-law marriage.

==== United Arab Emirates ====
Children born out-of-wedlock are given partial recognition. Their single expat mother or single expat father can sponsor them for residency. However, sexual relations outside of marriage were illegal in the UAE until November 2020, when restrictions were eased.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In Australia, 22% of couples were cohabiting . 78% of couples who marry have lived together beforehand in 2008, rising from 16% in 1975. In 2013, 34% of all births were to unmarried women. Australia recognizes de facto relationships. The proportion of births outside marriage varies by state/territory, being, in 2009, lowest in Victoria (at 28%), Australian Capital Territory (at 29%), and New South Wales (at 30%); and highest in Northern Territory (at 63%) and Tasmania (at 51%).

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand according to the 2001 census, 20.5% of couples were in &quot;de facto&quot; relationships. In New Zealand, 23.7% of couples were cohabiting as of 2006. In 2010, 48% of births were outside marriage. Like Australia, New Zealand recognizes &quot;de facto&quot; relationships.

=== Africa ===

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, the 2011 census revealed that of South Africans aged 20 or older, 43.7% had never been married, 36.7% were married at the time of the census, 11.0% were living together like married partners. Civil marriages fell by 22,5% between 2011 and 2019 and declined by a further 31,1% in 2020.

<doc id="36530" wikidata="Q1544796" url="?curid=36530" title="Mobile Bay">
<text>Mobile Bay ( ) is a shallow inlet of the Gulf of Mexico, lying within the state of Alabama in the United States. Its mouth is formed by the Fort Morgan Peninsula on the eastern side and Dauphin Island, a barrier island on the western side. The Mobile River and Tensaw River empty into the northern end of the bay, making it an estuary. Several smaller rivers also empty into the bay: Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River on the western side of the bay, and Fish River on the eastern side. Mobile Bay is the fourth-largest estuary in the United States with a discharge of of water per second. Annually, and often several times during the summer months, the fish and crustaceans will swarm the shallow coastline and shore of the bay. This event, appropriately named a jubilee, draws a large crowd because of the abundance of fresh, easily caught seafood.

Mobile Bay is in area. It is long by a maximum width of . The deepest areas of the bay are located within the shipping channel, sometimes in excess of deep, but the average depth of the bay is .

== History ==
Long occupied by cultures of indigenous peoples, this area was still under the chiefs of Mississippian culture at the time of Hernando de Soto&#x27;s exploration.

The recorded history of Mobile Bay begins about 1500, when Spanish explorers were sailing into the area. On early maps, the bay was named as &quot;Bahía del Espíritu Santo&quot; (Bay of the Holy Spirit). The area was explored in more detail in 1516 by Diego Miruelo and in 1519 by Alonso Álvarez de Pineda. In 1528, Pánfilo de Narváez travelled through what was likely the Mobile Bay area, encountering Native Americans who fled and burned their towns at the approach of the expedition. This response was a prelude to the journeys of Hernando de Soto, more than eleven years later.

=== European exploration into the region ===

Hernando de Soto explored the area of Mobile Bay and beyond in 1540, finding the area inhabited by indigenous Mississippian culture people. During this expedition his forces destroyed the fortified town of Mauvila, also spelled Maubila, from which the name Mobile was later derived. It was a town of the paramount Chief Tuscaloosa, located in inland Alabama, well to the north of the current site of Mobile. The next large expedition was that of Tristán de Luna y Arellano, in his unsuccessful attempt to establish a permanent colony for Spain nearby at Pensacola in 1559.

Although Spain&#x27;s presence in the area had been sporadic, in 1702 French colonists created a deep-sea port at Dauphin Island and founded French Louisiana&#x27;s capital at Mobile, a few miles north of Mobile Bay on the Mobile River. Following a series of floods, the original settlement of &quot;Fort Louis de la Mobile&quot; was relocated in 1711 to the head of Mobile Bay.

=== Role in wars ===
During the American Civil War Mobile Bay was used as a major port for blockade runners bringing in badly needed supplies for the Confederacy. On August 5, 1864, Admiral David Farragut led a Union flotilla through Confederate defenses and sealed off one of the last major Southern ports of the bay in the Battle of Mobile Bay. A number of Civil War-era shipwrecks remain in Mobile Bay, including &quot;American Diver&quot;, CSS &quot;Gaines&quot;, CSS &quot;Huntsville&quot;, USS &quot;Philippi&quot;, CSS &quot;Phoenix&quot;, USS &quot;Rodolph&quot;, USS &quot;Tecumseh&quot;, and CSS &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;.

Mobile&#x27;s role as a seaport has continued to the present day, though the commodities have changed through time. Cotton was the chief commodity in the nineteenth century. During the Second World War, Mobile&#x27;s shipbuilding industry expanded, and the city&#x27;s population surged as both black and white migrants moved there for work. Growth has been rapid since then.

=== Natural disasters in the area ===
The city has endured several devastating hurricanes in its history, the most recent being Hurricane Frederic in 1979 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Areas of low elevation, including the downtown business district, have been flooded repeatedly in hurricanes. However, much of the city is at an elevation exceeding above sea level, which is unusually high for the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.

On September 13, 1979, Hurricane Frederic entered the bay with winds reaching , destroying the bridge to Dauphin Island. On August 28–29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina pushed a massive storm surge into Mobile Bay; it measured high at Bayou La Batre (Alabama), with higher waves on top, and high at Mobile, at the far northern end of the 31-mile-long Mobile Bay. Thousands of boats, piers, and beach houses were damaged by waves exceeding high, and the battleship was pushed off her moorings, leaving her listing to port (tilted to the left). Downtown Mobile was flooded several feet, and the south-end towns of Bayou La Batre and Bon Secour were severely damaged. Dozens of vessels of various sizes were left stranded inland.

== Shoreline towns ==

The city of Mobile is situated at the head of the bay on the western shore. On the Eastern Shore of the bay are found several small communities, including Spanish Fort, Daphne, Fairhope, Point Clear, and Bon Secour. The town of Gulf Shores lies just outside the bay, on the Fort Morgan peninsula, while the town of Fort Morgan is located directly south of the bay. The Middle Bay Lighthouse has been located in the center of the bay since 1885.

The head of the bay is crossed by two major thoroughfares, Interstate 10, known as the Jubilee Parkway, and US 90/US 98, known as the Battleship Parkway. These two bridges serve as the primary connections between the city of Mobile and the Eastern Shore. On warm summer nights, the residents living around Mobile Bay sometimes enjoy the fruits of a mysterious natural phenomenon called a Jubilee, when fish and crabs swarm toward shore and can be easily harvested by people wading in the shallows.

<text>International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) is the oversight body of the satellite communications elements of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) established by the IMO designed to provide a worldwide system for automated emergency signal communication for ships at sea. IMSO ensures that the provision of maritime mobile satellite communications services (currently provided by Inmarsat Ltd and Iridium Ltd).

==History==

===INMARSAT===
The International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT) was established under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization by the Convention on the International Maritime Satellite Organization, signed at London on 3 September 1976 and entered into force on 16 July 1979. The organization was modeled after Intelsat, an international consortium which provided satellite communications among the member countries. The Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), a founding member of Intelsat, took the lead in the founding of Inmarsat. In coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization in the 1980s, the convention governing INMARSAT was amended to include improvements in aeronautical communications, notably for public safety.

The first Director General was appointed in January 1980 and operations began in 1982. Olof Lundberg, who had previously managed and developed mobile and specialized services at Swedish Telecom (now Telia), served as Director General and CEO until 1995.

===IMSO===
In the mid-1990s, there was contrasting views among member states for the agency&#x27;s future. There was a growing realization among the member states that the organization&#x27;s business assets needed to be privatized, mainly because of the competitive nature of the satellite communication industry and the unwillingness of many member states to invest money into INMARSAT to improve its network. There were also many which believed in the importance of maintaining the organization&#x27;s role in overseeing maritime satellite communication. The issue was resolved in a session in April 1998, which resulted in the amendment of the Convention on the International Mobile Satellite Organization, in which the operational assets would be split and privatized while the agency would continue as a regulatory organization.

On 15 April 1999, INMARSAT became the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO). At the time, the operational assets of INMARSAT were separated to become Inmarsat Ltd., a private UK-based company which agreed to inherit, overseen by the IMSO, certain public safety obligations related to the satellite system&#x27;s operation.

An agreement between the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the IMSO was signed in Montreal, Canada, on 20 September 2000 and addresses the relationship between ICAO and IMSO. As of November 2018, Inmarsat has 103 state parties that represent approximately 95 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world&#x27;s merchant fleet.

<text>A Jubilee is often used to refer to the celebration of a particular anniversary of an event, usually denoting the 25th, 40th, 50th, 60th, and the 70th anniversary. The term comes from the Hebrew Bible (see, &quot;Old Testament&quot;), initially concerning a recurring religious observance involving a set number of years, that notably involved freeing of debt slaves. Emperors of ancient Rome customarily marked anniversaries of their rule with celebrations, although they did not use the term jubilee. Nonetheless, the term came into English usage from the Bible, together with customary celebration of a reign, and is now often used to denote the celebrations associated with the reign of monarchs after a milestone number of years have passed.

==Religious usage==

The Jubilee ( &quot;yovel&quot;) year (every 50th year) and the Sabbatical year (every seventh year) are Biblical commandments concerning ownership of land and slaves. The laws concerning the Sabbatical year are still observed by many religious Jews in the State of Israel, while the Jubilee has not been observed for many centuries, if at all (before the &#x27;peshitto&#x27; era of the Vulgate-inspired bible). According to the Hebrew Bible, every seventh year, farmers in the land of Israel are commanded to let their land lie fallow, and slaves were freed. The celebration of the Jubilee is the fiftieth year, that is, the year after seven Sabbatical cycles. Jubilee was to recognize that by tradition all property belongs to God, not the individual Jew. For the Jew, returning of possessions to God was/is a religious vow or dedication.

In Roman Catholic tradition, a Jubilee is a year of penance instituted every 50 or 25 years.

==Terms for anniversaries==

Following the model of Augustus, the Roman emperors typically celebrated major jubilees on the 10th years of their reigns. The decennalia marked the 10th year, the vicennalia the 20th, andin the case of Constantine the Greatthe tricennalia the 30th. Smaller festivals sometimes occurred on the 5th years between these. For modern monarchs, the dates are typically connected with precious metals and gemstones:

*Silver jubilee, for a 25th anniversary.
*Ruby jubilee, for a 40th anniversary.
*Golden jubilee, for a 50th anniversary.
*Diamond jubilee, for either a 60th or 75th anniversary.
*Sapphire jubilee, for a 65th anniversary.
*Platinum jubilee, for a 70th anniversary.

<doc id="36540" wikidata="Q1307433" url="?curid=36540" title="Iron Chef">
<text>is a Japanese television cooking show produced by Fuji Television. The series, which premiered on October 10, 1993, is a stylized cook-off featuring guest chefs challenging one of the show&#x27;s resident &quot;Iron Chefs&quot; in a timed cooking battle built around a specific theme ingredient. The series ended on September 24, 1999, although four occasional specials were produced from January 5, 2000, to January 2, 2002. The series aired 309 episodes. Repeats are regularly aired on the Food Network in Canada, the Cooking Channel in the United States until Asian-American specialty television channel ChimeTV took over reruns in 2022, and on Special Broadcasting Service in Australia; in the United States, it is streamed by Peacock TV and Pluto TV. There are 5 spinoffs, with the latest being &quot;Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend&quot;.

Fuji TV aired a new version of the show, titled , premiering on October 26, 2012.

==Features==
The host of the show is the flamboyant Takeshi Kaga, known on the show as the aristocrat . He begins most episodes with his signature words, taken from Arthur Rimbaud, &quot;If memory serves me right...&quot;(Jadis) &quot;si je me souviens bien&quot;...&quot; and starts the cooking time with the phrase &quot;&quot;Allez Cuisine!&quot;. The show has two regular commentators, Kenji Fukui, who narrated the action on the floor, and Yukio Hattori, a food scholar and founder of the Hattori Nutrition College. A floor reporter, Shinichiro Ohta, reports to Fukui on what the challengers and Iron Chefs are preparing, their strategy, and their comments, breaking Fukui&#x27;s train of commentary with a polite &quot;Fukui-san?&quot;&quot;. One or two guest commentators (who also serve as judges) also made frequent appearances. The commentary covers ingredients, history of contenders, and other background information to give viewers context for what was happening in the kitchen.

===Story===
The kayfabe &quot;story&quot; behind &quot;Iron Chef&quot; is recounted at the beginning of every episode of the English dub. A title card, with a quote from famed French food author Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin first appeared: &quot;Tell me what you eat, and I&#x27;ll tell you what you are.&quot; Then, it was said that Kaga &quot;realized his dream in a form never seen before&quot; and specially constructed a cooking arena called &quot;Kitchen Stadium&quot;. There, visiting chefs from &quot;around the world&quot; would compete against his Gourmet Academy, led by his three (later four) Iron Chefs. Chairman Kaga himself was a showpiece, dressed in outlandish examples of men&#x27;s formal attire. The English name &quot;Iron Chef&quot; comes from the show itself: Kaga would use this translation of the Japanese title when summoning his chefs at the beginning of the &quot;battle&quot;.

=== Iron Chefs ===
From the beginning of the show in 1993, the three Iron Chefs were: Iron Chef Japanese Rokusaburo Michiba, Iron Chef Chinese Chen Kenichi, and Iron Chef French Yutaka Ishinabe. After the first season, Ishinabe decided to step down and become an &#x27;honorary Iron Chef&#x27;, thus passing the mantle of Iron Chef French to Hiroyuki Sakai in 1994. Ishinabe returned for two more battles during season three. At the beginning of season four in 1996, Michiba announced his retirement and debuted Koumei Nakamura as the new Iron Chef Japanese. Michiba returned on rare occasions for special Kitchen Stadium battles. In 1997, Chairman Kaga announced a new, additional Iron Chef to the group: Iron Chef Italian Masahiko Kobe. He was the youngest of the Iron Chefs and battled sparingly throughout the rest of the show, ascending to the stage separately from the three main Iron Chefs, and surrounded by a chamber string ensemble. In 1998, Nakamura also decided to retire and passed the title of Iron Chef Japanese to Masaharu Morimoto.

===Iron Chef statistics===


===Show staff===
* Kenji Fukui, Announcer/Commentator (English voice: Bill Bickard)
* Yukio Hattori, Commentator (English voice: Scott Morris)
* Takeshi Kaga (as Chairman Kaga), Host (English voice: Duncan Hamilton, Kent Frick)
* Shinichiro Ohta, Kitchen Reporter (English voice: Jeff Manning)
* Kyoichi Tanaka, Director
* Masahiro Ito, Screenwriter
* Kundō Koyama, Screenwriter
* Setsuko Yuuki, Food Coordinator
* Dave Spector served as translator and commentator for &quot;New York Special&quot;.

===Original format===
Originally, challengers vied with each other in preliminary &quot;battles&quot; to earn the right to face an Iron Chef in a 90-minute competition, and should a challenger win twice against Iron Chefs, the challenger would be given the title of &quot;Honorary Iron Chef&quot;. However, this format proved unpopular, the preliminary round was scrapped and the main contest was reduced to the now familiar 60 minutes. The awarding of honorary Iron Chef titles to challengers was also discontinued (although this was largely a moot point as few challengers ever defeated two Iron Chefs in separate contests), but was given as an emeritus title for a retiring Iron Chef. Once honorary titles were no longer issued, challengers who beat an Iron Chef had to settle for, according to the English version&#x27;s introduction, &quot;the people&#x27;s ovation and fame forever&quot;.

In each episode, chefs have one hour to cook and improvise a multicourse meal around a theme ingredient that must be present in each dish. Before the actual taping, the chefs are given a short list of possible themes, allowing the producers of the show to get any ingredients that may be needed. Judges&#x27; primary goal was said to be determining which chef was able to &quot;best express the unique qualities of the theme ingredient&quot;. In rare cases, the format changed—angler fish battles were typically 75 minutes in length, and noodle battles had the Iron Chef stop after 50 minutes of cooking, only to resume after the challenger&#x27;s dishes were tasted so that the noodles could be served right after cooking.

===Theme ingredients===
Featured ingredients tend toward the exotic and expensive. Many theme ingredients reflect the Japanese origin of the show—river eel, tofu, udon—though ingredients more familiar in the West, such as bell peppers, summer corn, and peaches, are spotlighted, as well. In one episode devoted to asparagus, the challenger boasted that he used over $1,000 worth of lobster (which he then discarded) simply to flavor his asparagus in this battle against Iron Chef Morimoto.

Initially, a minimum of three dishes was to be prepared, although some challengers have finished only a single dish; four is the typical number. The record for highest number of dishes prepared for a battle was eight, first set by challenger Kenji Kaji against Iron Chef Michiba in &quot;Battle Umeboshi&quot;. Five (later six) servings of each dish are prepared, one each for the chairman and judges, and one for photography and presentation.

===Assistant chefs===
Each chef is also given two assistants, who are supposedly students of Kaga&#x27;s &quot;Gourmet Academy&quot; (in reality, they are students of Hattori Nutrition College). If the challenger does not speak Japanese, students who can speak in the challenger&#x27;s native language are sometimes provided. In a notable exception, San Francisco chef Ron Siegel struggled with his assistants, who did not speak English. One assistant, Kenichi Miyanaga, became a challenger himself, taking on Iron Chef Morimoto in a sweetfish battle.

===Commentary and judging===
Throughout the cook-off, running commentary is made in a booth near the cooking area by an announcer, Kenji Fukui; a commentator, Yukio Hattori, and one or two of the guest judges, with one floor reporter (sometimes two; normally Shinichiro Ohta) providing details of the action on each side. The commentators and judges discuss the style of cooking, culinary traditions and unusual food preparation. At the end of the hour, after end-of-battle interviews with both competitors, each dish is presented to the camera, with a description of its properties (written by the show&#x27;s screenwriters based on the chef&#x27;s explanation) read by the announcer. Then, a panel of three (later expanded to four, and later still, five) judges, of which typically one is a professional critic, tastes the dishes and judges them based on taste, presentation, and originality. Each chef may be awarded up to 20 points by each judge, with 10 given for taste and five each for presentation and originality. The chef with the greatest score wins the competition. (In earlier four-judge episodes, the win went to the chef who won three of the four judges, or, failing that, the chef who makes the highest points total.)

Chairman Kaga tastes the dishes along with the judges. While he occasionally makes comments and seeks input from judges during tasting, he generally does not participate in scoring; he did do so, however, during the &quot;2000th Dish&quot; Battle. During this episode, a team of French cuisine chefs—captain Hiroyuki Sakai, the original Iron Chef French Yutaka Ishinabe, and former challenger Etsuo Joh—battled a team of Chinese cuisine chefs composed of captain Chen Kenichi, former challenger Sozo Myamoto, and former challenger Yuji Wakiya (who would later be Iron Chef Chinese on the 2012 revival). To break the tie, Chairman Kaga asked them to allow him this one instance of selfishness, and he cast his vote for the French team.

===Ties===
In the case of a deadlock (as was possible during the era of the four-judge panel), first place is awarded to the chef with the greater number of points. On the rare occasions that the scores were also tied, an immediate &quot;overtime battle&quot; was held to determine the winner. In overtime, the chefs are given 30 minutes to prepare dishes with a different key ingredient, having to make do with what remains of their pantry or with items that were previously prepared for the main battle. The overtime battles are aired as a separate episode. On one occasion, the overtime battle itself resulted in a tie, prompting Chairman Kaga to declare both the Iron Chef and challenger winners.

==Broadcast history==
The stage setting for the show, , the high-quality (and sometimes very expensive) ingredients used in the cooking battles, and Kaga&#x27;s extravagant costumes required the show to have a budget far higher than those of most other cooking shows. Some statistics: 893 portions of &quot;foie gras&quot;, 54 sea bream, 827 &quot;Ise&quot; shrimp, 964 &quot;matsutake&quot; mushrooms, 4,593 eggs, 1,489 truffles, 4,651 g of caviar, and 84 pieces of shark fin were used during the show, bringing the total grocery bill to ¥843,354,407 (or about $7,115,520). One of the most expensive battles was Battle Swallow&#x27;s Nest, which ran over $40,000 solely for that ingredient, not counting large quantities of shark&#x27;s fin; for the battle, the producers were permitted to return any unused portions to Hattori Nutrition College.

===Final episode and specials===
For the show&#x27;s grand finale, aired from September 10, 1999, to September 24, 1999, the Iron Chefs faced off against each other in a three-part battle, with the winner to face French chef Alain Passard, owner of Michelin three-star restaurant L&#x27;Arpege, with the winner dubbed the &quot;King of Iron Chefs&quot;.

In the first round, Iron Chef Chinese Chen defeated Iron Chef Italian Kobe in Battle Pork (Tokyo X). In the second round, Iron Chef French Sakai defeated Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto in Battle Bell Pepper. In the final match, Sakai defeated Chen in Battle Homard Lobster and was dubbed &quot;King of Iron Chefs&quot;. Prior to that episode, Sakai had never won a lobster battle.

In the final bonus match in Kitchen Stadium, with all of the current and previous Iron Chefs looking on, Iron Chef French Sakai defeated Alain Passard in Battle Long-Gang Chicken. Thus, Hiroyuki Sakai was dubbed as both &quot;King of Iron Chefs&quot; and &quot;The No. 1 in the World&quot;.

Two reunion specials were produced in 2000. The first was &quot;The Millennium Special&quot;; the second was &quot;New York Special&quot;, staged in a makeshift Kitchen Stadium at Webster Hall in New York City, and was the first appearance of Bobby Flay. The New York special also included Michiba and Morimoto on Gordon Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Door Knock Dinners&quot; (with footage aired on both shows) surprising a family in Rye by preparing dinner for them with just leftovers and other items in the family&#x27;s refrigerator. Another reunion episode of the show (entitled &quot;Iron Chef: 21st Century Battle&quot;) was produced and broadcast in 2001. A final reunion episode was produced and broadcast in 2002, entitled &quot;The Japan Cup&quot;. This special was hosted by celebrity Masahiro Motoki, and began with a mock funeral for the character of Chairman Kaga, citing fugu poisoning as his cause of death.

Sakai, Chen, Kobe and Michiba, along with celebrity chefs including Chen&#x27;s son Chen Kentaro and Singaporean patissier Janice Wong, also participated in an Iron Chef All Stars charity dinner at the Sydney Opera House in August 2017 that raised AU$26,500 for Opportunity International Australia and was eventually Kobe&#x27;s last Iron Chef event before his death.

===United States reception===
Starting around 1997, &quot;Iron Chef&quot; was shown, on KTSF in San Francisco, KSCI in Long Beach, as well as stations in Hawaii and the New York City area, in its original Japanese version with English subtitles, and quickly became a cult hit. In summer of 1998, the show stopped using subtitles; Fuji TV released a statement saying that the show was intended as a &quot;service to the Japanese community abroad&quot; and due to Japanese copyright laws were to be aired without subtitles, which had previously been provided &quot;inadvertently&quot;.

While always a success in Japan, &quot;Iron Chef&quot; became a surprise hit in the United States when it was picked up by the Food Network in 1999 and dubbed into English. Part of the U.S. appeal was due to the dubbing, which gave the show a campy charm that evoked English-dubbed Chinese kung fu movies of the 1970s. Audiences also found amusing some of the over-the-top culinary concoctions regularly featured on the show, eventually leading to a spoof on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

===International syndication===
The show was presented in the United States and Canada on the Food Network, dubbed and/or subtitled into English. It was also broadcast on SBS TV in Australia. In the case of SBS, this is unusual as the network has a policy favouring in-house subtitling of acquired programs; it may be felt that the tone given to the show by its American dub is essential to its charms, heightened perhaps by the fact that in most episodes, the flamboyant Chairman is subtitled instead of dubbed.

The show was also broadcast on the Finnish channel SubTV, and the Swedish channel TV400 (TV4). &quot;Iron Chef&quot; was broadcast on Challenge in the UK in 2003 and 2004, as part of its &quot;Japanese Christmas Cracker&quot; and &quot;Japanorama&quot; strands.

The show had again aired in the U.S. on the Fine Living Network from May 5, 2008, until the channel went off the air on May 30, 2010; however, the music from earlier broadcasts, taken from international films such as &quot;Backdraft&quot; and &quot;A Zed &amp; Two Noughts&quot;, had been replaced due to music-licensing issues with NBC Universal. The Cooking Channel picked up the series on June 1, 2010, when it replaced Fine Living. The stations that have carried the series, Fine Living, Cooking Channel, and Food Network, are all owned by Scripps Networks Interactive.

FilmRise acquired the exclusive rights to the original Iron Chef episodes in October 2021. The following month, episodes began streaming for free on Paramount&#x27;s Pluto TV service.

==Notable challengers==
Certain challengers have made repeat appearances, or have been particularly memorable (including if they were the lone chefs specializing in their particular cuisines in the show&#x27;s history).

(Japanese names are not in the traditional Japanese style [i.e. family name first] but have been written in standard European style [i.e. family name last].)
* Jacques Borie: An MOF winner. He is the only challenger who beat iron chef Yutaka Ishinabe.
* La Tour d&#x27;Argent (Two wins and one draw in four battles) – A historic French restaurant in Paris (dating itself back to 1582) that has a Tokyo branch at the Hotel New Otani open since 1984.
** Tadaaki Shimazu: a chef who worked at the Tokyo branch, he bested Sakai with homard lobster as the theme.
** Bernard Leprince (One win in two battles) : a chef at the main Paris branch who faced Nakamura twice, with the chefs winning one each. Leprince won their initial battle during the French Special with salmon as the theme and also won the rematch in Tokyo with duck as the theme.
** Dominique Corby: a chef at the Tokyo branch, he was the 300th challenger and fought Chen to a draw first with foie gras as the regulation theme and then with asparagus as the overtime theme. He is the only competitor to have tied an Iron Chef twice — once initially and again in the overtime battle. He and Chen were subsequently declared joint winners.
* Arpège (Two wins and one draw in four battles) – a French restaurant in Paris that earned its first Michelin Guide star in its first year after its founding in 1986, its second soon thereafter and a third in 1996, which it has maintained since. It was also ranked 8th in The World&#x27;s 50 Best Restaurants in 2018. 
** Alain Passard (One win and one draw in three battles): Arpège&#x27;s owner and head chef. He represented France in the 1997 Iron Chef World Cup in Kyoto and beat American Patrick Clark with homard lobster as the theme before tying Nakamura in the final with foie gras as the theme. Short after his appearance, L&#x27;Arpege had received its third Michelin star. In the series finale, Passard was invited to Kitchen Stadium to be the final challenger during the final King of Iron Chefs series, where Sakai bested him with Long Gang chicken as the theme.
** Tetsuya Shimada: A Japanese French chef who worked at Arpège from 1987 until his return to Japan in 1992, his skills were recognized by Passard, who made him a seafood specialist while at Arpège. Also a member of Club Mistral (see below), Sakai also beat him with black truffles as the theme.
* Cheng Kazuhiko: A Chinese chef and the first challenger to win in Kitchen Stadium after he bested Chen in the sixth episode with octopus as the theme
* Tadamichi Ōta: defeated Iron Chef Sakai in an octopus battle, in which Sakai was particularly squeamish about handling the live creatures. Later became the leader of the &quot;Ōta Faction&quot; (大田軍団) of traditional Japanese chefs. The Ōta Faction regularly challenged Iron Chef Morimoto and his neo-Japanese style, winning one out of five battles. Ōta Faction was the name used in the translated version shown on Food Network. In the original Japanese version (shown in the U.S. and transcribed by the Iron Chef Reporter in southern California) the group is called &quot;Ōta&#x27;s Party of Heaven and Earth&quot; (OPHE; 大田天地の会). Every time he appeared, Fukui would point out that he was not related to Shinichiro Ohta, the show&#x27;s floor reporter.
* Kyoko Kagata (One win in two battles): A French chef, the first female chef to appear on the show and the youngest chef to be victorious after beating Chen with scallops as the theme. Four years later, after experiencing a midlife crisis, she challenged Chen again. This time, with veal as the theme, Chen won by 19–17 on Kishi&#x27;s scorecard and 20–19 on the others.
: An interesting side note is that the second female challenger, cooking show host Katsuyo Kobayashi, also faced Chen. Kobayashi indirectly picked Chen because she allowed Kaga to pick for her. Chen lost both battles, and purportedly caught some flak from chef-friends of his. Chen fought another two female challengers in separate battles and won.
* Cho Chiyo: An okonomiyaki turned Cantonese chef from Kobe who helped feed those suffering hardship after the city was devastated by the Great Hanshin Earthquake. Kaga invited her to battle in recognition of her bravery and so that she could cook to her heart&#x27;s content, and she challenged Chen, who prevailed with tofu as the theme.
* Toshiro Kandagawa (three wins out of six battles): Regular challenger who aligned himself with the Ōta Faction, a group of hardline traditionalists in Japanese cuisine, and often led his army of fellow chefs and protegés into Kitchen Stadium during challenges. Kandagawa has taken part in several battles wherein he supported apprentices to battle an Iron Chef (only one out of the ten won). Kandagawa also participated in several &quot;battle special&quot; episodes, including the 21st Century Battle. Rokusaburo Michiba was his main rival until Michiba&#x27;s retirement as Iron Chef Japanese; he has recorded victories over Chen, Nakamura and Sakai.
* Pierre Gagnaire: The owner and head chef of the eponymous Michelin 3-star Pierre Gagnaire in Paris, Gagnaire represented France in the 1995 Iron Chef World Cup at Ariake Coliseum but lost to eventual runner-up Gianfranco Vissani with tuna as the theme ingredient. He was later under financial pressure as the French economic downturn threatened to close the restaurant, and Kaga was moved to organize the France Battle Special to rekindle Gagnaire&#x27;s spirit. He then proceeded to defeat Sakai with lobster as the theme. Gagnaire has since opened another restaurant bearing his name in Tokyo as part of his ventures, operating since 2005.
* Rory Kennedy: The head chef of Rules in Covent Garden, London and the lone British challenger on the show. He and Sakai battled to a draw with rabbit as the theme, with Sakai prevailing in overtime with pigeon as the theme.
* Bobby Flay: Flay entered into a bit of a rivalry with Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto during the show&#x27;s special &quot;New York Battle&quot;. Flay complained that his side of the kitchen was poorly laid out (it was noted in an Iron Chef America &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; episode that the kitchen was hastily set up in the provided forum). At one point Flay received an electric shock, transmitted by a wet floor and faulty wiring, when he grabbed a metal pan on the range. When Flay stood on his cutting board at the end of the battle, Morimoto declared that Flay was &quot;not a chef&quot; for disregarding the cleanliness of one&#x27;s cutting board. Morimoto won, but Flay was offered a rematch. He accepted, and got his revenge, in the 21st Century Battle in Japan, where, at battle&#x27;s end, he tossed the cutting board off the counter before climbing on it, so as not to offend Morimoto again. Flay then became an Iron Chef alongside Morimoto on &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;. This rivalry was revisited for a third time with Morimoto defeating Flay during the Holiday Ice Battle (&quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, November 2009)
* Ron Siegel: A French/California cuisine chef who was head chef of Charles Nob Hill in San Francisco when he bested Sakai with lobster as the theme to become the first American challenger to win in Kitchen Stadium. Mayor Willie Brown had personally recommended Siegel to be on the show.
* Michael Noble: The lone Canadian challenger and an award winner in the Bocuse d&#x27;Or, who was head chef at the Metropolitan Hotel in Vancouver when he challenged Morimoto in Battle Potato in 1999 with Morimoto winning 3-1.
* Wayne Nish: A Japanese-American chef (his grandfather is from Yamaguchi Prefecture), New York native and the head chef at March, a highly-rated restaurant on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. Sakai bested him with apples as the theme, with the battle also being notable because it was the only one that regular color commentator Yukio Hattori judged.
* : A group of Italian chefs working in Japan who took their name from the top flight of Italian football and frequently challenged Iron Chef Italian Kobe: Mario Frittoli, Constantino Gemmoli, and Franco Canzoniere. No group member ever defeated Kobe, although one member did defeat Morimoto. 
** Marco Paolo Molinari: A member of Serie A and a world pasta champion who prevailed over Morimoto with porcini mushrooms as the theme, making him ultimately the only Italian challenger to beat an Iron Chef. Utilized a block of marble that was first heated using alcohol spray and a torch and then cooled with dry ice while creating and kneading his dough, which bewildered Morimoto.
* Joël Bruant (One win in two battles): A Tokyo-based French chef considered a French culinary ambassador to Japan, he was vice chairman of the Acaedemie Culinaire de France and a top apprentice to Paul Bocuse. He and Marashi Furutaka beat Michiba and Chen in a doubles match with sea bass as the theme, but Sakai beat him with salmon as the theme.
* : A group of young specialists in French cuisine. They mainly targeted Iron Chef French Sakai as a member of Club des Trentes – one of their competing groups composed of more established French chefs that included Sakai, Ishinabe and challenger Etsuo Jō – in a similar fashion, although they took on Iron Chef Chinese Chen and Iron Chef French Ishinabe once each as well. Only one of them managed a win (Kazutaka Okabe versus Sakai, in a lamb battle) despite several attempts.
* Tatsuo Umemiya: An actor, &quot;tarento&quot; (including on restaurant variety shows) and businessman. He lost to Michiba with horse mackerel as the theme but was invited back as a judge for some subsequent battles including the King of Iron Chefs series finale.
* Heichinrou (One win out of three battles): The oldest restaurant in Yokohama Chinatown sent three challengers to challenge Chen in 1998 and 1999 after deeming him worthy of their challenge. Chen beat cooking coach Hisao Yaginuma with bok choy as the theme and Mitsuo Suganuma (the first Japanese chef to head a Heichinrou branch) with shark fin as the theme before Xie Huaxian, the restaurant&#x27;s grand chef, won with spiny lobster as the theme.
* Dr. Yukio Hattori: A gentlemen&#x27;s agreement went on between the Chairman of Gourmet Academy (Kaga) and the President of Culinary Academy (Hattori) where the Doctor agreed to battle an Iron Chef. If he won, he would be given a spot alongside the Iron Chefs and if he lost he would keep working for Kaga. As he remained a commentator until the end of the series, one can easily deduce the outcomes of his two battles. Joël Robuchon was invited as a guest judge for the event, and Honorary Iron Chef Ishinabe served in a commentary role in Hattori&#x27;s place for the battle. Hattori also battled Nakamura in his final battle with tuna as the theme owing to the longstanding Hattori-Nadaban rivalry, with Nakamura prevailing with tuna as the theme.
*Takashi Saitō (not to be confused with the baseball player): The top apprentice of Chen&#x27;s father Chen Kenmin who also coached Kenichi after Kenmin passed away and then challenged him with prawns at the theme. Both chefs recreated one of Kenmin&#x27;s signatures, prawns in chili sauce – Saito recreated Kenmin&#x27;s original recipe, while Kenichi recreated his father&#x27;s modern version of the dish (with ketchup, which he then served Canapé Style) and went on to win. In the &quot;2000th Dish Special&quot;, Kaga said that Chen&#x27;s prawns were his favorite dish to that point, and Chen himself also said it was the battle he remembered most including because it was the one battle that his mother Yoko watched in person.
*Isao Makio: A French chef who was a classmate of Sakai&#x27;s at Izumi Municipal Junior High School in Kagoshima Prefecture, the two sat next to each other but barely talked, though the two were also on the same train to seek jobs and got off at different stations. After Sakai returned to Kagoshima to visit his parents&#x27; grave and unexpectedly reunited with his class and teacher, the class relayed his wish to meet Sakai and challenge him, which would be the first time they had met in 40 years. Sakai prevailed with Kagoshima black pig as the theme and the class in attendance.
*Lin Kunbi (no wins in two battles): A celebrity Fuchien Chinese chef who battled Michiba to a draw with potatoes as the theme, leading to the very first overtime in show history where Michiba prevailed with sweet potatoes as the theme. He later also faced Nakamura, who won with bell peppers as the theme.
*Kenichi Miyanaga: A graduate of Hattori Nutrition College who was also an assistant for several Kitchen Stadium Battles and eventually hired by Michiba after Michiba retired as an active Iron Chef and after Miyanaga graduated. Michiba chose him to face Morimoto in a battle to also push Morimoto, and Morimoto won with sweetfish as the theme.
*Yūji Wakiya (one win in three battles): A master of &quot;neo-Chinese&quot; cuisine, Wakiya lost to Iron Chef Sakai in Battle Sea Urchin but defeated Iron Chef Chen with papayas. He later became part of Chen&#x27;s All-Chinese team alongside Sozo Miyamoto for the 2000th Dish Special. He was also named the second Iron Chef Chinese in the Millennium Cup and was supposed to take over Chen&#x27;s place, but he never actually battled under the new title until the first episode of the 2012 revival.
*Etsuo Jō (two wins in three battles): A French chef famous for his sauces. Michiba defeated him with broccoli as the theme, but he then bested Sakai with wine as the theme. He was also chosen to be the third member of Sakai&#x27;s All-French team for the 2000th Dish Special alongside Ishinabe.
*Sozo Miyamoto (no wins in two battles): A Shanghai cuisine chef and a rival of Chen&#x27;s who, like him, won a silver award representing Japan in the World Chinese Cooking Championship in 1992. Chen won with carp as the theme, but Miyamoto was also invited to join him on the All-Chinese team for the 2000th Dish Special alongside Wakiya.
*Li Jinlun: A Cantonese chef working in Tokyo after being been the head chef at Fook Lam Moon, a famous Cantonese restaurant in Hong Kong. Chen bested him with swallow&#x27;s nest ($24,000 worth) as the theme.

He first tied with Chen Kenichi during the battle of Pork belly and finally he made way to the 30 minutes overtime battle and won.
*Masahiko Hagiwara (One win in two battles): An Italian chef and pasta specialist. Chen beat him with scampi as the theme, but he bested Kobe with short pasta as the theme in Kobe&#x27;s debut, making him the only challenger to win against a debuting Iron Chef.
*Kentaro: Katsuyo Kobayashi&#x27;s son who wants to defeat Iron Chef Chen Kenichi like his mother did before. He first appeared in his mother&#x27;s cook show at the age of 5 and at age 25 he further his skills in art, music and cooking. During the battle with Iron Chef Chen Kenichi he refused to use the same recipes like his mother. Chen beat Kentaro in the new potatoes battle.
*Shinya Tasaki: The winner of the Association de la Sommellerie Internationale&#x27;s Meilleur Sommelier du Monde (World&#x27;s Best Sommelier) in Tokyo in 1995, the first (and as of 2020, still only) Asian national to win the competition. Also president of the Association . Tasaki is also the only non-professional chef to have won in Kitchen Stadium after defeating Kobe with fatty tuna as the theme. Though it was not a stipulation of the battle, by virtue of his being a sommelier, both he and Kobe chose wines to pair with their dishes. Also invited to perform sommelier duties during the series finale.
*Sotetsu Fujii: The high priest of the Fushikian Temple in Kamakura and a Shojin vegetarian chef, who Sakai bested with yams as the theme.
*Hiroshi Furusho: A French chef (including a specialty in Cajun cuisine) and a favorite of the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, including manager Katsuya Nomura, a recurring judge who recommended him for the show.

*Jun&#x27;ichi Itō: The first challenger not classified as a chef specializing in any specific cuisine, he started French cooking at age 18 and left for France at age 28. He left for Italy three years later and joined Enoteca Pinchiorri, where Kobe had also trained. When he was 35, he opened his restaurant Herle Quin in Tokyo. Food critic Asako Kishi, the show&#x27;s most frequent judge by dishes tasted, recommended him as a challenger before Chen won with yogurt as the theme.
*Kensuke Sakai: An Italian chef, but most notable because his restaurant &quot;Nigiro&quot; was (at time of taping in 1998) really a food stand that he brings in by hand to a monastery&#x27;s yard each night – he had been cited 30 times by Tokyo police before coming to the arrangement with the monastery. At his introduction, Sakai brought the food cart into Kitchen Stadium. Kobe bested him with pumpkin as the theme.

*Takashi Mera (One win in two battles): A chef who used the longest knife in the country, almost twice the 8-inch average length used by other Japanese chefs. He lost to Michiba with tuna as the theme but was invited back for a rematch and bested Nakamura with wakame seaweed as the theme.
*Kiyotaka Ikegawa: A sumo &quot;rikishi&quot; known as Fuyoho who turned chef after an injury cut his sumo career short. Chen bested him with horsehair crab as the theme.

==2012 revival==

In 2012, Fuji Television announced that it was recording new episodes of &quot;Iron Chef&quot;. The first episode debuted on October 26, 2012, as a two-hour special, thereafter reverting to a one-hour show airing on Friday evenings at 19:57 Japan time. Unlike the original &quot;Ryōri no Tetsujin&quot;, the new show was titled Iron Chef (アイアンシェフ) in katakana characters. The Chairman&#x27;s role was assumed by Japanese actor Hiroshi Tamaki. Fuji TV commentator Mizuki Sano hosted the program, and the reporters were Yurika Mita and Daisuke Miyagawa. Dr. Yukio Hattori returned from the original &quot;Iron Chef&quot; series to provide commentary. Three new Iron Chefs were chosen; Jun Kurogi as Iron Chef Japanese, Yūji Wakiya as Iron Chef Chinese, and Yōsuke Suga as Iron Chef French.

The first battle in the new show was a two-hour special with two battles. The first challenger was former Kitchen Stadium challenger (referred as &quot;nominee&quot;) Kenichi Miyanaga, recommended by Iron Chef Rokusaburo Michiba. Miyanaga is Michiba&#x27;s top apprentice and battled Iron Chef Suga. The challenger (&quot;nominee&quot;) in the second battle was Kentaro Chen, recommended by his father Iron Chef Chen Kenichi, who battled Iron Chef Wakiya.

It was announced, after airing thirteen episodes, that the new run of Iron Chef would be discontinued after the last episode on March 22, 2013. Mr. Tatematsu, General Manager of Editing, explained, &quot;Iron Chef is a high quality show and we can say it is FujiTV&#x27;s treasure. Currently we are struggling for the ratings. We think we have a time slot problem, too, so we would like to consider about a way to make it as special program and forward it into the next stage.&quot; On July 3, 2013, the Iron Chefs reunited for an American Chef Special with beef as the secret ingredient. All three Iron Chefs were paired with an American challenger, and then for a fourth round, all six competed. Currently, there are no plans for any more Iron Chef specials.

===&quot;Iron Chef America&quot;===
====&quot;Iron Chef USA&quot;====

Around Christmas 2001, the UPN network presented two one-hour episodes of &quot;Iron Chef USA&quot; hosted by William Shatner as &quot;The Chairman of the American Culinary Academy&quot;. Competition took place inside &quot;Kitchen Arena&quot; (built in Garden Arena in the Las Vegas MGM Grand Hotel). Commentary was provided by Michael Burger and Anthony Dias Blue, with floor reporting by Sissy Biggers. The show featured four Iron Chefs: Iron Chef American Todd English (whose specialty is actually Mediterranean food), Iron Chef French Jean Francois Meteigner, Iron Chef Italian Alessandro Stratta, and Iron Chef Asian Roy Yamaguchi. In the show&#x27;s only two battles, English defeated Kerry Simon in a dungeness crab battle, and Stratta defeated Marcus Samuelsson in a turkey battle.

These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, perhaps because the show focused little on cooking—a major part of the Japanese program. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused to say what they were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.

====&quot;Iron Chef America&quot;====

In 2004, Food Network announced that it would air an Iron Chef special, called &quot;Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters&quot;, featuring Sakai and Morimoto dueling with American Iron Chefs Bobby Flay, Mario Batali, and Wolfgang Puck, all Food Network personalities and renowned American celebrity chefs. (Morimoto and Flay battled in two previous Iron Chef specials that were made after the original series aired.) The specials featured Alton Brown as the announcer and Mark Dacascos playing the role of The Chairman (in the storyline, this Chairman is the nephew of Takeshi Kaga).

The show received high ratings and rave reviews and in October 2004, and Food Network began taping weekly episodes that premiered starting in January 2005. Some changes were made to the show, most notably replacing Puck with Morimoto as an Iron Chef (a fourth Iron Chef, Cat Cora, was added later), and the location was moved from Los Angeles to New York City. The fifth Iron Chef, Michael Symon, was added after his win in &quot;The Next Iron Chef&quot;. In 2009, Chef Jose Garces became the sixth Iron Chef following his own victory in the second season of that show. In 2010, Chef Marc Forgione won its third season, becoming the seventh Iron Chef on Iron Chef America. Chef Geoffrey Zakarian won that show&#x27;s fourth season in 2011, making him the eighth Iron Chef. In 2012, Chef Alexandra Guarnaschelli, who had served as Sous Chef on Iron Chef episodes, became the ninth after winning the fifth season of &quot;The Next Iron Chef&quot;, while Stephanie Izard became the tenth and final Iron Chef.

Even though both Todd English and Kerry Simon from &quot;Iron Chef USA&quot; competed on &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, the episodes did not mention their IC-USA appearances.

====&quot;Iron Chef Gauntlet&quot;====

&quot;Iron Chef Gauntlet&quot; is a two season reformat of &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; where seven chefs from around the country compete in an elimination contest, with the last chef remaining facing a &quot;gauntlet&quot; challenge of defeating three other Iron Chefs in order to earn the title. It aired from 2017 to 2018

Each episode features a different prominent Israeli chef, who competes against one of the show&#x27;s featured foreign chefs. All Israeli winners compete against one another in the finals and the winner competes against a foreign chef for the title of season champion. Season 1 featured only French chef Stéphane Froidevaux, who won the season&#x27;s finale, while season 2 saw the inclusion of Italian chef Alfredo Russo, meaning both Michelin star holders would have to compete against each other for a spot in the final bout. The show is actively hosted by actor Oded Menashe and the regular commentators are chef Yaron Kastenboim and catering company owner Ran Shmueli. While in season 1, the panel of judges was made up mostly of celebrities from the entertainment industry, season 2 features renowned persons from the culinary industry, such as restaurant critics and chefs. The competitors prepare a three-course meal, with each dish given a score of up to 10 points by each member of the panel and commentators, accumulating up to 150 points per chef (compared to 90 points in season 1, where the commentators had relatively more points to give).

===&quot;Iron Chef UK&quot;===

In 2010, UK public television network Channel 4 debuted &quot;Iron Chef UK&quot;, based on &quot;Iron Chef&quot;. The show airs five days a week, and is hosted by Olly Smith and Nick Nairn. The four Iron Chefs are Tom Aikens, Martin Blunos, Sanjay Dwivedi and Judy Joo. Like the original &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, the competitions are held in Kitchen Stadium and presided over by The Chairman. Judging occurs in two rounds, with the first round being appetizers, and the second being the main courses. Two challengers prepare the appetizer, producing one appetizer each, while the Iron Chef prepares two. These are judged, and the standing for the team versus the Iron Chef are announced. Then the second half begins: the challenging team and the Iron Chef return to the kitchen to prepare the main course. The two challengers each prepare one dish, while the Iron Chef prepares two. Judging resumes, and the results are announced. Either the Challenging team wins, or the Iron Chef wins in overall score, and the best dish from the challenging team is also announced. The challengers with the best dish returns on Friday to compete against the best Iron Chef of the week.

===&quot;Iron Chef Australia&quot;===

The Seven Network announced in August 2010 that an Australian version was planned, in part to capitalize on the success of the highly popular &quot;MasterChef Australia&quot;.

The Australian Iron Chefs were Neil Perry, Guy Grossi and Guillaume Brahimi, while the show features a static judging panel composed of food critics Larissa Dubecki, Simon Thomsen and Leo Schofield. Mark Dacascos reprises his role as The Chairman from &quot;Iron Chef America&quot;, and the program is hosted by Grant Denyer, with additional commentary provided by Richard Cornish.

&quot;Iron Chef Australia&quot; began airing on October 19, 2010, attracting an audience of 1.13 million viewers for its first episode.

<doc id="36541" wikidata="Q1753108" url="?curid=36541" title="First transcontinental railroad">
<text>America&#x27;s first transcontinental railroad (known originally as the &quot;Pacific Railroad&quot; and later as the &quot;Overland Route&quot;) was a continuous railroad line built between 1863 and 1869 that connected the existing eastern U.S. rail network at Council Bluffs, Iowa, with the Pacific coast at the Oakland Long Wharf on San Francisco Bay. The rail line was built by three private companies over public lands provided by extensive U.S. land grants. Building was financed by both state and U.S. government subsidy bonds as well as by company-issued mortgage bonds. The Western Pacific Railroad Company built of track from the road&#x27;s western terminus at Alameda/Oakland to Sacramento, California. The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California (CPRR) constructed east from Sacramento to Promontory Summit, Utah Territory. The Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) built from the road&#x27;s eastern terminus at the Missouri River settlements of Council Bluffs and Omaha, Nebraska, westward to Promontory Summit.

The railroad opened for through traffic between Sacramento and Omaha on May 10, 1869, when CPRR President Leland Stanford ceremonially tapped the gold &quot;Last Spike&quot; (later often referred to as the &quot;Golden Spike&quot;) with a silver hammer at Promontory Summit. In the following six months, the last leg from Sacramento to San Francisco Bay was completed. The resulting coast-to-coast railroad connection revolutionized the settlement and economy of the American West. It brought the western states and territories into alignment with the northern Union states and made transporting passengers and goods coast-to-coast considerably quicker, safer and less expensive.

The first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad&#x27;s original western terminus at the Alameda Terminal on September 6, 1869, where they transferred to the steamer &quot;Alameda&quot; for transport across the Bay to San Francisco. The road&#x27;s rail terminus was moved two months later to the Oakland Long Wharf, about a mile to the north, when its expansion was completed and opened for passengers on November 8, 1869. Service between San Francisco and Oakland Pier continued to be provided by ferry.

The CPRR eventually purchased of UPRR-built grade from Promontory Summit (MP 828) to Ogden, Utah Territory (MP 881), which became the interchange point between trains of the two roads. The transcontinental line became popularly known as the &quot;Overland Route&quot; after the name of the principal passenger rail service to Chicago that operated over the length of the line until 1962.

==Overall significance==
Railroads not only increased the speed of transport, they also dramatically lowered its cost. The first transcontinental railroad resulted in passengers and freight being able to cross the country in a matter of days instead of months and at one tenth the cost of stagecoach or wagon transport. With economical transportation in the West (which had been referred to as the Great American Desert) now farming, ranching and mining could be done at a profit. As a result, railroads transformed the country, particularly the West (which had few navigable rivers).

For example, before the railroads were built in the West, if a farmer were to ship a load of corn only 200 miles to Chicago, the shipping cost by wagon would exceed the price for which the corn could be sold. So, under such circumstances, farming could not be done at a profit. Mining and other economic activity in the West were similarly inhibited because of the high cost of wagon transportation. One Congressman referring to the West, bluntly stated that “All that land wasn’t worth ten cents until the railroads came.”

Freight rates by rail were a small fraction of what they had been with wagon transport. When the United States bought the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, people thought that it would take 300 years to populate it. With the introduction of the railroad, it took only 30 years. The low cost of shipping by rail resulted in the Great American Desert becoming the great American breadbasket. 

==Origins==
Among the early proponents of building a railroad line that would connect the coasts of the United States was Dr. Hartwell Carver, who in 1847 submitted to the U.S. Congress a &quot;Proposal for a Charter to Build a Railroad from Lake Michigan to the Pacific Ocean&quot;, seeking a congressional charter to support his idea.

===Preliminary exploration===
Congress agreed to support the idea. Under the direction of the Department of War, the Pacific Railroad Surveys were conducted from 1853 through 1855. These included an extensive series of expeditions of the American West seeking possible routes. A report on the explorations described alternative routes and included an immense amount of information about the American West, covering at least . It included the region&#x27;s natural history and illustrations of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.

The report did not include detailed topographic maps of potential routes needed to estimate the feasibility, cost and select the best route. However, the survey was detailed enough to determine that the best southern route lay south of the Gila River boundary with Mexico in mostly vacant desert, through the future territories of Arizona and New Mexico. This in part motivated the United States to complete the Gadsden Purchase.

In 1856, the Select Committee on the Pacific Railroad and Telegraph of the US House of Representatives published a report recommending support for a proposed Pacific railroad bill:

===Possible routes===
The U.S. Congress was strongly divided on where the eastern terminus of the railroad should be—in a southern or northern city. Three routes were considered:
* A northern route roughly along the Missouri River through present-day northern Montana to Oregon Territory. This was considered impractical because of the rough terrain and extensive winter snows.
* A central route following the Platte River in Nebraska through to the South Pass in Wyoming, following most of the Oregon Trail. Snow on this route remained a concern.
* A southern route across Texas, New Mexico Territory, the Sonora desert, connecting to Los Angeles, California. Surveyors found during an 1848 survey that the best route lay south of the border between the United States and Mexico. This was resolved by the Gadsden Purchase in 1853.

Once the central route was chosen, it was immediately obvious that the western terminus should be Sacramento. But there was considerable difference of opinion about the eastern terminus. Three locations along of Missouri River were considered:
* St. Joseph, Missouri, accessed via the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad.
* Kansas City, Kansas / Leavenworth, Kansas, accessed via the Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad, controlled by Thomas Ewing Jr. and later by John C. Frémont.
* Council Bluffs, Iowa / Omaha, Nebraska, accessed via an extension of Union Pacific financier Thomas C. Durant&#x27;s proposed Mississippi and Missouri Railroad and the new Union Pacific Railroad, also controlled by Durant.

Council Bluffs had several advantages: It was well north of the Civil War fighting in Missouri; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement. Durant had hired the future president Abraham Lincoln in 1857 when he was an attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri. Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus, and he relied on Durant&#x27;s counsel. Durant advocated for Omaha, and he was so confident of the choice that he began buying up land in Nebraska.

==Key people==
===Asa Whitney===
One of the most prominent champions of the central route railroad was Asa Whitney. He envisioned a route from Chicago and the Great Lakes to northern California, paid for by the sale of land to settlers along the route. Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians, printed maps and pamphlets, and submitted several proposals to Congress, all at his own expense. In June 1845, he led a team along part of the proposed route to assess its feasibility.

Legislation to begin construction of the &quot;Pacific Railroad&quot; (called the &quot;Memorial of Asa Whitney&quot;) was first introduced to Congress by Representative Zadock Pratt. Congress did not immediately act on Whitney&#x27;s proposal.

===Theodore Judah===

Theodore Judah was a fervent supporter of the central route railroad. He lobbied vigorously in favor of the project and undertook the survey of the route through the rugged Sierra Nevada, one of the chief obstacles of the project.

In 1852, Judah was chief engineer for the newly formed Sacramento Valley Railroad, the first railroad built west of the Mississippi River. Although the railroad later went bankrupt once the easy placer gold deposits around Placerville, California, were depleted, Judah was convinced that a properly financed railroad could pass from Sacramento through the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach the Great Basin and hook up with rail lines coming from the East.

In 1856, Judah wrote a 13,000-word proposal in support of a Pacific railroad and distributed it to Cabinet secretaries, congressmen and other influential people. In September 1859, Judah was chosen to be the accredited lobbyist for the Pacific Railroad Convention, which indeed approved his plan to survey, finance and engineer the road. Judah returned to Washington in December 1859. He had a lobbying office in the United States Capitol, received an audience with President James Buchanan, and represented the Convention before Congress.

Judah returned to California in 1860. He continued to search for a more practical route through the Sierra suitable for a railroad. In mid-1860, local miner Daniel Strong had surveyed a route over the Sierra for a wagon toll road, which he realized would also suit a railroad. He described his discovery in a letter to Judah. Also in 1860, Charles Marsh, a surveyor, civil engineer and water company owner, met with civil engineer Judah. Marsh, who had already surveyed a potential railroad route between Sacramento and Nevada City, California, a decade earlier, went with Judah into the Sierra Nevada Mountains. There they examined the Henness Pass Turnpike Company&#x27;s route (Marsh was a founding director of that company). They measured elevations and distances and discussed the possibility of a transcontinental railroad. Both were convinced that it could be done. Judah, Marsh and Strong then met with merchants and businessmen to solicit investors in their proposed railroad.

From January or February 1861 until July, Judah and Strong led a 10-person expedition to survey the route for the railroad over the Sierra Nevada through Clipper Gap and Emigrant Gap, over Donner Pass, and south to Truckee. They discovered a way across the Sierras that was gradual enough to be made suitable for a railroad, although it still needed a lot of work.

===The Big Four===

Four northern California businessmen formed the Central Pacific Railroad: Leland Stanford, (1824–1893), President; Collis Potter Huntington, (1821–1900), Vice President; Mark Hopkins, (1813–1878), Treasurer; Charles Crocker, (1822–1888), Construction Supervisor. All became substantially wealthy from their association with the railroad. Judah, Marsh, Strong, Stanford, Huntington, Hopkins and Crocker, along with James Bailey and Lucius Anson Booth, became the first board of directors of the Central Pacific Railroad.
===Thomas Durant===

Former ophthalmologist Dr. Thomas Clark &quot;Doc&quot; Durant was nominally only a vice president of Union Pacific, so he installed a series of respected men like John Adams Dix as president of the railroad. While serving as vice president of Union Pacific he would be a key figure in the Crédit Mobilier scandal which ultimately led to his removal from the company.

===Grenville M. Dodge===
Major General Grenville M. Dodge served as the chief engineer of Union Pacific during the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad. In 1865 while fighting against Native-American tribes he would discover a pass in the Laramie Mountains, which would serve as a vital passage for the First Transcontinental Railroad. Dodge would serve in the United States House of Representatives for Iowa&#x27;s 5th District from 1867 until 1869. During this time he would push for legislation to help the construction of the railroad.

==Authorization and funding==
In February 1860, Iowa Representative Samuel Curtis introduced a bill to fund the railroad. It passed the House but died when it could not be reconciled with the Senate version because of opposition from southern states who wanted a southern route near the 42nd parallel. Curtis tried and failed again in 1861. After the southern states seceded from the Union, the House of Representatives approved the bill on May 6, 1862, and the Senate on June 20. Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 into law on July 1. It authorized creation of two companies, the Central Pacific in the west and the Union Pacific in the mid-west, to build the railroad. The legislation called for building and operating a new railroad from the Missouri River at Council Bluffs, Iowa, west to Sacramento, California, and on to San Francisco Bay. Another act to supplement the first was passed in 1864. The Pacific Railroad Act of 1863 established the standard gauge to be used in these federally financed railways.

===Federal financing===
To finance the project, the act authorized the federal government to issue 30-year U.S. government bonds (at 6% interest). The railroad companies were paid $16,000 per mile (approximately $ per mile today) for track laid on a level grade, $32,000 per mile (about $ per mile today) for track laid in foothills, and $48,000 per mile (or about $ per mile today) for track laid in mountains. The two railroad companies sold similar amounts of company-backed bonds and stock.

===Union Pacific financing===
While the federal legislation for the Union Pacific required that no partner was to own more than 10 percent of the stock, the Union Pacific had problems selling its stock. One of the few subscribers was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints leader Brigham Young, who also supplied crews for building much of the railroad through Utah.

Durant manipulated market prices on his stocks by spreading rumors about which railroads he had an interest in were being considered for connection with the Union Pacific. First he touted rumors that his fledgling M&amp;M Railroad had a deal in the works, while secretly buying stock in the depressed Cedar Rapids and Missouri Railroad. Then he circulated rumors that the CR&amp;M had plans to connect to the Union Pacific, at which point he began buying back the M&amp;M stock at depressed prices. It is estimated his scams produced over $5 million in profits for him and his cohorts.

===Central Pacific financing===
Collis Huntington, a Sacramento hardware merchant, heard Judah&#x27;s presentation about the railroad at the St. Charles Hotel in November 1860. He invited Judah to his office to hear his proposal in detail. Huntington persuaded Judah to accept financing from himself and four others: Mark Hopkins, his business partner; James Bailey, a jeweler; Leland Stanford, a grocer; and Charles Crocker, a dry-goods merchant. They initially invested $1,500 each and formed a board of directors. These investors became known as The Big Four, and their railroad was called the Central Pacific Railroad. Each eventually made millions of dollars from their investments and control of the Central Pacific Railroad.

Before major construction could begin, Judah traveled back to New York City to raise funds to buy out The Big Four. Shortly after arriving in New York, Judah died on November 2, 1863, of yellow fever that he had contracted while traveling over the Panama Railroad&#x27;s transit of the Isthmus of Panama. The CPRR Engineering Department was taken over by his successor Samuel S. Montegue, as well as Canadian trained Chief Assistant Engineer (later Acting Chief Engineer) Lewis Metzler Clement who also became Superintendent of Track.

===Land grants===
To allow the companies to raise additional capital, Congress granted the railroads a right-of-way corridor, lands for additional facilities like sidings and maintenance yards. They were also granted alternate sections of government-owned lands— per mile (1.6 km)—for on both sides of the track, forming a checkerboard pattern. The railroad companies were given the odd-numbered sections while the federal government retained the even-numbered sections. The exception was in cities, at rivers, or on non-government property. The railroads sold bonds based on the value of the lands, and in areas with good land like the Sacramento Valley and Nebraska sold the land to settlers, contributing to a rapid settlement of the West. The total area of the land grants to the Union Pacific and Central Pacific was larger than the area of the state of Texas: federal government land grants totaled about 130,000,000 acres, and state government land grants totaled about 50,000,000 acres.

It was far from a given that the railroads operating in the thinly-settled west would make enough money to repay their construction and operation. If the railroad companies failed to sell the land granted them within three years, they were required to sell it at prevailing government price for homesteads: . If they failed to repay the bonds, all remaining railroad property, including trains and tracks, would revert to the U.S. government. To encourage settlement in the west, Congress (1861–1863) passed the Homestead Acts which granted an applicant of land with the requirement that the applicant improve the land. This incentive encouraged thousands of settlers to move west.

In return for the land grants, the railroads were required to haul government personnel and cargo at significantly reduced rates (generally half of the normal rate). In addition, the land was granted in a checkerboard fashion, with the government retaining every other section. The land that the government retained typically doubled in value as a result of the railroad being built. The land grants were a good deal for the government.

The government guaranteed loans to several Pacific railroads, which were all paid off by 1899 ($63 million in principal, and $105 million in interest). After receiving rate discounts of approximately 50% on government personnel and cargo for 80 years (including during two world wars), Congress finally discontinued the rate reductions at the end of World War II. The land grants had been more than paid for (several times over).

===Railroad self-dealing===
The federal legislation lacked adequate oversight and accountability. The two companies took advantage of these weaknesses in the legislation to manipulate the project and produce extra profit for themselves. Despite the generous subsidies offered by the federal government, the railroad capitalists knew they would not turn a profit on the railroad business for many months, possibly years. They determined to make a profit on the construction itself. Both groups of financiers formed independent companies to complete the project, and they controlled management of the new companies along with the railroad ventures. This self-dealing allowed them to build in generous profit margins paid out by the railroad companies. In the west, the four men heading the Central Pacific chose a simple name for their company, the &quot;Contract and Finance Company.&quot; In the east, the Union Pacific selected a foreign name, calling their construction firm &quot;Crédit Mobilier of America.&quot; The latter company was later implicated in a far-reaching scandal which would greatly effect the railroads purpose, described later.

Also, the lack of federal oversight provided both companies with incentives to continue building their railroads past one other, since they were each being paid, and receiving land grants, based on how many miles of track they laid, even though only one track would eventually be used. This tacitly-agreed profiteering activity was captured (probably accidentally) by Union Pacific photographer Andrew J. Russell in his images of the Promontory Trestle construction.

===Labor and wages===

Many of the civil engineers and surveyors who were hired by the Union Pacific had been employed during the American Civil War to repair and operate the over of railroad line the U.S. Military Railroad controlled by the end of the war. The Union Pacific also utilized their experience repairing and building truss bridges during the war. Most of the semi-skilled workers on the Union Pacific were recruited from the many soldiers discharged from the Union and Confederate armies along with emigrant Irishmen.
After 1864, the Central Pacific Railroad received the same Federal financial incentives as the Union Pacific Railroad, along with some construction bonds granted by the state of California and the city of San Francisco. The Central Pacific hired some Canadian and European civil engineers and surveyors with extensive experience building railroads, but it had a difficult time finding semi-skilled labor. Most Caucasians in California preferred to work in the mines or agriculture. The railroad experimented by hiring local emigrant Chinese as manual laborers, many of whom were escaping the poverty and terrors of the war (especially the Punti–Hakka Clan Wars) in the Sze Yup districts in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong province in China. When they proved themselves as workers, the CPRR from that point forward preferred to hire Chinese, and even set up recruiting efforts in Canton. Despite their small stature and lack of experience, the Chinese laborers were responsible for most of the heavy manual labor since only a very limited amount of that work could be done by animals, simple machines, or black powder. The railroad also hired some black people escaping the aftermath of the American Civil War. Most of the black and white workers were paid $30 per month and given food and lodging. Most Chinese were initially paid $31 per month and provided lodging, but they preferred to cook their own meals. In 1867 the CPRR raised their wage to $35 (equivalent to $ in ) per month after a strike. CPRR came to see the advantage of good workers employed at low wages: &quot;Chinese labor proved to be Central Pacific&#x27;s salvation.&quot;

==Transcontinental route==
===Construction begun===
The Central Pacific broke ground on January 8, 1863. Because of insufficient transportation alternatives from the manufacturing centers on the east coast, virtually all of their tools and machinery including rails, railroad switches, railroad turntables, freight and passenger cars, and steam locomotives were transported first by train to east coast ports. They were then loaded on ships which either sailed around South America&#x27;s Cape Horn, or offloaded the cargo at the Isthmus of Panama, where it was sent across via paddle steamer and the Panama Railroad. The Panama Railroad gauge was , which was incompatible with the gauge used by the CPRR equipment. The latter route was about twice as expensive per pound. Once the machinery and tools reached the San Francisco Bay area, they were put aboard river paddle steamers which transported them up the final of the Sacramento River to the new state capital in Sacramento. Many of these steam engines, railroad cars, and other machinery were shipped dismantled and had to be reassembled. Wooden timbers for railroad ties, trestles, bridges, firewood, and telegraph poles were harvested in California and transported to the project site.

The Union Pacific Railroad did not start construction for another 18 months until July 1865. They were delayed by difficulties obtaining financial backing and the unavailability of workers and materials due to the Civil War. Their start point in the new city of Omaha, Nebraska, was not yet connected via railroad to Council Bluffs, Iowa. Equipment needed to begin work was initially delivered to Omaha and Council Bluffs by paddle steamers on the Missouri River. The Union Pacific was so slow in beginning construction during 1865 that they sold two of the four steam locomotives they had purchased.

After the American Civil War ended in 1865, the Union Pacific still competed for railroad supplies with companies who were building or repairing railroads in the south, and prices rose.

===Rail standards===
At that time in the United States, there were two primary standards for track gauge, as defined by the distance between the two rails. In Britain, the gauge was , and this had been adopted by the majority of northern railways. However, much of the south had adopted a gauge. Transferring railway cars across a break of gauge required changing out the trucks. Alternatively, cargo was offloaded and reloaded, a time-consuming effort that delayed cargo shipments. For the transcontinental railroad, the builders adopted what is now known as the standard gauge.

The Bessemer process and open hearth furnace steel-making were in use by 1865, but the advantages of steel rails which lasted much longer than iron rails had not yet been demonstrated. The rails used initially in building the railway were nearly all made of an iron flat-bottomed modified I-beam profile weighing . The railroad companies were intent on completing the project as rapidly as possible at a minimum cost. Within a few years, nearly all railroads converted to steel rails.

===Time zones and telegraph usage===
Time was not standardized across the United States and Canada until November 18, 1883. In 1865, each railroad set its own time to minimize scheduling errors. To communicate easily up and down the line, the railroads built telegraph lines alongside the tracks. These lines eventually superseded the original First Transcontinental Telegraph which followed much of the Mormon Trail up the North Platte River and across the very thinly populated Central Nevada Route through central Utah and Nevada. The telegraph lines along the railroad were easier to protect and maintain. Many of the original telegraph lines were abandoned as the telegraph business was consolidated with the railroad telegraph lines.

===Union Pacific route===

The Union Pacific&#x27;s of track started at MP 0.0 in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on the eastern side of the Missouri River. Omaha was chosen by President Abraham Lincoln as the location of its Transfer Depot where up to seven railroads could transfer mail and other goods to Union Pacific trains bound for the west.

Trains were initially transported across the Missouri River by ferry before they could access the western tracks beginning in Omaha, Nebraska Territory. The river froze in the winter, and the ferries were replaced by sleighs. A bridge was not built until 1872, when the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge was completed.

After the rail line&#x27;s initial climb through the Missouri River bluffs west of Omaha and out of the Missouri River Valley, the route bridged the Elkhorn River and then crossed over the new Loup River bridge as it followed the north side of the Platte River valley west through Nebraska along the general path of the Oregon, Mormon and California Trails.

By December 1865, the Union Pacific had only completed of track, reaching Fremont, Nebraska, and a further of roadbed.

At the end of 1865, Peter A. Dey, Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific, resigned over a routing dispute with Thomas C. Durant, one of the chief financiers of the Union Pacific.

With the end of the Civil War and increased government supervision in the offing, Durant hired his former M&amp;M engineer Grenville M. Dodge to build the railroad, and the Union Pacific began a mad dash west.

Former Union General John &quot;Jack&quot; Casement was hired as the new Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific. He equipped several railroad cars to serve as portable bunkhouses for the workers and gathered men and supplies to push the railroad rapidly west. Among the bunkhouses, Casement added a galley car to prepare meals, and he even provided for a herd of cows to be moved with the railhead and bunk cars to provide fresh meat. Hunters were hired to provide buffalo meat from the large herds of American bison.

The small survey parties who scouted ahead to locate the roadbed were sometimes attacked and killed by raiding Native Americans. In response, the U.S. Army instituted active cavalry patrols that grew larger as the Native Americans grew more aggressive. Temporary, &quot;Hell on wheels&quot; towns, made mostly of canvas tents, accompanied the railroad as construction headed west.

The Platte River was too shallow and meandering to provide river transport, but the Platte river valley headed west and sloped up gradually at about , often allowing to lay a mile (1.6 km) of track a day or more in 1866 as the Union Pacific finally started moving rapidly west. Building bridges to cross creeks and rivers was the main source of delays. Near where the Platte River splits into the North Platte River and South Platte River, the railroad bridged the North Platte River over a bridge (nicknamed ½ mile bridge). It was built across the shallow but wide North Platte resting on piles driven by steam pile drivers. Here they built the &quot;railroad&quot; town of North Platte, Nebraska, in December 1866 after completing about of track that year. In late 1866, former Major General Grenville M. Dodge was appointed Chief Engineer on the Union Pacific, but hard-working General &quot;Jack&quot; Casement continued to work as chief construction &quot;boss&quot; and his brother Daniel Casement continued as a financial officer.

The original emigrant route across Wyoming of the Oregon, Mormon and California Trails, after progressing up the Platte River valley, went up the North Platte River valley through Casper, Wyoming, along the Sweetwater River and over the Continental Divide at the South Pass. The original westward travelers in their ox and mule pulled wagons tried to stick to river valleys to avoid as much road building as possible—gradients and sharp corners were usually of little or no concern to them. The ox and mule pulled wagons were the original off-road vehicles in their day since nearly all of the Emigrant Trails went cross country over rough, unimproved trails. The route over South Pass&#x27;s main advantage for wagons pulled by oxen or mules was a shorter elevation over an &quot;easy&quot; pass to cross and its &quot;easy&quot; connection to nearby river valleys on both sides of the continental divide for water and grass. The emigrant trails were closed in winter. The North Platte–South Pass route was far less beneficial for a railroad, as it was about longer and much more expensive to construct up the narrow, steep and rocky canyons of the North Platte. The route along the North Platte was also further from Denver, Colorado, and went across difficult terrain, while a railroad connection to that City was already being planned for and surveyed.

Efforts to survey a new, shorter, &quot;better&quot; route had been underway since 1864. By 1867, a new route was found and surveyed that went along part of the South Platte River in western Nebraska and after entering what is now the state of Wyoming, ascended a gradual sloping ridge between Lodgepole Creek and Crow Creek to the Evans pass (also called Sherman&#x27;s Pass) which was discovered by the Union Pacific employed English surveyor and engineer, James Evans, in about 1864. This pass now is marked by the Ames Monument () marking its significance and commemorating two of the main backers of the Union Pacific Railroad. From North Platte, Nebraska (elevation ), the railroad proceeded westward and upward along a new path across the Nebraska Territory and Wyoming Territory (then part of the Dakota Territory) along the north bank of the South Platte River and into what would become the state of Wyoming at Lone Pine, Wyoming. Evans Pass was located between what would become the new &quot;railroad&quot; towns of Cheyenne and Laramie. Connecting to this pass, about west of Cheyenne, was the one place across the Laramie Mountains that had a narrow &quot;guitar neck&quot; of land that crossed the mountains without serious erosion at the so-called &quot;gangplank&quot; () discovered by Major General Grenville Dodge in 1865 when he was in the U.S. Army. The new route surveyed across Wyoming was over shorter, had a flatter profile, allowing for cheaper and easier railroad construction, and also went closer by Denver and the known coalfields in the Wasatch and Laramie Ranges.

The railroad gained about in the climb to Cheyenne from North Platte, Nebraska—about —a very gentle slope of less than one degree average. This &quot;new&quot; route had never become an emigrant route because it lacked the water and grass to feed the emigrants&#x27; oxen and mules. Steam locomotives did not need grass, and the railroad companies could drill wells for water if necessary.

Coal had been discovered in Wyoming and reported on by John C. Frémont in his 1843 expedition across Wyoming, and was already being exploited by Utah residents from towns like Coalville, Utah, and later Kemmerer, Wyoming, by the time the Transcontinental railroad was built. Union Pacific needed coal to fuel its steam locomotives on the almost treeless plains across Nebraska and Wyoming. Coal shipments by rail were also looked on as a potentially major source of income—this potential is still being realized.
The Union Pacific reached the new railroad town of Cheyenne in December 1867, having laid about that year. They paused over the winter, preparing to push the track over Evans (Sherman&#x27;s) Pass. At , Evans Pass was the highest point reached on the transcontinental railroad. About beyond Evans pass, the railroad had to build an extensive bridge over the Dale Creek canyon (). The Dale Creek Crossing was one of their more difficult railroad engineering challenges. Dale Creek Bridge was long and above Dale Creek. The bridge components were pre-built of timber in Chicago, Illinois, and then shipped on rail cars to Dale Creek for assembly. The eastern and western approaches to the bridge site, near the highest elevation on the transcontinental railroad, required cutting through granite for nearly a mile on each side. The initial Dale Creek bridge had a train speed limit of per hour across the bridge. Beyond Dale Creek, railroad construction paused at what became the town of Laramie, Wyoming, to build a bridge across the Laramie River.

Located from Evans pass, Union Pacific connected the new &quot;railroad&quot; town of Cheyenne to Denver and its Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company railroad line in 1870. Elevated above sea level, and sitting on the new Union Pacific route with a connection to Denver, Cheyenne was chosen to become a major railroad center and was equipped with extensive railroad yards, maintenance facilities, and a Union Pacific presence. Its location made it a good base for helper locomotives to couple to trains with snowplows to help clear the tracks of snow or help haul heavy freight over Evans pass. The Union Pacific&#x27;s junction with the Denver Railroad with its connection to Kansas City, Kansas, Kansas City, Missouri, and the railroads east of the Missouri River again increased Cheyenne&#x27;s importance as the junction of two major railroads. Cheyenne later became Wyoming&#x27;s largest city and the capital of the new state of Wyoming.

The railroad established many townships along the way: Fremont, Elkhorn, Grand Island, North Platte, Ogallala and Sidney as the railroad followed the Platte River across Nebraska territory. The railroad even dipped into what would become the new state of Colorado after crossing the North Platte River as it followed the South Platte River west into what would become Julesburg before turning northwest along Lodgepole Creek into Wyoming. In the Dakota Territory (Wyoming) the new towns of Cheyenne, Laramie, Rawlins (named for Union General John Aaron Rawlins, who camped in the locality in 1867), Green River and Evanston (named after James Evans) were established, as well as much more fuel and water stops. The Green River was crossed with a new bridge, and the new &quot;railroad&quot; town of Green River constructed there after the tracks reached the Green River on October 1, 1868—the last big river to cross.

On December 4, 1868, the Union Pacific reached Evanston, having laid almost of track over the Green River and the Laramie Plains that year. By 1871, Evanston became a significant maintenance shop town equipped to carry out extensive repairs on the cars and steam locomotives.

In the Utah Territory, the railroad once again diverted from the main emigrant trails to cross the Wasatch Mountains and went down the rugged Echo Canyon (Summit County, Utah) and Weber River canyon. To speed up construction as much as possible, Union Pacific contracted several thousand Mormon workers to cut, fill, trestle, bridge, blast and tunnel its way down the rugged Weber River Canyon to Ogden, Utah, ahead of the railroad construction. The Mormon and Union Pacific rail work was joined in the area of the present-day border between Utah and Wyoming. The longest of four tunnels built in Weber Canyon was Tunnel 2. Work on this tunnel started in October 1868 and was completed six months later. Temporary tracks were laid around it and Tunnels 3 (), 4 () and 5 () to continue work on the tracks west of the tunnels.

The tunnels were all made with the new dangerous nitroglycerine explosive, which expedited work but caused some fatal accidents. While building the railroad along the rugged Weber River Canyon, Mormon workers signed the Thousand Mile Tree which was a lone tree alongside the track from Omaha. A historic marker has been placed there.

The tracks reached Ogden, Utah, on March 8, 1869, although finishing work would continue on the tracks, tunnels and bridges in Weber Canyon for over a year. From Ogden, the railroad went north of the Great Salt Lake to Brigham City and Corinne using Mormon workers, before finally connecting with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Summit in Utah territory on May 10, 1869. Some Union Pacific officers declined to pay the Mormons all of the agreed upon construction costs of the work through Weber Canyon, and beyond, claiming Union Pacific poverty despite the millions they had extracted through the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal. Only partial payment was secured through court actions against Union Pacific.

===Central Pacific route===

The Central Pacific laid of track, starting in Sacramento, California, in 1863 and continuing over the rugged Sierra Nevada mountains at Donner Pass into the new state of Nevada. The elevation change from Sacramento (elev. ) to Donner Summit (elev. ) had to be accomplished in about with an average elevation change of 76 feet per mile (14 meters per km), and there were only a few places in the Sierra where this type of &quot;ramp&quot; existed. The discovery and detailed map survey with profiles and elevations of this route over the Sierra Nevada is credited to Theodore Judah, chief engineer of the Central Pacific Railroad until his death in 1863. This route is up a ridge between the North fork of the American River on the south and Bear and South Yuba Rivers on the north. As the railroad climbed out of Sacramento up to Donner Summit, there was only one section near &quot;Cape Horn CPRR&quot; where the railroad grade slightly exceeded two percent.
In June 1864, the Central Pacific railroad entrepreneurs opened Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road (DFDLWR). Costing about $300,000 and a years worth of work, this toll road wagon route was opened over much of the route the Central Pacific railroad (CPRR) would use over Donner Summit to carry freight and passengers needed by the CPRR and to carry other cargo over their toll road to and from the ever-advancing railhead and over the Sierra to the gold and silver mining towns of Nevada. As the railroad advanced, their freight rates with the combined rail and wagon shipments would become much more competitive. The volume of the toll road freight traffic to Nevada was estimated to be about $13,000,000 a year as the Comstock Lode boomed, and getting even part of this freight traffic would help pay for the railroad construction. When the railroad reached Reno, it had the majority of all Nevada freight shipments, and the price of goods in Nevada dropped significantly as the freight charges to Nevada dropped significantly. The rail route over the Sierras followed the general route of the Truckee branch of the California Trail, going east over Donner Pass and down the rugged Truckee River valley.

The route over the Sierra had been plotted out by Judah in preliminary surveys before his death in 1863. Judah&#x27;s deputy, Samuel S. Montague was appointed as Central Pacific&#x27;s new Chief Engineer, with Lewis M. Clement as Assistant Chief Engineer and Charles Cadwalader as second assistant. To build the new railroad, detailed surveys had to be run that showed where the cuts, fills, trestles, bridges and tunnels would have to be built. Work that was identified as taking a long time was started as soon as its projected track location could be ascertained and work crews, supplies and road work equipment found to be sent ahead. Tunnels, trestles and bridges were nearly all built this way. The spread-out nature of the work resulted in the work being split into two divisions, with L. M. Clement taking the upper division from Blue Cañon to Truckee and Cadwalader taking the lower division from Truckee to the Nevada border. Other assistant engineers were assigned to specific tasks such as building a bridge, tunnel or trestle which was done by the workers under experienced supervisors.
In total, the Central Pacific had eleven tunnel projects (Nos. 3 through 13) under construction in the Sierra from 1865 to 1868, with seven tunnels located in a stretch on the east side of Donner Summit. The tunnels were usually built by drilling a series of holes in the tunnel face, filling them with black powder and detonating it to break the rock free. The black powder was provided by the California Powder Works near Santa Cruz, California. These works had started production in 1864 after the American Civil War had cut off shipments of black powder from the East to the mining and railroad industry of California and Nevada. The Central Pacific was a prolific user of black powder, often using up to 500 kegs of per day.

The summit tunnel (Number 6), , was started in late 1865, well ahead of the railhead. Through solid granite, the summit tunnel progressed at a rate of only about per day per face as it was being worked by three eight-hour shifts of workers, hand drilling holes with a rock drill and hammer, filling them with black powder and trying to blast the granite loose. One crew worked drilling holes on the faces and another crew collected and removed the loosened rock after each explosion. The workers were pulled off the summit tunnel and the track grading east of Donner Pass in the winter of 1865–1866 as there was no way to supply them, nor quarters they could have lived in. The crews were transferred to work on bridges and track grading on the Truckee River canyon.
In 1866, they put in a vertical shaft in the center of the summit tunnel and started work towards the east and west tunnel faces, giving four working faces on the summit tunnel to speed up progress. A steam engine off an old locomotive was brought up with much effort over the wagon road and used as a winch driver to help remove loosened rock from the vertical shaft and two working faces. By the winter of 1866–67, work had progressed sufficiently and a camp had been built for workers on the summit tunnel which allowed work to continue. The cross section of a tunnel face was a , oval with an vertical wall. Progress on the tunnel sped up to over per day per face when they started using the newly invented nitroglycerin—manufactured near the tunnel. They used nitroglycerin to deepen the summit tunnel to the required height after the four tunnel faces met, and made even faster progress. Nearly all other tunnels were worked on both tunnel faces and met in the middle. Depending on the material the tunnels penetrated, they were left unlined or lined with brick, rock walls or timber and post. Some tunnels were designed to bend in the middle to align with the track bed curvature. Despite this potential complication, nearly all the different tunnel center lines met within or so. The detailed survey work that made these tunnel digs as precise as required was nearly all done by the Canadian-born and -trained Lewis Clement, the CPRR&#x27;s Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track, and his assistants.

Hills or ridges in front of the railroad road bed would have to have a flat-bottomed, V-shaped &quot;cut&quot; made to get the railroad through the ridge or hill. The type of material determined the slope of the V and how much material would have to be removed. Ideally, these cuts would be matched with valley fills that could use the dug out material to bring the road bed up to grade—cut and fill construction. In the 1860s there was no heavy equipment that could be used to make these cuts or haul it away to make the fills. The options were to dig it out by pick and shovel, haul the hillside material by wheelbarrow and/or horse or mule cart or blast it loose. To blast a V-shaped cut out, they had to drill several holes up to deep in the material, fill them with black powder, and blast the material away. Since the Central Pacific was in a hurry, they were profligate users of black powder to blast their way through the hills. The only disadvantage came when a nearby valley needed fill to get across it. The explosive technique often blew most of the potential fill material down the hillside, making it unavailable for fill. Initially, many valleys were bridged by &quot;temporary&quot; trestles that could be rapidly built and were later replaced by much lower maintenance and permanent solid fill. The existing railroad made transporting and putting material in valleys much easier—load it on railway dump cars, haul where needed and dump it over the side of the trestle.
The route down the eastern Sierras was done on the south side of Donner Lake with a series of switchbacks carved into the mountain. The Truckee River, which drains Lake Tahoe, had already found and scoured out the best route across the Carson Range of mountains east of the Sierras. The route down the rugged Truckee River Canyon, including required bridges, was done ahead of the main summit tunnel completion. To expedite the building of the railroad through the Truckee River canyon, the Central Pacific hauled two small locomotives, railcars, rails and other material on wagons and sleighs to what is now Truckee, California, and worked the winter of 1867–68 on their way down Truckee canyon ahead of the tracks being completed to Truckee. In Truckee canyon, five Howe truss bridges had to be built. This gave them a head start on getting to the &quot;easy&quot; miles across Nevada.

In order to keep the higher portions of the Sierra grade open in the winter, of timber snow sheds were built between Blue Cañon and Truckee in addition to utilizing snowplows pushed by locomotives, as well as manual shovelling. With the advent of more efficient oil fired steam and later diesel electric power to drive plows, flangers, spreaders, and rotary snow plows, most of the wooden snowsheds have long since been removed as obsolete. Tunnels 1–5 and Tunnel 13 of the original 1860s tunnels on Track 1 of the Sierra grade remain in use today, while additional new tunnels were later driven when the grade was double tracked over the first quarter of the twentieth century. In 1993, the Southern Pacific Railroad (which operated the CPRR-built Oakland–Ogden line until its 1996 merger with the Union Pacific) closed and pulled up the section of Track #1 over the summit running between the Norden complex (Shed 26, MP 192.1) and the covered crossovers in Shed #47 (MP 198.8) about a mile east of the old flyover at Eder, bypassing and abandoning the tunnel 6–8 complex, the concrete snowsheds just beyond them, and tunnels 9–12 ending at MP 195.7, all of which had been located on Track 1 within two miles of the summit. Since then all east- and westbound traffic has been run over the Track #2 grade crossing the summit about south of Donner Pass through the Tunnel #41 (&quot;The Big Hole&quot;) running under Mt. Judah between Soda Springs and Eder, which was opened in 1925 when the summit section of the grade was double tracked. This routing change was made because the Track 2 and Tunnel 41 Summit crossing is far easier and less expensive to maintain and keep open in the harsh Sierra winters.

On June 18, 1868, the Central Pacific reached Reno, Nevada, after completing of railroad up and over the Sierras from Sacramento, California. By then the railroad had already been prebuilt down the Truckee River on the much flatter land from Reno to Wadsworth, Nevada, where they bridged the Truckee for the last time. From there, they struggled across a forty mile desert to the end of the Humboldt river at the Humboldt Sink. From the end of the Humboldt, they continued east over the Great Basin Desert bordering the Humboldt River to Wells, Nevada. One of the most troublesome problems found on this route along the Humboldt was at Palisade Canyon (near Carlin, Nevada), where for the line had to be built between the river and basalt cliffs. From Wells, Nevada, to Promontory Summit, the Railroad left the Humboldt and proceeded across the Nevada and Utah desert. Water for the steam locomotives was provided by wells, springs, or pipelines to nearby water sources. Water was often pumped into the water tanks with windmills. Train fuel and water cranes for the early trains with steam locomotives may have been as often as every . On one memorable occasion, not far from Promontory, the Central Pacific crews organized an army of workers and five train loads of construction material, and laid of track on a prepared rail bed in one day—a record that still stands today. The Central Pacific and Union Pacific raced to get as much track laid as possible, and the Central Pacific laid about of track from Reno to Promontory Summit in the one year before the Last Spike was driven on May 10, 1869.

Central Pacific had 1,694 freight cars available by May 1869, with more under construction in their Sacramento yard. Major repairs and maintenance on the Central Pacific rolling stock was done in their Sacramento maintenance yard. Near the end of 1869, Central Pacific had 162 locomotives, of which 2 had two drivers (drive wheels), 110 had four drivers, and 50 had six drivers. The steam locomotives had been purchased in the eastern states and shipped to California by sea. Thirty-six additional locomotives were built and coming west, and twenty-eight more were under construction. There was a shortage of passenger cars and more had to be ordered. The first Central Pacific sleeper, the &quot;Silver Palace Sleeping Car&quot;, arrived at Sacramento on June 8, 1868.

The CPRR route passed through Newcastle and Truckee in California, Reno, Wadsworth, Winnemucca, Battle Mountain, Elko and Wells in Nevada (with many more fuel and water stops), before connecting with the Union Pacific line at Promontory Summit in the Utah Territory. When the eastern end of the CPRR was extended to Ogden by purchasing the Union Pacific Railroad line from Promontory for about $2.8 million in 1870, it ended the short period of a boom town for Promontory, extended the Central Pacific tracks about and made Ogden a major terminus on the transcontinental railroad, as passengers and freight switched railroads there.
Subsequent to the railhead&#x27;s meeting at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory, the San Joaquin River Bridge at Mossdale Crossing (near present-day Lathrop, California) was completed on September 8, 1869, with the first through freight train carrying freight from the East Coast leaving Sacramento and crossing the bridge to arrive that evening at the Alameda Wharf on San Francisco Bay. As a result, the western part of the route was extended from Sacramento to the Alameda Terminal in Alameda, California, and shortly thereafter, to the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point in Oakland, California, and on to San Jose, California. Train ferries transferred some railroad cars to and from the Oakland wharves and tracks to wharves and tracks in San Francisco. Before the CPRR was completed, developers were building other feeder railroads like the Virginia and Truckee Railroad to the Comstock Lode diggings in Virginia City, Nevada, and several different extensions in California and Nevada to reach other cities there. Some of their main cargo was the thousands of cords ( each) of firewood needed for the many steam engines and pumps, cooking stoves, heating stoves etc. in Comstock Lode towns and the tons of ice needed by the miners as they worked ever deeper into the &quot;hot&quot; Comstock Lode ore body. In the mines, temperatures could get above at the work face and a miner often used over of ice per shift. This new railroad connected to the Central Pacific near Reno, and went through Carson City, the new capital of Nevada.

After the transcontinental railroads were completed, many other railroads were built to connect up to other population centers in Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Oregon, Washington territories, etc. In 1869, the Kansas Pacific Railway started building the Hannibal Bridge, a swing bridge across the Missouri River between Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas, which connected railroads on both sides of the Missouri while still allowing passage of paddle steamers on the river. After completion, this became another major east–west railroad. To speed completion of the Kansas Pacific Railroad to Denver, construction started east from Denver in March 1870 to meet the railroad coming west from Kansas city. The two crews met at a point called Comanche Crossing, Kansas Territory, on August 15, 1870. Denver was now firmly on track to becoming the largest city and the future capital of Colorado. The Kansas Pacific Railroad linked with the Denver Pacific Railway via Denver to Cheyenne in 1870.

The original transcontinental railroad route did not pass through the two biggest cities in the so-called Great American Desert—Denver, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Feeder railroad lines were soon built to service these two and other cities and states along the route.

Modern-day Interstate 80 roughly follows the path of the railroad from Sacramento across modern day California, Nevada, Wyoming and Nebraska, with a few exceptions. Most significantly, the two routes are different between Wells, Nevada, and Echo, Utah. In this area the freeway passes along the south shore of the Great Salt Lake and passes through Salt Lake City, cresting the Wasatch Mountains at Parley&#x27;s Summit. The railroad was originally routed along the north shore, and later with the Lucin Cutoff directly across the center of the Great Salt Lake, passing through the city of Ogden instead of Salt Lake City. The railroad crosses the Wasatch Mountains via a much gentler grade through Weber Canyon. Most of the other deviations are in mountainous areas where interstate highways allow for grades up to six-percent grades, which allows them to go many places the railroads had to go around, since their goal was to hold their grades to less than two percent.

==Construction==
Most of the capital investment needed to build the railroad was generated by selling government-guaranteed bonds (granted per mile of completed track) to interested investors. The Federal donation of right-of-way saved money and time as it did not have to be purchased from others. The financial incentives and bonds would hopefully cover most of the initial capital investment needed to build the railroad. The bonds would be paid back by the sale of government-granted land, as well as prospective passenger and freight income. Most of the engineers and surveyors who figured out how and where to build the railroad on the Union Pacific were engineering college trained. Many of Union Pacific engineers and surveyors were Union Army veterans (including two generals) who had learned their railroad trade keeping the trains running and tracks maintained during the U.S. Civil War. After securing the finances and selecting the engineering team, the next step was to hire the key personnel and prospective supervisors. Nearly all key workers and supervisors were hired because they had previous railroad on-the-job training, knew what needed to be done and how to direct workers to get it done. After the key personnel were hired, the semi-skilled jobs could be filled if there was available labor. The engineering team&#x27;s main job was to tell the workers where to go, what to do, how to do it, and provide the construction material they would need to get it done.

Survey teams were put out to produce detailed contour maps of the options on the different routes. The engineering team looked at the available surveys and chose what was the &quot;best&quot; route. Survey teams under the direction of the engineers closely led the work crews and marked where and by how much hills would have to be cut and depressions filled or bridged. Coordinators made sure that construction and other supplies were provided when and where needed, and additional supplies were ordered as the railroad construction consumed the supplies. Specialized bridging, explosive and tunneling teams were assigned to their specialized jobs. Some jobs like explosive work, tunneling, bridging, heavy cuts or fills were known to take longer than others, so the specialized teams were sent out ahead by wagon trains with the supplies and men to get these jobs done by the time the regular track-laying crews arrived. Finance officers made sure the supplies were paid for and men paid for their work. An army of men had to be coordinated and a seemingly never-ending chain of supplies had to be provided. The Central Pacific road crew set a track-laying record by laying of track in a single day, commemorating the event with a signpost beside the track for passing trains to see.

In addition to the track-laying crews, other crews were busy setting up stations with provisions for loading fuel, water and often also mail, passengers and freight. Personnel had to be hired to run these stations. Maintenance depots had to be built to keep all of the equipment repaired and operational. Telegraph operators had to be hired to man each station to keep track of where the trains were so that trains could run in each direction on the available single track without interference or accidents. Sidings had to be built to allow trains to pass. Provision had to be made to store and continually pay for coal or wood needed to run the steam locomotives. Water towers had to be built for refilling the water tanks on the engines, and provision made to keep them full.

===Labor===
The majority of the Union Pacific track across the Nebraska and Wyoming territories was built by veterans of the Union and Confederate armies, as well as many recent immigrants. Brigham Young, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, landed contracts with the Union Pacific that offered jobs for around 2,000 members of the church with the hope that the railroad would support commerce in Utah. Church members built most of the road through Utah. Construction superintendent Durant repeatedly failed to pay the wages agreed upon. The Union Pacific train carrying him to the final spike ceremony was held up by a strike by unpaid workers in Piedmont, Wyoming, until he paid them for their work. Representatives of Brigham Young had less success, and failed in court to force him to honor the contract.
The manual labor to build the Central Pacific&#x27;s roadbed, bridges and tunnels was done primarily by many thousands of emigrant workers from China under the direction of skilled non-Chinese supervisors. The Chinese were commonly referred to at the time as &quot;Celestials&quot; and China as the &quot;Celestial Kingdom&quot;. Labor-saving devices in those days consisted primarily of wheelbarrows, horse or mule pulled carts, and a few railroad pulled gondolas. The construction work involved an immense amount of manual labor. Initially, Central Pacific had a hard time hiring and keeping unskilled workers on its line, as many would leave for the prospect of far more lucrative gold or silver mining options elsewhere. Despite the concerns expressed by Charles Crocker, one of the &quot;big four&quot; and a general contractor, that the Chinese were too small in stature and lacking previous experience with railroad work, they decided to try them anyway. After the first few days of trial with a few workers, with noticeably positive results, Crocker decided to hire as many as he could, looking primarily at the California labor force, where the majority of Chinese worked as independent gold miners or in the service industries (e.g.: laundries and kitchens). Most of these Chinese workers were represented by a Chinese &quot;boss&quot; who translated, collected salaries for his crew, kept discipline and relayed orders from an American general supervisor. Most Chinese workers spoke only rudimentary or no English, and the supervisors typically only learned rudimentary Chinese. Many more workers were imported from the Guangdong Province of China, which at the time, beside great poverty, suffered from the violence of the Taiping Rebellion. Most Chinese workers were planning on returning with their newfound &quot;wealth&quot; when the work was completed. Most of the men received between one and three dollars per day, the same as unskilled white workers; but the workers imported directly from China sometimes received less. A diligent worker could save over $20 per month after paying for food and lodging—a &quot;fortune&quot; by Chinese standards. A snapshot of workers in late 1865 showed about 3,000 Chinese and 1,700 white workers employed on the railroad. Nearly all of the white workers were in supervisory or skilled craft positions and made more money than the Chinese.

Most of the early work on the Central Pacific consisted of constructing the railroad track bed, cutting and/or blasting through or around hills, filling in washes, building bridges or trestles, digging and blasting tunnels and then laying the rails over the Sierra Nevada mountains. Once the Central Pacific was out of the Sierras and the Carson Range, progress sped up considerably as the railroad bed could be built over nearly flat ground. In those days, the Central Pacific once did a section of of track in one day as a &quot;demonstration&quot; of what they could do on flat ground like most of the Union Pacific had in Wyoming and Nebraska.

The track laying was divided up into various parts. In advance of the track layers, surveyors consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the fishplate bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers—the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work had to be done manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor-saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.
Tunnels were blasted through hard rock by drilling holes in the rock face by hand and filling them with black powder. Sometimes cracks were found which could be filled with powder and blasted loose. The loosened rock would be collected and hauled out of the tunnel for use in a fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as waste. A foot or so advance on a tunnel face was a typical day&#x27;s work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years. In the final days of working in the Sierras, the recently invented nitroglycerin explosive was introduced and used on the last tunnels including Summit Tunnel.

Supply trains carried all the necessary material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it the rest of the ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the track ballast and leveled to get ready for the rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men on each side of the rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with spike mauls. The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.

Track ballast was put between the ties as they progressed. Where a proper railbed had already been prepared, the work progressed rapidly. Constantly needed supplies included &quot;food, water, ties, rails, spikes, fishplates, nuts and bolts, track ballast, telegraph poles, wire, firewood (or coal on the Union Pacific) and water for the steam train locomotives, etc.&quot; After a flatcar was unloaded, it would usually be hooked to a small locomotive and pulled back to a siding, so another flatcar with rails etc. could be advanced to the railhead. Since juggling railroad cars took time on flat ground, where wagon transport was easier, the rail cars would be brought to the end of the line by steam locomotive, unloaded, and the flat car returned immediately to a siding for another loaded car of either ballast or rails. Temporary sidings were often installed where it could be easily done to expedite getting needed supplies to the railhead.

The railroad tracks, spikes, telegraph wire, locomotives, railroad cars, supplies etc. were imported from the east on sailing ships that sailed the nearly , 200-day trip around Cape Horn. Some freight was put on Clipper ships which could do the trip in about 120 days. Some passengers and high-priority freight were shipped over the newly completed (as of 1855) Panama Railroad across the Isthmus of Panama. Using paddle steamers to and from Panama, this shortcut could be traveled in as little as 40 days. Supplies were normally offloaded at the Sacramento, California, docks where the railroad started.

===Central Pacific construction===
On January 8, 1863, Governor Leland Stanford ceremonially broke ground in Sacramento, California, to begin construction of the Central Pacific Railroad. After great initial progress along the Sacramento Valley, construction was slowed, first by the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, then by cutting a railroad bed up the mountains themselves. As they progressed higher in the mountains, winter snowstorms and a shortage of reliable labor compounded the problems. On January 7, 1865, a want ad for 5,000 laborers was placed in the Sacramento Union. Consequently, after a trial crew of Chinese workers was hired and found to work successfully, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts to hire more emigrant laborers—mostly Chinese. Emigrants from poverty stricken regions of China, many of which suffered from the strife of the Taiping Rebellion, seemed to be more willing to tolerate the living and working conditions on the railroad construction, and progress on the railroad continued. The increasing necessity for tunneling as they proceeded up the mountains then began to slow progress of the line yet again.
The first step of construction was to survey the route and determine the locations where large excavations, tunnels and bridges would be needed. Crews could then start work in advance of the railroad reaching these locations. Supplies and workers were brought up to the work locations by wagon teams and work on several different sections proceeded simultaneously. One advantage of working on tunnels in winter was that tunnel work could often proceed since the work was nearly all &quot;inside&quot;. Living quarters would have to be built outside and getting new supplies was difficult. Working and living in winter in the presence of snow slides and avalanches caused some deaths.

To carve a tunnel, one worker held a rock drill on the granite face while one to two other workers swung eighteen-pound sledgehammers to sequentially hit the drill which slowly advanced into the rock. Once the hole was about deep, it would be filled with black powder, a fuse set and then ignited from a safe distance. Nitroglycerin, which had been invented less than two decades before the construction of the first transcontinental railroad, was used in relatively large quantities during its construction. This was especially true on the Central Pacific Railroad, which owned its own nitroglycerin plant to ensure it had a steady supply of the volatile explosive. This plant was operated by Chinese laborers as they were willing workers even under the most trying and dangerous of conditions.

Chinese laborers were also crucial in the construction of 15 tunnels along the railroad&#x27;s line through the Sierra Nevada mountains. These were about high and wide. When tunnels with vertical shafts were dug to increase construction speed, tunneling began in the middle of the tunnel and at both ends simultaneously. At first hand-powered derricks were used to help remove loose rocks up the vertical shafts. These derricks were later replaced with steam hoists as work progressed. By using vertical shafts, four faces of the tunnel could be worked at the same time, two in the middle and one at each end. The average daily progress in some tunnels was only a day per face, which was very slow, or daily according to historian George Kraus. J. O. Wilder, a Central Pacific-Southern Pacific employee, commented that &quot;The Chinese were as steady, hard-working a set of men as could be found. With the exception of a few whites at the west end of Tunnel No. 6, the laboring force was entirely composed of Chinamen with white foremen and a &quot;boss/translator&quot;. A single foreman (often Irish) with a gang of 30 to 40 Chinese men generally constituted the force at work at each end of a tunnel; of these, 12 to 15 men worked on the heading, and the rest on the bottom, removing blasted material. When a gang was small or the men were needed elsewhere, the bottoms were worked with fewer men or stopped so as to keep the headings going.&quot; The laborers usually worked three shifts of 8 hours each per day, while the foremen worked in two shifts of 12 hours each, managing the laborers. Once out of the Sierra, construction was much easier and faster. Under the direction of construction superintendent James Harvey Strobridge, Central Pacific track-laying crews set a record with of track laid in one day on April 28, 1869. Horace Hamilton Minkler, track foreman for the Central Pacific, laid the last rail and tie before the Last Spike was driven.

In order to keep the CPRR&#x27;s Sierra grade open during the winter months, beginning in 1867, of massive wooden snow sheds and galleries were built between Blue Cañon and Truckee, covering cuts and other points where there was danger of avalanches. 2,500 men and six material trains were employed in this work, which was completed in 1869. The sheds were built with two sides and a steep peaked roof, mostly of locally cut hewn timber and round logs. Snow galleries had one side and a roof that sloped upward until it met the mountainside, thus permitting avalanches to slide over the galleries, some of which extended up the mountainside as much as . Masonry walls such as the &quot;Chinese Walls&quot; at Donner Summit were built across canyons to prevent avalanches from striking the side of the vulnerable wooden construction. A few concrete sheds (mostly at crossovers) are still in use today.

===Union Pacific construction===
The major investor in the Union Pacific was Thomas Clark Durant, who had made his stake money by smuggling Confederate cotton with the aid of Grenville M. Dodge. Durant chose routes that would favor places where he held land, and he announced connections to other lines at times that suited his share dealings. He paid an associate to submit the construction bid to another company he controlled, Crédit Mobilier, manipulating the finances and government subsidies and making himself another fortune. Durant hired Dodge as chief engineer and Jack Casement as construction boss.

In the East, the progress started in Omaha, Nebraska, by the Union Pacific Railroad which initially proceeded very quickly because of the open terrain of the Great Plains. This changed as the work entered Indian-held lands, because the railroad violated Native American treaties with the United States. War parties began to raid the moving labor camps that followed the progress of the line. Union Pacific responded by increasing security and hiring marksmen to kill American Bison, which were both a physical threat to trains and the primary food source for many of the Plains Indians. The Native Americans then began killing laborers when they realized that the so-called &quot;Iron Horse&quot; threatened their existence. Security measures were further strengthened, and progress on the railroad continued.

Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s first postwar command (Military Division of the Mississippi) covered the territory west of the Mississippi and east of the Rocky Mountains, and his top priority was to protect the construction of the railroads. In 1867, he wrote to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, &quot;we are not going to let thieving, ragged Indians check and stop the progress&quot; of the railroads.

&quot;On the ground in the West, Gen. Philip Henry Sheridan, assuming Sherman&#x27;s command, took to his task much as he had done in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War, when he ordered the &quot;scorched earth&quot; tactics that presaged Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea.&quot;

&quot;The devastation of the buffalo population signalled the end of the Indian Wars, and Native Americans were pushed into reservations. In 1869, the Comanche chief Tosawi was reported to have told Sheridan, &quot;Me Tosawi. Me good Indian,&quot; and Sheridan allegedly replied, &quot;The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.&quot; The phrase was later misquoted, with Sheridan supposedly stating, &quot;The only good Indian is a dead Indian.&quot; Sheridan denied he had ever said such a thing.&quot;

&quot;By the end of the 19th century, only 300 buffalo were left in the wild. Congress finally took action, outlawing the killing of any birds or animals in Yellowstone National Park, where the only surviving buffalo herd could be protected. Conservationists established more wildlife preserves, and the species slowly rebounded. Today, there are more than 200,000 bison in North America.&quot;

&quot;Sheridan acknowledged the role of the railroad in changing the face of the American West, and in his &quot;Annual Report of the General of the U.S. Army&quot; in 1878, he acknowledged that the Native Americans were scuttled to reservations with no compensation beyond the promise of religious instruction and basic supplies of food and clothing—promises, he wrote, which were never fulfilled.&quot;

&quot;We took away their country and their means of support, broke up their mode of living, their habits of life, introduced disease and decay among them, and it was for this and against this they made war. Could any one expect less? Then, why wonder at Indian difficulties?&quot;

===The &quot;Last Spike&quot; ceremony===
 

Six years after the groundbreaking, laborers of the Central Pacific Railroad from the west and the Union Pacific Railroad from the east met at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory. On the Union Pacific side was Union Pacific No 119, an 1868 4-4-0 type. Thrusting westward, the last two rails were laid by Irishmen. On the Central Pacific side was their Central Pacific No 60 Jupiter, another 1868 4-4-0 type. Thrusting eastward, the last two rails were laid by the Chinese.
It was at Promontory Summit on May 10, 1869, that the two engines met. Leland Stanford drove &quot;The Last Spike&quot; (or golden spike) that joined the rails of the transcontinental railroad. The spike is now on display at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University, while a second &quot;Last&quot; Golden Spike is also on display at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. In perhaps the world&#x27;s first live mass-media event, the hammers and spike were wired to the telegraph line so that each hammer stroke would be heard as a click at telegraph stations nationwide—the hammer strokes were missed, so the clicks were sent by the telegraph operator. As soon as the ceremonial &quot;Last Spike&quot; had been replaced by an ordinary iron spike, a message was transmitted to both the East Coast and West Coast that simply read, &quot;DONE&quot;. Travel from coast to coast was reduced from six months or more to just one week.

==Aftermath==

===Railroad developments===

When the last spike was driven, the rail network was not yet connected to the Atlantic or Pacific but merely connected Omaha to Sacramento. To get from Sacramento to the Pacific, the Central Pacific purchased in 1867 the struggling Western Pacific Railroad (unrelated to the railroad of the same name that would later parallel its route) and in February 1868 resumed construction on it, which had halted in October 1866 because of funding troubles. On September 6, 1869, the first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad&#x27;s original western terminus on the east side of San Francisco Bay at the Alameda Terminal, where they transferred to the steamer &quot;Alameda&quot; for transport across the Bay to San Francisco. On November 8, 1869, the Central Pacific finally completed the rail connection to its western terminus at Oakland, California, also on the East Bay, where freight and passengers completed their transcontinental link to San Francisco by ferry.

The original route from the Central Valley to the Bay skirted the Delta by heading south out of Sacramento through Stockton and crossing the San Joaquin River at Mossdale, then climbed over the Altamont Pass and reached the east side of the San Francisco Bay through Niles Canyon. The Western Pacific was originally chartered to go to San Jose, but the Central Pacific decided to build along the East Bay instead, as going from San Jose up the Peninsula to San Francisco itself would have brought it into conflict with competing interests. The railroad entered Alameda and Oakland from the south, roughly paralleling what would later become U.S. Route 50 and later still Interstates 5, 205, and 580. A more direct route was obtained with the purchase of the California Pacific Railroad, crossing the Sacramento River and proceeding southwest through Davis to Benicia, where it crossed the Carquinez Strait by means of the enormous Solano train ferry, then followed the shores of the San Pablo and San Francisco bays to Richmond and the Port of Oakland (paralleling U.S. Route 40 which ultimately became Interstate 80). In 1930, a rail bridge across the Carquinez replaced the Benicia ferries.

Very early on, the Central Pacific learned that it would have trouble maintaining an open track in winter across the Sierras. At first they tried plowing the road with special snowplows mounted on their steam engines. When this was only partially successful, an extensive process of building snow sheds over some of the track was instituted to protect it from deep snows and avalanches. These eventually succeeded at keeping the tracks clear for all but a few days of the year.

Both railroads soon instituted extensive upgrade projects to build better bridges, viaducts and dugways as well as install heavier duty rails, stronger ties, better road beds etc. The original track had often been laid as fast as possible with only secondary attention to maintenance and durability. The primary incentive had been getting the subsidies, which meant that upgrades of all kinds were routinely required in the following years. The cost of making these upgrades was relatively small once the railroad was operating. Once the railroad was complete supplies could be moved from distant factories directly to the construction site by rail.
The Union Pacific would not connect Omaha to Council Bluffs until completing the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge in 1872.

Several years after the end of the Civil War, the competing railroads coming from Missouri finally realized their initial strategic advantage and a building boom ensued. In July 1869, the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad finished the Hannibal Bridge in Kansas City which was the first bridge to cross the Missouri River. This in turn connected to Kansas Pacific trains going from Kansas City to Denver, which in turn had built the Denver Pacific Railway connecting to the Union Pacific. In August 1870, the Kansas Pacific drove the last spike connecting to the Denver Pacific line at Strasburg, Colorado, and the first true Atlantic to Pacific United States railroad was completed.

Kansas City&#x27;s head start in connecting to a true transcontinental railroad contributed to it rather than Omaha becoming the dominant rail center west of Chicago.

The Kansas Pacific became part of the Union Pacific in 1880.

On June 4, 1876, an express train called the &quot;Transcontinental Express&quot; arrived in San Francisco via the first transcontinental railroad only 83 hours and 39 minutes after it had left New York City. Only ten years before, the same journey would have taken months over land or weeks on ship, possibly all the way around South America.

The Central Pacific got a direct route to San Francisco when it was merged with the Southern Pacific Railroad to create the Southern Pacific Company in 1885. The Union Pacific initially took over the Southern Pacific in 1901 but was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to divest it because of monopoly concerns. The two railroads would once again unite in 1996 when the Southern Pacific was sold to the Union Pacific.

Having been bypassed with the completion of the Lucin Cutoff in 1904, the Promontory Summit rails were pulled up in 1942 to be recycled for the World War II effort. This process began with a ceremonial &quot;undriving&quot; at the Last Spike location.

===Crédit Mobilier===

Despite the transcontinental success and millions in government subsidies, the Union Pacific faced bankruptcy less than three years after the Last Spike as details surfaced about overcharges that Crédit Mobilier had billed Union Pacific for the formal building of the railroad. The scandal hit epic proportions in the 1872 United States presidential election, which saw the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant and became the biggest scandal of the Gilded Age. It would not be resolved until the death of the congressman who was supposed to have reined in its excesses but instead wound up profiting from it.

Durant had initially come up with the scheme to have Crédit Mobilier subcontract to do the actual track work. Durant gained control of the company after buying out employee Herbert Hoxie for $10,000. Under Durant&#x27;s guidance, Crédit Mobilier was charging Union Pacific often twice or more the customary cost for track work. The process mired down Union Pacific work.

Lincoln asked Massachusetts Congressman Oakes Ames, who was on the railroad committee, to clean things up and get the railroad moving. Ames got his brother Oliver Ames Jr. named president of the Union Pacific, while he became president of Crédit Mobilier.

Ames then in turn gave stock options to other politicians while at the same time continuing the lucrative overcharges. The scandal was to implicate Vice President Schuyler Colfax (who was cleared) and future President James Garfield among others.

The scandal broke in 1872 when the &quot;New York Sun&quot; published correspondence detailing the scheme between Henry S. McComb and Ames. In the ensuing Congressional investigation, it was recommended that Ames be expelled from Congress, but this was reduced to a censure and Ames died within three months.

Durant later left the Union Pacific and a new rail baron, Jay Gould, became the dominant stockholder. As a result of the Panic of 1873, Gould was able to pick up bargains, among them the control of the Union Pacific Railroad and Western Union.

===Visible remains===
Visible remains of the historic line are still easily located—hundreds of miles are still in service today, especially through the Sierra Nevada Mountains and canyons in Utah and Wyoming. While the original rail has long since been replaced because of age and wear, and the roadbed upgraded and repaired, the lines generally run on top of the original, handmade grade. Vista points on Interstate 80 through California&#x27;s Truckee Canyon provide a panoramic view of many miles of the original Central Pacific line and of the snow sheds which made winter train travel safe and practical.

In areas where the original line has been bypassed and abandoned, primarily because of the Lucin Cutoff re-route in Utah, the original road grade is still obvious, as are numerous cuts and fills, especially the Big Fill a few miles east of Promontory. The sweeping curve which connected to the east end of the Big Fill now passes a Thiokol rocket research and development facility.

In 1957, Congress authorized the Golden Spike National Historic Site, which was redesignated the Golden Spike National Historical Park in 2019. Today the site features replica engines of Union Pacific No. 119 and Central Pacific Jupiter. The engines are fired up periodically by the National Park Service for the public. On May 10, 2006, on the anniversary of the driving of the spike, Utah announced that its state quarter design would be a representation of the driving of the Last Spike.

===Current passenger service===
Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, a daily passenger service from Emeryville, California (in the San Francisco Bay Area) to Chicago, uses the first transcontinental railroad from Sacramento to central Nevada. Because this rail line currently operates in a directional running setup across most of Nevada, the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; will switch to the Central Corridor at either Winnemucca or Wells.

==In popular culture==
The joining of the Union Pacific line with the Central Pacific line in May 1869 at Promontory Summit, Utah, was one of the major inspirations for French writer Jules Verne&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, published in 1873.

While not exactly accurate, John Ford&#x27;s 1924 silent movie &quot;The Iron Horse&quot; captures the fervent nationalism that drove public support for the project. Among the cooks serving the film&#x27;s cast and crew between shots were some of the Chinese laborers who worked on the Central Pacific section of the railroad.
The feat is depicted in various movies, including the 1939 film &quot;Union Pacific&quot;, starring Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Cecil B. DeMille, which depicts the fictional Central Pacific investor Asa Barrows obstructing attempts of the Union Pacific to reach Ogden, Utah.

The 1939 movie is said to have inspired the &quot;Union Pacific&quot; Western television series starring Jeff Morrow, Judson Pratt and Susan Cummings which aired in syndication from 1958 until 1959.

The 1962 film &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; has a whole segment devoted to the construction; one of the movie&#x27;s most famous scenes, filmed in Cinerama, is of a buffalo stampede over the railroad.

The construction of what presumably is—or is suggested to be—the transcontinental railroad provides the backdrop of the 1968 epic Spaghetti Western &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, directed by Italian director Sergio Leone.

Graham Masterton&#x27;s 1981 novel &quot;A Man of Destiny&quot; (published in the UK as &quot;Railroad&quot;) is a fictionalized account of the line&#x27;s construction.

The 1993 children&#x27;s book &quot;Ten Mile Day&quot; by Mary Ann Fraser tells the story of the record setting push by the Central Pacific in which they set a record by laying of track in a single day on April 28, 1869, to settle a $10,000 bet.

Kristiana Gregory&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;The Great Railroad Race&quot; (part of the &quot;Dear America&quot; series) is written as the fictional diary of Libby West, who chronicles the end of the railroad construction and the excitement that engulfed the country at the time.

In the 1999 Will Smith film &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, the joining ceremony is the setting of an assassination attempt on then U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant by the film&#x27;s antagonist Dr. Arliss Loveless.

The main character in &quot;The Claim&quot; (2000) is a surveyor for the Central Pacific Railroad, and the film is partially about the efforts of a frontier mayor to have the railroad routed through his town.

In the 2002 DreamWorks Animation movie &quot;&quot;, the title character, a horse named Spirit, is delivered with other horses to pull a steam locomotive at a work site for the transcontinental railroad.

The &quot;American Experience&quot; series&#x27; 2002–2003 season documents the railway in the episode titled &quot;Transcontinental Railroad&quot;.

The building of the railway is covered by the 2004 BBC documentary series &quot;Seven Wonders of the Industrial World&quot; in episode 6, &quot;The Line&quot;.

The popular sci-fi television show &quot;Doctor Who&quot; featured the transcontinental railroad in a 2010 BBC audiobook entitled &quot;The Runaway Train&quot;, read by Matt Smith and written for audio by Oli Smith.

The construction of the transcontinental railroad provides the setting for the AMC television series &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;. Thomas Durant is a regular character in the series and is portrayed by actor Colm Meaney.

The campaign mode of Kalypso Media&#x27;s 2018 video game &quot;Railway Empire&quot; covers the construction of the transcontinental railroad and features key figures such as Thomas Durant and Collis Huntington.

<doc id="36545" wikidata="Q38060" url="?curid=36545" title="Gaul">
<text>Gaul () was a region of Western Europe first clearly described by the Romans, encompassing present-day France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and parts of Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, and Northern Italy. It covered an area of . According to Julius Caesar, who took control of the region on behalf of the Roman Republic, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica, and Aquitania.

Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. This material culture was found not only in all of Gaul but also as far east as modern-day southern Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary.

Warbands led by the Gaul Brennos sacked the city of Rome in 387 BC, becoming the only time Rome was conquered by a foreign enemy in 800 years. However, Gallia Cisalpina was conquered by the Romans in 204 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the largest part of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. Roman control of Gaul lasted for five centuries, until the last Roman rump state, the Domain of Soissons, fell to the Franks in AD 486.

While the Gauls shifted from a primarily Celtic culture during Late Antiquity, becoming amalgamated into a Gallo-Roman culture, &quot;Gallia&quot; remained the conventional name of the territory throughout the Early Middle Ages, until it acquired a new identity as the Capetian Kingdom of France in the high medieval period. &quot;Gallia&quot; remains a name of France in modern Greek (Γαλλία) and modern Latin (besides the alternatives &quot;Francia&quot; and &quot;Francogallia&quot;).

==Name==

The Greek and Latin names &quot;Galatia&quot; (first attested by Timaeus of Tauromenium in the 4th century BC) and &quot;Gallia&quot; are ultimately derived from a Celtic ethnic term or clan &quot;Gal(a)-to-&quot;. The &quot;Galli&quot; of &quot;Gallia Celtica&quot; were reported to refer to themselves as &quot;Celtae&quot; by Caesar. Hellenistic etymology connected the name of the Galatians (Γαλάται, &quot;Galátai&quot;) to the supposedly &quot;milk-white&quot; skin (γάλα, &quot;gála&quot; &quot;milk&quot;) of the Gauls. Modern researchers say it is related to Welsh &quot;gallu&quot;, , &quot;capacity, power&quot;, thus meaning &quot;powerful people&quot;.

Despite its superficial similarity, the normal English translation of &quot;Gallia&quot; since the Middle Ages, &quot;Gaul&quot;, has a different origin than the Latin term. It stems from the French &quot;Gaule&quot;, itself deriving from the Old Frankish &quot;*Walholant&quot; (via a Latinized form &quot;*Walula&quot;), literally the &quot;Land of the Foreigners/Romans&quot;. &quot;*Walho-&quot; is a reflex of the Proto-Germanic &quot;*walhaz&quot;, &quot;foreigner, Romanized person&quot;, an exonym applied by Germanic speakers to Celts and Latin-speaking people indiscriminately. It is cognate with the names Wales, Cornwall, Wallonia, and Wallachia. The Germanic &quot;w-&quot; is regularly rendered as &quot;gu-&quot; / &quot;g-&quot; in French (cf. &quot;guerre&quot; &quot;war&quot;, &quot;garder&quot; &quot;ward&quot;, &quot;Guillaume&quot; &quot;William&quot;), and the historic diphthong &quot;au&quot; is the regular outcome of &quot;al&quot; before a following consonant (cf. &quot;cheval&quot; ~ &quot;chevaux&quot;). French &quot;Gaule&quot; or &quot;Gaulle&quot; cannot be derived from Latin &quot;Gallia&quot;, since &quot;g&quot; would become &quot;j&quot; before &quot;a&quot; (cf. &quot;gamba&quot; &gt; &quot;jambe&quot;), and the diphthong &quot;au&quot; would be unexplained; the regular outcome of Latin &quot;Gallia&quot; is &quot;Jaille&quot; in French, which is found in several western place names, such as, La Jaille-Yvon and Saint-Mars-la-Jaille. Proto-Germanic &quot;*walha&quot; is derived ultimately from the name of the Volcae.

Also unrelated, in spite of superficial similarity, is the name &quot;Gael&quot;. The Irish word &quot;gall&quot; did originally mean &quot;a Gaul&quot;, i.e. an inhabitant of Gaul, but its meaning was later widened to &quot;foreigner&quot;, to describe the Vikings, and later still the Normans. The dichotomic words &quot;gael&quot; and &quot;gall&quot; are sometimes used together for contrast, for instance in the 12th-century book &quot;Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib&quot;.

As adjectives, English has the two variants: &quot;Gaulish&quot; and &quot;Gallic&quot;. The two adjectives are used synonymously, as &quot;pertaining to Gaul or the Gauls&quot;, although the Celtic language group once spoken in Gaul is predominantly known as Gaulish.

==History==

===Pre-Roman Gaul===

There is little written information concerning the peoples that inhabited the regions of Gaul, save what can be gleaned from coins. Therefore, the early history of the Gauls is predominantly a matter of archaeology, and the relationships between their material culture, genetic relationships (the study of which has been aided, in recent years, through the field of archaeogenetics) and linguistic divisions rarely coincide.

Before the rapid spread of the La Tène culture in the 5th to 4th centuries BC, the territory of eastern and southern France already participated in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture ( to 8th centuries BC) out of which the early iron-working Hallstatt culture (7th to 6th centuries BC) would develop. By 500 BC, there is strong Hallstatt influence throughout most of France (except for the Alps and the extreme north-west).

Out of this Hallstatt background, the La Tène culture arose during the 7th and 6th century BC, presumably representing an early form of Continental Celtic culture and likely under Mediterranean influence from the Greek, Phoenician, and Etruscan civilizations. This culture spread out in a number of early centers along the Seine, the Middle Rhine and the upper Elbe. By the late 5th century BC, La Tène influence spread rapidly across the entire territory of Gaul. The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) not only in France but also what is now Switzerland, northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Bohemia, Moravia, Slovakia and Hungary. 

A major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age, during the 500-year period from 1300 to 800 BC. The newcomers were genetically most closely related to ancient individuals from Gaul. The authors describe this as a &quot;plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain&quot;.

The major source of early information on the Celts of Gaul was Poseidonios of Apamea, whose writings were quoted by Timagenes, Julius Caesar, the Sicilian Greek Diodorus Siculus, and the Greek geographer Strabo.

In the 4th and early 3rd century BC, Gallic clan confederations expanded far beyond the territory of what would become Roman Gaul (which defines usage of the term &quot;Gaul&quot; today), into Pannonia, Illyria, northern Italy, Transylvania and even Asia Minor.
By the 2nd century BC, the Romans described Gallia Transalpina as distinct from Gallia Cisalpina. In his &quot;Gallic Wars&quot;, Julius Caesar distinguishes among three ethnic groups in Gaul: the Belgae in the north (roughly between the Rhine and the Seine), the Celtae in the center and in Armorica, and the Aquitani in the southwest, the southeast being already colonized by the Romans. While some scholars believe the Belgae north of the Somme were a mixture of Celtic and Germanic elements, their ethnic affiliations have not been definitively resolved. 

In addition to the Gauls, there were other peoples living in Gaul, such as the Greeks and Phoenicians who had established outposts such as Massilia (present-day Marseille) along the Mediterranean coast. Also, along the southeastern French Mediterranean coast, the Ligures had merged with the Celts to form a Celto-Ligurian culture.

===Initial contact with Rome===
In the 2nd century BC Mediterranean Gaul had an extensive urban fabric and was prosperous. Archeologists know of cities in northern Gaul including the Biturigian capital of Avaricum (Bourges), Cenabum (Orléans), Autricum (Chartres) and the excavated site of Bibracte near Autun in Saône-et-Loire, along with a number of hill forts (or oppida) used in times of war. The prosperity of Mediterranean Gaul encouraged Rome to respond to pleas for assistance from the inhabitants of Massilia, who found themselves under attack by a coalition of Ligures and Gauls. The Romans intervened in Gaul in 154 BC and again in 125 BC. Whereas on the first occasion they came and went, on the second they stayed. In 122 BC Domitius Ahenobarbus managed to defeat the Allobroges (allies of the Salluvii), while in the ensuing year Quintus Fabius Maximus &quot;destroyed&quot; an army of the Arverni led by their king Bituitus, who had come to the aid of the Allobroges. Rome allowed Massilia to keep its lands, but added to its own territories the lands of the conquered tribes. As a direct result of these conquests, Rome now controlled an area extending from the Pyrenees to the lower Rhône river, and in the east up the Rhône valley to Lake Geneva. By 121 BC Romans had conquered the Mediterranean region called &quot;Provincia&quot; (later named &quot;Gallia Narbonensis&quot;). This conquest upset the ascendancy of the Gaulish Arverni peoples.

===Conquest by Rome===

The Roman proconsul and general Julius Caesar led his army into Gaul in 58 BC, ostensibly to assist Rome&#x27;s Gaullish allies against the migrating Helvetii. With the help of various Gallic clans (e.g., the Aedui) he managed to conquer nearly all of Gaul. While their military was just as strong as the Romans&#x27;, the internal division between the Gallic tribes guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar, and Vercingetorix&#x27;s attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. Julius Caesar was checked by Vercingetorix at a siege of Gergovia, a fortified town in the center of Gaul. Caesar&#x27;s alliances with many Gallic clans broke. Even the Aedui, their most faithful supporters, threw in their lot with the Arverni but the ever-loyal Remi (best known for its cavalry) and Lingones sent troops to support Caesar. The Germani of the Ubii also sent cavalry, which Caesar equipped with Remi horses. Caesar captured Vercingetorix in the Battle of Alesia, which ended the majority of Gallic resistance to Rome.

As many as a million people (probably 1 in 5 of the Gauls) died, another million were enslaved, 300 clans were subjugated and 800 cities were destroyed during the Gallic Wars. The entire population of the city of Avaricum (Bourges) (40,000 in all) were slaughtered. Before Julius Caesar&#x27;s campaign against the Helvetii (Switzerland), the Helvetians had numbered 263,000, but afterwards only 100,000 remained, most of whom Caesar took as slaves.

===Roman Gaul===
After Gaul was absorbed as &quot;Gallia&quot;, a set of Roman provinces, its inhabitants gradually adopted aspects of Roman culture and assimilated, resulting in the distinct Gallo-Roman culture. Citizenship was granted to all in 212 by the Constitutio Antoniniana. From the third to 5th centuries, Gaul was exposed to raids by the Franks. The Gallic Empire, consisting of the provinces of Gaul, Britannia, and Hispania, including the peaceful Baetica in the south, broke away from Rome from 260 to 273. In addition to the large number of natives, Gallia also became home to some Roman citizens from elsewhere and also in-migrating Germanic and Scythian tribes such as the Alans.

The religious practices of inhabitants became a combination of Roman and Celtic practice, with Celtic deities such as Cobannus and Epona subjected to . The imperial cult and Eastern mystery religions also gained a following. Eventually, after it became the official religion of the Empire and paganism became suppressed, Christianity won out in the twilight days of the Western Roman Empire (while the Christianized Eastern Roman Empire lasted another thousand years, until the invasion of Constantinople by the Ottomans in 1453); a small but notable Jewish presence also became established.

The Gaulish language is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable Romanization of the local material culture. The last record of spoken Gaulish deemed to be plausibly credible concerned the destruction by Christians of a pagan shrine in Auvergne &quot;called Vasso Galatae in the Gallic tongue&quot;. Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French.

The Vulgar Latin in the region of Gallia took on a distinctly local character, some of which is attested in graffiti, which evolved into the Gallo-Romance dialects which include French and its closest relatives. The influence of substrate languages may be seen in graffiti showing sound changes that matched changes that had earlier occurred in the indigenous languages, especially Gaulish. The Vulgar Latin in the north of Gaul evolved into the langues d&#x27;oïl and Franco-Provencal, while the dialects in the south evolved into the modern Occitan and Catalan tongues. Other languages held to be &quot;Gallo-Romance&quot; include the Gallo-Italic languages and the Rhaeto-Romance languages.

===Frankish Gaul===
Following Frankish victories at Soissons (AD 486), Vouillé (AD 507) and Autun (AD 532), Gaul (except for Brittany and Septimania) came under the rule of the Merovingians, the first kings of France. Gallo-Roman culture, the Romanized culture of Gaul under the rule of the Roman Empire, persisted particularly in the areas of Gallia Narbonensis that developed into Occitania, Gallia Cisalpina and to a lesser degree, Aquitania. The formerly Romanized north of Gaul, once it had been occupied by the Franks, developed into Merovingian culture instead. Roman life, centered on the public events and cultural responsibilities of urban life in the &quot;res publica&quot; and the sometimes luxurious life of the self-sufficient rural villa system, took longer to collapse in the Gallo-Roman regions, where the Visigoths largely inherited the status quo in the early 5th century. Gallo-Roman language persisted in the northeast into the Silva Carbonaria that formed an effective cultural barrier, with the Franks to the north and east, and in the northwest to the lower valley of the Loire, where Gallo-Roman culture interfaced with Frankish culture in a city like Tours and in the person of that Gallo-Roman bishop confronted with Merovingian royals, Gregory of Tours.

==Gauls==
=== Social structure, indigenous nation and clans ===

The Druids were not the only political force in Gaul, however, and the early political system was complex, if ultimately fatal to the society as a whole. The fundamental unit of Gallic politics was the clan, which itself consisted of one or more of what Caesar called &quot;pagi&quot;. Each clan had a council of elders, and initially a king. Later, the executive was an annually-elected magistrate. Among the Aedui, a clan of Gaul, the executive held the title of &quot;Vergobret&quot;, a position much like a king, but his powers were held in check by rules laid down by the council.

The regional ethnic groups, or &quot;pagi&quot; as the Romans called them (singular: &quot;pagus&quot;; the French word &quot;pays&quot;, &quot;region&quot; [a more accurate translation is &#x27;country&#x27;], comes from this term), were organized into larger multi-clan groups, which the Romans called &quot;civitates&quot;. These administrative groupings would be taken over by the Romans in their system of local control, and these &quot;civitates&quot; would also be the basis of France&#x27;s eventual division into ecclesiastical bishoprics and dioceses, which would remain in place—with slight changes—until the French Revolution.

Although the clans were moderately stable political entities, Gaul as a whole tended to be politically divided, there being virtually no unity among the various clans. Only during particularly trying times, such as the invasion of Caesar, could the Gauls unite under a single leader like Vercingetorix. Even then, however, the faction lines were clear.

The Romans divided Gaul broadly into &quot;Provincia&quot; (the conquered area around the Mediterranean), and the northern Gallia Comata (&quot;free Gaul&quot; or &quot;long-haired Gaul&quot;). Caesar divided the people of Gallia Comata into three broad groups: the &quot;Aquitani&quot;; &quot;Galli&quot; (who in their own language were called &quot;Celtae&quot;); and &quot;Belgae&quot;. In the modern sense, Gaulish peoples are defined linguistically, as speakers of dialects of the Gaulish language. While the Aquitani were probably Vascons, the Belgae would thus probably be a mixture of Celtic and Germanic elements.

Julius Caesar, in his book, &quot;The Gallic Wars&quot;, wrote

===Religion===
The Gauls practiced a form of animism, ascribing human characteristics to lakes, streams, mountains, and other natural features and granting them a quasi-divine status. Also, worship of animals was not uncommon; the animal most sacred to the Gauls was the boar which can be found on many Gallic military standards, much like the Roman eagle.

Their system of gods and goddesses was loose, there being certain deities which virtually every Gallic person worshipped, as well as clan and household gods.

Perhaps the most intriguing facet of Gallic religion is the practice of the Druids. The druids presided over human or animal sacrifices that were made in wooded groves or crude temples. They also appear to have held the responsibility for preserving the annual agricultural calendar and instigating seasonal festivals which corresponded to key points of the lunar-solar calendar. The religious practices of druids were syncretic and borrowed from earlier pagan traditions, with probably indo-European roots. Julius Caesar mentions in his Gallic Wars that those Celts who wanted to make a close study of druidism went to Britain to do so. In a little over a century later, Gnaeus Julius Agricola mentions Roman armies attacking a large druid sanctuary in Anglesey in Wales. There is no certainty concerning the origin of the druids, but it is clear that they vehemently guarded the secrets of their order and held sway over the people of Gaul. Indeed, they claimed the right to determine questions of war and peace, and thereby held an &quot;international&quot; status. In addition, the Druids monitored the religion of ordinary Gauls and were in charge of educating the aristocracy. They also practiced a form of excommunication from the assembly of worshippers, which in ancient Gaul meant a separation from secular society as well. Thus the Druids were an important part of Gallic society. The nearly complete and mysterious disappearance of the Celtic language from most of the territorial lands of ancient Gaul, with the exception of Brittany, can be attributed to the fact that Celtic druids refused to allow the Celtic oral literature or traditional wisdom to be committed to the written letter.

<text>Indigo Books &amp; Music Inc., known as &quot;Indigo&quot; and stylized &quot;!ndigo&quot;, is Canada&#x27;s only major English-language bookstore chain. It is Canada&#x27;s largest book, gift, and specialty toy retailer, operating stores in all ten provinces and one territory, and through a website offering a selection of books, toys, home décor, stationery, and gifts. Most Chapters and Indigo stores include a Starbucks café inside. As of 2022, Indigo has started selling music (vinyl, CDs), and select audio equipment (headphones, turntables).

At the end of its fiscal year in March 2018, the company reported a record annual revenue surpassing CAD $1 billion. As of July 1, 2017, the company operated 86 superstores under the banners Chapters and Indigo and 123 small format stores, under the banners Coles, Indigospirit, and The Book Company. Indigo is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario and employed more than 7,000 people throughout Canada.

After a series of mergers and acquisitions in the Canadian bookstore industry, Indigo stands as Canada&#x27;s last remaining national bookstore chain. In late 2017, announcements were made to expand to the United States, starting with a location in The Mall at Short Hills in Millburn, New Jersey.

==History==
The company was founded in 1996 by Heather Reisman, who is married to Gerry Schwartz, majority owner and CEO of Onex Corporation.

The company&#x27;s first big-box bookstore initially called &quot;Indigo Books, Music &amp; More&quot;, was opened in Burlington, Ontario on September 4, 1997. With financing from Onex Corporation, Indigo bought Chapters, their largest Canadian competitor, in 2001 and continues to operate many stores under the Chapters banner. Indigo also gained the ownership of the Coles chain of small-format bookstores, which was also owned by Chapters.

Indigo closed three high-profile stores in Toronto in the spring of 2014, including the World&#x27;s Biggest Bookstore, which it acquired when it bought Chapters. In June 2014, Reisman said the company was headed into a new phase, selling a much higher percentage of non-book items.

In late 2017, it was announced that it would expand to the United States, with its first location opening in &quot;The Mall at Short Hills&quot; in October 2018.

In September 2022, Reisman stepped down as CEO and became executive chair, with Peter Ruis being named CEO.

In February 2023, Indigo was the victim of a ransomware attack that rendered them unable to process non-cash transactions, returns, and gift cards for approximately four days. They got back their card transactions through a wireless pinpad, but the rewards system was still down. Online shopping remained unavailable for almost two months. While Indigo has assured the public that customer data was not compromised, they notified current and former employees that employee data had been. LockBit has claimed responsibility for the attack. Indigo made the decision not to pay the ransom due to the possibility that the money would be used to fund terrorism or organized crime.

In June 2023, Reisman announced her retirement, effective August 22, 2023. This came after four out of ten board members stepped down, citing loss of confidence and mistreatment from the board leadership.

In September 2023, founder Heather Reisman returned as chief executive officer, after Peter Ruis abruptly resigned earlier in the month.

In August 2024, Indigo served a cease and desist letter to the pro-Palestinian activist group Indigo Kills Kids. Demands in the letter included that the group stop infringing intellectual property laws, remove &quot;false and defamatory content,&quot; and stop interfering with the business and reputation of Indigo. On September 17, 2024, the Federal Court of Canada granted interim emergency approval to a lawsuit from Indigo requesting internet service providers take down the organization&#x27;s website.

==Operations==
The company sells books, magazines, gifts, and toys through its website and in its stores. Its banners currently include Indigo Books &amp; Music, Chapters, Coles, SmithBooks, IndigoSpirit, and The Book Company (small format).

Indigo began a partnership with Apple and iUniverse publishing in the 2010s. Indigo also manufactures its own brand of products, called IndigoLife. In addition, the chain&#x27;s Indigo Trusted Advisor Program offers book recommendations from experts in health, finance, and the environment, such as David Bach and David Suzuki.

==Charitable activities==
In 2004, Indigo started the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation, a program that helps provide new books and learning materials to high-needs elementary schools. Indigo commits $1.5 million annually to schools across Canada.

The money is raised by Indigo itself, customers, staff, suppliers, and proceeds from Love of Reading fundraising products (i.e., gift card sleeves). Only 80% of customer donations have been granted to over 1800 schools since the Love of Reading Foundation&#x27;s inception, with Indigo covering all of the operating costs of the foundation. The funding given to the schools is split across a 90% credit to spend at Indigo and 10% cash to be spent anywhere, as long as it contributes to advancement of literacy.

In addition to the regularly collected funds, the annual Adopt a School program has increased the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation&#x27;s donations up to a total of CAD 26 million given to more than 3,000 school libraries in Canada since 2004. During the month-long Adopt a School program, each retail store selects a local school to be the recipient of the donations the store collects during that time period.

In 2007, the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation produced a documentary chronicling the issue of funding for books in Canadian elementary schools. The documentary &quot;Writing on the Wall&quot; recounts the establishment of the foundation, while revealing the current conditions of school libraries and literacy in Canada. A follow-up documentary was created in 2017 titled &quot;Read Between the Lines&quot;.

==Kobo Inc.==
Kobo Inc., an e-reader platform and manufacturer, was founded and spun off of Indigo in November 2009. By August 2011, the Kobo e-reading platform had become the dominant player in Canada, with research firm Ipsos Reid estimating that it represented 36% of the Canadian market as of that date.

In November 2011, Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten purchased the company for US$315 million in cash. Around 58% of Kobo was owned by Indigo at the time of the purchase.

==Employee programs==
Indigo was listed as one of Canada&#x27;s Top 20 Employer Brands in the 2018 survey by Randstad NV. This is due in part to staff rewards program which includes benefits eligibility for both full-time and part-time employees. Indigo also offers a company-matched RRSP program and yearly employee scholarships.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Charity scandal===
CBC Marketplace showed that Indigo is doubly profiting from its own charity &quot;Love of Reading Foundation&quot;: the charity forced schools to buy books only from Indigo at full retail price. Other vendors usually sell to charities at wholesale price. Then, the charity used the profits to get charity tax refund for the donation to its own charity. Based on data provided by the CBC documentary, the profits obtained is almost equal to the charity it gives if the tax refunds is taken into account.

===Product removal===
In 2001, Indigo removed Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; from the shelves. In 2006, Indigo decided not to sell the June issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which reprinted the controversial cartoons of the Muslim prophet Muhammad that had led to violent demonstrations around the world. Indigo also did not distribute the issue of &quot;Western Standard&quot; which reprinted and discussed those same cartoons. The company has also reportedly refused to stock several titles by David Icke, and firearms magazines.

===Competitive position===
The Indigo/Chapters chain has been criticized over what some perceive as a virtual monopoly over retail-based book sales in Canada. In 2002, the company strongly opposed the entry of Amazon into the Canadian marketplace with accusations the U.S.-based company was skirting regulations about foreign ownership of Canadian booksellers.

Indigo&#x27;s expansion has been blamed, among other factors, for the financial difficulties of some independent booksellers in Canada. In particular, its rise coincided with the bankruptcy of Lichtman&#x27;s, once Canada&#x27;s largest independent bookseller.

<text>A magnetic field (sometimes called B-field) is a physical field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic materials. A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity and to the magnetic field. A permanent magnet&#x27;s magnetic field pulls on ferromagnetic materials such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets. In addition, a nonuniform magnetic field exerts minuscule forces on &quot;nonmagnetic&quot; materials by three other magnetic effects: paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and antiferromagnetism, although these forces are usually so small they can only be detected by laboratory equipment. Magnetic fields surround magnetized materials, electric currents, and electric fields varying in time. Since both strength and direction of a magnetic field may vary with location, it is described mathematically by a function assigning a vector to each point of space, called a vector field (more precisely, a pseudovector field).

In electromagnetics, the term &quot;magnetic field&quot; is used for two distinct but closely related vector fields denoted by the symbols and . In the International System of Units, the unit of , magnetic flux density, is the tesla (in SI base units: kilogram per second squared per ampere), which is equivalent to newton per meter per ampere. The unit of , magnetic field strength, is ampere per meter (A/m). and differ in how they take the medium and/or magnetization into account. In vacuum, the two fields are related through the vacuum permeability, formula_1; in a magnetized material, the quantities on each side of this equation differ by the magnetization field of the material.

Magnetic fields are produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property, their spin. Magnetic fields and electric fields are interrelated and are both components of the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature.

Magnetic fields are used throughout modern technology, particularly in electrical engineering and electromechanics. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both electric motors and generators. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is conceptualized and investigated as magnetic circuits. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the Hall effect. The Earth produces its own magnetic field, which shields the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer from the solar wind and is important in navigation using a compass.
==Description== 

The force on an electric charge depends on its location, speed, and direction; two vector fields are used to describe this force. The first is the electric field, which describes the force acting on a stationary charge and gives the component of the force that is independent of motion. The magnetic field, in contrast, describes the component of the force that is proportional to both the speed and direction of charged particles. The field is defined by the Lorentz force law and is, at each instant, perpendicular to both the motion of the charge and the force it experiences.

There are two different, but closely related vector fields which are both sometimes called the &quot;magnetic field&quot; written and . While both the best names for these fields and exact interpretation of what these fields represent has been the subject of long running debate, there is wide agreement about how the underlying physics work. Historically, the term &quot;magnetic field&quot; was reserved for while using other terms for , but many recent textbooks use the term &quot;magnetic field&quot; to describe as well as or in place of .
There are many alternative names for both (see sidebars).

=== The B-field ===

The magnetic field vector at any point can be defined as the vector that, when used in the Lorentz force law, correctly predicts the force on a charged particle at that point:

Here is the force on the particle, is the particle&#x27;s electric charge, is the external electric field, , is the particle&#x27;s velocity, and × denotes the cross product. The direction of force on the charge can be determined by a mnemonic known as the &quot;right-hand rule&quot; (see the figure). Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field &quot;can&quot; distinguish between these, see Hall effect below.

The first term in the Lorentz equation is from the theory of electrostatics, and says that a particle of charge in an electric field experiences an electric force:
formula_2

The second term is the magnetic force:
formula_3

Using the definition of the cross product, the magnetic force can also be written as a scalar equation:
formula_4
where , , and are the scalar magnitude of their respective vectors, and is the angle between the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field. The vector is &quot;defined&quot; as the vector field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion of a charged particle. In other words,

The field can also be defined by the torque on a magnetic dipole, .

The SI unit of is tesla (symbol: T). The Gaussian-cgs unit of is the gauss (symbol: G). (The conversion is 1 T ≘ 10000 G.) One nanotesla corresponds to 1 gamma (symbol: γ).

=== The H-field ===

The magnetic field is defined:

where formula_5 is the vacuum permeability, and is the magnetization vector. In a vacuum, and are proportional to each other. Inside a material they are different (see H and B inside and outside magnetic materials). The SI unit of the -field is the ampere per metre (A/m), and the CGS unit is the oersted (Oe).

===Measurement===
An instrument used to measure the local magnetic field is known as a magnetometer. Important classes of magnetometers include using induction magnetometers (or search-coil magnetometers) which measure only varying magnetic fields, rotating coil magnetometers, Hall effect magnetometers, NMR magnetometers, SQUID magnetometers, and fluxgate magnetometers. The magnetic fields of distant astronomical objects are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce synchrotron radiation that is detectable in radio waves. The finest precision for a magnetic field measurement was attained by Gravity Probe B at ().

=== Visualization===


The field can be visualized by a set of &quot;magnetic field lines&quot;, that follow the direction of the field at each point. The lines can be constructed by measuring the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of points (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a vector) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. Connecting these arrows then forms a set of magnetic field lines. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength. Magnetic field lines are like streamlines in fluid flow, in that they represent a continuous distribution, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines.

An advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the &quot;number&quot; of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly &quot;translated&quot; to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the surface integral of the magnetic field.

Various phenomena &quot;display&quot; magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field form lines that correspond to &quot;field lines&quot;. Magnetic field &quot;lines&quot; are also visually displayed in polar auroras, in which plasma particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

Field lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In ferromagnetic substances like iron and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a tension, (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. &quot;Unlike&quot; poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; &quot;like&quot; poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other.

==Magnetic field of permanent magnets==
&quot;Permanent magnets&quot; are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron and nickel, that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.

The magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small straight magnet is proportional to the magnet&#x27;s &quot;strength&quot; (called its magnetic dipole moment ). The equations are non-trivial and depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its by 180 degrees.

The magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modeling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called dipoles each having their own . The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles; any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.

There are two simplified models for the nature of these dipoles: the magnetic pole model and the Amperian loop model. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, and . Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.

A realistic model of magnetism is more complicated than either of these models; neither model fully explains why materials are magnetic. The monopole model has no experimental support. The Amperian loop model explains some, but not all of a material&#x27;s magnetic moment. The model predicts that the motion of electrons within an atom are connected to those electrons&#x27; orbital magnetic dipole moment, and these orbital moments do contribute to the magnetism seen at the macroscopic level. However, the motion of electrons is not classical, and the spin magnetic moment of electrons (which is not explained by either model) is also a significant contribution to the total moment of magnets.

===Magnetic pole model===

Historically, early physics textbooks would model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the Coulomb force between electric charges. At the microscopic level, this model contradicts the experimental evidence, and the pole model of magnetism is no longer the typical way to introduce the concept. However, it is still sometimes used as a macroscopic model for ferromagnetism due to its mathematical simplicity.

In this model, a magnetic -field is produced by fictitious &quot;magnetic charges&quot; that are spread over the surface of each pole. These &quot;magnetic charges&quot; are in fact related to the magnetization field . The -field, therefore, is analogous to the electric field , which starts at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all -field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole all -field lines point toward the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out). Too, a north pole feels a force in the direction of the -field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the -field.

In the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength separated by a small distance vector , such that . The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that is opposite to the magnetization field inside a permanent magnet.

Since it is based on the fictitious idea of a &quot;magnetic charge density&quot;, the pole model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north–south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents, nor the inherent connection between angular momentum and magnetism.

The pole model usually treats magnetic charge as a mathematical abstraction, rather than a physical property of particles. However, a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that physically has only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a &quot;magnetic charge&quot; analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end. Some theories (such as Grand Unified Theories) have predicted the existence of magnetic monopoles, but so far, none have been observed.

===Amperian loop model===

In the model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop with current and loop area . The dipole moment of this loop is .

These magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic -field.

The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current and an area . Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of
formula_6
where the direction of is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area has been reduced to zero and its current increased to infinity such that the product is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the Einstein–de Haas effect &quot;rotation by magnetization&quot; and its inverse, the Barnett effect or &quot;magnetization by rotation&quot;. Rotating the loop faster (in the same direction) increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.

==Interactions with magnets==
===Force between magnets===
Specifying the force between two small magnets is quite complicated because it depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and their distance and direction relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field of the other.

To understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the &quot;magnetic pole model&quot; given above. In this model, the &quot;-field&quot; of one magnet pushes and pulls on &quot;both&quot; poles of a second magnet. If this -field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is &quot;nonuniform&quot; (such as the near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.

This is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.

The details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field. Mathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment due to a magnetic field is:

formula_7

where the gradient is the change of the quantity per unit distance and the direction is that of maximum increase of . The dot product , where and represent the magnitude of the and vectors and is the angle between them. If is in the same direction as then the dot product is positive and the gradient points &quot;uphill&quot; pulling the magnet into regions of higher -field (more strictly larger ). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own then summing up the forces on each of these very small regions.

===Magnetic torque on permanent magnets===

If two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a &quot;magnetic torque&quot; on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque tends to align a magnet&#x27;s poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

 In terms of the pole model, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to , where is a constant called the vacuum permeability, measuring V·s/(A·m) and is the angle between and .

Mathematically, the torque on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment of the magnet:

formula_8

where × represents the vector cross product. This equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if is in the same direction as the magnetic field, since the cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction. Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.

==Interactions with electric currents==
Currents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.

===Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents===

All moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving point charges, such as electrons, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.

Magnetic field lines form in concentric circles around a cylindrical current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the &quot;right-hand grip rule&quot; (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)
Bending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or &quot;solenoid&quot; enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron core may act as an &quot;electromagnet&quot;, generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.

The magnetic field generated by a steady current (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point) is described by the &quot;Biot–Savart law&quot;:
formula_9
where the integral sums over the wire length where vector is the vector line element with direction in the same sense as the current , is the magnetic constant, is the distance between the location of and the location where the magnetic field is calculated, and is a unit vector in the direction of . For example, in the case of a sufficiently long, straight wire, this becomes:
formula_10
where . The direction is tangent to a circle perpendicular to the wire according to the right hand rule.

A slightly more general way of relating the current formula_11 to the -field is through Ampère&#x27;s law:
formula_12
where the line integral is over any arbitrary loop and formula_13 is the current enclosed by that loop. Ampère&#x27;s law is always valid for steady currents and can be used to calculate the -field for certain highly symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid.

In a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields, Ampère&#x27;s law is one of four Maxwell&#x27;s equations that describe electricity and magnetism.

===Force on moving charges and current===

====Force on a charged particle====
A charged particle moving in a -field experiences a &quot;sideways&quot; force that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. This force is known as the &quot;Lorentz force&quot;, and is given by
formula_14
where is the force, is the electric charge of the particle, is the instantaneous velocity of the particle, and is the magnetic field (in teslas).

The Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no work on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary magnetic dipole, or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.

====Force on current-carrying wire====
The force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a current carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current-carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the &quot;Laplace force&quot;.
Consider a conductor of length , cross section , and charge due to electric current . If this conductor is placed in a magnetic field of magnitude that makes an angle with the velocity of charges in the conductor, the force exerted on a single charge is
formula_15
so, for charges where
formula_16
the force exerted on the conductor is
formula_17
where .

==Relation between H and B==
The formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own bound current, which can be a challenge to calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the spin of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.) The -field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of &quot;magnetization&quot; first.

===Magnetization===
The &quot;magnetization&quot; vector field represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net magnetic dipole moment per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A⋅m2, the SI unit of magnetization is ampere per meter, identical to that of the -field.

The magnetization field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside the magnet.)

In the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called &quot;bound current&quot;. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic field due to the magnet. Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere&#x27;s law:
formula_18
where the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and is the bound current enclosed by that closed loop.

In the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive &quot;magnetic pole strength&quot; (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to:
formula_19
where the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface and is the &quot;magnetic charge&quot; (in units of magnetic flux) enclosed by . (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.

===H-field and magnetic materials===
In SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by
formula_20

In terms of the H-field, Ampere&#x27;s law is
formula_21
where represents the &#x27;free current&#x27; enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of does not depend at all on the bound currents.

For the differential equivalent of this equation see Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Ampere&#x27;s law leads to the boundary condition
formula_22
where is the surface free current density and the unit normal formula_23 points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.

Similarly, a surface integral of over any closed surface is independent of the free currents and picks out the &quot;magnetic charges&quot; within that closed surface:
formula_24

which does not depend on the free currents.

The -field, therefore, can be separated into two independent parts:
formula_25

where is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents.

The magnetic -field, therefore, re-factors the bound current in terms of &quot;magnetic charges&quot;. The field lines loop only around &quot;free current&quot; and, unlike the magnetic field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.

===Magnetism===

Most materials respond to an applied -field by producing their own magnetization and therefore their own -fields. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term &quot;magnetism&quot; describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic phase of a material. Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior:
* Diamagnetic materials produce a magnetization that opposes the magnetic field.
* Paramagnetic materials produce a magnetization in the same direction as the applied magnetic field.
* Ferromagnetic materials and the closely related ferrimagnetic materials and antiferromagnetic materials can have a magnetization independent of an applied B-field with a complex relationship between the two fields.
* Superconductors (and ferromagnetic superconductors) are materials that are characterized by perfect conductivity below a critical temperature and magnetic field. They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields (the so-named mixed state) under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of on .

In the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:
formula_26
where is a material dependent parameter called the permeability. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank tensor so that may not point in the same direction as . These relations between and are examples of constitutive equations. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex -to- relation; see magnetic hysteresis.

==Stored energy==

Energy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.

For linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that where is frequency-independent), the energy density is:

formula_27

If there are no magnetic materials around then can be replaced by . The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.

In general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume needed to cause a small change of magnetic field is:

formula_28

Once the relationship between and is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For hysteretic materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.

==Appearance in Maxwell&#x27;s equations==

Like all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its &quot;sources&quot;. (For the &quot;sources&quot; are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Equations&quot;. Maxwell&#x27;s Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of classical electrodynamics including both electricity and magnetism.

The first property is the divergence of a vector field , , which represents how &quot;flows&quot; outward from a given point. As discussed above, a -field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of is zero. (Such vector fields are called solenoidal vector fields.) This property is called Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or magnetic monopoles.

The second mathematical property is called the curl, such that represents how curls or &quot;circulates&quot; around a given point. The result of the curl is called a &quot;circulation source&quot;. The equations for the curl of and of are called the Ampère–Maxwell equation and Faraday&#x27;s law respectively.

===Gauss&#x27; law for magnetism===
One important property of the -field produced this way is that magnetic -field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, is a solenoidal vector field); a field line may only extend to infinity, or wrap around to form a closed curve, or follow a never-ending (possibly chaotic) path. Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet -field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north. If a -field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point.

More formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the &quot;number&quot; of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism:
formula_29
where the integral is a surface integral over the closed surface (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for -field pointing out and negative for -field pointing in.

===Faraday&#x27;s Law===
A changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an electric field (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as &quot;Faraday&#x27;s law&quot; and forms the basis of many electrical generators and electric motors. Mathematically, Faraday&#x27;s law is:
formula_30

where formula_31 is the electromotive force (or &quot;EMF&quot;, the voltage generated around a closed loop) and is the magnetic flux—the product of the area times the magnetic field normal to that area. (This definition of magnetic flux is why is often referred to as &quot;magnetic flux density&quot;.) The negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that &quot;opposes&quot; the &quot;change&quot; in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as Lenz&#x27;s law. This integral formulation of Faraday&#x27;s law can be converted into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions.

formula_32

===Ampère&#x27;s Law and Maxwell&#x27;s correction===
Similar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s correction to Ampère&#x27;s law&quot; and is applied as an additive term to Ampere&#x27;s law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday&#x27;s law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)

The full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell–Ampère equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used.

The Maxwell term &quot;is&quot; critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell&#x27;s correction to Ampère&#x27;s Law together with Faraday&#x27;s law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form electromagnetic waves, such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.

formula_33

where is the complete microscopic current density, and is the vacuum permittivity.

As discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric field and an applied magnetic field by producing their own internal &quot;bound&quot; charge and current distributions that contribute to and but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, and fields are used to re-factor Maxwell&#x27;s equations in terms of the &quot;free current density&quot; :

formula_34

These equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the &quot;bound&quot; charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between and as well as that between and . On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell&#x27;s equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.

==Formulation in special relativity and quantum electrodynamics==
===Relativistic electrodynamics===
==== As different aspects of the same phenomenon ====
According to the special theory of relativity, the partition of the electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the observational frame of reference: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.

The magnetic field existing as electric field in other frames can be shown by consistency of equations obtained from Lorentz transformation of four force from Coulomb&#x27;s Law in particle&#x27;s rest frame with Maxwell&#x27;s laws considering definition of fields from Lorentz force and for non accelerating condition. The form of magnetic field hence obtained by Lorentz transformation of four-force from the form of Coulomb&#x27;s law in source&#x27;s initial frame is given by:formula_35where formula_36 is the charge of the point source, formula_37 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_38 is the position vector from the point source to the point in space, formula_39 is the velocity vector of the charged particle, formula_40 is the ratio of speed of the charged particle divided by the speed of light and formula_41 is the angle between formula_38 and formula_39. This form of magnetic field can be shown to satisfy maxwell&#x27;s laws within the constraint of particle being non accelerating. The above reduces to Biot-Savart law for non relativistic stream of current (formula_44).

Formally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 tensor, called the &quot;electromagnetic tensor&quot;. Changing reference frames &quot;mixes&quot; these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity &quot;mixes&quot; space and time into spacetime, and mass, momentum, and energy into four-momentum. Similarly, the energy stored in a magnetic field is mixed with the energy stored in an electric field in the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor.

==== Magnetic vector potential ====
In advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the &quot;magnetic vector potential&quot; , and the electric scalar potential , are defined using gauge fixing such that:
formula_45

The vector potential, &quot;&quot; given by this form may be interpreted as a &quot;generalized potential momentum per unit charge&quot; just as is interpreted as a &quot;generalized potential energy per unit charge&quot;. There are multiple choices one can make for the potential fields that satisfy the above condition. However, the choice of potentials is represented by its respective gauge condition.

Maxwell&#x27;s equations when expressed in terms of the potentials in Lorenz gauge can be cast into a form that agrees with special relativity. In relativity, together with forms a four-potential regardless of the gauge condition, analogous to the four-momentum that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simpler—and it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics.

==== Propagation of Electric and Magnetic fields ====
Special theory of relativity imposes the condition for events related by cause and effect to be time-like separated, that is that causal efficacy propagates no faster than light. Maxwell&#x27;s equations for electromagnetism are found to be in favor of this as electric and magnetic disturbances are found to travel at the speed of light in space. Electric and magnetic fields from classical electrodynamics obey the principle of locality in physics and are expressed in terms of retarded time or the time at which the cause of a measured field originated given that the influence of field travelled at speed of light. The retarded time for a point particle is given as solution of:

formula_46

where formula_47 is retarded time or the time at which the source&#x27;s contribution of the field originated, formula_48 is the position vector of the particle as function of time, formula_49 is the point in space, formula_50 is the time at which fields are measured and formula_51 is the speed of light. The equation subtracts the time taken for light to travel from particle to the point in space from the time of measurement to find time of origin of the fields. The uniqueness of solution for formula_47 for given formula_53, formula_38 and formula_55 is valid for charged particles moving slower than speed of light.

==== Magnetic field of arbitrary moving point charge ====

The solution of maxwell&#x27;s equations for electric and magnetic field of a point charge is expressed in terms of retarded time or the time at which the particle in the past causes the field at the point, given that the influence travels across space at the speed of light.

Any arbitrary motion of point charge causes electric and magnetic fields found by solving maxwell&#x27;s equations using green&#x27;s function for retarded potentials and hence finding the fields to be as follows:

formula_56

formula_57

where formula_58and formula_59 are electric scalar potential and magnetic vector potential in Lorentz gauge, formula_36 is the charge of the point source, formula_61 is a unit vector pointing from charged particle to the point in space, formula_62 is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light and formula_63 is the corresponding Lorentz factor. Hence by the principle of superposition, the fields of a system of charges also obey principle of locality.

===Quantum electrodynamics===

The classical electromagnetic field incorporated into quantum mechanics forms what is known as the semi-classical theory of radiation. However, it is not able to make experimentally observed predictions such as spontaneous emission process or Lamb shift implying the need for quantization of fields. In modern physics, the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a &quot;classical&quot; field, but rather a quantum field; it is represented not as a vector of three numbers at each point, but as a vector of three quantum operators at each point. The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction (and much else) is &quot;quantum electrodynamics&quot; (QED), which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the &quot;Standard Model of particle physics&quot;.

In QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles (and their antiparticles) is computed using perturbation theory. These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation as Feynman diagrams in which virtual photons are exchanged.

Predictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10−12 (and limited by experimental errors); for details see precision tests of QED. This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far.

All equations in this article are in the classical approximation, which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here. However, under most everyday circumstances, the difference between the two theories is negligible.

==Uses and examples==

===Earth&#x27;s magnetic field===

The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is produced by convection of a liquid iron alloy in the outer core. In a dynamo process, the movements drive a feedback process in which electric currents create electric and magnetic fields that in turn act on the currents.

The field at the surface of the Earth is approximately the same as if a giant bar magnet were positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° off the rotational axis of the Earth (see the figure). The north pole of a magnetic compass needle points roughly north, toward the North Magnetic Pole. However, because a magnetic pole is attracted to its opposite, the North Magnetic Pole is actually the south pole of the geomagnetic field. This confusion in terminology arises because the pole of a magnet is defined by the geographical direction it points.

Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is not constant—the strength of the field and the location of its poles vary. Moreover, the poles periodically reverse their orientation in a process called geomagnetic reversal. The most recent reversal occurred 780,000 years ago.

===Rotating magnetic fields===
The &quot;rotating magnetic field&quot; is a key principle in the operation of alternating-current motors. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field.

Magnetic torque is used to drive electric motors. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of electromagnets. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft.

A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.

This inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, three-phase systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world&#x27;s electrical power supply systems.

Synchronous motors use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled—and induction motors use short-circuited rotors (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.

The Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris and the Serbian-American electrical engineer Nikola Tesla independently researched the use of rotating magnetic fields in electric motors. In 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the &quot;Royal Academy of Sciences&quot; in Turin and Tesla gained for his work.

===Hall effect===
The charge carriers of a current-carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the &quot;Hall effect&quot;.

The &quot;Hall effect&quot; is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).

===Magnetic circuits===

An important use of is in &quot;magnetic circuits&quot; where inside a linear material. Here, is the magnetic permeability of the material. This result is similar in form to Ohm&#x27;s law , where is the current density, is the conductance and is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm&#x27;s law () is:

formula_64

where formula_65 is the magnetic flux in the circuit, formula_66 is the magnetomotive force applied to the circuit, and is the reluctance of the circuit. Here the reluctance is a quantity similar in nature to resistance for the flux. Using this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of circuit theory.

===Largest magnetic fields===
, the largest magnetic field produced over a macroscopic volume outside a lab setting is 2.8 kT (VNIIEF in Sarov, Russia, 1998). As of October 2018, the largest magnetic field produced in a laboratory over a macroscopic volume was 1.2 kT by researchers at the University of Tokyo in 2018.
The largest magnetic fields produced in a laboratory occur in particle accelerators, such as RHIC, inside the collisions of heavy ions, where microscopic fields reach 1014 T. Magnetars have the strongest known magnetic fields of any naturally occurring object, ranging from 0.1 to 100 GT (108 to 1011 T).

== Common formulæ==
Additional magnetic field values can be found through the magnetic field of a finite beam, for example, that the magnetic field of an arc of angle formula_41 and radius formula_68 at the center is formula_69, or that the magnetic field at the center of a N-sided regular polygon of side formula_70 is formula_71, both outside of the plane with proper directions as inferred by right hand thumb rule.

==History==


===Early developments===
While magnets and some properties of magnetism were known to ancient societies, the research of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles. Noting the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points &quot;poles&quot; in analogy to Earth&#x27;s poles. He also articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.

Almost three centuries later, William Gilbert of Colchester replicated Petrus Peregrinus&#x27; work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet. Published in 1600, Gilbert&#x27;s work, &quot;De Magnete&quot;, helped to establish magnetism as a science.

===Mathematical development===
In 1750, John Michell stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an inverse square law Charles-Augustin de Coulomb experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that north and south poles cannot be separated. Building on this force between poles, Siméon Denis Poisson (1781–1840) created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824. In this model, a magnetic -field is produced by &quot;magnetic poles&quot; and magnetism is due to small pairs of north–south magnetic poles.

Three discoveries in 1820 challenged this foundation of magnetism. Hans Christian Ørsted demonstrated that a current-carrying wire is surrounded by a circular magnetic field. Then André-Marie Ampère showed that parallel wires with currents attract one another if the currents are in the same direction and repel if they are in opposite directions. Finally, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart announced empirical results about the forces that a current-carrying long, straight wire exerted on a small magnet, determining the forces were inversely proportional to the perpendicular distance from the wire to the magnet. Laplace later deduced a law of force based on the differential action of a differential section of the wire, which became known as the Biot–Savart law, as Laplace did not publish his findings.

Extending these experiments, Ampère published his own successful model of magnetism in 1825. In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson&#x27;s model. Further, Ampère derived both Ampère&#x27;s force law describing the force between two currents and Ampère&#x27;s law, which, like the Biot–Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Ampère introduced the term electrodynamics to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.

In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field, formulating what is now known as Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. Later, Franz Ernst Neumann proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Ampère&#x27;s force law. In the process, he introduced the magnetic vector potential, which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.

In 1850, Lord Kelvin, then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted and . The former applied to Poisson&#x27;s model and the latter to Ampère&#x27;s model and induction. Further, he derived how and relate to each other and coined the term &quot;permeability&quot;.

Between 1861 and 1865, James Clerk Maxwell developed and published Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which explained and united all of classical electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot; in 1861. These equations were valid but incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper &quot;A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field&quot; and demonstrated the fact that light is an electromagnetic wave. Heinrich Hertz published papers in 1887 and 1888 experimentally confirming this fact.

===Modern developments===

In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). Tesla received a patent for his electric motor in May 1888. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched rotating magnetic fields and subsequently published his research in a paper to the &quot;Royal Academy of Sciences&quot; in Turin, just two months before Tesla was awarded his patent, in March 1888.

The twentieth century showed that classical electrodynamics is already consistent with special relativity, and extended classical electrodynamics to work with quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. Finally, the emergent field of quantum mechanics was merged with electrodynamics to form quantum electrodynamics, which first formalized the notion that electromagnetic field energy is quantized in the form of photons.

<text>Nansen passports, originally and officially stateless persons passports, were internationally recognized refugee travel documents from 1922 to 1938, first issued by the League of Nations&#x27;s Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees to stateless refugees. They quickly became known as &quot;Nansen passports&quot; for their promoter, the Norwegian statesman and polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen.

==History==

The end of World War I saw significant turmoil, leading to a refugee crisis. Numerous governments were toppled, and national borders were redrawn, often along generally ethnic lines. Civil war broke out in some countries. Many people left their homes because of war or persecution or fear thereof. The upheaval resulted in many people being without passports, or even nations to issue them, which prevented much international travel, often trapping refugees.

The precipitating event for the Nansen passport was the 1921 announcement by the new government of the Soviet Union revoking the citizenship of Russians living abroad, including some 800,000 refugees from the Russian Civil War. The first Nansen passports were issued following an international agreement reached at the Intergovernmental Conference on Identity Certificates for Russian Refugees, convened by Fridtjof Nansen in Geneva from July 3, 1922, to July 5, 1922, in his role as High Commissioner for Refugees for the League of Nations. By 1942, they were honoured by governments in 52 countries.

In 1924, the Nansen arrangement was broadened to also include Armenian, and in 1928 to Assyrian, Bulgarian, and Turkish refugees. Approximately 450,000 Nansen passports were provided to stateless people and refugees who needed travel documents, but could not obtain one from a national authority.

Following Nansen&#x27;s death in 1930, the passport was handled by the Nansen International Office for Refugees within the League of Nations. At that point the passport no longer included a reference to the 1922 conference, but were issued in the name of the League. The office was closed in 1938; passports were thereafter issued by a new agency, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees under the Protection of the League of Nations in London.

==Legacy==
The Nansen International Office for Refugees was awarded the 1938 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to establish the Nansen passports.

While Nansen passports are no longer issued, existing national and supranational authorities, including the United Nations, issue travel documents for stateless people and refugees, including certificates of identity (or &quot;alien&#x27;s passports&quot;) and refugee travel documents.

<text>The nuraghe, or nurhag, is the main type of ancient megalithic edifice found in Sardinia, Italy, developed during the Nuragic Age between 1900 and 730 BC. Today it has come to be the symbol of Sardinia and its distinctive culture known as the Nuragic civilization. More than 7,000 nuraghes have been found, though archeologists believe that originally there were more than 10,000.

==Etymology==

Natively, the structure is called a &quot;nuraghe&quot; (, ; plural: Logudorese Sardinian , Campidanese Sardinian , Italian ). According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the etymology is &quot;uncertain and disputed&quot;: &quot;The word is perhaps related to the Sardinian place names &quot;Nurra&quot;, &quot;Nurri&quot;, &quot;Nurru&quot;, and to Sardinian &quot;nurra&quot; &#x27;heap of stones, cavity in earth&#x27; (although these senses are difficult to reconcile). A connection with the Semitic base of Arabic &quot;nūr&quot; &#x27;light, fire, etc.&#x27; is now generally rejected.&quot; The Latin word &quot;murus&quot; (&#x27;wall&#x27;) may be related to it, being a result of the derivation: &quot;murus&quot;–&quot;*muraghe&quot;–nuraghe. However, such theories are debated.

An etymological theory suggests a Proto-Basque origin by the term &quot;*nur&quot; (stone) with the common plural ending; the Paleo-Sardinian suffix is also found in some Indo-European languages such as Latin and Greek. Another possible explanation is that the term &quot;nuraghe&quot; came from the name of the Iberian mythological hero Norax, and the root &quot;*nur&quot; would be an adaptation of the Indo-European root &quot;*nor&quot;.

==General layout==
The typical nuraghe is situated in areas where previous prehistoric Sardinian cultures had been distributed, that, is not far from alluvial plains (though few nuraghes appear in plains currently as they were destroyed by human activities such as agriculture, dams and road building) and has the outer shape of a truncated conical tower, thus resembling a medieval tower, with a tholos-like vault inside.

The structure&#x27;s walls consist of three components: an outer layer (tilted inwards and made of many layers of stones whose size diminishes with increasing height: mostly, lower layers consist of rubble masonry, while upper layers tend to be of ashlar masonry); an inner layer, made of smaller stones (to form a corbelled dome of the bullet-shaped &quot;tholos&quot; type, and where ashlar masonry is used more frequently); and an intermediate layer of very small pieces and dirt, which makes the whole construction very sturdy: it stands only by virtue of the weight of its stones, which may each amount to several tons. Some nuraghes are about 20 meters (60 ft) in height, the tallest one known, Nuraghe Arrubiu, reached a height of 25–30 meters.

The entrance leads into a corridor, on whose sides are often open niches, that lead to the round chamber. A spiral stone stair, leading to upper floors (if present) and/or to a terrace, was built within the thick walls and it was illuminated by embrasures. The Nuragic towers might have as much as three corbel chambers one on top of the other. In complex nuraghes corridors were often present, sometimes corbelled, such as at Santu Antine, in which the corbelled arch corridors were superimposed on two levels, and reached a length of 27 meters.

Today fewer than 7,000 nuraghes remain standing; their number was originally larger. Nuraghes are most prevalent in the northwest and south-central parts of the island.
==Function==

There is no consensus on the function of the nuraghes: they could have been rulers&#x27; residences, military strongholds, meeting halls, religious temples, ordinary dwellings or a combination of any of these things. Some of the nuraghes are, however, located in strategic places – such as hills – from which important passages could be easily controlled. They might have been something between a &quot;status symbol&quot; and a &quot;passive defence&quot; building, meant to be a deterrent for possible enemies.

Nuraghes could also have been the &quot;national&quot; symbol of the Nuragic peoples. Small-scale models of nuraghe have often been excavated at religious sites (e.g. in the &quot;maze&quot; temple at the Su Romanzesu site near Bitti in central Sardinia). Nuraghes may have just connoted wealth or power, or they may have been an indication that a site had its owners. Recent unconfirmed theories tend to suggest that Sardinian towns were independent entities (such as the city-states, although in a geographical sense they were not cities) that formed federations and that the building of these monuments might have depended on agreed-on distributions of territory among federated unities.

They were not tombs of princes and their families, as was mistakenly believed by taking as an argument the discovery of human remains there, but of strata of a later age than the Nuragic, that is, Carthaginian and Roman. Neither were they monumental temples, which today are known to be of different shapes and types, even for prehistoric island times, likewise burials (domus de janas or &quot;fairy houses&quot;; tumbas de sos gigantes or &quot;tombs of the giants&quot;).

In 2002, Juan Belmonte and Mauro Zedda measured the entrance orientations (declinations and azimuths) of 272 simple nuraghes and of the central towers of 180 complex ones. The data revealed clear peaks corresponding to orientations pointing to the sunrise at winter solstice and to the Moon at its southernmost rising position. These alignments remained constant throughout the history of nuraghe. The most common declinations revealed were of around −43° for the earlier nuraghes, shifting to just −45½° for the later. Zedda has suggested that the target is likely a star, quite possibly Alpha Centauri.


==Types==
===Protonuraghe===
Protonuraghes are considered to be the most archaic type; they differ somewhat from the &quot;classical&quot; (tholos-vaulted) nuraghes in their stockier look. Protonuraghes generally follow an irregular plan and lack the large circular room present in presumed later forms; instead, they are laid out along one or more corridors or long rooms. Although lacking the central circular room, they are sometimes similar in size to later nuraghes.

===Mixed nuraghe===
This type is distinguished by the restorations made in later times, supposedly because of a change to the protonuraghes design, or for other needs.

===Single-tower nuraghe===
This is considered to be the predominant type of nuraghe, and it represents the most diffused typology. The single tower, of a truncated conical shape, contains one or more superimposed chambers, covered by a tholos-shaped chamber. The access, generally located at the ground level, leads into a passageway that leads, in the front, into the central chamber and in one side (usually the left) in the helical staircase, built inside the wall mass, that lead to the terrace or to the upper-floor chamber.

In addition to the usual circular rooms, in their inside can be found other smaller environments such as niches.

===A &quot;tancadu&quot; nuraghe===
A &quot;tancadu&quot; nuraghe (Sardinian term for courtyard) represents the evolution of the single-tower nuraghe; another circular building was later added to the main tower, with two enclosing curtain walls connecting the two. A courtyard was present within the structure, sometimes provided with a well.

===Polylobed nuraghe===
Also called &quot;Nuragic royal palaces&quot;, the polylobed nuraghes are the least frequent typology. Very elaborate and often designed in a unified manner, they look like veritable fortresses with several towers linked by high ramparts, whose function was to offer more useful space and perhaps to reinforce the central tower. These &quot;Megalithic castles&quot; were surrounded by additional walls, sometimes also provided with towers (the so-called bulwark).

==Notable nuraghes==

Nuraghes are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. Su Nuraxi di Barumini, in the south of the island, has been chosen to represent all the nuragic patrimony, but one of the highest and most complex nuraghes is the Nuraghe Santu Antine near the village of Torralba, in northern Sardinia. Other famous nuraghes are near Alghero (Nuraghe Palmavera), Macomer, Abbasanta (see Losa), Orroli (Nuraghe Arrubiu), Gonnesa (Nuraghe Seruci) and Villanovaforru (Nuraghe Genna Maria).

==Date and cultural significance==
The nuraghes were built between the middle of the Bronze Age (18th–15th centuries BCE) and the Late Bronze Age. The claim that the El-Ahwat structures from Israel might be related has been contested; those are dated to either the 12th or the 11th century BCE. The only buildings widely accepted as being related to nuraghes are the &quot;torri&quot; (plural of &quot;torre&quot;) from southern Corsica and the talaiots from Menorca and Majorca.

According to Massimo Pallottino, an Italian archaeologist specialized in Etruscology, the architecture produced by the Nuragic civilization was the most advanced of any in the western Mediterranean during this epoch, including those in the regions of Magna Graecia. Of the 7,000 extant nuraghes, only a few have been scientifically excavated.
