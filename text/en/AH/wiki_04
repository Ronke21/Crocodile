<text>A water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work.

Water turbines were developed in the 19th century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grids. Now, they are mostly used for electric power generation.
Water turbines are mostly found in dams to generate electric power from water potential energy.

==History==
Water wheels have been used for hundreds of years for industrial power. Their main shortcoming is size, which limits the flow rate and head that can be harnessed. The migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years. Development occurred during the Industrial Revolution, using scientific principles and methods. They also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time.

=== Swirl ===
The word turbine was introduced by the French engineer Claude Burdin in the early 19th century and is derived from the Greek word &quot;τύρβη&quot; for &quot;whirling&quot; or a &quot;vortex&quot;. The main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a swirl component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor. This additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power. They could process more water by spinning faster and could harness much greater heads. (Later, impulse turbines were developed which didn&#x27;t use swirl.)

=== Timeline ===


The earliest known water turbines date to the Roman Empire. Two helix-turbine mill sites of almost identical design were found at Chemtou and Testour, modern-day Tunisia, dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. The horizontal water wheel with angled blades was installed at the bottom of a water-filled, circular shaft. The water from the mill race entered the pit tangentially, creating a swirling water column which made the fully submerged wheel act like a true turbine.

Fausto Veranzio in his book &quot;Machinae Novae&quot; (1595) described a vertical axis mill with a rotor similar to that of a Francis turbine.

Johann Segner developed a reactive water turbine (Segner wheel) in the mid-18th century in Kingdom of Hungary. It had a horizontal axis and was a precursor to modern water turbines. It is a very simple machine that is still produced today for use in small hydro sites. Segner worked with Euler on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design. In the 18th century, a Dr. Robert Barker invented a similar reaction hydraulic turbine that became popular as a lecture-hall demonstration. The only known surviving example of this type of engine used in power production, dating from 1851, is found at Hacienda Buena Vista in Ponce, Puerto Rico.

In 1820, Jean-Victor Poncelet developed an inward-flow turbine.

In 1826, Benoît Fourneyron developed an outward-flow turbine. This was an efficient machine (~80%) that sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension. The stationary outlet also had curved guides.

In 1844, Uriah A. Boyden developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine. Its runner shape was similar to that of a Francis turbine.

In 1849, James B. Francis improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90% efficiency. He also conducted sophisticated tests and developed engineering methods for water turbine design. The Francis turbine, named for him, is the first modern water turbine. It is still the most widely used water turbine in the world today. The Francis turbine is also called a radial flow turbine, since water flows from the outer circumference towards the centre of runner.

Inward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design. As the water swirls inward, it accelerates, and transfers energy to the runner. Water pressure decreases to atmospheric, or in some cases subatmospheric, as the water passes through the turbine blades and loses energy.

In 1876, John B. McCormick, building on Francis&#x27;s designs, demonstrated the first modern mixed-flow turbine with the development of the Hercules turbine, initially manufactured by the Holyoke Machine Company and subsequently improved upon by engineers in Germany and the United States. The design effectively combined the inward flow principles of the Francis design with the downward discharge of the Jonval turbine, with flow inward at the inlet, axial through the wheel&#x27;s body, and slightly outward at the outlet. Initially performing optimally at 90% efficiency at lower speeds, this design would see many improvements in the subsequent decades in derivatives under names like &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Risdon&quot;, &quot;Samson&quot; and &quot;New American,&quot; ushering in a new era of American turbine engineering.

Water turbines, particularly in the Americas, would largely become standardized with the establishment of the Holyoke Testing Flume, described as the first modern hydraulic laboratory in the United States by Robert E. Horton and Clemens Herschel, the latter of which would serve as its chief engineer for a time. Initially created in 1872 by James B. Emerson from the testing flumes of Lowell, after 1880 the Holyoke, Massachusetts hydraulic laboratory was standardized by Herschel, who used it to develop the Venturi meter, the first accurate means of measuring large flows, to properly measure water power efficiency by different turbine models. While skepticism of certain weir calculations were held by European hydrologists, the facility allowed for standard efficiency testing among major manufacturers through 1932, by which time more modern facilities and methods had proliferated.

Around 1890, the modern fluid bearing was invented, now universally used to support heavy water turbine spindles. As of 2002, fluid bearings appear to have a mean time between failures of more than 1300 years.

Around 1913, Viktor Kaplan created the Kaplan turbine, a propeller-type machine. It was an evolution of the Francis turbine and revolutionized the ability to develop low-head hydro sites.

=== New concept ===

All common water machines until the late 19th century (including water wheels) were basically reaction machines; water &quot;pressure&quot; head acted on the machine and produced work. A reaction turbine needs to fully contain the water during energy transfer.

In 1866, California millwright Samuel Knight invented a machine that took the impulse system to a new level. Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields, Knight developed a bucketed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet, which had converted a high head (hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or penstock) of water to kinetic energy. This is called an impulse or tangential turbine. The water&#x27;s velocity, roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery, does a U-turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at low velocity.

In 1879, Lester Pelton, experimenting with a Knight Wheel, developed a Pelton wheel (double bucket design), which exhausted the water to the side, eliminating some energy loss of the Knight wheel which exhausted some water back against the center of the wheel. In about 1895, William Doble improved on Pelton&#x27;s half-cylindrical bucket form with an elliptical bucket that included a cut in it to allow the jet a cleaner bucket entry. This is the modern form of the Pelton turbine which today achieves up to 92% efficiency. Pelton had been quite an effective promoter of his design and although Doble took over the Pelton company he did not change the name to Doble because it had brand name recognition.

Turgo and cross-flow turbines were later impulse designs.

== Theory of operation ==
Flowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner, creating a force on the blades. Since the runner is spinning, the force acts through a distance (force acting through a distance is the definition of work). In this way, energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine.

Water turbines are divided into two groups: reaction turbines and impulse turbines.

The precise shape of water turbine blades is a function of the supply pressure of water, and the type of impeller selected.

=== Reaction turbines ===
Reaction turbines are acted on by water, which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy. They must be encased to contain the water pressure (or suction), or they must be fully submerged in the water flow.

Newton&#x27;s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.

Most water turbines in use are reaction turbines and are used in low (&lt;) and medium () head applications. In reaction turbine, pressure drop occurs in both fixed and moving blades. It is largely used in dam and large power plants.

=== Impulse turbines ===
Impulse turbines change the velocity of a water jet. The jet pushes on the turbine&#x27;s curved blades which changes the direction of the flow. The resulting change in momentum (impulse) causes a force on the turbine blades. Since the turbine is spinning, the force acts through a distance (work) and the diverted water flow is left with diminished energy. An impulse turbine is one in which the pressure of the fluid flowing over the rotor blades is constant and all the work output is due to the change in kinetic energy of the fluid.

Prior to hitting the turbine blades, the water&#x27;s pressure (potential energy) is converted to kinetic energy by a nozzle and focused on the turbine. No pressure change occurs at the turbine blades, and the turbine doesn&#x27;t require a housing for operation.

Newton&#x27;s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.

Impulse turbines are often used in very high (&gt;300m/1000 ft) head applications.

=== Power ===
The power available in a stream is;

formula_1

where:

*formula_2 power (J/s or watts)
*formula_3 turbine efficiency
*formula_4 density of fluid (kg/m3)
*formula_5 acceleration of gravity (9.81 m/s2)
*formula_6 head (m). For still water, this is the difference in height between the inlet and outlet surfaces. Moving water has an additional component added to account for the kinetic energy of the flow. The total head equals the &quot;pressure head&quot; plus &quot;velocity head&quot;.
*formula_7= flow rate (m3/s)

=== Pumped-storage hydroelectricity ===
Some water turbines are designed for pumped-storage hydroelectricity. They can reverse flow and operate as a pump to fill a high reservoir during off-peak electrical hours, and then revert to a water turbine for power generation during peak electrical demand. This type of turbine is usually a Deriaz or Francis turbine in design.

This type of system is used in El Hierro, one of the Canary Islands: &quot;When wind production exceeds demand, excess energy will pump water from a lower reservoir at the bottom of a volcanic cone to an upper reservoir at the top of the volcano 700 meters above sea level. The lower reservoir stores 150,000 cubic meters of water. The stored water acts as a battery. The maximum storage capacity is 270 MWh. When demand rises and there is not enough wind power, the water will be released to four hydroelectric turbines with a total capacity of 11 MW.&quot;

=== Efficiency ===
Large modern water turbines operate at mechanical efficiencies greater than 90%.

*Kaplan turbine
*Tyson turbine
*Deriaz turbine
*Gorlov helical turbine

===Impulse turbine===
*Water wheel

*Cross-flow turbine (also known as the Bánki-Michell turbine, or Ossberger turbine)
*Jonval turbine
*Reverse overshot water-wheel
*Screw turbine

== Design and application ==
Turbine selection is based on the available water head, and less so on the available flow rate. In general, impulse turbines are used for high head sites, and reaction turbines are used for low head sites. Kaplan turbines with adjustable blade pitch are well-adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions, since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flows.

Small turbines (mostly under 10 MW) may have horizontal shafts, and even fairly large bulb-type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal. Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes best use of the available head, and makes installation of a generator more economical. Pelton wheels may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because the size of the machine is so much less than the available head. Some impulse turbines use multiple jets per runner to balance shaft thrust. This also allows for the use of a smaller turbine runner, which can decrease costs and mechanical losses.

=== Typical range of heads ===

• Screw turbine
• VLH turbine
• Kaplan turbine
• Francis turbine
• Pelton wheel
• Turgo turbine

50 &lt; &quot;H&quot; &lt; 250

=== Specific speed ===
The specific speed formula_8 of a turbine characterizes the turbine&#x27;s shape in a way that is not related to its size. This allows a new turbine design to be scaled from an existing design of known performance. The specific speed is also the main criteria for matching a specific hydro site with the correct turbine type.
The specific speed is the speed with which the turbine turns for a particular discharge Q, with unit head and thereby is able to produce unit power.

=== Affinity laws ===
Affinity laws allow the output of a turbine to be predicted based on model tests. A miniature replica of a proposed design, about one foot (0.3 m) in diameter, can be tested and the laboratory measurements applied to the final application with high confidence. Affinity laws are derived by requiring similitude between the test model and the application.

Flow through the turbine is controlled either by a large valve or by wicket gates arranged around the outside of the turbine runner. Differential head and flow can be plotted for a number of different values of gate opening, producing a hill diagram used to show the efficiency of the turbine at varying conditions.

=== Runaway speed ===
The runaway speed of a water turbine is its speed at full flow, and no shaft load. The turbine will be designed to survive the mechanical forces of this speed. The manufacturer will supply the runaway speed rating.

== Control systems ==
Different designs of governors have been used since the mid-18th century to control the speeds of the water turbines. A variety of flyball systems, or first-generation governors, were used during the first 100 years of water turbine speed controls. In early flyball systems, the flyball component countered by a spring acted directly to the valve of the turbine or the wicket gate to control the amount of water that enters the turbines. Newer systems with mechanical governors started around 1880. An early mechanical governor is a servomechanism that comprises a series of gears that use the turbine&#x27;s speed to drive the flyball and turbine&#x27;s power to drive the control mechanism. The mechanical governors were continued to be enhanced in power amplification through the use of gears and the dynamic behavior. By 1930, the mechanical governors had many parameters that could be set on the feedback system for precise controls. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace the mechanical governors. In the electronic governors, also known as second-generation governors, the flyball was replaced by rotational speed sensor but the controls were still done through analog systems. In the modern systems, also known as third-generation governors, the controls are performed digitally by algorithms that are programmed to the computer of the governor.

===Wicket gate===
A wicket gate, or guide vane, is a ring of gates (or vanes) surrounding a water turbine which control the flow of water entering it; varying the aperture between them manages the rate of the turbine&#x27;s spin, and thereby the amount of electricity generated.

== Turbine blade materials ==
Given that the turbine blades in a water turbine are constantly exposed to water and dynamic forces, they need to have high corrosion resistance and strength. The most common material used in overlays on carbon steel runners in water turbines are austenitic steel alloys that have 17% to 20% chromium to increase stability of the film which improves aqueous corrosion resistance. The chromium content in these steel alloys exceed the minimum of 12% chromium required to exhibit some atmospheric corrosion resistance. Having a higher chromium concentration in the steel alloys allows for a much longer lifespan of the turbine blades. Currently, the blades are made of martensitic stainless steels which have high strength compared to austenitic stainless steels by a factor of 2. Along with corrosion resistance and strength, weld-ability and density are important criteria for turbine blade material selection. Greater weld-ability allows for easier and high quality repairs. Low density allows higher efficiency through easier rotation. The most common material used in Kaplan Turbine blades are stainless steel alloys (SS). The martensitic stainless steel alloys have high strength that allow thinner sections than standard carbon steel; reduced mass enhances the hydrodynamic flow conditions and efficiency of the water turbine. The SS(13Cr-4Ni) has been shown to have improved erosion resistance at all angles of attack through the process of laser peening. It is important to minimize erosion in order to maintain high efficiencies because erosion negatively impacts the hydraulic profile of the blades which reduces the relative ease of rotation.

== Maintenance ==
Turbines are designed to run for decades with very little maintenance of the main elements; overhaul intervals are on the order of several years. Maintenance of the runners and parts exposed to water include removal, inspection, and repair of worn parts.

Normal wear and tear includes pitting corrosion from cavitation, fatigue cracking, and abrasion from suspended solids in the water. Steel elements are repaired by welding, usually with stainless steel rods. Damaged areas are cut or ground out, then welded back up to their original or an improved profile. Old turbine runners may have a significant amount of stainless steel added this way by the end of their lifetime. Elaborate welding procedures may be used to achieve the highest quality repairs.

Other elements requiring inspection and repair during overhauls include bearings, packing box and shaft sleeves, servomotors, cooling systems for the bearings and generator coils, seal rings, wicket gate linkage elements and all surfaces.
== Environmental impact ==
Water turbines are generally considered a clean power producer, as the turbine causes essentially no change to the water. They use a renewable energy source and are designed to operate for decades. They produce significant amounts of the world&#x27;s electrical supply.

Negative consequences of water turbines are mostly associated with the dams normally required for their operation. Dams alter the natural ecology of rivers, potentially killing fish, stopping migrations, and disrupting livelihoods. Dams also cause less obvious, but potentially serious, consequences, including increased evaporation of water (especially in arid regions), and changes to water temperature and flow patterns. In the United States, it is now illegal to block the migration of fish, so fish ladders for species such as salmon and white sturgeon must be provided by dam builders.

<doc id="34054" wikidata="Q1433597" url="?curid=34054" title="White Wolf Publishing">
<text>White Wolf Entertainment AB, formerly White Wolf Publishing, was an American roleplaying game and book publisher. The company was founded in 1991 as a merger between Lion Rampant and &quot;White Wolf Magazine&quot; (est. 1986 in Rocky Face, GA; it later became &quot;White Wolf Inphobia&quot;), and was initially led by Mark Rein-Hagen of the former and Steve Wieck and Stewart Wieck of the latter. White Wolf Publishing, Inc. merged with CCP Games in 2006. White Wolf Publishing operated as an imprint of CCP hf, but ceased in-house production of any material, instead licensing their properties to other publishers. It was announced in October 2015 that White Wolf had been acquired from CCP by Paradox Interactive. In November 2018, after most of its staff were dismissed for making controversial statements, it was announced that White Wolf would no longer function as an entity separate from Paradox Interactive.

The name &quot;White Wolf&quot; originates from Michael Moorcock&#x27;s works.

==Overview==
White Wolf published a line of several different but overlapping games set in the &quot;World of Darkness&quot;, a &quot;modern gothic&quot; world that, while seemingly similar to the real world, is home to supernatural terrors, ancient conspiracies, and several approaching apocalypses. The company also published the high fantasy &quot;Exalted&quot; RPG, the modern mythic &quot;Scion&quot;, and d20 system material under their Sword &amp; Sorcery imprint, including such titles as the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; gothic horror campaign setting &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, and Monte Cook&#x27;s &quot;Arcana Unearthed&quot; series. In order to complement the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; game line, a LARP system dubbed &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre&quot; has been published.

White Wolf also released several series of novels based on the Old World of Darkness, all of which are currently out of print (although many are coming back into availability via print-on-demand).

White Wolf also ventured in the collectible card game market with &quot;Arcadia&quot;, &quot;Rage&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (formerly &quot;Jyhad&quot;). &quot;V:TES&quot;, perhaps the most successful card game, was originally published by Wizards of the Coast in 1994, but was abandoned just two years later after a revamped base set, name change and three expansions were published. White Wolf acquired the rights to the game in 2000, even though no new material had been produced for the game in over four years. Since then, several &quot;V:TES&quot; expansions have been released, and the game was the only official source of material for the Old World of Darkness, until 2011 when the 20th Anniversary Edition of &quot;&quot; was published and the Onyx Path was announced.

Video games such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; are based on White Wolf&#x27;s role-playing game &quot;&quot;. There are also several .

===Merger and MMO===
On Saturday, 11 November 2006, White Wolf and CCP Games, the Icelandic MMO development company responsible for EVE Online, announced a merger between the two companies during the keynote address at the EVE Online Fanfest 2006. It was also revealed that a World of Darkness MMORPG was already in the planning stages. This game was cancelled in April 2014 after nine years of development.

===The Onyx Path===

At GenCon 2012 it was announced that CCP Games/White Wolf would not continue to produce table-top RPGs . Onyx Path Publishing, a new company by White Wolf Creative Director Richard Thomas, purchased the Trinity games and Scion from CCP and became licensee for the production of World of Darkness titles (classic and new), as well as Exalted. Onyx Path does not, however, hold a license to the Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre titles.

===Purchase by Paradox Interactive===
On Thursday, 29 October 2015, Paradox Interactive and CCP announced that Paradox had purchased White Wolf and all of its intellectual properties. Tobias Sjögren would serve as the CEO of the revived company, which would remain a subsidiary of Paradox. Martin Ericsson, formerly a developer on the World of Darkness MMO, served in the &quot;Lead Storyteller&quot; role for the company.

In November 2018, as a result of backlash generated by material pertaining to &quot;murder of gay Chechens&quot; published in a &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade Fifth Edition&quot; source book as well as the inclusion of optional neo-Nazi aesthetic in the Brujah vampire clan, it was announced that White Wolf would no longer function as an entity separate from its parent company, and would cease developing and publishing products internally.

==RPG products==
===The Old or Classic World of Darkness game lines===
The games of this series use White Wolf&#x27;s Storyteller System. Several games inspired spinoffs in the form of historical period settings such as the Dark Ages.

In addition to those game lines a series of books was produced under the title &quot;World of Darkness&quot;. These provided stand-alone materials for multiple game lines with the focus on a specific region or theme, e.g. &quot;WoD: Blood-Dimmed Tides&quot; (about the oceans), &quot;WoD: Combat&quot; (an alternative &#x27;crossover&#x27; combat system to resolve contradictory mechanics and add some sophistication), &quot;WoD: Tokyo&quot; and &quot;WoD: Mafia&quot;.

For the Third Edition of &quot;Ars Magica&quot;, White Wolf connected that game&#x27;s pseudohistorical setting to the future &quot;World of Darkness&quot; setting. This was a simple adjustment (since the core premise of both settings is &#x27;Earth as we know it&#x27; + &#x27;supernatural fiction is reality&#x27;) and particularly suited to the &#x27;Tremere connection&#x27; between a clan of vampires from the original &quot;Vampire&quot; and a House of magi in the &quot;Order of Hermes&quot; (the central organization of &quot;Ars Magica&quot; as well as one of the &#x27;Traditions&#x27; in &quot;)&quot;.

===The Chronicles of Darkness game lines===
The games of this series use White Wolf&#x27;s newer Storytelling System. For over a decade it was also known as &quot;World of Darkness,&quot; causing it to be referred to as the &quot;new World of Darkness&quot; or nWoD to distinguish it from the prior line of games. In December 2015, it was renamed &quot;Chronicles of Darkness&quot; by its new publisher Onyx Path in order to more clearly distinguish the two given Paradox Entertainment&#x27;s intention to reboot the original setting.

===Age of Sorrows===
*&quot;Exalted&quot;

===Trinity Universe===
Trinity was originally named Æon, but a trademark issue with Viacom related to the MTV show &quot;Æon Flux&quot; resulted in a name change.

*&quot;Trinity&quot; (science fiction and psychics)
*&quot;Aberrant&quot; (near-future superheroes)
*&quot;Adventure!&quot; (1920s pulp heroes)

===Other===
* &quot;Pendragon&quot;
* &quot;Scion&quot;
* &quot;Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game&quot;
* &quot;Engel&quot;

==Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre (LARP)==
The majority of the Old World of Darkness games were adapted into the original Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre format for live-action roleplaying. Product lines in this era include:

Subsequently, the Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre was revamped for the New World of Darkness. A core &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre&quot; rulebook was published as the LARP analogue to the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; core rulebook, with several Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre adaptations following in suit: &quot;The Requiem&quot;, &quot;The Forsaken&quot;, and &quot;The Awakening&quot; each adapted their respective namesakes to the new system of MET rules. The license to produce Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre content was acquired by By Night Studios in 2013.

===By Night Studios===
At Midwinter Gaming Convention in 2013 it was announced that as a result of CCP Games&#x27; discontinuation of publishing, By Night Studios had acquired the license to all Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre titles. In May 2013, By Night Studios launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to rebuild the Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade product specifically for the Live-Action Role Play audience. The book was published in December 2013. This was followed by &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre: Werewolf the Apocalypse&quot; in October 2016 and &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre: Changeling the Dreaming&quot; in 2020.

In 2019, By Night Studios released &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre: Vampire the Masquerade, Volume II: Issue 1&quot;, intended to be the first in a series of releases featuring new character options. Eventually each of these releases would be collected within a full edition of Volume II. This plan was eventually scrapped in favor of releasing the full version of &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre: Vampire the Masquerade, Volume 2&quot; in October 2021, featuring the additional new rules that were slated to appear in Issues 2 and 3.

After publication of &quot;Vampire the Masquerade, Volume 2&quot;, work began &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre: Werewolf the Apocalypse, Volume 2&quot;, which was written but never scheduled for formal release. In February 2023, the manuscript was released on the By Night Studios website for free.

In May 2023, By Night Studios announced a new &quot;Laws of the Night&quot;, featuring new live action rules based on &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade, Fifth Edition&quot;. A crowdfunding campaign was launched and successfully raised $111,165 with a target goal of $25,000. The PDF version of the book was released online in September 2023, with physical copies scheduled to ship in 2024.

By Night Studios also published &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre: Vampire the Masquerade: War of Ages&quot; in 2023, which took the setting for &quot;Vampire the Masquerade, Fifth Edition&quot; and re-imagined the game in the style of Nordic Live action role-playing games, focusing less on game mechanics in favor of a deeper focus on immersive role-playing.

==Fiction==
Starting in 1986, White Wolf published fiction in various formats, beginning with its eponymous magazine title (which ran 57 issues), then three comic book titles in 1987, and on to graphic novels, paperbacks and hardcover books. Works included novels and anthologies based on White Wolf&#x27;s games, as well as general fantasy and horror fiction. White Wolf printed several Elric of Melniboné collections by Michael Moorcock. The company also put out general fiction collections by Harlan Ellison, as well as several paperback editions of the &quot;Borderlands&quot; anthologies edited by Thomas F. Monteleone.

===Imprints and labels===
White Wolf had different imprints under which various books are published, most notably:

* Arthaus - products for which White Wolf serves as publisher, not developer
* Black Dog Game Factory - adult themed products (defunct)
* Sword and Sorcery Studios - products compatible with the d20 system by Wizards of the Coast

Black Dog Game Factory was also a fictional company in the World of Darkness, as detailed in the &quot;Subsidiaries: A Guide to Pentex&quot; game supplement.

==Reception==
White Wolf won the 2004 Silver Ennie Award for &quot;Best Publisher&quot;.

<doc id="34057" wikidata="Q366805" url="?curid=34057" title="William Congreve">
<text>William Congreve (24 January 1670 – 19 January 1729) was an English playwright, poet and Whig politician. His works, which form an important component of Restoration literature, were known for their use of satire and the comedy of manners genre. Notable plays he wrote include &quot;The Old Bachelor&quot; (1693), &quot;The Double Dealer&quot; (1693), &quot;Love for Love&quot; (1695), &quot;The Mourning Bride&quot; (1697) and &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (1700) which established him a great writer in the genre of comedy of manners. He died in London, and was buried at the Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey.

==Early life==
William Congreve was born in Bardsey Grange, on an estate near Ledston, West Riding of Yorkshire. Although Samuel Johnson disputed this, it has since been confirmed by a baptism entry for &quot;William, sonne of Mr. William Congreve, of Bardsey grange, baptised 10 February 1669&quot; [i.e. 1670 by the modern reckoning of the new year]. His parents were Colonel William Congreve (1637–1708) and Mary Browning (1636?–1715), who moved to London in 1672, then to the Irish port of Youghal.

Congreve was educated at Kilkenny College, where he met Jonathan Swift, and at Trinity College Dublin. He moved to London to study law at the Middle Temple, but preferred literature, drama, and the fashionable life. Congreve used the pseudonym Cleophil, under which he published &quot;Incognita: or, Love and Duty &quot; in 1692. This early work, written when he was about 17 years of age, gained him recognition among men of letters and entry into the literary world. He became a disciple of John Dryden whom he met through gatherings of literary circles held at Will&#x27;s Coffeehouse in the Covent Garden district of London. Dryden supported him throughout his life, often composing complimentary introductions for his publications.

Congreve was distantly related to Lady Elizabeth Hastings, whose family owned Ledston and was part of the London intelligentsia. He wrote a number of articles about her in the &quot;Tatler&quot; magazine.

==Literary career==
William Congreve shaped the English comedy of manners through his use of satire and well-written dialogue. Congreve achieved fame in 1693 when he wrote some of the most popular English plays of the Restoration period. This period was distinguished by the fact that female roles were beginning to be played predominantly by women, which was evident in Congreve&#x27;s work. One of Congreve&#x27;s favourite actresses was Mrs. Anne Bracegirdle, who performed many of the female lead roles in his plays.

His first play &quot;The Old Bachelor&quot;, written to amuse himself while convalescing, was produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1693. It was recognized as a success, and ran for a two-week period when it opened. Congreve&#x27;s mentor John Dryden gave the production rave reviews and proclaimed it to be a brilliant first piece. The second play to be produced was called &quot;The Double-Dealer&quot; which was not nearly as successful as the first production. By the age of 30, he had written four comedies, including &quot;Love for Love&quot; (premiered 30 April 1695) staged at the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Theatre, which was nearly as well-received as his first major success, and &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (premiered March 1700). This play was a failure at the time of production but is seen as one of his masterpieces today, and is still revived. He wrote one tragedy, &quot;The Mourning Bride&quot; (1697) which was extremely popular at the time of creation but is now one of his least regarded dramas. After the production of &quot;Love for Love,&quot; Congreve became one of the managers for the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1695. During that time, he wrote public occasional verse. As a result of his success and literary merit, he was awarded one of the five positions of commissioner for licensing hackney coaches.

Congreve&#x27;s career as a playwright was successful but brief. He only wrote five plays, authored from 1693 to 1700, in total. This was partly in response to changes in taste, as the public turned away from the sort of high-brow sexual comedy of manners in which he specialized. Congreve may have been forced off the stage due to growing concerns about the morality of his theatrical comedies. He reportedly was particularly stung by a critique written by Jeremy Collier (&quot;A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage&quot;), to the point that he wrote a long reply, &quot;Amendments of Mr. Collier&#x27;s False and Imperfect Citations.&quot; Although no longer on the stage, Congreve continued his literary art. He wrote the librettos for two operas that were being created at the time, and he translated the works of Molière.

As a member of the Whig Kit-Kat Club, Congreve&#x27;s career shifted to the political sector, and even a political appointment in Jamaica in 1714 by George I. Congreve continued to write, although his style changed greatly. During his time in Jamaica, he wrote poetry instead of full-length dramatic productions and translated the works of Homer, Juvenal, Ovid, and Horace.

==Later life==
Congreve withdrew from the theatre and lived the rest of his life on residuals from his early work, the royalties received when his plays were produced, as well as his private income. His output from 1700 was restricted to the occasional poem and some translation (notably Molière&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur de Pourceaugnac&quot;). He collaborated with Vanbrugh on a 1704 English version of the play called &quot;Squire Trelooby&quot;. Congreve never married; in his own era and through subsequent generations, he was famous for his friendships with prominent actresses and noblewomen for whom he wrote major parts in all his plays. These women included Anne Bracegirdle and Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, daughter of the famous general, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Congreve and Henrietta most probably met some time before 1703 and the duchess subsequently had a daughter, Mary (1723–1764), who was believed to be his child. Upon his death, he left his entire fortune to the Duchess of Marlborough.

As early as 1710, Congreve suffered both from gout and from cataracts on his eyes. He was involved in a carriage accident in late September 1728 from which he never recovered (having probably received an internal injury); he died in London in January 1729, and was buried in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey.

==Famous lines==

Two of Congreve&#x27;s phrases from &quot;The Mourning Bride&quot; (1697) have become famous, although sometimes misquoted or misattributed to William Shakespeare.
*&quot;Musick has charms to soothe a savage breast&quot;, which is the first line of the play, spoken by Almeria in Act I, Scene I. This is often rendered as: &quot;Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast&quot; or even &quot;savage beast&quot;. On 9 September 1956, the line was recited in front of the largest television audience at that time, some 60.7 million viewers, by Charles Laughton, prior to bidding the audience good night on Elvis Presley&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which Laughton was guest hosting. 
*&quot;Heav&#x27;n has no rage, like love to hatred turn&#x27;d, Nor hell a fury, like a woman scorned&quot;, spoken by Zara in Act III, Scene VIII, but paraphrased as &quot;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned&quot;. This was also referenced in Squid Game Season 1 Netflix series’ after contestant 101 died from a Suicide attack in the Glass panel, after the man betrayed the wild woman, when one of the VIPs confused him with a student of the bard,confused him with Shakespeare, and the Eagle VIP corrected him for it.

Congreve coined another famous phrase in &quot;Love for Love&quot; (1695):
*&quot;O fie, Miss, you must not kiss and tell.&quot;

<doc id="34059" wikidata="Q26013" url="?curid=34059" title="War of 1812">
<text>The War of 1812 was fought by the United States and its allies against the United Kingdom and its allies in North America. It began when the United States declared war on Britain on 18 June 1812. Although peace terms were agreed upon in the December 1814 Treaty of Ghent, the war did not officially end until the peace treaty was ratified by the United States Congress on 17 February 1815.

AngloAmerican tensions stemmed from long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy, which resisted U.S. colonial settlement in the Old Northwest. In 1807, these tensions escalated after the Royal Navy began enforcing tighter restrictions on American trade with France and impressed sailors who were originally British subjects, even those who had acquired American citizenship. Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they were divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against. News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway.

At sea, the Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 and 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American invasions on Upper Canada. The April 1814 abdication of Napoleon allowed the British to send additional forces to North America and reinforce the Royal Navy blockade, crippling the American economy. In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalize their opposition to the war.

In August 1814, British troops captured Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. In the Southeastern United States, American forces and Indian allies defeated an anti-American faction of the Muscogee. The Treaty of Ghent was signed in December 1814, though it would be February before word reached the United States and the treaty was fully ratified. In the interim, American troops led by Andrew Jackson repulsed a major British attack on New Orleans.

== Origins ==

== Forces ==
=== American ===
During the years 1810–1812, American naval ships were divided into two major squadrons, with the &quot;northern division&quot;, based at New York, commanded by Commodore John Rodgers, and the &quot;southern division&quot;, based at Norfolk, commanded by Commodore Stephen Decatur.

Although not much of a threat to Canada in 1812, the United States Navy was a well-trained and professional force comprising over 5,000 sailors and marines. It had 14 ocean-going warships with three of its five &quot;super-frigates&quot; non-operational at the onset of the war. Its principal problem was lack of funding, as many in Congress did not see the need for a strong navy. The biggest ships in the American navy were frigates and there were no ships-of-the-line capable of engaging in a fleet action with the Royal Navy. On the high seas, the Americans pursued a strategy of commerce raiding, capturing or sinking British merchantmen with their frigates and privateers. The Navy was largely concentrated on the Atlantic coast before the war as it had only two gunboats on Lake Champlain, one brig on Lake Ontario and another brig in Lake Erie when the war began.

The United States Army was initially much larger than the British Army in North America. Many men carried their own long rifles while the British were issued muskets, except for one unit of 500 riflemen. Leadership was inconsistent in the American officer corps as some officers proved themselves to be outstanding, but many others were inept, owing their positions to political favours. Congress was hostile to a standing army and the government called out 450,000 men from the state militias during the war. The state militias were poorly trained, armed, and led. The failed invasion of Lake Champlain led by General Dearborn illustrates this. The British Army soundly defeated the Maryland and Virginia militias at the Battle of Bladensburg in 1814 and President Madison commented &quot;I could never have believed so great a difference existed between regular troops and a militia force, if I had not witnessed the scenes of this day&quot;.

=== British ===
The United States was only a secondary concern to Britain, so long as the Napoleonic Wars continued with France. In 1813, France had 80 ships-of-the-line and was building another 35. Containing the French fleet was the main British naval concern, leaving only the ships on the North American and Jamaica Stations immediately available. In Upper Canada, the British had the Provincial Marine. While largely unarmed, they were essential for keeping the army supplied since the roads were abysmal in Upper Canada. At the onset of war, the Provincial Marine had four small armed vessels on Lake Ontario, three on Lake Erie and one on Lake Champlain. The Provincial Marine greatly outnumbered anything the Americans could bring to bear on the Great Lakes.

When the war broke out, the British Army in North America numbered 9,777 men in regular units and fencibles. While the British Army was engaged in the Peninsular War, few reinforcements were available. Although the British were outnumbered, the long-serving regulars and fencibles were better trained and more professional than the hastily expanded United States Army. The militias of Upper Canada and Lower Canada were initially far less effective, but substantial numbers of full-time militia were raised during the war and played pivotal roles in several engagements, including the Battle of the Chateauguay which caused the Americans to abandon the Saint Lawrence River theatre.

=== Indigenous peoples ===
The highly decentralized bands and tribes considered themselves allies of, and not subordinates to, the British or the Americans. Various tribes fighting with United States forces provided them with their &quot;most effective light troops&quot; while the British needed Indigenous allies to compensate for their numerical inferiority. The Indigenous allies of the British, Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy in the west and Iroquois in the east, avoided pitched battles and relied on irregular warfare, including raids and ambushes that took advantage of their knowledge of terrain. In addition, they were highly mobile, able to march a day.

Their leaders sought to fight only under favourable conditions and would avoid any battle that promised heavy losses, doing what they thought best for their tribes. The Indigenous fighters saw no issue with withdrawing if needed to save casualties. They always sought to surround an enemy, where possible, to avoid being surrounded and make effective use of the terrain. Their main weapons were a mixture of muskets, rifles, bows, tomahawks, knives and swords as well as clubs and other melee weapons, which sometimes had the advantage of being quieter than guns.

== Declaration of war ==
On 1 June 1812, Madison sent a message to Congress recounting American grievances against Great Britain, though not specifically calling for a declaration of war. The House of Representatives then deliberated for four days behind closed doors before voting 79 to 49 (61%) in favour of the first declaration of war. The Senate concurred in the declaration by a 19 to 13 (59%) vote in favour. The declaration focused mostly on maritime issues, especially involving British blockades, with two thirds of the indictment devoted to such impositions, initiated by Britain&#x27;s Orders in Council. The conflict began formally on 18 June 1812, when Madison signed the measure into law. He proclaimed it the next day. This was the first time that the United States had formally declared war on another nation, and the Congressional vote was approved by the smallest margin of any declaration of war in America&#x27;s history. None of the 39 Federalists in Congress voted in favour of the war, while other critics referred to it as &quot;Mr. Madison&#x27;s War&quot;. Just days after war had been declared, a small number of Federalists in Baltimore were attacked for printing anti-war views in a newspaper, which eventually led to over a month of deadly rioting in the city.

Prime Minister Spencer Perceval was assassinated in London on 11 May and Lord Liverpool came to power. He wanted a more practical relationship with the United States. On June 23, he issued a repeal of the Orders in Council, but the United States was unaware of this, as it took three weeks for the news to cross the Atlantic. On 28 June 1812, was dispatched from Halifax to New York under a flag of truce. She anchored off Sandy Hook on July 9 and left three days later carrying a copy of the declaration of war, British ambassador to the United States Augustus Foster and consul Colonel Thomas Henry Barclay. She arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia eight days later. The news of the declaration took even longer to reach London.

British commander Isaac Brock in Upper Canada received the news much faster. He issued a proclamation alerting citizens to the state of war and urging all military personnel &quot;to be vigilant in the discharge of their duty&quot;, so as to prevent communication with the enemy and to arrest anyone suspected of helping the Americans. He also ordered the British garrison of Fort St. Joseph on Lake Huron to capture the American fort at Mackinac. This fort commanded the passage between Lakes Huron and Michigan, which was important to the fur trade. The British garrison, aided by fur traders of the North West Company and Sioux, Menominee, Winnebago, Chippewa, and Ottawa, immediately besieged and captured Mackinac.

== Course of war ==

The war was conducted in several theatres:
# The Canada–United States border: the Great Lakes region (Old Northwest and Upper Canada), the Niagara Frontier, and the St. Lawrence River (New England and Lower Canada).
# At sea, principally the Atlantic Ocean, the American east coast and Maritime Canada.
# The Gulf Coast and Southern United States (including the Creek War in the Alabama River basin).
# The Mississippi River basin.

=== Unpreparedness ===
The war had been preceded by years of diplomatic dispute, yet neither side was ready for war when it came. Britain was heavily engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, most of the British Army was deployed in the Peninsular War in Portugal and Spain, and the Royal Navy was blockading most of the coast of Europe. The number of British regular troops present in Canada in July 1812 was officially 6,034, supported by additional Canadian militia. Throughout the war, the British War Secretary was Earl Bathurst, who had few troops to spare for reinforcing North America defences during the first two years of the war. He urged Lieutenant General George Prévost to maintain a defensive strategy. Prévost, who had the trust of the Canadians, followed these instructions and concentrated on defending Lower Canada at the expense of Upper Canada, which was more vulnerable to American attacks and allowed few offensive actions. Unlike campaigns along the east coast, Prevost had to operate with no support from the Royal Navy.

The United States was also not prepared for war. Madison had assumed that the state militias would easily seize Canada and that negotiations would follow. In 1812, the regular army consisted of fewer than 12,000 men. Congress authorized the expansion of the army to 35,000 men, but the service was voluntary and unpopular; it paid poorly and there were initially few trained and experienced officers. The militia objected to serving outside their home states, they were undisciplined and performed poorly against British forces when called upon to fight in unfamiliar territory. Multiple militias refused orders to cross the border and fight on Canadian soil.

American prosecution of the war suffered from its unpopularity, especially in New England where anti-war speakers were vocal. Massachusetts Congressmen Ebenezer Seaver and William Widgery were &quot;publicly insulted and hissed&quot; in Boston while a mob seized Plymouth&#x27;s Chief Justice Charles Turner on 3 August 1812 &quot;and kicked [him] through the town&quot;. The United States had great difficulty financing its war. It had disbanded its national bank, and private bankers in the Northeast were opposed to the war, but it obtained financing from London-based Barings Bank to cover overseas bond obligations. New England failed to provide militia units or financial support, which was a serious blow, and New England states made loud threats to secede as evidenced by the Hartford Convention. Britain exploited these divisions, opting to not blockade the ports of New England for much of the war and encouraging smuggling.

===War in the West===
====Invasions of Canada, 1812====
An American army commanded by William Hull invaded Upper Canada on July 12, arriving at Sandwich (Windsor, Ontario) after crossing the Detroit River. Hull issued a proclamation ordering all British subjects to surrender. The proclamation said that Hull wanted to free them from the &quot;tyranny&quot; of Great Britain, giving them the liberty, security, and wealth that his own country enjoyedunless they preferred &quot;war, slavery and destruction&quot;. He also threatened to kill any British soldier caught fighting alongside Indigenous fighters. Hull&#x27;s proclamation only helped to stiffen resistance to the American attacks as he lacked artillery and supplies.

Hull withdrew to the American side of the river on 7 August 1812 after receiving news of a Shawnee ambush on Major Thomas Van Horne&#x27;s 200 men, who had been sent to support the American supply convoy. Hull also faced a lack of support from his officers and fear among his troops of a possible massacre by unfriendly Indigenous forces. A group of 600 troops led by Lieutenant Colonel James Miller remained in Canada, attempting to supply the American position in the Sandwich area, with little success.

Major General Isaac Brock believed that he should take bold measures to calm the settler population in Canada and to convince the tribes that Britain was strong. He moved to Amherstburg near the western end of Lake Erie with reinforcements and attacked Detroit, using Fort Malden as his stronghold. Hull feared that the British possessed superior numbers, and Fort Detroit lacked adequate gunpowder and cannonballs to withstand a long siege. He agreed to surrender on 16 August. Hull also ordered the evacuation of Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to Fort Wayne, but Potawatomi warriors ambushed them and escorted them back to the fort where they were massacred on 15 August. The fort was subsequently burned.

Brock moved to the eastern end of Lake Erie, where American General Stephen Van Rensselaer was attempting a second invasion. The Americans attempted an attack across the Niagara River on 13 October, but they were defeated at Queenston Heights. However, Brock was killed during the battle and British leadership suffered after his death. American General Henry Dearborn made a final attempt to advance north from Lake Champlain, but his militia refused to go beyond American territory.

==== American Northwest, 1813 ====

After Hull surrendered Detroit, General William Henry Harrison took command of the American Army of the Northwest. He set out to retake the city, which was now defended by Colonel Henry Procter and Tecumseh. A detachment of Harrison&#x27;s army was defeated at Frenchtown along the River Raisin on 22 January 1813. Procter left the prisoners with an inadequate guard and his Potawatomie allies killed and scalped 60 captive Americans. The defeat ended Harrison&#x27;s campaign against Detroit, but &quot;Remember the River Raisin!&quot; became a rallying cry for the Americans.

In May 1813, Procter and Tecumseh set siege to Fort Meigs in northwestern Ohio. Tecumseh&#x27;s fighters ambushed American reinforcements who arrived during the siege, but the fort held out. The fighters eventually began to disperse, forcing Procter and Tecumseh to return to Canada. Along the way they attempted to storm Fort Stephenson, a small American post on the Sandusky River near Lake Erie. They were repulsed with serious losses, marking the end of the Ohio campaign.

Captain Oliver Hazard Perry fought the Battle of Lake Erie on 10 September 1813. His decisive victory at Put-in-Bay ensured American military control of the lake, improved American morale after a series of defeats and compelled the British to fall back from Detroit. This enabled General Harrison to launch another invasion of Upper Canada, which culminated in the American victory at the Battle of the Thames on 5 October 1813, where Tecumseh was killed.

==== American West, 1813–1815 ====
The Mississippi River valley was the western frontier of the United States in 1812. The territory acquired in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 contained almost no American settlements west of the Mississippi except around St. Louis and a few forts and trading posts in the Boonslick. Fort Belle Fontaine was an old trading post converted to an Army post in 1804 and this served as regional headquarters. Fort Osage, built in 1808 along the Missouri River, was the westernmost American outpost, but it was abandoned at the start of the war. Fort Madison was built along the Mississippi in Iowa in 1808 and had been repeatedly attacked by British-allied Sauk since its construction. The United States Army abandoned Fort Madison in September 1813 after the indigenous fighters attacked it and besieged itwith support from the British. This was one of the few battles fought west of the Mississippi. Black Hawk played a leadership role.

The American victory on Lake Erie and the recapture of Detroit isolated the British on Lake Huron. In the winter a Canadian party under Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall established a new supply line from York to Nottawasaga Bay on Georgian Bay. He arrived at Fort Mackinac on 18 May with supplies and more than 400 militia and Indians, then sent an expedition which successfully besieged and recaptured the key trading post of Prairie du Chien, on the Upper Mississippi. The Americans dispatched a substantial expedition to relieve the fort, but Sauk, Fox, and Kickapoo warriors under Black Hawk ambushed it and forced it to withdraw with heavy losses in the Battle of Rock Island Rapids. In September 1814, the Sauk, Fox, and Kickapoo, supported by part of Prairie du Chien&#x27;s British garrison, repulsed a second American force led by Major Zachary Taylor in the Battle of Credit Island. These victories enabled the Sauk, Fox, and Kickapoo to harass American garrisons further to the south, which led the Americans to abandon Fort Johnson, in central Illinois Territory. Consequently, the Americans lost control of almost all of Illinois Territory, although they held onto the St. Louis area and eastern Missouri. However, the Sauk raided even into these territories, clashing with American forces at the Battle of Cote Sans Dessein in April 1815 at the mouth of the Osage River in the Missouri Territory and the Battle of the Sink Hole in May 1815 near Fort Cap au Gris. This left the British and their Indian allies in control of most of modern Illinois and all of modern Wisconsin.

Meanwhile, the British were supplying the Indians in the Old Northwest from Montreal via Mackinac. On 3 July, the Americans sent a force of five vessels from Detroit to recapture Mackinac. A mixed force of regulars and volunteers from the militia landed on the island on 4 August. They did not attempt to achieve surprise, and Indians ambushed them in the brief Battle of Mackinac Island and forced them to re-embark. The Americans discovered the new base at Nottawasaga Bay and on 13 August they destroyed its fortifications and the schooner &quot;Nancy&quot; that they found there. They then returned to Detroit, leaving two gunboats to blockade Mackinac. On 4 September, the British surprised, boarded, and captured both gunboats. These engagements on Lake Huron left Mackinac under British control.

The British returned Mackinac and other captured territory to the United States after the war. Some British officers and Canadians objected to handing back Prairie du Chien and especially Mackinac under the terms of the Treaty of Ghent. However, the Americans retained the captured post at Fort Malden near Amherstburg until the British complied with the treaty. Fighting between Americans, the Sauk and other indigenous tribes continued through 1817, well after the war ended in the east.

=== War in the American Northeast ===

==== Niagara frontier, 1813 ====

Both sides placed great importance on gaining control of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River because of the difficulties of land-based communication. The British already had a small squadron of warships on Lake Ontario when the war began and had the initial advantage. The Americans established a Navy yard at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, New York, a port on Lake Ontario. Commodore Isaac Chauncey took charge of the thousands of sailors and shipwrights assigned there and recruited more from New York. They completed a warship (the corvette USS &quot;Madison&quot;) in 45 days. Ultimately, almost 3,000 men at the shipyard built 11 warships and many smaller boats and transports. Army forces were also stationed at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, where they camped out through the town, far surpassing the small population of 900. Officers were housed with families. Madison Barracks was later built at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor.

Having regained the advantage by their rapid building program, on 27 April 1813 Chauncey and Dearborn attacked York, the capital of Upper Canada. At the Battle of York, the outnumbered British regulars destroyed the fort and dockyard and retreated, leaving the militia to surrender the town. American soldiers set fire to the Legislature building, and looted and vandalized several government buildings and citizens&#x27; homes. The burning of York was pivotal for the British, and resulted in the absence of supplies that would be needed in later battles. 

On 25 May 1813, Fort Niagara and the American Lake Ontario squadron began bombarding Fort George. An American amphibious force assaulted Fort George on the northern end of the Niagara River on 27 May and captured it without serious losses. The British abandoned Fort Erie and headed towards Burlington Heights. The British position was close to collapsing in Upper Canada; the Iroquois considered changing sides and ignored a British appeal to come to their aid. However, the Americans did not pursue the retreating British forces until they had largely escaped and organized a counter-offensive at the Battle of Stoney Creek on 5 June. The British launched a surprise attack at 2a.m., leading to confused fighting and a strategic British victory.

The Americans pulled back to Forty Mile Creek rather than continue their advance into Upper Canada. At this point, the Six Nations of the Grand River began to come out to fight for the British as an American victory no longer seemed inevitable. The Iroquois ambushed an American patrol at Forty Mile Creek while the Royal Navy squadron based in Kingston sailed in and bombarded the American camp. General Dearborn retreated to Fort George, mistakenly believing that he was outnumbered and outgunned. British Brigadier General John Vincent was encouraged when about 800 Iroquois arrived to assist him.

An American force surrendered on 24 June to a smaller British force due to advance warning by Laura Secord at the Battle of Beaver Dams, marking the end of the American offensive into Upper Canada. British Major General Francis de Rottenburg did not have the strength to retake Fort George, so he instituted a blockade, hoping to starve the Americans into surrender. Meanwhile, Commodore James Lucas Yeo had taken charge of the British ships on the lake and mounted a counterattack, which the Americans repulsed at the Battle of Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. Thereafter, Chauncey and Yeo&#x27;s squadrons fought two indecisive actions, off the Niagara on 7 August and at Burlington Bay on 28 September. Neither commander was prepared to take major risks to gain a complete victory.

Late in 1813, the Americans abandoned the Canadian territory that they occupied around Fort George. They set fire to the village of Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) on 10 December 1813, incensing the Canadians. Many of the inhabitants were left without shelter, freezing to death in the snow. The British retaliated following their Capture of Fort Niagara on 18 December 1813. A British-Indian force led by Riall stormed the neighbouring town of Lewiston, New York on 19 December; four American civilians were killed by drunken Indians after the battle. A small force of Tuscarora warriors engaged Riall&#x27;s men during the battle, which allowed many residents of Lewiston to evacuate the village. The British and their Indian allies subsequently attacked and burned Buffalo on Lake Erie on 30 December 1813 in revenge for the American attack on Fort George and Newark in May.

==== St. Lawrence and Lower Canada, 1813 ====
The British were vulnerable along the stretch of the St. Lawrence that was between Upper Canada and the United States. In the winter of 1812–1813, the Americans launched a series of raids from Ogdensburg, New York that hampered British supply traffic up the river. On 21 February, George Prévost passed through Prescott, Ontario on the opposite bank of the river with reinforcements for Upper Canada. When he left the next day, the reinforcements and local militia attacked in the Battle of Ogdensburg and the Americans were forced to retreat.

The Americans made two more thrusts against Montreal in 1813. Major General Wade Hampton was to march north from Lake Champlain and join a force under General James Wilkinson that would sail from Sackett&#x27;s Harbor on Lake Ontario and descend the St. Lawrence. Hampton was delayed by road and supply problems and his intense dislike of Wilkinson limited his desire to support his plan. Charles de Salaberry defeated Hampton&#x27;s force of 4,000 at the Chateauguay River on 25 October with a smaller force of Canadian Voltigeurs and Mohawks. Salaberry&#x27;s force numbered only 339, but it had a strong defensive position. Wilkinson&#x27;s force of 8,000 set out on 17 October, but it was delayed by weather. Wilkinson heard that a British force was pursuing him under Captain William Mulcaster and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Wanton Morrison and landed near Morrisburg, Ontario by 10 November, about 150 kilometres (90 mi) from Montreal. On 11 November, his rear guard of 2,500 attacked Morrison&#x27;s force of 800 at Crysler&#x27;s Farm and was repulsed with heavy losses. He learned that Hampton could not renew his advance, retreated to the United States and settled into winter quarters. He resigned his command after a failed attack on a British outpost at Lacolle Mills.

==== Niagara and Plattsburgh campaigns, 1814 ====

The Americans again invaded the Niagara frontier. They had occupied southwestern Upper Canada after they defeated Colonel Henry Procter at Moraviantown in October and believed that taking the rest of the province would force the British to cede it to them. The end of the war with Napoleon in Europe in April 1814 meant that the British could deploy their army to North America, so the Americans wanted to secure Upper Canada to negotiate from a position of strength. They planned to invade via the Niagara frontier while sending another force to recapture Mackinac. They captured Fort Erie on 3 July 1814. Unaware of Fort Erie&#x27;s fall or of the size of the American force, the British general Phineas Riall engaged with Winfield Scott, who won against a British force at the Battle of Chippawa on 5 July. The American forces had been through a hard training under Winfield Scott and proved to the professionals under fire. They deployed in a shallow U formation, bringing flanking fire and well-aimed volleys against Riall&#x27;s men. Riall&#x27;s men were chased off the battlefield.

An attempt to advance further ended with the hard-fought but inconclusive Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane on July 25. The battle was fought several miles north of Chippawa Creek near Niagara Falls and is considered the bloodiest and costliest battle of the war. Both sides stood their ground as American General Jacob Brown pulled back to Fort George after the battle and the British did not pursue. Commanders Riall, Scott, Brown, and Drummond were all wounded; Scott&#x27;s wounds ended his service in the war.

The Americans withdrew but withstood a prolonged siege of Fort Erie. The British tried to storm Fort Erie on 14 August 1814, but they suffered heavy losses, losing 950 killed, wounded, and captured, compared to only 84 dead and wounded on the American side. The British were further weakened by exposure and shortage of supplies. Eventually, they raised the siege, but American Major General George Izard took over command on the Niagara front and followed up only halfheartedly. An American raid along the Grand River destroyed many farms and weakened British logistics. In October 1814, the Americans advanced into Upper Canada and engaged in skirmishes at Cook&#x27;s Mill. They pulled back when they heard of the approach of the new British warship , launched in Kingston that September and armed with 104 guns. The Americans lacked provisions and retreated across the Niagara after destroying Fort Erie.

Meanwhile, after Napoleon abdicated, 15,000 British troops were sent to North America under four of Wellington&#x27;s ablest brigade commanders. Fewer than half were veterans of the Peninsular War and the rest came from garrisons. Prévost was ordered to burn Sackett&#x27;s Harbor to gain naval control of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the Upper Lakes, and to defend Lower Canada from attack. He did defend Lower Canada but otherwise failed to achieve his objectives, so he decided to invade New York State. His army outnumbered the American defenders of Plattsburgh under General Alexander Macomb, but he was worried about his flanks and decided that he needed naval control of Lake Champlain. Upon reaching Plattsburgh, Prévost delayed the assault until Captain George Downie arrived in the hastily built 36-gun frigate . &quot;Confiance&quot; was not fully completed, and her raw crew had never worked together, but Prévost forced Downie into a premature attack.

The British squadron on the lake under was more evenly matched by the Americans under Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. At the Battle of Plattsburgh on 11 September 1814, &quot;Confiance&quot; suffered heavy casualties and struck her colours, and the rest of the British fleet retreated. Prevost, already alienated from his veteran officers by insisting on proper dress codes, now lost their confidence, while Macdonough emerged as a national hero.

The Americans now had control of Lake Champlain; Theodore Roosevelt later termed it &quot;the greatest naval battle of the war&quot;.

Prévost then turned back, to the astonishment of his senior officers, saying that it was too hazardous to remain on enemy territory after the loss of naval supremacy. He was recalled to London, where a naval court-martial decided that defeat had been caused principally by Prévost urging the squadron into premature action and then failing to afford the promised support from the land forces. He died suddenly, just before his court-martial was to convene. His reputation sank to a new low as Canadians claimed that their militia under Brock did the job but Prévost failed. However, recent historians have been kinder. Peter Burroughs argues that his preparations were energetic, well-conceived, and comprehensive for defending the Canadas with limited means and that he achieved the primary objective of preventing an American conquest.

==== Occupation of Maine ====

Maine, then part of Massachusetts, was a base for smuggling and illegal trade between the United States and the British. Until 1813, the region was generally quiet except for privateer actions near the coast. In September 1813, the United States Navy&#x27;s brig fought and captured the Royal Navy brig off Pemaquid Point.

On 11 July 1814, Thomas Masterman Hardy took Moose Island (Eastport, Maine) without a shot and the entire American garrison, 65 men of Fort Sullivan peacefully surrendered. The British temporarily renamed the captured fort &quot;Fort Sherbrooke&quot;. In September 1814, John Coape Sherbrooke led 3,000 British troops from his base in Halifax in the &quot;Penobscot Expedition&quot;. In 26 days, he raided and looted Hampden, Bangor and Machias, destroying or capturing 17 American ships. He won the Battle of Hampden, with two killed while the Americans had one killed. Retreating American forces were forced to destroy the frigate .

The British occupied the town of Castine and most of eastern Maine for the rest of the war, governing it under martial law and re-establishing the colony of New Ireland. The Treaty of Ghent returned this territory to the United States. When the British left in April 1815, they took £10,750 in tariff duties from Castine. This money, called the &quot;Castine Fund&quot;, was used to establish Dalhousie University in Halifax. Decisions about the islands in Passamaquoddy Bay were decided by joint commission in 1817. However, Machias Seal Island had been seized by the British as part of the occupation and was unaddressed by the commission. While kept by Britain/Canada, it remains in dispute to this day.

=== Chesapeake campaign ===

The strategic location of the Chesapeake Bay near the Potomac River made it a prime target for the British. Rear Admiral George Cockburn arrived there in March 1813 and was joined by Admiral Warren who took command of operations ten days later. Starting in March a squadron under Cockburn started a blockade of the mouth of the Bay at Hampton Roads harbour and raided towns along the Bay from Norfolk, Virginia to Havre de Grace, Maryland. In late April Cockburn landed at and set fire to Frenchtown, Maryland and destroyed ships that were docked there. In the following weeks he routed the local militias and looted and burned three other towns. Thereafter he marched to iron foundry at Principio and destroyed it along with sixty-eight cannons.

On 4 July 1813, Commodore Joshua Barney, an American Revolutionary War naval officer, convinced the Navy Department to build the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, a squadron of twenty barges powered by small sails or oars (sweeps) to defend the Chesapeake Bay. Launched in April 1814, the squadron was quickly cornered on the Patuxent River. While successful in harassing the Royal Navy, they could not stop subsequent British operations in the area.

==== Burning of Washington ====

In August 1814, a force of 2,500 soldiers under General Ross had just arrived in Bermuda aboard , three frigates, three sloops and ten other vessels. Released from the Peninsular War by victory, the British intended to use them for diversionary raids along the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. In response to Prévost&#x27;s request, they decided to employ this force, together with the naval and military units already on the station, to strike at the national capital. Anticipating the attack, valuable documents, including the original Constitution, were removed to Leesburg, Virginia. The British task force advanced up the Chesapeake, routing Commodore Barney&#x27;s flotilla of gunboats, carried out the Raid on Alexandria, landed ground forces that bested the US defenders at the Battle of Bladensburg, and carried out the Burning of Washington.

United States Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr. insisted that the British were going to attack Baltimore rather than Washington, even as British army and naval units were on their way to Washington. Brigadier General William H. Winder, who had burned several bridges in the area, assumed the British would attack Annapolis and was reluctant to engage because he mistakenly thought the British army was twice its size. The inexperienced state militia was easily routed in the Battle of Bladensburg, opening the route to Washington. British troops led by Major General Robert Ross, accompanied by Cockburn, the 3rd Brigade attacked and captured Washington with a force of 4,500. On 24 August, after the British had finished looting the interiors, Ross directed his troops to set fire to number of public buildings, including the White House and the United States Capitol. Extensive damage to the interiors and the contents of both were subsequently reported. US government and military officials fled to Virginia, while Secretary of the United States Navy William Jones ordered the Washington Navy Yard and a nearby fort to be razed in order to prevent its capture. Public buildings in Washington were destroyed by the British though private residences ordered spared.

==== Siege of Fort McHenry ====
After taking some munitions from the Washington Munitions depot, the British boarded their ships and moved on to their major target, the heavily fortified major city of Baltimore. Because some of their ships were held up in the Raid on Alexandria, they delayed their movement allowing Baltimore an opportunity to strengthen the fortifications and bring in new federal troops and state militia units. The &quot;Battle for Baltimore&quot; began with the British landing on 12 September 1814 at North Point, where they were met by American militia further up the Patapsco Neck peninsula. An exchange of fire began, with casualties on both sides. The British Army commander Major Gen. Robert Ross was killed by snipers. The British paused, then continued to march northwestward to face the stationed Maryland and Baltimore City militia units at Godly Wood. The Battle of North Point was fought for several afternoon hours in a musketry and artillery duel. The British also planned to simultaneously attack Baltimore by water on the following day, although the Royal Navy was unable to reduce Fort McHenry at the entrance to Baltimore Harbor in support of an attack from the northeast by the British Army.

The British eventually realized that they could not force the passage to attack Baltimore in coordination with the land force. A last ditch night feint and barge attack during a heavy rain storm was led by Captain Charles Napier around the fort up the Middle Branch of the river to the west. Split and misdirected partly in the storm, it turned back after suffering heavy casualties from the alert gunners of Fort Covington and Battery Babcock. The British called off the attack and sailed downriver to pick up their army, which had retreated from the east side of Baltimore. All the lights were extinguished in Baltimore the night of the attack, and the fort was bombarded for 25 hours. The only light was given off by the exploding shells over Fort McHenry, illuminating the flag that was still flying over the fort. The defence of the fort inspired the American lawyer Francis Scott Key to write &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot;, a poem that was later set to music as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

=== Southern theatre ===
Because of the region&#x27;s polyglot population, both the British and the Americans perceived the war in the Gulf South as a fundamentally different conflict from the one occurring in the Lowcountry and Chesapeake.

==== Creek War ====
Before 1813, the war between the Creeks, or Muscogee, had been largely an internal affair sparked by the ideas of Tecumseh farther north in the Mississippi Valley. A faction known as the Red Sticks, so named for the colour of their war sticks, had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. The Red Sticks were allied with Tecumseh, who had visited the Creeks about a year before 1813 and encouraged greater resistance to the Americans. The Creek Nation was a trading partner of the United States, actively involved with British and Spanish trade as well. The Red Sticks as well as many southern Muscogee people like the Seminole had a long history of alliance with the British and Spanish empires. This alliance helped the North American and European powers protect each other&#x27;s claims to territory in the south.

On 27 July the Red Sticks were returning from Pensacola with a pack train filled with trade goods and arms when they were attacked by Americans who made off with their goods. On 30 August 1813, in retaliation for the raid, the Red Sticks, led by chiefs of the Creeks Red Eagle and Peter McQueen, attacked Fort Mims north of Mobile, the only American-held port in the territory of West Florida. The attack on Fort Mims resulted in the horrific death of 400 refugee settlers, all butchered and scalped, including women and children, and became an ideological rallying point for the Americans. It prompted the state of Georgia and the Mississippi militia to immediately take major action against Creek offensives. The Red Sticks chiefs gained power in the east along the Alabama River, Coosa River and Tallapoosa River in the Upper Creek territory. By contrast, the Lower Creek, who lived along the Chattahoochee River, generally opposed the Red Sticks and wanted to remain allied to the U.S. Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins recruited Lower Creek to aid the 6th Military District under General Thomas Pinckney and the state militias against the Red Sticks. The United States combined forces were 5,000 troops from East and West Tennessee, with about 200 indigenous allies. At its peak, the Red Stick faction had 4,000 warriors, only a quarter of whom had muskets.

The Indian frontier of western Georgia was the most vulnerable but was partially fortified already. From November 1813 to January 1814, Georgia&#x27;s militia and auxiliary Federal troops from the Creek and Cherokee indigenous nations and the states of North Carolina and South Carolina organized the fortification of defences along the Chattahoochee River and expeditions into Upper Creek territory in present-day Alabama. The army, led by General John Floyd, went to the heart of the Creek Holy Grounds and won a major offensive against one of the largest Creek towns at the Battle of Autossee, killing an estimated two hundred people. In November, the militia of Mississippi with a combined 1,200 troops attacked the Econachca encampment in the Battle of Holy Ground on the Alabama River. Tennessee raised a militia of 5,000 under Major General Andrew Jackson and Brigadier General John Coffee and won the battles of Tallushatchee and Talladega in November 1813.

Jackson suffered enlistment problems in the winter. He decided to combine his force, composed of Tennessee militia and pro-American Creek, with the Georgia militia. In January, however, the Red Sticks attacked his army at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek. Jackson&#x27;s troops repelled the attackers, but they were outnumbered and forced to withdraw to his base at Fort Strother.

In January, Floyd&#x27;s force of 1,300 state militia and 400 Creek moved to join the United States forces in Tennessee, but they were attacked in camp on the Calibee Creek by Tukabatchee Muscogees on 27 January.

Jackson&#x27;s force increased in numbers with the arrival of United States Army soldiers and a second draft of Tennessee state militia, Cherokee, and pro-American Creek swelled his army to around 5,000. In March 1814, they moved south to attack the Red Sticks. On 27 March, Jackson decisively defeated a force of about a thousand Red Sticks at Horseshoe Bend, killing 800 of them at a cost of 49 killed and 154 wounded.

Jackson then moved his army to Fort Jackson on the Alabama River. He promptly turned on the pro-American Creek who had fought with him and compelled their chieftains, along with a single Red Stick chieftain, to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which forced the Creek tribe as a whole to cede most of western Georgia and part of Alabama to the U.S. Both Hawkins and the pro-American Creek strongly opposed the treaty, which they regarded as deeply unjust. The third clause of the treaty also demanded that the Creek cease communicating with the British and Spanish, and trade only with United States-approved agents.
====Gulf of Mexico coast====
British aid to the Red Sticks arrived after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in April 1814 and after Admiral Alexander Cochrane assumed command from Admiral Warren in March. Captain Hugh Pigot arrived in May 1814 with two ships to arm the Red Sticks. He thought that some 6,600 warriors could be armed and recruited. It was overly optimistic at best. The Red Sticks were in the process of being destroyed as a military force. Cochrane underestimated Jackson&#x27;s competence, and was likely unaware of his progress over the Creek, even after his victory. In April 1814, the British established an outpost on the Apalachicola River (Prospect Bluff Historic Sites). Cochrane sent a company of Royal Marines commanded by Edward Nicolls, the vessels and and further supplies to meet the Indians in the region. In addition to training them, Nicolls was tasked to raise a force from escaped slaves as part of the Corps of Colonial Marines.

On 12 July 1814, General Jackson complained to the governor of West Florida, Mateo González Manrique, situated at Pensacola that combatants from the Creek War were being harboured in Spanish territory and made reference to reports of the British presence on Spanish soil. Although he gave an angry reply to Jackson, Manrique was alarmed at the weak position he found himself in and appealed to the British for help. The British were observed docking on August 25 and unloading the following day.

The first engagement of the British and their Creek allies against the Americans on the Gulf of Mexico coast was the 14 September 1814 attack on Fort Bowyer. Captain William Percy tried to take the United States fort, hoping to then move on Mobile and block United States trade and encroachment on the Mississippi. After the Americans repulsed Percy&#x27;s forces, the British established a military presence of up to 200 Marines at Pensacola. In November, Jackson&#x27;s force of 4,000 men took the town. This underlined the superiority of numbers of Jackson&#x27;s force in the region. The United States force moved to New Orleans in late 1814. Jackson&#x27;s army of 1,000 regulars and 3,000 to 4,000 militia, pirates and other fighters as well as civilians and slaves built fortifications south of the city.

American forces under General James Wilkinson, himself a paid Spanish secret agent, took the Mobile area from the Spanish in March 1813. This region was the rump of Spanish West Florida, the western portion of which had been annexed to the United States in 1810. The Americans built Fort Bowyer, a log and earthen-work fort with 14 guns, on Mobile Point to defend it. Major Latour opined that none of the three forts in the area were capable of resisting a siege.

At the end of 1814, the British launched a double offensive in the South weeks before the Treaty of Ghent was signed. On the Atlantic coast, Admiral George Cockburn was to close the Intracoastal Waterway trade and land Royal Marine battalions to advance through Georgia to the western territories. While on the Gulf coast, Admiral Alexander Cochrane moved on the new state of Louisiana and the Mississippi Territory. Cochrane&#x27;s ships reached the Louisiana coast on 9 December and Cockburn arrived in Georgia on 14 December.

The British army had the objective of gaining control of the entrance of the Mississippi. To this end, an expeditionary force of 8,000 troops under General Edward Pakenham attacked Jackson&#x27;s prepared defences in New Orleans on 8 January 1815. The Battle of New Orleans was an American victory, as the British failed to take the fortifications on the East Bank. The British attack force suffered high casualties, including 291 dead, 1,262 wounded and 484 captured or missing whereas American casualties were light with 13 dead, 39 wounded and 19 missing, according to the respective official casualty returns. This battle was hailed as a great victory across the United States, making Jackson a national hero and eventually propelling him to the presidency. In January 1815 Fort St. Philip endured ten days of bombardment from two bomb vessels of the Royal Navy. Robert V. Remini believes this was preventing the British moving their fleet up the Mississippi in support of the land attack.

After deciding further attacks would be too costly and unlikely to succeed, the British troops withdrew on 18 January. However, adverse winds slowed the evacuation operation and it was not until 27 January 1815 that the land forces rejoined the fleet, allowing for its final departure. After New Orleans, the British moved to take Mobile as a base for further operations. In preparation, General John Lambert laid siege to Fort Bowyer taking it on 12 February 1815. However HMS &quot;Brazen&quot; brought news of the Treaty of Ghent the next day and the British abandoned the Gulf Coast. This ending of the war prevented the capture of Mobile, and any renewed attacks on New Orleans.

Meanwhile, in January 1815, Cockburn succeeded in blockading the southeastern coast of Georgia by occupying Camden County. The British quickly took Cumberland Island, Fort Point Peter and Fort St. Tammany in a decisive victory. Under the orders of his commanding officers, Cockburn&#x27;s forces relocated many refugee slaves, capturing St. Simons Island as well to do so. He had orders to recruit as many runaway slaves into the Corps of Colonial Marines as possible and use them to conduct raids in Georgia and the Carolinas. Cockburn also provided thousands of muskets and carbines and a huge quantity of ammunition to the Creeks and Seminole Indians for the same purpose. During the invasion of the Georgia coast, an estimated 1,485 people chose to relocate to British territories or join the British military. However, by mid-March, several days after being informed of the Treaty of Ghent, British ships left the area.

The British government did not recognize either West Florida or New Orleans as American territory. The historian Frank Owsley suggests that they might have used a victory at New Orleans to demand further concessions from the U.S. However, subsequent research in the correspondence of British ministers at the time suggests otherwise. with specific reference to correspondence from the Prime Minister to the Foreign Secretary dated 23 December 1814. West Florida was the only territory permanently gained by the United States during the war.

===The war at sea===
====Background====
In 1812, Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy was the world&#x27;s largest and most powerful navy, with over 600 vessels in commission, following the defeat of the French Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Most of these ships were employed blockading the French navy and protecting British trade against French privateers, but the Royal Navy still had 85 vessels in American waters, counting all North American and Caribbean waters. However, the Royal Navy&#x27;s North American squadron was the most immediately available force, based in Halifax and Bermuda (two of the colonies that made up British North America), and numbered one small ship of the line and seven frigates as well as nine smaller sloops and brigs and five schooners. By contrast, the entire United States Navy was composed of 8 frigates, 14 smaller sloops and brigs, with no ships of the line. The United States had embarked on a major shipbuilding program before the war at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor to provide ships for use on the Great Lakes, and continued to produce new ships.

==== Opening strategies ====
The British strategy was to protect their own merchant shipping between Halifax and the West Indies, with the order given on 13 October 1812 to enforce a blockade of major American ports to restrict American trade.

Because of their numerical inferiority, the American strategy was to cause disruption through hit-and-run tactics such as the capturing prizes and engaging Royal Navy vessels only under favourable circumstances.

Days after the formal declaration of war, the United States put out two small squadrons, including the frigate &quot;President&quot; and the sloop under Commodore John Rodgers and the frigates &quot;United States&quot; and , with the brig under Captain Stephen Decatur. These were initially concentrated as one unit under Rodgers, who intended to force the Royal Navy to concentrate its own ships to prevent isolated units being captured by his powerful force. Large numbers of American merchant ships were returning to the United States with the outbreak of war and the Royal Navy could not watch all the ports on the American seaboard if they were concentrated together. Rodgers&#x27; strategy worked in that the Royal Navy concentrated most of its frigates off New York Harbor under Captain Philip Broke, allowing many American ships to reach home. However, Rodgers&#x27; own cruise captured only five small merchant ships, and the Americans never subsequently concentrated more than two or three ships together as a unit.

==== Single-ship actions ====
The more recently built frigates of the US Navy were intended to overmatch their opponents. The United States did not believe that it could build a large enough navy to contest with the Royal Navy in fleet actions. Therefore, where it could be done, individual ships were built to be tougher, larger, and carry more firepower than their equivalents in European navies. The newest three 44-gun ships were designed with a 24-pounder main battery. These frigates were intended to demolish the 36- to 38-gun (18-pounder) armed frigates that formed the majority of the world&#x27;s navies, while being able to evade larger ships. Similarly the Wasp class ship-sloops were an over-match to the Cruizer class brigs being employed by the British. The Royal Navy, maintaining more than 600 ships in fleets and stations worldwide, was overstretched and undermanned; most British ships enforcing the blockade were (with a few notable exceptions) less practiced than the crews of the smaller US Navy. This meant that in single-ship actions the Royal Navy ships often found themselves against larger ships with larger crews, who were better drilled, as intended by the US planners.

However naval ships do not fight as individuals by the code of the duel, they are national instruments of war, and are used as such. The Royal Navy counted on its numbers, experience, and traditions to overcome the individually superior vessels. As the US Navy found itself mostly blockaded by the end of the war, the Royal Navy was correct. For all the fame that these actions received, they in no way affected the outcome of the results of Atlantic theatre of War. The final count of frigates lost was three on each side, with most of the US Navy blockaded in port. During the war, the United States Navy captured 165 British merchantmen (although privateers captured many more) while the Royal Navy captured 1,400 American merchantmen. More significantly, the British blockade of the Atlantic coast caused the majority of warships to be unable to put to sea and shut down both American imports and exports.

Notable single-ship engagements include USS &quot;Constitution&quot; vs HMS &quot;Guerriere&quot; on 19 August 1812, USS &quot;United States&quot; vs HMS &quot;Macedonian&quot; on 25 October, USS &quot;Constitution&quot; vs HMS &quot;Java&quot; on 29–30 December, &quot;HMS Shannon&quot; vs USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; on 1 June 1813 (the bloodiest such action of the war), HMS &quot;Phoebe&quot; vs USS &quot;Essex&quot; on 28 March 1814, HMS &quot;Endymion&quot; vs USS &quot;President&quot; on 15 January 1815.

In single ship battles, superior force was the most significant factor. In response to the majority of the American ships being of greater force than the British ships of the same class, Britain constructed five 40-gun, 24-pounder heavy frigates and two &quot;spar-decked&quot; frigates (the 60-gun and ) and others. To counter the American sloops of war, the British constructed the of 22 guns. The British Admiralty also instituted a new policy that the three American heavy frigates should not be engaged except by a ship of the line or frigates in squadron strength.

The United States Navy&#x27;s smaller ship-sloops had also won several victories over Royal Navy sloops-of-war, again of smaller armament. The American sloops &quot;Hornet&quot;, , , and were all ship-rigged while the British sloops that they encountered were brig-rigged, which gave the Americans a significant advantage. Ship rigged vessels are more manoeuvrable in battle because they have a wider variety of sails and thus being more resistant to damage. Ship-rigged vessels can back sail, literally backing up or heave to (stop).

==== Privateering ====

The operations of American privateers proved a more significant threat to British trade than the United States Navy. They operated throughout the Atlantic until the close of the war, most notably from Baltimore. American privateers reported taking 1300 British merchant vessels, compared to 254 taken by the United States Navy, although the insurer Lloyd&#x27;s of London reported that only 1,175 British ships were taken, 373 of which were recaptured, for a total loss of 802. Canadian historian Carl Benn wrote that American privateers took 1,344 British ships, of which 750 were retaken by the British. The British tried to limit privateering losses by the strict enforcement of convoy by the Royal Navy and directly by blockading coastal waterways and capturing 278 American privateers. Due to the massive size of the British merchant fleet, American captures only affected 7.5% of the fleet, resulting in no supply shortages or lack of reinforcements for British forces in North America. Of 526 American privateers, 148 were captured by the Royal Navy and only 207 ever took a prize.

Due to the large size of their navy, the British did not rely as much on privateering. The majority of the 1,407 captured American merchant ships were taken by the Royal Navy. The war was the last time the British allowed privateering, since the practice was coming to be seen as politically inexpedient and of diminishing value in maintaining its naval supremacy. However, privateering remained popular in British colonies. It was the last hurrah for privateers in the insular British North American colony of Bermuda who vigorously returned to the practice with experience gained in previous wars. The nimble Bermuda sloops captured 298 American ships. Privateer schooners based in continental British North America, especially from Nova Scotia, took 250 American ships and proved especially effective in crippling American coastal trade and capturing American ships closer to shore than the Royal Navy&#x27;s cruisers.

==== British blockade ====
The naval blockade of the United States began informally in the late fall of 1812. Under the command of British Admiral John Borlase Warren, it extended from South Carolina to Florida. It expanded to cut off more ports as the war progressed. Twenty ships were on station in 1812 and 135 were in place by the end of the conflict. In March 1813, the Royal Navy punished the Southern states, who were most vocal about annexing British North America, by blockading Charleston, Port Royal, Savannah, and New York City as well. Additional ships were sent to North America in 1813 and the Royal Navy tightened and extended the blockade, first to the coast south of Narragansett by November 1813 and to the entire American coast on 31 May 1814. In May 1814, following the abdication of Napoleon and the end of the supply problems with Wellington&#x27;s army, New England was blockaded.

The British needed American foodstuffs for their army in Spain and benefited from trade with New England, so they did not at first blockade New England. The Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay were declared in a state of blockade on 26 December 1812. Illicit trade was carried on by collusive captures arranged between American traders and British officers. American ships were fraudulently transferred to neutral flags. Eventually, the United States government was driven to issue orders to stop illicit trading. This put only a further strain on the commerce of the country. The British fleet occupied the Chesapeake Bay and attacked and destroyed numerous docks and harbours. The effect was that no foreign goods could enter the United States on ships and only smaller fast boats could attempt to get out. The cost of shipping became very expensive as a result.

The blockade of American ports later tightened to the extent that most American merchant ships and naval vessels were confined to port. The American frigates and ended the war blockaded and hulked in New London, Connecticut. USS &quot;United States&quot; and USS &quot;Macedonian&quot; attempted to set sail to raid British shipping in the Caribbean, but were forced to turn back when confronted with a British squadron, and by the end of the war, the United States had six frigates and four ships-of-the-line sitting in port. Some merchant ships were based in Europe or Asia and continued operations. Others, mainly from New England, were issued licences to trade by Admiral Warren, commander in chief on the American station in 1813. This allowed Wellington&#x27;s army in Spain to receive American goods and to maintain the New Englanders&#x27; opposition to the war. The blockade nevertheless decreased American exports from $130 million in 1807 to $7 million in 1814. Most exports were goods that ironically went to supply their enemies in Britain or the British colonies. The blockade had a devastating effect on the American economy with the value of American exports and imports falling from $114 million in 1811 down to $20 million by 1814 while the United States Customs took in $13 million in 1811 and $6 million in 1814, even though the Congress had voted to double the rates. The British blockade further damaged the American economy by forcing merchants to abandon the cheap and fast coastal trade to the slow and more expensive inland roads. In 1814, only 1 out of 14 American merchantmen risked leaving port as it was likely that any ship leaving port would be seized.

As the Royal Navy base that supervised the blockade, Halifax profited greatly during the war. From there, British privateers seized and sold many French and American ships. More than a hundred prize vessels were anchored in St. George&#x27;s Harbour awaiting condemnation by the Admiralty Court when a hurricane struck in 1815, sinking roughly sixty of the vessels.

=== Freeing and recruiting slaves ===
The British Royal Navy&#x27;s blockades and raids allowed about 4,000 African Americans to escape slavery by fleeing American plantations aboard British ships. American slaves near to the British military rebelled against their masters and made their way to British encampments. The migrants who settled in Canada were known as the Black Refugees. The blockading British fleet in the Chesapeake Bay received increasing numbers of freed slaves during 1813. By British government order, they were considered free persons when they reached British hands.

Alexander Cochrane&#x27;s proclamation of 2 April 1814 invited Americans who wished to emigrate to join the British. Although it did not explicitly mention slaves, it was taken by all as addressed to them. About 2,400 escaped slaves and their families were transported by the Royal Navy to the Royal Naval Dockyard at Bermuda (where they were employed on works about the yard and organized as a militia to aid in the defence of the yard), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick during and after the war. Starting in May 1814, younger male volunteers were recruited into a new Corps of Colonial Marines. They fought for Britain throughout the Atlantic campaign, including the Battle of Bladensburg, the attacks on Washington, D.C., and the Battle of Baltimore, before withdrawing to Bermuda with the rest of the British forces. They were later settled in Trinidad after having rejected orders for transfer to the West India Regiments, forming the community of the Merikins (none of the freed slaves remained in Bermuda after the war). These escaped slaves represented the largest emancipation of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. Britain paid the United States for the financial loss of the slaves at the end of the war.

== Treaty of Ghent ==
In August 1814, peace discussions began in Ghent (in present-day Belgium); both sides approached negotiations warily. The British strategy for decades had been to create a buffer state in the American Northwest Territory to block American expansion. Britain also demanded naval control of the Great Lakes and access to the Mississippi River. On the American side, Monroe instructed the American diplomats sent to Europe to try to convince the British to cede the Canadas, or at least Upper Canada, to the U.S. At a later stage, the Americans also demanded damages for the burning of Washington and for the seizure of ships before the war began.
American public opinion was outraged when Madison published the demands as even the Federalists were now willing to fight on. A British force burned Washington, but it failed to capture Baltimore and sailed away when its commander was killed. In northern New York State, 10,000 British veterans were marching south until a decisive defeat at the Battle of Plattsburgh forced them back to Canada. British Prime Minister Lord Liverpool, aware of growing opposition to wartime taxation and the demands of merchants for reopened trade with America, realized Britain also had little to gain and much to lose from prolonged warfare especially given growing concern about the situation in Europe. The main focus of British foreign policy was the Congress of Vienna, at which British diplomats had clashed with Russian and Prussian diplomats over the terms of the peace with France and there were fears that Britain might have to go to war with Russia and Prussia. Export trade was all but paralyzed and France was no longer an enemy of Britain after Napoleon fell in April 1814, so the Royal Navy no longer needed to stop American shipments to France and it no longer needed to impress more seamen. The British were preoccupied in rebuilding Europe after the apparent final defeat of Napoleon.

Consequently, Lord Liverpool urged the British negotiators to offer a peace based on the restoration of the pre-war status quo. The British negotiators duly dropped their demands for the creation of an Indian neutral zone, which allowed negotiations to resume at the end of October. The American negotiators accepted the British proposals for a peace based on the pre-war status quo. Prisoners were to be exchanged and escaped slaves returned to the United States, as at least 3,000 American slaves had escaped to British lines. The British however refused to honour this aspect of the treaty, settling some of the newly freed slaves in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The Americans protested Britain&#x27;s failure to return American slaves in violation of the Treaty of Ghent. After arbitration by the Tsar of Russia the British paid $1,204,960 in damages to Washington, to reimburse the slave owners.

On 24 December 1814, the diplomats had finished and signed the Treaty of Ghent. The treaty was ratified by the British Prince Regent three days later on 27 December. On 17 February, it arrived in Washington, where it was quickly ratified and went into effect, ending the war. The terms called for all occupied territory to be returned, the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States to be restored, and the Americans were to gain fishing rights in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The British insisted on the inclusion of provisions to restore to the Indians &quot;all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811&quot;. The Americans ignored and violated these provisions.

The Treaty of Ghent completely maintained Britain&#x27;s maritime belligerent rights, a key goal for the British, without acknowledging American maritime rights or the end of impressment. While American maritime rights were not seriously violated in the century of peace until World War I, the defeat of Napoleon made the need for impressment irrelevant and the grievances of the United States no longer an issue. In this sense, the United States achieved its goals indirectly and felt its honour had been upheld despite impressment continuing.

== Losses and compensation ==

Losses figures do not include deaths among Canadian militia forces or Indigenous tribes. British losses in the war were about 1,160 killed in action and 3,679 wounded, with 3,321 British who died from disease. American losses were 2,260 killed in action and 4,505 wounded. While the number of Americans who died from disease is not known, it is estimated that about 15,000 died from all causes directly related to the war.

The war added some £25 million to Britain&#x27;s national debt. In the United States, the cost was $90 million reaching a peak of 2.7% of GDP. The national debt rose from $45 million in 1812 to $127 million by the end of 1815, although by selling bonds and treasury notes at deep discountsand often for irredeemable paper money due to the suspension of specie payment in 1814the government received only $34 million worth of specie. Stephen Girard, the richest man in the United States at the time, was among those who funded the United States government&#x27;s involvement in the war. The British national debt rose from £451 million in 1812 to £841 million in 1814, although this was at a time when Britain was fighting a war against Napoleon. The war was bad for both economies.

In the United States, the economy grew 3.7% a year from 1812 to 1815, despite a large loss of business by East Coast shipping interests. Prices were 15% higherinflatedin 1815 compared to 1812, an annual rate of 4.8%. Hundreds of new banks were opened; they largely handled the loans that financed the war since tax revenues were down. Money that would have been spent on foreign trade was diverted to opening new factories, which were profitable since British factory-made products were not for sale. This gave a major boost to the Industrial Revolution in the United States as typified by the Boston Associates.

== Long-term consequences ==

The border between the United States and Canada remained essentially unchanged by the war, with neither side making meaningful territorial gains. Despite the Treaty of Ghent not addressing the original points of contention and establishing the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, relations between the United States and Britain changed drastically. The issue of impressment also became irrelevant as the Royal Navy no longer needed sailors after the war.

The long-term results of the war were generally satisfactory for both the United States and Great Britain. Except for occasional border disputes and some tensions during and after the American Civil War, relations between the United States and Britain remained peaceful for the rest of the 19th century. In the 20th century, spurred by multiple world conflicts, the two countries became close allies. The memory of the conflict played a major role in helping to consolidate a Canadian national identity after 1867, the year of Canadian confederation.

The Rush–Bagot Treaty between the United States and Britain was enacted in 1817. It demilitarized the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, where many British naval arrangements and forts still remained. The treaty laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary. It remains in effect to this day.

=== Bermuda ===

Bermuda had been largely left to the defences of its own militia and privateers before American independence, but the Royal Navy had begun buying up land and operating from there beginning in 1795, after a number of years spent surveying the reefs to find Hurd&#x27;s channel (which enabled large frigates and ships of the line to pass through the surrounding reefs to Murray&#x27;s Anchorage and the enclosed harbours). As construction work progressed through the first half of the 19th century, Bermuda became an Imperial fortress and the permanent naval headquarters the Western hemisphere, housing the Admiralty and serving as a base and dockyard. Defence infrastructure remained the central leg of Bermuda&#x27;s economy until after World War II.

=== The Canadas ===
After the war, pro-British leaders in Upper Canada demonstrated a strong hostility to American influences, including republicanism, which shaped its policies. Immigration from the United States was discouraged and favour was shown to the Anglican Church as opposed to the more Americanized Methodist Church.

The Battle of York showed the vulnerability of Upper and Lower Canada (The Canadas). In the decades following the war, several projects were undertaken to improve the defence of the colonies against the United States. They included work on La Citadelle at Quebec City, Fort Henry at Kingston, and rebuilding Fort York at York. Additionally, work began on the Halifax Citadel to defend the port against foreign navies. Akin to the American view that it was a &quot;Second War of Independence&quot; for the United States, the war was also somewhat of a war of independence for Canada. Before the war Canada was a mix of French Canadians, native-born British subjects, loyalists and Americans who migrated there. Historian Donald R. Hickey maintains that the war that threatened Canada greatly helped to cement these disparate groups into a unified nation.

=== Indigenous nations ===

The Indigenous tribes allied to the British lost their cause. The Americans rejected the British proposal to create an &quot;Indian barrier state&quot; in the American West at the Ghent peace conference and it never resurfaced. Donald Fixico argues that &quot;[a]fter the War of 1812, the U.S. negotiated over two hundred Indian treaties that involved the ceding of Indian lands and 99 of these agreements resulted in the creation of reservations west of the Mississippi River&quot;.

The Indigenous nations lost most of their fur-trapping territory. Indigenous nations were displaced in Alabama, Georgia, New York and Oklahoma, losing most of what is now Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin within the Northwest Territory as well as in New York and the South. They came to be seen as an undesirable burden by British policymakers, who now looked to the United States for markets and raw materials. Everyone, including British fur traders were prohibited from entering in the United States for purposes of trade.

British Indian agents however continued to meet regularly with their former allies among the tribes of the Old Northwest, but refused to supply them with arms or help them resist American attempts to displace them. The American government rapidly built a network of forts throughout the Old Northwest, thus establishing firm military control. It also sponsored American fur traders, who outcompeted the British fur traders. Meanwhile, Euro-American settlers rapidly migrated into the Old Northwest, into the lands occupied by the tribes who were previously allied with the British. The War of 1812 marked a turning point in the history of the Old Northwest because it established United States authority over the British and Indians of that border region.

After the decisive defeat of the Creek Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, some Creek warriors escaped to join the Seminole in Florida. The remaining Creek chiefs signed away about half their lands, comprising 23,000,000 acres, covering much of southern Georgia and two-thirds of modern Alabama. The Creek were separated from any future help from the Spanish in Florida and from the Choctaw and Chickasaw to the west.

=== United Kingdom ===

The war is seldom remembered in the United Kingdom. The war in Europe against the French Empire under Napoleon ensured that the British did not consider the War of 1812 against the United States as more than a sideshow. Britain&#x27;s blockade of French trade had worked and the Royal Navy was the world&#x27;s dominant nautical power (and remained so for another century). While the land campaigns had contributed to saving Canada, the Royal Navy had shut down American commerce, bottled up the United States Navy in port and widely suppressed privateering. British businesses, some affected by rising insurance costs, were demanding peace so that trade could resume with the United States. The peace was generally welcomed by the British, although there was disquiet about the rapid growth of the United States. The two nations quickly resumed trade after the end of the war and a growing friendship.

The historian Donald Hickey maintains that for Britain, &quot;the best way to defend Canada was to accommodate the United States. This was the principal rationale for Britain&#x27;s long-term policy of rapprochement with the United States in the nineteenth century and explains why they were so often willing to sacrifice other imperial interests to keep the republic happy&quot;.

=== United States ===

The nation gained a strong sense of complete independence as people celebrated their &quot;second war of independence&quot;. Nationalism soared after the victory at the Battle of New Orleans. The opposition Federalist Party collapsed due to its opposition to the war and the Era of Good Feelings ensued.

No longer questioning the need for a strong Navy, the United States built three new 74-gun ships of the line and two new 44-gun frigates shortly after the end of the war. In 1816, the United States Congress passed into law an &quot;Act for the gradual increase of the Navy&quot; at a cost of $1,000,000 a year for eight years, authorizing nine ships of the line and 12 heavy frigates. The captains and commodores of the Navy became the heroes of their generation in the United States. Several war heroes used their fame to win elections to national office. Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison both benefited from their military successes to win the presidency, while representative Richard Mentor Johnson&#x27;s role during the war helped him attain the vice presidency.

During the war, New England states became increasingly frustrated over how the war was being conducted and how the conflict affected them. They complained that the United States government was not investing enough militarily and financially in the states&#x27; defences and that the states should have more control over their militias. Increased taxes, the British blockade, and the occupation of some of New England by enemy forces also agitated public opinion in the states. At the Hartford Convention held between December 1814 and January 1815, Federalist delegates deprecated the war effort and sought more autonomy for the New England states. They did not call for secession but word of the angry anti-war resolutions appeared as peace was announced and the victory at New Orleans was known. The upshot was that the Federalists were permanently discredited and quickly disappeared as a major political force.

This war enabled thousands of slaves to escape to freedom, despite the difficulties. The British helped numerous escaped slaves resettle in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, where Black Loyalists had also been granted land after the American Revolutionary War.

Jackson invaded Florida (then part of New Spain) in 1818, demonstrating to Spain that it could no longer control that colonial territory with a small force. Spain sold Florida to the United States in 1819 under the Adams–Onís Treaty following the First Seminole War. Pratt concludes that &quot;[t]hus indirectly the War of 1812 brought about the acquisition of Florida&quot;.

<text>Winter is the coldest and darkest season of the year in temperate and polar climates. It occurs after autumn and before spring. The tilt of Earth&#x27;s axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.

When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. Winter typically brings precipitation that, depending on a region&#x27;s climate, is mainly rain or snow. The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun&#x27;s elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value; that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole. The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. 

The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice and depend on latitude. They differ due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth&#x27;s elliptical orbit (see: earliest and latest sunrise and sunset).

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;winter&quot; comes from the Proto-Germanic noun &quot;*wintru-&quot;, whose origin is unclear. Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*wed-&quot; &#x27;water&#x27; or a nasal infix variant &quot;*wend-&quot;.

==Cause==

The tilt of the Earth&#x27;s axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44° to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.

During winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of solar radiation strikes the Earth per unit of surface area. Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the distance of the Earth from the Sun (due to the Earth&#x27;s elliptical orbit) is negligible.

The manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snow-prone latitudes is highly variable, depending on elevation, position versus marine winds, and the amount of precipitation. For instance, within Canada (a country of cold winters), Winnipeg, on the Great Plains (a long way from the ocean), has a January high of and a low of . 

In comparison, Vancouver, on the west coast (with a marine influence from moderating Pacific winds), has a January low of , with days well above freezing, at . Both places are at 49°N latitude and in the same western half of the continent. A similar but less extreme effect is found in Europe: despite their northerly latitude, the British Isles have no non-mountain weather stations with a below-freezing mean January temperature.

==Meteorological reckoning==

Meteorological reckoning is the method of measuring the winter season used by meteorologists based on &quot;sensible weather patterns&quot; for record keeping purposes, so the start of meteorological winter varies with latitude. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. This corresponds to the months of December, January and February in the Northern Hemisphere, and June, July and August in the Southern Hemisphere. 

The coldest average temperatures of the season are typically experienced in January or February in the Northern Hemisphere and in June, July or August in the Southern Hemisphere. Nighttime predominates in the winter season, and in some regions, winter has the highest rate of precipitation as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent snow cover or high precipitation rates coupled with low temperatures, precluding evaporation. Blizzards often develop and cause many transportation delays. Diamond dust, also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching due to air with slightly higher moisture from above mixing with colder, surface-based air. They are made of simple hexagonal ice crystals. 

The Swedish Meteorological Institute (SMHI) defines &quot;thermal winter&quot; as when the daily mean temperatures are below for five consecutive days. According to the SMHI, winter in Scandinavia is more pronounced when Atlantic low-pressure systems take more southerly and northerly routes, leaving the path open for high-pressure systems to come in and cold temperatures to occur. As a result, the coldest January on record in Stockholm, in 1987, was also the sunniest.

Accumulations of snow and ice are commonly associated with winter in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the large land masses there. In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40°S make the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also in the southerly Patagonia region of South Argentina. Snow occurs year-round in Antarctica.

==Astronomical and other calendar-based reckoning==


In the Northern Hemisphere, some authorities define the period of winter based on astronomical fixed points (i.e., based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun), regardless of weather conditions. In one version of this definition, winter begins at the winter solstice and ends at the March equinox. These dates are somewhat later than those used to define the beginning and end of the meteorological winter — usually considered to span the entirety of December, January, and February in the Northern Hemisphere and June, July, and August in the Southern.

Astronomically, the winter solstice — being the day of the year that has fewest hours of daylight — ought to be in the middle of the season, but seasonal lag means that the coldest period normally follows the solstice by a few weeks. In some cultures, the season is regarded as beginning at the solstice and ending on the following equinox. In the Northern Hemisphere, depending on the year, this corresponds to the period between 20, 21 or 22 December and 19, 20 or 21 March.

In an old Norwegian tradition, winter begins on 14 October and ends on the last day of February.

In many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, winter begins on 1 June and ends on 31 August.

In Celtic nations such as Ireland (using the Irish calendar) and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on All Hallows, or Samhain. Winter ends and spring begins on Imbolc, or Candlemas, which is 1 or 2 February. In Chinese astronomy and other East Asian calendars, winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, on Lìdōng, and end with the arrival of spring on 3 or 4 February, on Lìchūn. Late Roman Republic scholar Marcus Terentius Varro defined winter as lasting from the fourth day before the Ides of November (10 November) to the eighth day before the Ides of Februarius (6 February).

This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere and May, June and July in the Southern Hemisphere.

Many mainland European countries tended to recognize Martinmas or St. Martin&#x27;s Day (11 November) as the first calendar day of winter. The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian equinox and solstice dates. Also, Valentine&#x27;s Day (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring, such as flowers blooming.

The three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere and lasts through late February or early March. This &quot;thermological winter&quot; is earlier than the solstice delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic or Chinese) definition. Depending on seasonal lag, this period will vary between climatic regions.

Since by almost all definitions valid for the Northern Hemisphere, winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the season is split across years, just like summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. &quot;Winter 2018&quot;. Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. &quot;Winter 18/19&quot;, or settling on the year the season starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions.

==Ecological reckoning and activity==

Ecological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates. It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term &quot;hibernal&quot; for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal). The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth. The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.

To survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for overwintering:
*Migration is a common effect of winter upon animals such as migratory birds. Some butterflies also migrate seasonally.
*Hibernation is a state of reduced metabolic activity during the winter. Some animals &quot;sleep&quot; during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns; e.g., gophers, frogs, snakes, and bats.
*Some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely. This is the case for squirrels, beavers, skunks, badgers, and raccoons.
*Resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature. The color of the fur or plumage changes to white (in order to be confused with snow) and thus retains its cryptic coloration year-round. Examples are the rock ptarmigan, Arctic fox, weasel, white-tailed jackrabbit, and mountain hare.
*Some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter; this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur. The coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling. The heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for trappers, who sought more profitable skins.
*Snow also affects the ways animals behave; many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it. Mice and voles typically live under the snow layer.

Some annual plants never survive the winter. Other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle; this is known as vernalization. As for perennials, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly deciduous trees, usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the flowering plum, which flowers in time for Chinese New Year. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called hardening.

==Examples==
===Exceptionally cold===
*1683–1684, &quot;The Great Frost&quot;, when the Thames, hosting the River Thames frost fairs, was frozen all the way up to London Bridge and remained frozen for about two months. Ice was about thick in London and about thick in Somerset. The sea froze up to out around the coast of the southern North Sea, causing severe problems for shipping and preventing use of many harbors.
*1739–1740, one of the most severe winters in the UK on record. The Thames remained frozen over for about 8 weeks. The Irish famine of 1740–1741 claimed the lives of at least 300,000 people.
*1816 was the Year Without a Summer in the Northern Hemisphere. The unusual coolness of the winter of 1815–1816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, in April 1815. There were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810, and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814. The cumulative effects were worldwide but were especially strong in the Eastern United States, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Europe. Frost formed in May in New England, killing many newly planted crops, and the summer never recovered. Snow fell in New York and Maine in June, and ice formed in lakes and rivers in July and August. In the UK, snow drifts remained on hills until late July, and the Thames froze in September. Agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in food shortages and the worst famine of the 19th century.
*1887–1888: There were record cold temperatures in the Upper Midwest, heavy snowfalls worldwide, and amazing storms, including the Schoolhouse Blizzard of 1888 (in the Midwest in January) and the Great Blizzard of 1888 (in the Eastern US and Canada in March).
*In Europe, the winters of early 1947, February 1956, 1962–1963, 1981–1982, and 2009–2010 were abnormally cold. The UK winter of 1946–1947 started out relatively normal but became one of the snowiest UK winters to date, with nearly continuous snowfall from late January until March.
*In South America, the winter of 1975 was one of the strongest, with record snow occurring at 25°S in cities of low altitude, with the registration of −17 °C (1.4 °F) in some parts of southern Brazil.
*In the eastern United States and Canada, the winter of 2013–2014 and the second half of February 2015 were abnormally cold.
===Historically significant===
*1310–1330: Many severe winters and cold, wet summers in Europe, the first clear manifestation of the unpredictable weather of the Little Ice Age that lasted for several centuries (from about 1300 to 1900). The persistently cold, wet weather caused great hardship, was primarily responsible for the Great Famine of 1315–1317, and strongly contributed to the weakened immunity and malnutrition leading up to the Black Death (1348–1350).
*1600–1602: Extremely cold winters in Switzerland and Baltic region after the eruption of Huaynaputina in Peru in 1600.
*1607–1608: In North America, ice persisted on Lake Superior until June. Londoners held their first frost fair on the frozen-over River Thames.
*1622: In Turkey, the Golden Horn and southern section of Bosphorus froze over.
*1690s: Extremely cold, snowy, severe winters. Ice surrounded Iceland for miles in every direction.
*1779–1780: Scotland&#x27;s coldest winter on record, and ice surrounded Iceland in every direction (like in the 1690s). In the United States, a record five-week cold spell bottomed out at in Hartford, Connecticut and in New York City. The Hudson River and New York&#x27;s harbor froze over.
*1783–1786: The Thames partially froze, and snow remained on the ground for months. In February 1784, the &quot;North Carolina&quot; was frozen in Chesapeake Bay.
*1794–1795: A severe winter, with the coldest January in the UK and lowest temperature ever recorded in London: on 25 January. The cold began on Christmas Eve and lasted until late March, with a few temporary warm-ups. The Severn and Thames froze, and frost fairs started up again. The French army tried to invade the Netherlands over its frozen rivers, while the Dutch fleet was stuck in its harbor. The winter had easterlies (from Siberia) as its dominant feature.
*1813–1814: Severe cold, last freeze-over of Thames, and last frost fair. (Removal of old London Bridge and changes to river&#x27;s banks made freeze-overs less likely.)
*1883–1888: Colder temperatures worldwide, including an unbroken string of abnormally cold and brutal winters in the Upper Midwest, related to the explosion of Krakatoa in August 1883. There was snow recorded in the UK as early as October and as late as July during this period.
*1976–1977: One of the coldest winters in the US in decades.
*1985: Arctic outbreak in the US resulting from shift in polar vortex, with many cold temperature records broken.
*2002–2003 was an unusually cold winter in the Northern and Eastern US.
*2010–2011: Persistent bitter cold in the entire eastern half of the US from December onward, with few or no midwinter warm-ups, and with cool conditions continuing into spring. La Niña and negative Arctic oscillation were strong factors. Heavy and persistent precipitation contributed to almost constant snow cover in the Northeastern US, which finally receded in early May.
*2011 was one of the coldest on record in New Zealand, with sea level snow falling in Wellington in July for the first time in 35 years and a much heavier snowstorm for 3 days in a row in August.

==Effect on humans==

Humans are sensitive to winter cold, which compromises the body&#x27;s ability to maintain both core and surface heat of the body. Slipping on icy surfaces is a common cause of winter injuries. Other injuries from the cold include:

* Hypothermia — Shivering, leading to uncoordinated movements and death.
* Frostbite — Freezing of skin, leading to loss of feeling and damaged tissue.
* Trench foot — Numbness, leading to damaged tissue and gangrene.
* Chilblains — Capillary damage in digits can lead to more severe cold injuries.
Rates of influenza, COVID-19, and other respiratory diseases also increase during the winter.

==Mythology==

In Persian culture, the winter solstice is called Yaldā (meaning: birth) and has been celebrated for thousands of years. It is referred to as the eve of the birth of Mithra, who symbolised light, goodness and strength on Earth.

In Greek mythology, Hades kidnapped Persephone to be his wife. Zeus ordered Hades to return her to Demeter, the goddess of the Earth and her mother. Hades tricked Persephone into eating the food of the dead, so Zeus decreed that she spend six months with Demeter and six months with Hades. During the time her daughter is with Hades, Demeter became depressed and caused winter.

In Welsh mythology, Gwyn ap Nudd abducted a maiden named Creiddylad. On May Day, her lover, Gwythr ap Greidawl, fought Gwyn to win her back. The battle between them represented the contest between summer and winter.

<text>Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE, or WAV due to its filename extension; pronounced or ) is an audio file format standard for storing an audio bitstream on personal computers. The format was developed and published for the first time in 1991 by IBM and Microsoft. It is the main format used on Microsoft Windows systems for uncompressed audio. The usual bitstream encoding is the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) format.

WAV is an application of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) bitstream format method for storing data in &quot;chunks&quot;, and thus is similar to the 8SVX and the Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) format used on Amiga and Macintosh computers, respectively.

== Description ==
The WAV file is an instance of a Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) defined by IBM and Microsoft. The RIFF format acts as a &quot;wrapper&quot; for various audio coding formats.

Though a WAV file can contain compressed audio, the most common WAV audio format is uncompressed audio in the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) format. LPCM is also the standard audio coding format for audio CDs, which store two-channel LPCM audio sampled at 44.1 kHz with 16 bits per sample. Since LPCM is uncompressed and retains all of the samples of an audio track, professional users or audio experts may use the WAV format with LPCM audio for maximum audio quality. WAV files can also be edited and manipulated with relative ease using software.

On Microsoft Windows, the WAV format supports compressed audio using the Audio Compression Manager (ACM). Any ACM codec can be used to compress a WAV file. The user interface (UI) for ACM may be accessed through various programs that use it, including Sound Recorder in some versions of Windows.

Beginning with Windows 2000, a codice_1 header was defined which specifies multiple audio channel data along with speaker positions, eliminates ambiguity regarding sample types and container sizes in the standard WAV format and supports defining custom extensions to the format.

==File specifications==

===RIFF===
A RIFF file is a tagged file format. It has a specific container format (a &quot;chunk&quot;) with a header that includes a four-character tag (FourCC) and the size (number of bytes) of the chunk. The tag specifies how the data within the chunk should be interpreted, and there are several standard FourCC tags. Tags consisting of all capital letters are reserved tags. The outermost chunk of a RIFF file has a codice_2 tag; the first four bytes of chunk data are an additional FourCC tag that specify the form type and are followed by a sequence of subchunks. In the case of a WAV file, the additional tag is codice_3. The remainder of the RIFF data is a sequence of chunks describing the audio information.

The advantage of a tagged file format is that the format can be extended later while maintaining backward compatibility. The rule for a RIFF (or WAV) reader is that it should ignore any tagged chunk that it does not recognize. The reader will not be able to use the new information, but the reader should not be confused.

The specification for RIFF files includes the definition of an codice_4 chunk. The chunk may include information such as the title of the work, the author, the creation date, and copyright information. Although the codice_4 chunk was defined for RIFF in version 1.0, the chunk was not referenced in the formal specification of a WAV file. Many readers had trouble processing this. Consequently, the safest thing to do from an interchange standpoint was to omit the codice_4 chunk and other extensions and send a lowest-common-denominator file. There are other INFO chunk placement problems.

RIFF files were expected to be used in international environments, so there is codice_7 chunk to specify the country code, language, dialect, and code page for the strings in a RIFF file. For example, specifying an appropriate codice_7 chunk should allow the strings in an codice_4 chunk (and other chunks throughout the RIFF file) to be interpreted as Cyrillic or Japanese characters.

RIFF also defines a codice_10 chunk whose contents are uninteresting. The chunk allows a chunk to be deleted by just changing its FourCC. The chunk could also be used to reserve some space for future edits so the file could be modified without being resized. A later definition of RIFF introduced a similar codice_11 chunk.

===RIFF WAVE===
The top-level definition of a WAV file is:

The top-level RIFF form uses a codice_3 tag. It is followed by a mandatory codice_13 chunk that describes the format of the sample data that follows. This chunk includes information such as the sample encoding, number of bits per channel, the number of channels, and the sample rate. 

The WAV specification includes some optional features. The optional codice_14 chunk reports the number of samples for some compressed coding schemes. The codice_15 chunk identifies some significant sample numbers in the wave file. The codice_16 chunk allows the samples to be played out of order or repeated rather than just from beginning to end. The associated data list (codice_17) allows labels and notes to be attached to cue points; text annotation may be given for a group of samples (e.g., caption information). 

Finally, the mandatory codice_18 chunk contains the actual samples in the format previously specified.

Note that the WAV file definition does not show where an codice_4 chunk should be placed. It is also silent about the placement of a codice_7 chunk (which specifies the character set used).

The RIFF specification attempts to be a formal specification, but its formalism lacks the precision seen in other tagged formats. For example, the RIFF specification does not clearly distinguish between a set of subchunks and an ordered sequence of subchunks. The RIFF form chunk suggests it should be a sequence container. Sequencing information is specified in the RIFF form of a WAV file consistent with the formalism: &quot;However, codice_13 must always occur before codice_18, and both of these chunks are mandatory in a WAVE file.&quot; The specification suggests a codice_23 chunk is also a sequence: &quot;A LIST chunk contains a list, or ordered sequence, of subchunks.&quot; However, the specification does not give a formal specification of the codice_4 chunk; an example codice_4 codice_23 chunk ignores the chunk sequence implied in the codice_4 description. The codice_23 chunk definition for codice_18 does use the codice_23 chunk as a sequence container with good formal semantics.

The WAV specification supports, and most WAV files use, a single contiguous array of audio samples. The specification also supports discrete blocks of samples and silence that are played in order. The specification for the sample data contains apparent errors:

Apparently codice_31 (undefined) and codice_32 (defined but not referenced) should be identical. Even with this resolved, the productions then allow a codice_33 to contain a recursive codice_18 (which implies data interpretation problems). To avoid the recursion, the specification can be interpreted as:
WAV files can contain embedded IFF &quot;lists&quot;, which can contain several &quot;sub-chunks&quot;.

=== WAV file header ===

This is an example of a WAV file header (44 bytes). Data is stored in little-endian byte order.

 [Master RIFF chunk]
 FileTypeBlocID (4 bytes) : Identifier « RIFF » (0x52, 0x49, 0x46, 0x46)
 FileSize (4 bytes) : Overall file size minus 8 bytes
 FileFormatID (4 bytes) : Format = « WAVE » (0x57, 0x41, 0x56, 0x45)
 [Chunk describing the data format]
 FormatBlocID (4 bytes) : Identifier « fmt␣ » (0x66, 0x6D, 0x74, 0x20)
 BlocSize (4 bytes) : Chunk size minus 8 bytes, which is 16 bytes here (0x10)
 AudioFormat (2 bytes) : Audio format (1: PCM integer, 3: IEEE 754 float)
 NbrChannels (2 bytes) : Number of channels
 Frequency (4 bytes) : Sample rate (in hertz)
 BytePerSec (4 bytes) : Number of bytes to read per second (Frequency * BytePerBloc).
 BytePerBloc (2 bytes) : Number of bytes per block (NbrChannels * BitsPerSample / 8).
 BitsPerSample (2 bytes) : Number of bits per sample
 [Chunk containing the sampled data]
 DataBlocID (4 bytes) : Identifier « data » (0x64, 0x61, 0x74, 0x61)
 DataSize (4 bytes) : SampledData size
 SampledData

==Metadata==
As a derivative of RIFF, WAV files can be tagged with metadata in the INFO chunk. In addition, WAV files can embed any kind of metadata, including but not limited to Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) data or ID3 tags in extra chunks. The RIFF specification requires that applications ignore chunks they do not recognize and applications may not necessarily use this extra information.

== Popularity ==
Uncompressed WAV files are large, so file sharing of WAV files over the Internet is uncommon except among video, music and audio professionals. The high resolution of the format makes it suitable for retaining first generation archived files of high quality, for use on a system where disk space and network bandwidth are not constraints.

===Use by broadcasters===

In spite of their large size, uncompressed WAV files are used by most radio broadcasters, especially those that have adopted a tapeless system.

* BBC Radio in the UK requires LPCM 48 kHz 16-bit WAV audio as standard for all content made for broadcast on its stations.
* The UK Commercial radio company Global Radio uses 44.1 kHz 16-bit two-channel WAV files throughout their broadcast chain.
* The ABC &quot;D-Cart&quot; system, which was developed by the Australian broadcaster, uses 48 kHz 16-bit two-channel WAV files.
* The Digital Radio Mondiale consortium uses WAV files as an informal standard for transmitter simulation and receiver testing.

== Limitations ==
The WAV format is limited to files that are less than , because of its use of a 32-bit unsigned integer to record the file size in the header. Although this is equivalent to about 6.8 hours of CD-quality audio at 44.1 kHz, 16-bit stereo, it is sometimes necessary to exceed this limit, especially when greater sampling rates, bit resolutions or channel count are required. The W64 format was therefore created for use in Sound Forge. Its 64-bit file size field in the header allows for much longer recording times. The RF64 format specified by the European Broadcasting Union has also been created to solve this problem.

== Non-audio data ==
Since the sampling rate of a WAV file can vary from to , and the number of channels can be as high as 65535, WAV files have also been used for non-audio data. LTspice, for instance, can store multiple circuit trace waveforms in separate channels, at any appropriate sampling rate, with the full-scale range representing ±1 V or A rather than a sound pressure.

== Audio compact discs ==
Audio compact discs (CDs) do not use the WAV file format, using instead Red Book audio. The commonality is that audio CDs are encoded as uncompressed 16-bit 44.1 kHz stereo LPCM, which is one of the formats supported by WAV.

==Comparison of coding schemes==
Audio in WAV files can be encoded in a variety of audio coding formats, such as GSM or MP3, to reduce the file size. All WAV files, even those that use MP3 compression, use the codice_35 extension.

This is a reference to compare the monophonic (not stereophonic) audio quality and compression bitrates of audio coding formats available for WAV files including LPCM, ADPCM, Microsoft GSM 06.10, CELP, SBC, Truespeech and MPEG Layer-3. These are the default ACM codecs that come with Windows.

<text>Windows 95 is a consumer-oriented operating system developed by Microsoft and the first of its Windows 9x family of operating systems, released to manufacturing on July 14, 1995, and generally to retail on August 24, 1995. Windows 95 merged Microsoft&#x27;s formerly separate MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows products, and featured significant improvements over its predecessor, most notably in the graphical user interface (GUI) and in its simplified &quot;plug-and-play&quot; features. There were also major changes made to the core components of the operating system, such as moving from a mainly cooperatively multitasked 16-bit architecture of its predecessor Windows 3.1 to a 32-bit preemptive multitasking architecture.

Windows 95 introduced numerous functions and features that were featured in later Windows versions, and continue in modern variations to this day, such as the taskbar, notification area, and the &quot;Start&quot; button which summons the Start menu. Accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that generated much prerelease hype, it was a major success and is considered to be one of the biggest and most important products in the personal computing industry. Three years after its introduction, Windows95 was followed by Windows98. Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows95 on December 31, 2000. Like WindowsNT3.51, which was released shortly before, Windows95 received only one year of extended support, ending on December 31, 2001.
==Development==

The initial design and planning of Windows 95 can be traced back to around March 1992, just around the time before the release of Windows 3.1. At this time, &quot;Windows for Workgroups 3.11&quot; and Windows NT 3.1 were still in development. At this point, Microsoft&#x27;s strategy was to have a next generation, high-end OS based on Windows NT, namely, Cairo, and a low-end, consumer-focused one as an evolution of Windows 3.1. The latter strategy was to develop a 32-bit underlying kernel and filesystem with 32-bit protected mode device drivers in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, to be used as the basis for the next version of Windows, code named &quot;Chicago.&quot; Cairo would be Microsoft&#x27;s next-generation operating system based on Windows NT, featuring a new user interface and an object-based file system, but it was not planned to be shipped before 1994. Cairo would never be shipped, however, although elements from the Cairo project eventually shipped in Windows NT 4.0 in late July 1996, without the object-based file system, which would later evolve into WinFS.

Simultaneously with Windows 3.1&#x27;s release, IBM started shipping OS/2 2.0. Microsoft realized they required an updated version of Windows that could support 32-bit applications and preemptive multitasking, but could still run on low-end hardware (Windows NT did not). Initially, the &quot;Chicago&quot; team did not know how the product would be packaged. Initial thoughts were there might be two products, MS-DOS 7, which would just be the underlying OS, an evolution of the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 kernel, with a character mode OS on top, and a fully integrated graphical Windows OS. But soon into the project, the idea of MS-DOS 7 was abandoned and the decision was made to develop only an integrated graphical OS Windows &quot;Chicago.&quot;

===Beta===
Before Windows 95&#x27;s official release, users in the United States and United Kingdom had an opportunity to participate in the Windows 95 Preview Program. For US$19.95/£19.95, users would receive several 3.5-inch floppy disks that would be used to install Windows 95 either as an upgrade from Windows 3.1 or as a fresh installation. Participants were also given a free preview of The Microsoft Network (MSN), the online service that Microsoft launched with Windows 95. During the preview period, Microsoft established various electronic distribution points for promotional and technical documentation on Chicago, including a detailed document for media reviewers describing the new system highlights. The preview versions expired in November 1995, after which the user would have to purchase their copy of the final version of Windows 95.

==Architecture==

Windows 95 was designed to be maximally compatible with existing MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows programs and device drivers while offering a more stable and better performing system. The Windows 95 architecture is an evolution of Windows for Workgroups&#x27; 386 enhanced mode.
;Configuration Manager (CONFIGMG):Responsible for implementing Plug and Play functionality; monitoring hardware configuration changes; detecting devices using &quot;bus enumerators&quot;; and allocating I/O ports, IRQs, DMA channels and memory in a conflict-free fashion.
;Installable File System Manager (Input/Output Subsystem):Coordinates access to supported file systems. Windows 95 initially shipped with support for FAT12, FAT16, the VFAT extension, ISO 9660 (CDFS), Joliet and network redirectors, with later releases supporting FAT32.

Access requests to physical media are sent to &quot;Input/Output Supervisor&quot;, a component responsible for scheduling the requests. Each physical media has its device driver: access to the disk is performed by a &quot;port driver&quot;, while access to a SCSI device is handled by a &quot;miniport&quot; driver working atop the SCSI layer. Port and Miniport drivers perform I/O operations in 32-bit protected mode, bypassing MS-DOS and BIOS, significantly improving performance. In case there is no native Windows driver for a certain storage device, or if a device is forced to run in compatibility mode, the &quot;Real Mode Mapper&quot; can access it through MS-DOS.

32-bit Windows programs are assigned protected memory segments, which can be adjusted to any desired size, and memory areas outside the segment cannot be accessed by a program, that limited harm to other programs and the system when a program crashed. Before this, programs used fixed non-exclusive 64 KB segments. While the 64 KB size was a serious handicap in DOS and Windows 3.x, lack of guarantee of exclusiveness was the cause of stability issues because programs sometimes overwrote each other&#x27;s segments, a crashing Windows 3.x program could knock out surrounding processes. Unfortunately for compatibility reasons some parts of the 32-bit Windows program memory was non-exclusive and shared among the whole system (most famously the first 1MiB of the address space), this meant that in Windows 95 a crash which incorrectly modified this shared memory could still cause harm to other programs or the system (full memory protection only came to consumer Windows systems with the launch of Windows XP).

The Win32 API is implemented by three modules, each consisting of a 16-bit and a 32-bit component:

;Kernel:Provides high-level access to memory and process management, and access to the file system. Consists of KRNL386.EXE, KERNEL32.DLL, and VWIN32.VXD.
;User:Responsible for managing and drawing the various user interface components, such as windows, menus and buttons. Consists of USER.EXE and USER32.DLL.
;Graphics Device Interface (GDI): Responsible for drawing graphics in a device-independent way. Consists of GDI.EXE and GDI32.DLL.

===Dependence on MS-DOS===
To end-users, MS-DOS appears as an underlying component of Windows 95. For example, it is possible to prevent the loading of the graphical user interface and boot the system into a real-mode MS-DOS environment. This was done by inserting command.com into the autoexec.bat file or changing the BootGUI variable in the MSDOS.SYS file to 0. This sparked debate amongst users and professionals regarding the extent to which Windows 95 is an operating system or merely a graphical shell running on top of MS-DOS.

When the graphical user interface is started, the virtual machine manager takes over the filesystem-related and disk-related functionality. MS-DOS itself is demoted to a compatibility layer for 16-bit device drivers. This contrasts with earlier versions of Windows which rely on MS-DOS to perform file and disk access (Windows for Workgroups 3.11 could also largely bypass MS-DOS when 32-bit file access and 32-bit disk access were enabled). Keeping MS-DOS in memory allows Windows 95 to use DOS device drivers when suitable Windows drivers are unavailable. Windows 95 is capable of using all 16-bit Windows 3.x drivers.

Unlike Windows 3.x, DOS programs running in Windows 95 do not need DOS drivers for the mouse, CD-ROM and sound card; Windows drivers are used instead. HIMEM.SYS is still required to boot Windows 95. EMM386 and other memory managers, however, are only used by DOS programs. In addition, CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT settings (aside from HIMEM.SYS) do not affect Windows programs. DOS games, which could not be executed on Windows 3.x, can run inside Windows 95 (games tended to lock up Windows 3.x or cause other problems). As with Windows 3.x, DOS programs that use EGA or VGA graphics modes run in windowed mode (CGA and text mode programs can continue to run).

On startup, the MS-DOS component in Windows 95 responds to a pressed key by temporarily pausing the default boot process and presenting the DOS boot options menu, allowing the user to continue starting Windows normally, start Windows in safe mode or exit to the DOS prompt. As in previous versions of MS-DOS, there is no 32-bit support and DOS drivers must be loaded for mice and other hardware.

As a consequence of DOS compatibility, Windows 95 has to keep internal DOS data structures synchronized with those of Windows 95. When starting a program, even a native 32-bit Windows program, MS-DOS momentarily executes to create a data structure known as the Program Segment Prefix. It is even possible for MS-DOS to run out of conventional memory while doing so, preventing the program from launching. Windows 3.x allocated &quot;fixed&quot; segments in conventional memory first. Since the segments were allocated as fixed, Windows could not move them, which would prevent any more programs from launching.

Microsoft partially removed support for File Control Blocks (an API hold-over of DOS 1.x and CP/M) in Windows 95 OSR2 (OEM Service Release 2). FCB functions can read FAT32 volumes, but not write to them.

With merging Windows together with MS-DOS, Microsoft had effectively locked-in users who may have been using a different non-Microsoft DOS, like PC DOS and DR DOS, who could previously make use of Windows 3.x without requiring Microsoft&#x27;s MS-DOS. Caldera demostrated that Windows 95 could in fact run on top of its DR DOS operating system, and argued that Microsoft was being anti-competitive, which would prove useful in a later court case between Caldera and Microsoft.

==User interface==
Windows 95 introduced a redesigned shell based around a desktop metaphor; File shortcuts (also known as shell links) were introduced and the desktop was re-purposed to hold shortcuts to applications, files and folders, reminiscent of Mac OS.

In Windows 3.1, the desktop was used to display icons of running applications. In Windows 95, the currently running applications were displayed as buttons on a taskbar across the bottom of the screen. The taskbar also contained a notification area used to display icons for background applications, a volume control and the current time.

The Start menu, invoked by clicking the &quot;Start&quot; button on the taskbar or by pressing the Windows key, was introduced as an additional means of launching applications or opening documents. While maintaining the program groups used by its predecessor Program Manager, it also displayed applications within cascading sub-menus.

The previous File Manager program was replaced by Windows Explorer and the Explorer-based Control Panel and several other special folders were added such as My Computer, Dial-Up Networking, Recycle Bin, Network Neighborhood, My Documents, Recent documents, Fonts, Printers, and My Briefcase among others. AutoRun was introduced for CD drives.

The user interface looked dramatically different from prior versions of Windows, but its design language did not have a special name like &quot;Metro&quot;, &quot;Aqua&quot; or &quot;Material Design&quot;. Internally it was called &quot;the new shell&quot; and later simply &quot;the shell&quot;. The subproject within Microsoft to develop the new shell was internally known as &quot;Stimpy&quot;.

In 1994, Microsoft designers Mark Malamud and Erik Gavriluk approached Brian Eno to compose music for the Windows 95 project. The result was the six-second start-up music-sound of the Windows 95 operating system, &quot;The Microsoft Sound&quot; and it was first released as a startup sound in May 1995 on Windows 95 May Test Release build 468. The previous &quot;tada&quot; startup sound from Windows 3.1 became the shutdown sound for Windows 95.

When released for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, Internet Explorer 4 came with an optional Windows Desktop Update, which modified the shell to provide several additional updates to Windows Explorer, including a &quot;Quick Launch&quot; toolbar, and new features integrated with Internet Explorer, such as Active Desktop (which allowed Internet content to be displayed directly on the desktop).

Some of the user interface elements introduced in Windows 95, such as the desktop, taskbar, Start menu and Windows Explorer file manager, remained fundamentally unchanged on future versions of Windows.

==Technical improvements==

Windows 95 included support for 255-character mixed-case long filenames and preemptively multitasked protected-mode 32-bit applications. 16-bit processes were still co-operatively multitasked.

===Plug and Play===
Windows 95 tried to automate device detection and configuration as much as possible, but could still fall back to manual settings if necessary. During the initial install process of Windows 95, it would attempt to automatically detect all devices installed in the system.

Windows 95 also introduced the Device Manager to indicate which devices were working optimally with correct drivers and configuration and to allow the user to override automatic Plug and Play-based driver installation with manual options or give a choice of several semi-automatic configurations to try to free up resources for devices that still needed manual configuration.

Windows 95 also has built-in support for Advanced Power Management.

===Long file names===

32-bit File Access is necessary for the &quot;long file names&quot; feature introduced with Windows 95 through the use of the VFAT file system extension. It is available to both Windows programs and MS-DOS programs started from Windows (they have to be adapted slightly, since accessing long file names requires using larger pathname buffers and hence different system calls). Competing DOS-compatible operating systems released before Windows 95 cannot see these names. Using older versions of DOS utilities to manipulate files means that the long names are not visible and are lost if files are moved or renamed and by the copy (but not the original) if the file is copied. During a Windows 95 automatic upgrade of an older Windows 3.1 system, DOS and third-party disk utilities which can destroy long file names are identified and made unavailable. When Windows 95 is started in DOS mode, e.g. for running DOS programs, low-level access to disks is locked out. In case the need arises to depend on disk utilities that do not recognize long file names, such as the MS-DOS 6.x&#x27;s defrag utility, a program called LFNBACK for backup and restoration of long file names is provided on the CD-ROM, specifically in its \ADMIN\APPTOOLS\LFNBACK directory. 

===32-bit===
Windows 95 followed Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with its lack of support for older, 16-bit x86 processors, thus requiring an Intel 80386 (or compatible). While the OS kernel is 32-bit, much code (especially for the user interface) remained 16-bit for performance reasons as well as development time constraints.

The introduction of 32-bit file access in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 meant that 16-bit real mode MS-DOS is not used for managing the files while Windows is running, and the earlier introduction of the 32-bit disk access means that the PC BIOS is often no longer used for managing hard disks. DOS can be used for running old-style drivers for compatibility, but Microsoft discourages using them, as this prevents proper multitasking and impairs system stability. Control Panel allows a user to see which MS-DOS components are used by the system; optimal performance is achieved when they are bypassed. The Windows kernel uses MS-DOS style real-mode drivers in &quot;Safe Mode&quot;, which exists to allow a user to fix problems relating to loading native, protected-mode drivers.

===Core improvements in OEM Service Releases===
OEM Service Releases of Windows 95 introduced support in Windows for several core new technologies that were not included in the original release of Windows 95. These include the Internet Explorer web browser, DriveSpace compression, OpenGL, DirectX, FAT32 file system support, UltraDMA mode for disk drives, Universal Serial Bus, IEEE 1394 (FireWire), and Accelerated Graphics Port.

===Accessibility features===
Windows 95 introduced computer accessibility features like Sticky keys, FilterKeys, ToggleKeys, Mouse keys. Microsoft Active Accessibility API was introduced as an add-on for Windows 95.

==System requirements==
Official system requirements were an Intel 386DX CPU of any speed, 4 MB of system RAM and 50–55 MB of hard disk space depending on features selected. These minimal claims were made in order to maximize the available market of Windows 3.1 migrations. This configuration would rely heavily on virtual memory and was only optimal for productive use on single-tasking dedicated workstations. It was possible to run Windows 95 on a 386 SX, but this led to even less acceptable performance due to its 16-bit external data bus. To achieve optimal performance, Microsoft recommended an i486 or compatible CPU with at least 8 MB of RAM.

Windows 95 may fail to boot on computers with a processor faster than 2.1 GHz and more than approximately 480 MB of memory. In such a case, reducing the file cache size or the size of video memory can help. The theoretical maximum according to Microsoft is 2 GB.

Most copies of Windows 95 were on CD-ROM, but a -inch floppy version was also available for older machines. The retail floppy disk version of Windows 95 came on 13 DMF formatted floppy disks, while OSR2.1 doubled the floppy count to 26. Both versions exclude additional software that the CD-ROM version might have featured. Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 was also available on floppy disks.

==Upgradeability==
Windows 95 was superseded by Windows 98, which also included the Windows Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default. It could still be directly upgraded by either Windows 2000 Professional or Windows Me. Office 2000 was the last version of Microsoft Office to be compatible with Windows 95. Similarly, Windows Media Player 7.0, released in June 2000, and DirectX 8.0a, released in February 2001, are the last versions of Windows Media Player and DirectX available for Windows 95, respectively.

Updates for Windows 95 could be installed via the Windows Update website. The Windows Update website for Windows 95 and 98 was removed in 2011. An independent project named Windows Update Restored aims to restore the Windows Update websites for older versions of Windows, including Windows 95.

While Windows 95 did not officially support the .NET Framework, versions 2.0 and 3.5 were unofficially backported for the operating system in 2024.

===Internet Explorer===
Windows 95 originally shipped without Internet Explorer, and the default network installation did not include TCP/IP, the network protocol used on the Internet. At the release date of Windows 95, Internet Explorer 1.0 was available, but only in the Plus! add-on pack for Windows 95, which was a separate product. The Plus! pack did not reach as many retail consumers as the operating system itself (it was mainly advertised for its non-Internet-related add-ons such as themes and better disk compression) but was usually included in pre-installed (OEM) sales, and at the time of Windows 95&#x27;s release, the web was being browsed mainly with a variety of early web browsers such as NCSA Mosaic and Netscape Navigator (promoted by products such as IBox).

Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1 was the first release of Windows to include Internet Explorer (version 2.0) with the OS. While there was no uninstaller, it could be deleted easily if desired. OEM Service Release 2 included Internet Explorer 3. The installation of Internet Explorer 4 on Windows 95 (or the OSR2.5 version preinstalled on a computer) gave Windows 95 Active Desktop and browser integration into Windows Explorer, known as the Windows Desktop Update. The CD version of the last release of Windows 95, OEM Service Release 2.5 (version 4.00.950C), includes Internet Explorer 4, and installs it after Windows 95&#x27;s initial setup and first boot are complete.

While only the 4.x series of the browser contained the option to install the Windows Desktop Update features, the subsequent 5.x version had the option hidden. Editing the installer&#x27;s configuration file located in a temporary folder would make the feature available in the installer. Alternatively, Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 users could first install IE 4 with the desktop update before installing a newer version of Internet Explorer. The last version of Internet Explorer supported on Windows 95 is Internet Explorer 5.5 with SP2, which was released on July 23, 2001. Windows 95 shipped with Microsoft&#x27;s dial-up online service called The Microsoft Network (MSN).

==Release and promotion==
Sales were projected as high as $720 million on release day. The marketing campaign for Windows 95 was estimated at $1 billion and spanned the entire industry. The Windows 95 release included a commercial featuring The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1981 single &quot;Start Me Up&quot; (a reference to the Start button). It was widely reported that Microsoft paid the Rolling Stones between US$8 and US$14 million for the use of the song in the Windows 95 advertising campaign. However, Microsoft said that this was just a rumour spread by the band to increase their market value, and the company paid US$3 million. A 30-minute promotional video, labeled a &quot;cyber sitcom,&quot; featuring Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry, was also released to showcase the features of Windows 95. Microsoft&#x27;s US$200 million advertising campaign featured stories of people waiting in line outside stores to get a copy.

In the UK, the largest computer chain, PC World, received a large quantity of point-of-sale material; many branches opened at midnight to sell the first copies of the product. Copies of &quot;The Times&quot; were available for free, and Microsoft paid for 1.5 million issues (twice the daily circulation at the time).

In the United States, the Empire State Building in New York City was lit to match the colors of the Windows logo. In Canada, a banner was hung down the side of the CN Tower in Toronto.

The release included a number of &quot;Fun Stuff&quot; items on the CD, including music videos of Edie Brickell&#x27;s &quot;Good Times&quot; and Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Buddy Holly,&quot; a trailer for the 1995 film &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and the computer game &quot;Hover!&quot;

Sales were strong, with one million copies shipped worldwide in just four days. According to International Data Corporation, by the end of 1998, Windows 95 was the most used desktop OS with 57.4% of the marketshare, with its successor Windows 98 coming in second at 17.2%. Windows 95 also still sold more non-OEM copies to large customers in the month of May 1999, which analysts attributed to large companies opting to wait for the release of Windows 2000.

===Editions===
Several Windows 95 editions have been released. Only the original release was sold as a shrink-wrapped product; later editions were provided only to computer OEMs for installation on new PCs. For this reason, these editions are known as OEM Service Releases (OSR).

Together with the introduction of Windows 95, Microsoft released the &quot;Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95&quot; pack, which contained several optional components for high-end multimedia PCs, including Internet Explorer, DriveSpace and additional themes.

The first service pack was made available half a year after the original release and fixed several small bugs.

The second service pack mainly introduced support for new hardware, most notably support for hard drives larger than 2 GB in the form of the FAT32 file system. This release was never made available to end-users directly and was only sold through OEMs (OSR2) with the purchase of a new PC. 

A full third service pack was never released, but two smaller revisions to the second were released in the form of a USB Supplement (OSR2.1) and the Windows Desktop Update (OSR2.5). Both were made available as updated disc images shipped by OEMs, and the Windows Desktop Update was also released with the standalone Internet Explorer 4.0 release. OSR2.5 was notable for featuring several changes to the Windows Explorer, integrating it with Internet Explorer 4.0—this version of Internet Explorer looks very similar to the one featured in Windows 98.


==Legacy==
On December 31, 2001, Microsoft ended its support for Windows 95, making it an &quot;obsolete&quot; product per the Microsoft Lifecycle Policy.

Many features have since become key components of the Microsoft Windows series, such as the Start menu and the taskbar, originated in Windows 95. Neil MacDonald, a Gartner analyst, said that Windows 95 &quot;was a quantum leap in difference in technological capability and stability.&quot; Ina Fried of &quot;CNET&quot; said that &quot;by the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world.&quot;

The basic design of Windows 95, with its combination of a desktop that can be used as a storage location, a pop-out application menu, and a taskbar showing running applications, a clock and a system tray, was strongly influential on future user interfaces for desktop operating systems. The core UI concepts of Windows 95 have persisted up to the present day in both Windows itself as well as on other operating systems like Linux, with the default behaviour of desktop environments like KDE and XFCE replicating it in many aspects.

Even though support for Windows 95 has ended, the software has occasionally remained in use on legacy systems for various purposes. In addition, some video game enthusiasts choose to use Windows 95 for their legacy system to play old DOS games, although some other versions of Windows such as Windows 98 can also be used for this purpose.

<doc id="34069" wikidata="Q82414" url="?curid=34069" title="Winter Olympic Games">
<text>The Winter Olympic Games (), also known as the Winter Olympics, is a major international multi-sport event held once every four years for sports practiced on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympic Games, the 1924 Winter Olympics, were held in Chamonix, France. The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from 776 BCE to 394 CE. The Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) 1,500 years later in 1894, leading to the first modern Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.
The original five Winter Olympic Sports (consisting of nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 to 1936, interrupted in 1940 and 1944 by World War II, and resumed in 1948. Until 1992, the Summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games were held in the same year. A decision to change this was made in 1986, when during the 91st International Olympic Committee session, IOC members decided to alternate the Summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games on separate four-year cycles in even-numbered years. Also, at that same congress it was decided that 1992 Winter Olympics would be the last to be held in the same year as the Summer Games and that to change the rotation, the games that would be held in 1996 would be brought forward by two years, being scheduled to 1994. After those games, the next were to be held in 1998 when the four-year Olympic Cycle resumed.

The Winter Olympic Games have evolved since their inception. Sports and disciplines have been added and some of them, such as alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton, and snowboarding, have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program. Some others, including curling and bobsleigh, have been discontinued and later reintroduced; others have been permanently discontinued, such as military patrol, though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it. Still others, such as speed skiing, bandy and skijoring, were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced the profile of the Games. It generated income via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the IOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and corporate sponsors, to exert influence. The IOC has had to address numerous criticisms over the decades like internal scandals, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians, as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympic Games. Countries have used the Winter Olympic Games as well as the Summer Olympic Games to proclaim the superiority of their political systems.

The Winter Olympic Games have been hosted on three continents by thirteen countries, all of whom are located in the Northern Hemisphere. They have been held four times in the United States (1932, 1960, 1980, and 2002), three times in France (1924, 1968, and 1992) and twice each in Switzerland (1928 and 1948), Austria (1964 and 1976), Norway (1952 and 1994), Japan (1972 and 1998), Italy (1956 and 2006) and Canada (1988 and 2010). Also, the Winter Olympic Games have been held just once each in Germany (1936), Yugoslavia (1984), Russia (2014), South Korea (2018), and China (2022). The IOC has selected the Italian cities of Milan and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo to host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The Winter Olympics are usually held in February, during the winter season of the Northern Hemisphere. , no city in the Southern Hemisphere has applied to host the Winter Olympic Games in the month of August (during the winter months of the Southern Hemisphere).

, twelve countries have participated in every Winter Olympic GamesAustria, Canada, Finland, France, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Also, Czechoslovakia participated in all Winter Olympic Games before its dissolution and its successors, Czech Republic and Slovakia have participated in all Winter Games thereafter. Six of these countries have won medals at every Winter Olympic GamesAustria, Canada, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. The only country to have won a gold medal at every Winter Olympic Games is the United States. Norway leads the all-time medal record for the Winter Olympic Games. When including defunct states, Germany (comprising the former countries of West Germany and East Germany) leads, followed by Norway, Russia (including the former Soviet Union), and the United States.

==History==
===Early years===
 A predecessor, the Nordic Games, were organised by General Viktor Gustaf Balck in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1901 and were held again in 1903 and 1905 and then every fourth year thereafter until 1926. Balck was a charter member of the IOC and a close friend of Olympic Games founder Pierre de Coubertin. He attempted to have winter sports, specifically figure skating, added to the Olympic programme but was unsuccessful until the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. Four figure skating events were contested, at which Ulrich Salchow (10-time world champion) and Madge Syers won the individual titles.

Three years later, Italian count Eugenio Brunetta d&#x27;Usseaux proposed that the IOC stage a week of winter sports included as part of the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. The organisers opposed this idea because they desired to protect the integrity of the Nordic Games and were concerned about a lack of facilities for winter sports.

The idea was resurrected for the 1916 Games, which were to be held in Berlin, Germany. A winter sports week with speed skating, figure skating, ice hockey and Nordic skiing were planned, but the 1916 Olympics was cancelled after the outbreak of World War I.

===1920 to 1936===

The first Olympics after the war, the 1920 Summer Olympics, were held in Antwerp, Belgium, and featured figure skating and an ice hockey tournament. Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey were banned from competing in the games. At the IOC Congress held the following year it was decided that the host nation of the 1924 Summer Olympics, France, would host a separate &quot;International Winter Sports Week&quot; under the patronage of the IOC. Chamonix was chosen to host this week (actually 11 days) of events.

The 1924 games in Chamonix proved to be a success when more than 250 athletes from 16 nations competed in 16 events. Athletes from Finland and Norway won 28 medals, more than the rest of the participating nations combined. The first gold medal awarded was won by Charles Jewtraw of the United States in the 500-meter speed skate. Sonja Henie of Norway, at just 11 years old, competed in the ladies&#x27; figure skating and, although finishing last, became popular with fans. Gillis Grafström of Sweden defended his 1920 gold medal in men&#x27;s figure skating, becoming the first Olympian to win gold medals in both Summer and Winter Olympics. 
Germany remained banned until 1925, and instead hosted a series of games called Deutsche Kampfspiele, starting with the winter edition of 1922 (which predated the first Winter Olympics). In 1925 the IOC decided to create a separate winter event and the 1924 games in Chamonix were retroactively designated as the first Winter Olympics.

St. Moritz, Switzerland, was appointed by the IOC to host the second Winter Games in 1928. Fluctuating weather conditions challenged the hosts. The opening ceremony was held in a blizzard while warm weather conditions plagued sporting events throughout the rest of the games. Because of the weather the 10,000 metre speed-skating event had to be abandoned and officially cancelled. The weather was not the only noteworthy aspect of the 1928 games: Sonja Henie of Norway returned to the Winter Olympics to make history when she won the ladies&#x27; figure skating at the age of 15. She became the youngest Olympic champion in history, a distinction she held for 70 years, and went on to defend her title at the next two Winter Olympics. Gillis Grafström won his third consecutive figure skating gold and went on to win silver in 1932, becoming the most decorated men&#x27;s figure skater to date.

The next Winter Olympics, held in Lake Placid, New York, United States was the first to be hosted outside of Europe. Seventeen nations and 252 athletes participated. This was less than in 1928, as the journey to Lake Placid was too long and expensive for some European nations that encountered financial problems in the midst of the Great Depression. The athletes competed in fourteen events in four sports. Virtually no snow fell for two months before the Games, and there was not enough snow to hold all the events until mid-January. Sonja Henie defended her Olympic title, and Eddie Eagan of the United States, who had been an Olympic champion in boxing in 1920, won the gold medal in the men&#x27;s bobsleigh event to join Gillis Grafström as the only athletes to have won gold medals in both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Eagan has the distinction as the only Olympian as of 2020 to accomplish this feat in different sports.

The German towns of Garmisch and Partenkirchen joined to organise the 1936 Winter Games, held from 6–16 February. This was the last time the Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same country in the same year. Alpine skiing made its Olympic debut, but skiing teachers were barred from entering because they were considered to be professionals. Because of this decision the Swiss and Austrian skiers refused to compete at the games.

World War II interrupted the Winter Olympics. The 1940 games had been awarded to Sapporo, Japan, but the decision was rescinded in 1938 because of the Japanese invasion of China. The games were then to be held at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, but the 1940 games were cancelled following the German invasion of Poland in 1939. Due to the ongoing war, the 1944 games, originally scheduled for Cortina D&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, were cancelled.

===1948 to 1962===

St. Moritz was selected to host the first post-war games, in 1948. Switzerland&#x27;s neutrality had protected the town during World War II, and most venues from the 1928 games remained in place, which made St. Moritz a logical choice. It became the first city to host a Winter Olympics twice. Twenty-eight countries competed in Switzerland, but athletes from Germany and Japan were not invited. Controversy erupted when two hockey teams from the United States arrived, both claiming to be the legitimate U.S. Olympic hockey representative. The Olympic flag presented at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp was stolen, as was its replacement. There was unprecedented parity at these games, during which 10 countries won gold medals—more than any games to that point.

The Olympic Flame tradition was introduced at the 1952 games in Oslo, when the flame was lit in the fireplace by Norwegian skiing pioneer Sondre Nordheim and the first Winter torch relay was conducted by 94 torchbearers entirely on their skis. Bandy, a popular sport in the Nordic countries, was featured as a demonstration sport, though only Norway, Sweden, and Finland fielded teams. Norwegian athletes won 17 medals, which outpaced all the other nations. They were led by Hjalmar Andersen who won three gold medals in four events in the speed skating competition.

After not being able to host the games in 1944, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo was selected to organise the 1956 Winter Olympics. At the opening ceremonies the final torchbearer, Guido Caroli, entered the Olympic Stadium on ice skates. As he skated around the stadium his skate caught on a cable and he fell and burned his arm, nearly extinguishing the flame. He was able to recover and light the cauldron. These were the first Winter Games to be televised, and the first Olympics ever broadcast to an international audience, though no television rights were sold until the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The Cortina games were used to test the feasibility of televising large sporting events.

The Soviet Union made its Olympic debut and had an immediate impact, winning more medals than any other nation. The Soviets&#x27; immediate success might be explained by the advent of the state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateur athlete&quot;. The USSR entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train full-time. Chiharu Igaya won the first Winter Olympics medal for Japan and the continent of Asia when he placed second in the slalom.

The IOC awarded the 1960 Olympics to Squaw Valley, United States. 
the announcement of its selection came as a shock as the resort was undeveloped and unknown outside the United States.About US$80,000,000 was spent over four years to build the completely non-existent infrastructure. The opening and closing ceremonies were the firsts produced by Walt Disney Company. The Squaw Valley Olympics was the first Winter Games to have a dedicated athletes&#x27; village, the first to use a computer (courtesy of IBM) to tabulate results, and the first to feature female speed skating events. This edition is the only one to date to not have bobsleigh competitions, as the number of countries registered in the event was insufficient and the costs of building the track were too high for the Organizing Committee.To replace the event, an extra edition from the FIBT World Championship was held.

===1964 to 1980===
The Austrian city of Innsbruck was the host in 1964. For the first time, the Olympic torch of the Winter Olympic Games was lit at the traditional ritual held in the temple of Olympia. Although Innsbruck was a traditional winter sports resort, unprojected warm weather caused a lack of snow and organisers were unable to save enough snow to be used during the Games, and the Austrian army was enlisted to transport snow and ice from other places to the sports venues. Soviet speed-skater Lidia Skoblikova made history by winning all four-speed skating events. Her career total of six gold medals set a record for Winter Olympics athletes. Also, for the first time Luge was added to the Olympic program, but the sport received bad publicity when a competitor was killed in a pre-Olympic training run.

Held in the French town of Grenoble, the 1968 Winter Olympics were the first Olympic Games to be broadcast in colour. There were 1,158 athletes from 37 nations competing in 35 events. French alpine ski racer Jean-Claude Killy became only the second person to win all the men&#x27;s alpine skiing events. Due the high interest around the world, the organising committee sold television rights for US$2 million, which was more than twice the cost of the broadcast rights for the Innsbruck Games. For the first time, the organizers chose to decentralize the Games to save costs and the events were spread across three long distances clusters, which led to the need to build three Olympic Villages. Along the high costs, the organisers claimed that this was necessary to accommodate technological advances, however, critics disputed this, alleging that the layout would incorporate the best possible venues for television broadcasts at the athletes&#x27; expense.

The 1972 Winter Games, held in Sapporo, Japan, were the first to be hosted on a continent other than North America or Europe. The issue of professionalism was disputed during these Games when a number of alpine skiers were found to have participated in a ski camp at Mammoth Mountain in the United States; three days before the opening ceremony, IOC president Avery Brundage threatened to bar the skiers from competing in the Games as he insisted that they were no longer amateurs having benefited financially from their status as athletes. Eventually only Austrian Karl Schranz, who earned more than the other skiers, was excluded from the competition. Canada boycotted the 1972 and the 1976 ice hockey tournaments in protest at not being able to use players from professional leagues. Canadian authorities also accused the Soviet Union of using state-sponsored athletes, who were de facto professionals. Francisco Fernández Ochoa became the first and, as of 2022, the only Spaniard to win a Winter Olympic gold medal when he triumphed in the slalom.

The 1976 Winter Olympics had initially been awarded in 1970 to Denver, Colorado in the United States. These Games would have coincided with the year of Colorado&#x27;s centennial and the United States Bicentennial. However, the increasing costs of the event and the oil crisis led to a local plebiscite held in November 1972, that resulted in the city withdrawing from hosting the Games, as the people of Colorado voted against public funding of the Games by a 3:2 margin. The IOC responded by offering the Games to Vancouver-Garibaldi, British Columbia in Canada, which had previously been a finalist bid for the 1976 Games. However, a change in the provincial government resulted in an administration that did not support the Olympic bid, so the IOC&#x27;s offer was rejected.

Salt Lake City, previously a candidate for the 1972 Winter Olympics, then put itself forward, but a tense political situation led IOC to invite Innsbruck to host the 1976 Games, as all the infrastructure used during the 1964 Games had been maintained. Despite only having half the usual time to prepare for the Games, Innsbruck accepted the invitation to replace Denver in February 1973. During the opening ceremonies, two cauldrons were lit because it was the second time that the Austrian town had hosted the Winter Games. The 1976 Games featured the first combination bobsleigh-and-luge track, in neighbouring Igls. The Soviet Union won its fourth consecutive ice hockey gold medal.

In 1980 the Winter Olympics returned to Lake Placid, which had hosted the 1932 Games.Unlike previous editions, Lake Placid had no competitors in this bid process. Cyprus made their Olympic debut at the games. People&#x27;s Republic of China and the first tropical nation Costa Rica competed for the first at the Winter Games. The Republic of China boycoted the Games, in protest of the IOC&#x27;s recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the only &quot;China&quot;, and its request for the Republic of China to compete as &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. The PRC, on the other hand, returned to the Olympics for the first time since 1952 and made its Winter Olympic debut.

American speed-skater Eric Heiden set either an Olympic or World record in every one of the five events in which he competed, winning a total of five individual gold medals and breaking the record for most individual golds in a single Olympics (both Summer and Winter). Hanni Wenzel won both the slalom and giant slalom and her country, Liechtenstein, became the smallest nation to produce an Olympic gold medallist. In the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;, the American hockey team composed of college players beat the favoured seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union, and progressed to eventually win the gold medal.

===1984 to 1998===

Sapporo, Japan, and Gothenburg, Sweden, were front-runners to host the 1984 Winter Olympics. It was therefore a surprise when Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, was selected as host. The Games were well-organised and not affected by the run-up to the war that engulfed the country eight years later. A total of 49 nations and 1,272 athletes participated in 39 events. Host nation Yugoslavia won its first Olympic medal when alpine skier Jure Franko won silver in the giant slalom. Another sporting highlight was the free dance performance of British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean; their &quot;Boléro&quot; routine received unanimous perfect scores for artistic impression, earning them the gold medal.
In 1988, the Canadian city of Calgary hosted the first Winter Olympics to span three weekends, lasting for a total of 16 days. New events were added in ski-jumping and speed skating, while future Olympic sports curling, short track speed skating and freestyle skiing made their debut appearance as demonstration sports. The speed skating events were held indoors for the first time, on the Olympic Oval. Dutch skater Yvonne van Gennip won three gold medals and set two world records, beating skaters from the favoured East German team in every race.

Her medal total was equalled by Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen, who won all three events in his sport. Alberto Tomba, an Italian skier, made his Olympic debut by winning both the giant slalom and slalom. East German Christa Rothenburger won the women&#x27;s 1,000 metre speed skating event. Seven months later she would earn a silver in track cycling at the Summer Games in Seoul, to become the only athlete to win medals in both a Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year. The 1988 games are well remembered in popular culture from two films based on its events: Cool Runnings about the Jamaican bobsled team; and Eddie the Eagle about British ski jumper Michael Edwards, who finished last but set a British record of 73.5 metres.

The 1992 Winter Games were the last to be held in the same year as the Summer Games. They were hosted in the French Savoie region, with 18 events held in the city of Albertville and the remaining events spread out over the Savoie. Political changes of the time were reflected in the composition of the Olympic teams competing in France: this was the first Games to be held after the fall of Communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Germany competed as a single nation for the first time since the 1964 Games.

Former Yugoslavian republics Croatia and Slovenia made their debuts as independent nations; most of the former Soviet republics still competed as a single team known as the Unified Team, but the Baltic States made independent appearances for the first time since before World War II. At 16 years old, Finnish ski jumper Toni Nieminen made history by becoming the youngest male Winter Olympic champion. New Zealand skier Annelise Coberger became the first Winter Olympic medallist from the southern hemisphere when she won a silver medal in the women&#x27;s slalom.

The 1994 Winter Olympics, held in Lillehammer, Norway, were the first Winter Games to be held in a different year from the Summer Games. This change resulted from the decision reached in the 91st IOC Session (1986) to separate the Summer and Winter Games and place them in alternating even-numbered years. Lillehammer is the northernmost city to ever host the Winter Games. It was the second time the Games were held in Norway, after the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, and the first time the Olympic Truce was observed. As a result, after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia made their Olympic debuts.

The women&#x27;s figure skating competition drew media attention when American skater Nancy Kerrigan was injured on 6 January 1994, in an assault planned by the ex-husband of opponent Tonya Harding. Both skaters competed in the Games, but the gold medal was narrowly won by Oksana Baiul who became Ukraine&#x27;s first Olympic champion, while Kerrigan won the silver medal. Johann Olav Koss of Norway won three gold medals, coming first in all of the distance speed skating events.

13-year-old Kim Yoon-Mi became the youngest-ever Olympic gold medallist when South Korea won the women&#x27;s 3,000-metre speed skating relay. Bjørn Dæhli of Norway won a medal in four out of five cross-country events, becoming the most decorated Winter Olympian until then. Russia won the most events, with eleven gold medals, while Norway achieved 26 podium finishes, collecting the most medals overall on home ground. Juan Antonio Samaranch described Lillehammer as &quot;the best Olympic Winter Games ever&quot; in his closing ceremony speech.

The 1998 Winter Olympics were held in the Japanese city of Nagano and were the first Games to host more than 2,000 athletes. The National Hockey League allowed its players to participate in the men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament for the first time, and the Czech Republic won the tournament. Women&#x27;s ice hockey made its debut, and the United States won the gold medal. Bjørn Dæhlie of Norway won three gold medals in Nordic skiing, becoming the most decorated Winter Olympic athlete, with eight gold medals and twelve medals overall. Austrian Hermann Maier survived a crash during the downhill competition and returned to win gold in the super-G and the giant slalom. Tara Lipinski of the United States, aged just 15, became the youngest ever female gold medallist in an individual event when she won the Ladies&#x27; Singles, a record that had stood since Sonja Henie of Norway won the same event, also aged 15, in St. Moritz in 1928. New world records were set in speed skating largely due to the introduction of the clap skate.

===2002 to 2022===

After a tumultuous host city process, the 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City, United States. 2,399 athletes from 77 National Olympic Committees participated in 78 events in 7 sports. These Games were the first to take place since the September 11 attacks of 2001, which meant a higher degree of security to avoid a terrorist attack. The opening ceremony saw signs of the aftermath of the events of that day, including the flag that flew at Ground Zero, and honour guards of NYPD and FDNY members.

German Georg Hackl won a silver in the singles luge, becoming the first athlete in Olympic history to win medals in the same individual event in five consecutive Olympics. Canada achieved an unprecedented double by winning both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey gold medals. Canada became embroiled with Russia in a controversy that involved the judging of the pairs figure skating competition. The Russian pair of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze competed against the Canadian pair of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier for the gold medal.

The Canadians appeared to have skated well enough to win the competition, yet the Russians were awarded the gold. The French judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, awarded the gold to the Russians. An investigation revealed that she had been pressured to give the gold to the Russian pair regardless of how they skated; in return, the Russian judge would look favourably on the French entrants in the ice dancing competition.

The IOC decided to award both pairs the gold medal in a second medal ceremony held later in the Games. Australian Steven Bradbury became the first gold medallist from the southern hemisphere when he won the 1,000 metre short-track speed skating event.
The Italian city of Turin hosted the 2006 Winter Olympics. It was the second time that Italy had hosted the Winter Olympic Games. South Korean athletes won 10 medals, including 6 gold in the short-track speed skating events. Sun-Yu Jin won three gold medals while her teammate Hyun-Soo Ahn won three gold medals and a bronze. In the women&#x27;s Cross-Country team pursuit Canadian Sara Renner broke one of her poles and, when he saw her dilemma, Norwegian coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen decided to lend her a pole. In so doing she was able to help her team win a silver medal in the event at the expense of the Norwegian team, who finished fourth.

On winning the Super-G, Kjetil-Andre Aamodt of Norway became the most decorated ski racer of all time with 4 gold and 8 overall medals. He is also the only ski racer to have won the same event at three Olympics, winning the Super-G in 1992, 2002, and 2006. Claudia Pechstein of Germany became the first speed skater to earn nine career medals.

In February 2009, Pechstein tested positive for &quot;blood manipulation&quot; and received a two-year suspension, which she appealed. The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld her suspension but a Swiss court ruled that she could compete for a spot on the 2010 German Olympic team. This ruling was brought to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which overturned the lower court&#x27;s ruling and precluded her from competing in Vancouver.

In 2003, the IOC awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics to Vancouver, thus allowing Canada to host its second Winter Olympics. With a population of more than 2.5 million people Vancouver is the largest metropolitan area to ever host a Winter Olympic Games. Over 2,500 athletes from 82 countries participated in 86 events. The death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training run on the day of the opening ceremonies resulted in the Whistler Sliding Centre changing the track layout on safety grounds.

Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen won five medals in the six cross-country events on the women&#x27;s programme. She finished the Olympics with three golds, a silver and a bronze. For the first time, Canada won a gold medal at an Olympic Games it hosted, having failed to do so at both the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. In contrast to the lack of gold medals at these previous Olympics, the Canadian team finished first overall in gold medal wins, and became the first host nation—since Norway in 1952—to lead the gold medal count, with 14 medals. In doing so, it also broke the record for the most gold medals won by a NOC at a single Winter Olympics (the previous was 13, set by the Soviet Union in 1976 and matched by Norway in 2002).

The Vancouver Games were notable for the poor performance of the Russian athletes. From their first Winter Olympics in 1956 to the 2006 Games, a Soviet or Russian delegation had never been outside the top five medal-winning nations, but in 2010 they finished sixth in total medals and eleventh in gold medals. President Dmitry Medvedev called for the resignation of top sports officials immediately after the Games. Russia&#x27;s disappointing performance at Vancouver is cited as the reason behind the enhancement of an already existing doping scheme alleged to have been in operation at major events such as the 2014 Games at Sochi.

The success of Asian countries stood in stark contrast to the under-performing Russian team, with Vancouver marking a high point for medals won by Asian countries. At the Albertville Games in 1992 the Asian countries had won fifteen medals, three of which were gold. In Vancouver, the total number of medals won by athletes from Asia had increased to thirty-one, with eleven of them being gold. The rise of Asian nations in Winter Olympics sports is due in part to the growth of winter sports programmes and the interest in winter sports in nations such as Kazakhstan, South Korea, Japan and China. These results increased the chances of an Asian city hosting the 2018 Winter Olympics that would be held the following year.

Sochi, Russia, was selected as the host city for the 2014 Winter Olympics over Salzburg, Austria, and Pyeongchang, South Korea. This was the first time that Russia had hosted a Winter Olympics. The Games took place from 7 to 23 February 2014. A record 2,800 athletes from 88 countries competed in 98 events. The Olympic Village and Olympic Stadium were located on the Black Sea coast. All of the mountain venues were away in the alpine region known as Krasnaya Polyana. The Games were the most expensive until the date, with a cost of £30 billion (US$51 billion).

On the snow, Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen took two golds to bring his total tally of Olympic medals to 13, overtaking his compatriot Bjørn Dæhlie to become the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time. Another Norwegian, cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen took three golds; her total of ten Olympic medals tied her as the female Winter Olympian with most medals, alongside Raisa Smetanina and Stefania Belmondo. Snowboarder Ayumu Hirano became the youngest medallist on snow at the Winter Games when he took a silver in the halfpipe competition at the age of fifteen.

On the ice, the Netherlands team dominated the speed skating events, taking 23 medals, four clean sweeps of the podium places and at least one medal in each of the twelve medal events. Ireen Wüst was their most successful competitor, taking two golds and three silvers. In figure skating, Yuzuru Hanyu became the first skater to break the 100-point barrier in the short programme on the way to winning the gold medal. Among the sledding disciplines, luger Armin Zöggeler took a bronze, becoming the first Winter Olympian to secure a medal in six consecutive Games.

Following their disappointing performance at the 2010 Games, and an investment of £600 million in elite sport, Russia initially topped the medal table, taking 13 gold and 33 total medals. However, Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of the Russian national anti-doping laboratory, subsequently claimed that he had been involved in doping dozens of Russian competitors for the Games, and that he had been assisted by the Russian Federal Security Service in opening and re-sealing bottles containing urine samples so that samples with banned substances could be replaced with &quot;clean&quot; urine.

A subsequent investigation commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency led by Richard McLaren concluded that a state-sponsored doping programme had operated in Russia from &quot;at least late 2011 to 2015&quot; across the &quot;vast majority&quot; of Summer and Winter Olympic sports. On 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that Russia would compete as the Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics and by the end of 2017 the IOC Disciplinary Commission had disqualified 43 Russian athletes, stripping thirteen medals and knocking Russia from the top of the medal table, thus putting Norway in the lead. However, nine medals were later returned, meaning that Russia reclaimed first place in the overall medal table, and joint first place with Norway in terms of gold medals.

On 6 July 2011, Pyeongchang, South Korea, was selected to host the 2018 Winter Olympics over Munich, Germany, and Annecy, France. This was the first time that South Korea had been selected to host a Winter Olympics and it was the second time the Olympics were held in the country overall, after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. The Games took place from 9 to 25 February 2018. More than 2,900 athletes from 92 countries participated in 102 events. The main venue cluster was the Alpensia Resort in Daegwallyeong-myeon, while the ice events are held at Gangneung Olympic Park in Pyeongchang&#x27;s neighbouring sea-city of Gangneung.

The lead-up to the 2018 Winter Olympics was affected by the tensions between North and South Korea and the ongoing Russian doping scandal. Despite tense relations, North Korea agreed to participate in the Games, enter with South Korea during the opening ceremony as a unified Korea, and field a unified team in women&#x27;s ice hockey. Russian athletes, who complied with the IOC&#x27;s doping regulations, were given the option to compete in Pyeongchang as &quot;Olympic Athletes from Russia&quot; (OAR).

The Games saw the addition of big air snowboarding, mass start speed skating, mixed doubles curling, and mixed team alpine skiing to the programme. Like four years early, the Netherlands again dominated speed skating, winning gold medals in seven of the ten individual events. Dutch speed skater Sven Kramer won gold in the men&#x27;s 5000m event, becoming the only male speed skater to win the same Olympic event three times. On the snow, Norway led the medal tally in cross-country skiing, with Marit Bjørgen winning bronze in the women&#x27;s team sprint and gold in the 30-kilometre classical event, bringing her total Olympic medal haul to fifteen, the most won by any athlete (male or female) in Winter Olympics history.

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo of Norway became the youngest ever male to win an Olympic gold in cross-country skiing when he won the men&#x27;s sprint at age 21. Noriaki Kasai of Japan became the first athlete in history to participate in eight Winter Olympics when he took part in the ski jumping qualification the day before the opening of the Games. Ester Ledecká of the Czech Republic won gold in the skiing super-G event and another gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom, making her the first female athlete to win Olympic gold medals in two sports at a single Winter Games.

Norway led the total medal standings with 39, the highest number of medals by a nation in any Winter Olympics, followed by Germany&#x27;s 31 and Canada&#x27;s 29. Host nation South Korea won seventeen medals, five of them gold, its highest medal haul at a Winter Olympics.

Beijing, the capital of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, was elected as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics on 31 July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session. Beijing became the first city ever to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Like the Summer Olympics held six months earlier in Tokyo, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of strict health and safety protocols, including restrictions on public attendance at the Games. The Games included a record 109 events over 15 disciplines in seven sports with seven new medal events, including mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross. The Games were held between 4 and 20 February 2022 at venues in Beijing and Zhangjiakou which for the first time were run entirely on renewable energy. Several of the events were impacted by temperatures as low as minus 20 Celsius and strong wind.

The first gold medal of the Games was won by Therese Johaug of Norway in the women&#x27;s skiathlon. Johaug had been excluded from the 2018 Winter Olympics in a controversial decision after having used a banned cream for sunburned lips. She went on to also win the women&#x27;s 10 km and 30 km cross-country distances. In the women&#x27;s snowboard cross, Lindsey Jacobellis of the United States won the gold, having lost the gold 16 years earlier at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino due to a brutal fall. On the ice, the Netherlands dominated with a total of six gold medals and Irene Schouten winning the women&#x27;s mass start, 3,000m and 5,000m distances. Nils van der Poel of Sweden won the men&#x27;s 5,000m and 10,000m distances, setting new Olympic records in both distances. Kamila Valieva of Russia was allowed to compete in the women&#x27;s figure skating despite a failed doping test in December 2021. She failed, however, to win an individual medal after falling in her final routine. Russia&#x27;s team gold medal remained in limbo for two years, pending investigation into Valieva&#x27;s positive drug test, before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) disqualified Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021, leading the ISU to re-allocate the medals, upgrading the United States to gold and Japan to silver while downgrading the ROC to bronze. Finland claimed its first ice hockey gold, having beaten the Russian Olympic Committee in the men&#x27;s final on the last day of the Games.

Norway was first in the overall medal standings, claiming 37 medals in total and 16 gold medals, the highest number of gold medals of any country in a single Winter Olympics. This was the ninth time Norway claimed the highest number of gold medals at the Winter Games.

===Future===

The 2026 Winter Olympics will be held in Milan-Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, and take place between 6 and 22 February 2026. At the 142nd IOC Session in July 2024, it was confirmed that the 2030 Winter Olympics will be hosted by France in the French Alps. The 2034 Winter Olympics was also awarded simultaneously to be hosted by the United States in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the Olympics were held previously in 2002.

==Problems and politics==
===Controversy===
The process for awarding host city honours came under intense scrutiny after Salt Lake City had been awarded the right to host the 2002 Games. Soon after the host city had been announced it was discovered that the organisers had engaged in an elaborate bribery scheme to curry favour with IOC officials. Gifts and other financial considerations were given to those who would evaluate and vote on Salt Lake City&#x27;s bid. These gifts included medical treatment for relatives, a college scholarship for one member&#x27;s son and a land deal in Utah. Even IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch received two rifles valued at $2,000. Samaranch defended the gift as inconsequential since, as president, he was a non-voting member.

The subsequent investigation uncovered inconsistencies in the bids for every Olympics (both Summer and Winter) since 1988. For example, the gifts received by IOC members from the Japanese Organising Committee for Nagano&#x27;s bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics were described by the investigation committee as &quot;astronomical&quot;. Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, the IOC feared that corporate sponsors would lose faith in the integrity of the process and that the Olympic brand would be tarnished to such an extent that advertisers would begin to pull their support.

The investigation resulted in the expulsion of 10 IOC members and the sanctioning of another 10. New terms and age limits were established for IOC membership, and 15 former Olympic athletes were added to the committee. Stricter rules for future bids were imposed, with ceilings imposed on the value of gifts IOC members could accept from bid cities.

===Host city legacy===
According to the IOC, the host city for the Winter Olympics is responsible for &quot;...establishing functions and services for all aspects of the Games, such as sports planning, venues, finance, technology, accommodation, catering, media services, etc., as well as operations during the Games&quot;. Due to the cost of hosting the Games, most host cities never realise a profit on their investment. For example, the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, cost $3.6 billion to host. By comparison, the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, cost $12.5 billion. The organisers of the Nagano Games claimed that the cost of extending the bullet train service from Tokyo to Nagano was responsible for the large price tag.

The organising committee had hoped that the exposure gained from hosting the Winter Olympics, and the improved access to Nagano from Tokyo, would benefit the local economy for years afterwards. In fact, Nagano&#x27;s economy did experience a post-Olympic boom for a year or two, but the long-term effects have not materialised as anticipated. The likelihood of heavy debt is a deterrent to prospective host cities, as well as the prospect of unused sports venues and infrastructure saddling the local community with upkeep costs with no appreciable post-Olympic value.

The Winter Olympics has the added problem of the alpine events requiring a mountain location; the men&#x27;s downhill needs an 800-metre altitude difference along a suitable course. As this is a focal event that is central to the Games, the IOC has previously not agreed to it taking place a long way from the main host city, in contrast to the Summer Games, where sailing and horse sports have taken place more than away. The requirement for a mountain location also means that venues such as hockey arenas often have to be built in sparsely populated areas with little future need for a large arena and for the hotels and infrastructure needed for all Olympic visitors. Due to cost issues, fewer and fewer cities are willing to host. Both the Torino 2006 and Vancouver 2010 Games, which were hosted in countries where large cities are located close to suitable mountain regions, had lower costs since more venues, hotels and transport infrastructure already existed. In contrast, the Sochi 2014 games had large costs as most installations had to be built.

The IOC has tried to mitigate these concerns. Firstly, it has agreed to fund part of the host city&#x27;s budget. Secondly, the qualifying host countries are limited to those that have the resources and infrastructure to successfully host an Olympic Games without negatively impacting their region or nation; this rules out a large portion of the developing world. Finally, any prospective host city is required to add a &quot;legacy plan&quot; to their proposal, with a view to the long-term economic and environmental impact that hosting the Olympics will have.

Beginning with the 2022 Winter Games, the IOC is allowing a longer distance between the alpine events and other events. The Oslo bid had to the Kvitfjell downhill arena, while eventual host Beijing had venues 220 km away from the city as well. For the 2026 Winter Games, Stockholm&#x27;s unsuccessful bid proposed to hold the alpine event in Åre, away by road.

===Doping===
In 1967 the IOC began enacting drug testing protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but his team was still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time was a lack of standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of the tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.

The 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin became notable for a scandal involving the emerging trend of blood doping, the use of blood transfusions or synthetic hormones such as Erythropoietin (EPO) to improve oxygen flow and thus reduce fatigue. The Italian police conducted a raid on the Austrian cross-country ski team&#x27;s residence during the Games where they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment. This event followed the pre-Olympics suspension of 12 cross-country skiers who tested positive for unusually high levels of haemoglobin, which is evidence of blood doping.

The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi&#x27;s Russian Doping Scandal has resulted in the International Olympic Committee to begin disciplinary proceedings against 28 (later increased to 46) Russian athletes who competed at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, acting on evidence that their urine samples were tampered with.

===Cold War===
The Winter Olympics were an ideological front in the Cold War since the Soviet Union first participated at the 1956 Winter Games. It did not take long for the Cold War combatants to discover what a powerful propaganda tool the Olympic Games could be. The advent of the state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateur athlete&quot; of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism until the &#x27;90s.

The Cold War created tensions amongst countries allied to the two superpowers. The strained relationship between East and West Germany created a difficult political situation for the IOC. Because of its role in World War II, Germany was not allowed to compete at the 1948 Winter Olympics. In 1950, the IOC recognised the West German Olympic Committee, and invited East and West Germany to compete as a unified team at the 1952 Winter Games. East Germany declined and instead sought international legitimacy separate from West Germany.

In 1955, the Soviet Union recognised East Germany as a sovereign state, thereby giving more credibility to East Germany&#x27;s campaign to become an independent participant. The IOC agreed provisionally to accept the East German National Olympic Committee on condition that East and West Germans compete as one team. The situation became tense when the Berlin Wall was constructed by East Germany in 1961 to stop migration of its citizens and Western European nations began refusing visas to East German athletes. The uneasy compromise of a unified team held until the 1968 Grenoble Games when the IOC split the teams and threatened to reject host-city bids from any country that refused entry visas to East German athletes.

===Boycott===
The Winter Games have had only one national team boycott when Taiwan decided not to participate in the 1980 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid. Prior to the Games, the IOC agreed to allow China to compete in the Olympics for the first time since 1952. China was given permission to compete as the &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (PRC) and to use the PRC flag and anthem. Until 1980 the island of Taiwan had been competing under the name &quot;Republic of China&quot; (ROC) and had been using the ROC flag and anthem. The IOC attempted to have the countries compete together but when this proved to be unacceptable the IOC demanded that Taiwan cease to call itself the &quot;Republic of China&quot;.

The IOC renamed the island &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; and demanded that it adopt a different flag and national anthem, stipulations to which Taiwan would not agree. Despite numerous appeals and court hearings, the IOC&#x27;s decision stood. When the Taiwanese athletes arrived at the Olympic village with their Republic of China identification cards they were not admitted. They subsequently left the Olympics in protest, just before the opening ceremonies. Taiwan returned to Olympic competition at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo as Chinese Taipei. The country agreed to compete under a flag bearing the emblem of their National Olympic Committee and to play the anthem of their National Olympic Committee should one of their athletes win a gold medal. The agreement remains in place to this day.

==Sports==
The Olympic Charter limits winter sports to &quot;those sports which are practised on snow or ice&quot;. Since 1992 a number of new sports have been added to the Olympic programme, which include short-track speed skating, snowboarding, freestyle and moguls skiing. The addition of these events has broadened the appeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America. While European powers such as Norway and Germany still dominate the traditional Winter Olympic sports, countries such as South Korea, Australia and Canada are finding success in these new sports. The results are more parity in the national medal tables, more interest in the Winter Olympics, and higher global television ratings.

===Current sports===

===Demonstration events===
Demonstration sports have historically provided a venue for host countries to attract publicity to locally popular sports by having a competition without granting medals. Demonstration sports were discontinued after 1992. Military patrol, a precursor to the biathlon, was a medal sport in 1924 and was demonstrated in 1928, 1936 and 1948, becoming an official sport in 1960. The special figures figure skating event was only contested at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Bandy (Russian hockey) is a sport popular in the Nordic countries and Russia. In the latter it is considered a national sport. It was demonstrated at the Oslo Games.

Ice stock sport, a German variant of curling, was demonstrated in 1936 in Germany and 1964 in Austria. The ski ballet event, later known as ski-acro, was demonstrated in 1988 and 1992. Skijöring, skiing behind dogs, was a demonstration sport in St. Moritz in 1928. A sled-dog race was held at Lake Placid in 1932. Speed skiing was demonstrated in Albertville at the 1992 Winter Olympics. Winter pentathlon, a variant of the modern pentathlon, was included as a demonstration event at the 1948 Games in Switzerland. It included cross-country skiing, shooting, downhill skiing, fencing, and horse riding.

<doc id="34071" wikidata="Q34389" url="?curid=34071" title="Whitney Houston">
<text>Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American singer, actress, film producer, and philanthropist. Commonly referred to as &quot;the Voice&quot;, she is one of the most awarded performers of all time. Her crossover appeal and achievements on the popular music charts influenced the breaking down of gender and racial barriers in popular culture. Known for her vocal delivery and live performances, Houston was ranked second on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the greatest singers of all time in 2023.

Houston signed to Arista Records at the age of 19. Her first two studio albums, &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; (1985) and &quot;Whitney&quot; (1987), topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 14 and 11 weeks, respectively. She took a more urban turn with her third studio album, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot; (1990), and performed an acclaimed rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Super Bowl XXV in 1991. The soundtrack of her film debut &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (1992) won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 20 weeks, and remains the best-selling soundtrack album of all time. Its lead single, &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and became the best-selling female single in history. Houston continued her work in the film industry, including starring roles in &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; (1995), &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1996) and &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1997). The soundtrack of &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; became the best-selling gospel album of all time.

Houston&#x27;s first studio album in eight years, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; (1998), found critical and commercial success, and she renewed her contract with Arista Records for $100 million in 2001, one of the largest recording deals of all time. However, her next album, &quot;Just Whitney&quot; (2002), received mixed reviews, while her drug use and a tumultuous marriage to singer Bobby Brown began to overshadow her music career. After divorcing Brown, Houston returned to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with her final album, &quot;I Look to You&quot; (2009). On February 11, 2012, Houston accidentally drowned in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, California, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors. News of her death coincided with the 2012 Grammy Awards and was covered internationally along with her memorial service.

Houston is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales of more than 220 million records worldwide. Her first two albums, along with &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack, rank among the best-selling albums of all time and made her the only black artist to score three RIAA diamond-certified albums. &quot;Whitney&quot; (1987) was the first album by a female artist to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; are among the best-selling singles ever, with the latter being certified diamond by RIAA. Houston scored 11 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles and remains the only artist to have seven consecutive singles top the chart. She has been inducted into multiple halls and walks of fame. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; named her the highest-earning posthumous female celebrity. Her assets amounted to $250 million, earned over a 25-year career.

==Early life and family ==

Whitney Elizabeth Houston was born on August 9, 1963, at Presbyterian Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, to Emily &quot;Cissy&quot; (née Drinkard) and John Russell Houston Jr. Cissy was a Grammy-winning gospel and soul singer who was a member of The Drinkard Singers and the founder of The Sweet Inspirations before becoming a solo artist. John was a former Army serviceman who later became an administrator under the Newark mayor. Houston was given the nickname &quot;Nippy&quot; by her father.

Houston&#x27;s parents are both African-American. Cissy Houston stated that she has partial Dutch and Native American ancestry. Houston was a cousin of singers Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick as well as a distant cousin of opera singer Leontyne Price. Aretha Franklin became an &quot;honorary aunt&quot; while Darlene Love was Houston&#x27;s godmother. Houston&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather Jeremiah Burke Sanderson was an American abolitionist and advocate for the civil and educational rights of black Americans during the mid-19th century. Houston had three older brothers: paternal half-brother John III; maternal half-brother Gary, a basketball player and singer; and Michael.

The Houston family relocated to a suburban area of East Orange three years following the Newark race riots of 1967. Houston&#x27;s parents later divorced.

Houston was raised in the Baptist faith. She joined the church choir at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark at the age of five, and she also learned to play piano at New Hope. She later recalled being exposed to the Pentecostal church nearby as well. Houston made her solo performance debut at New Hope singing the hymn &quot;Guide Me O Thou Great Jehovah&quot; at the age of 12. When Houston became a teenager, she told her mother that she wanted to pursue a career in music. Throughout her teenage years, she would be taught how to sing by Cissy. Along with her mother, her cousins and Franklin, Houston was influenced by singers such as Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, and Roberta Flack.

Houston attended Franklin Elementary School (now Whitney E. Houston Academy of Creative and Performing Arts) before transferring to Mount Saint Dominic Academy, a Catholic girls&#x27; high school in Caldwell, New Jersey, by sixth grade. She graduated from Mount Saint Dominic in 1981.

==Career==
=== 1977–1984: Career beginnings ===
Houston&#x27;s professional career began when she joined her mother&#x27;s band as a background singer at fourteen while Cissy performed at Manhattan cabaret clubs. Houston gave her first solo during Cissy&#x27;s performance at Manhattan&#x27;s Town Hall in February 1978, performing &quot;Tomorrow&quot; from the Broadway musical, &quot;Annie&quot;, where she received her first standing ovation. Houston began a career as a session vocalist backing up artists like her mother, Michael Zager, Chaka Khan and Lou Rawls. Houston was the featured vocalist in Zager&#x27;s disco song &quot;Life&#x27;s a Party&quot; (1978). Houston became a fashion model in 1980 and a year later, became one of the first black models to appear on the cover of a fashion magazine landing a cover of &quot;Seventeen&quot;. With her looks and girl-next-door charm, Houston became one of the most sought-after teen models in the country, later appearing in fashion spreads for &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Young Miss&quot;. Houston continued her music career during this period, recording demos of gospel recordings with producer Steven Abdul Khan Brown. Houston&#x27;s vocal talent made her sought after for recording deals, but were turned down by her mother, who insisted that Houston finish high school.

In September 1981, following the advice of her cousin Dionne Warwick, Houston signed with Tara Productions and hired Gene Harvey as her manager. Daniel Gittelman and Seymour Flics would also be part of the team to work closely with Houston. In 1982, Houston was featured as the lead vocalist on the song &quot;Memories&quot; by the band Material on their album &quot;One Down&quot;. In his &quot;Village Voice&quot; review of &quot;One Down&quot;, Robert Christgau called the song &quot;one of the most gorgeous ballads you&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. In early 1983, Houston was the featured lead vocalist on the song &quot;Eternal Love&quot;, co-written by Paul Jabara and featured on his album &quot;Paul Jabara &amp; Friends&quot;. After auditions with CBS and Elektra Records, Houston would be discovered by Gerry Griffith, then the A&amp;R representative for Arista Records, while Houston performed with her mother at the Seventh Avenue South nightclub in Manhattan. Griffith convinced Arista head Clive Davis to make time to see her perform at another nightclub called Sweetwaters the following week. Davis was impressed and immediately offered a worldwide record deal, which Houston eventually signed on April 10, 1983. Houston was introduced to a national audience in June 1983, performing the song &quot;Home&quot; from the Broadway musical &quot;The Wiz&quot; on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;.

Houston did not begin work on an album immediately. The label wanted to make sure no other label signed her away and Davis wanted to ensure he had the right material and producers for her debut album. Some producers passed on the project because of prior commitments. After seeing her perform in New York, Michael Masser offered to pair Houston with Teddy Pendergrass, on the duet, &quot;Hold Me&quot;, which appeared on his album, &quot;Love Language&quot;. Released in May 1984, the song gave Houston her first taste of success, becoming a top-10 hit on the R&amp;B and adult contemporary charts. Houston also received notice in 1984 after being paired up with Jermaine Jackson, with whom the duet, &quot;Take Good Care of My Heart&quot;, was featured on Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dynamite&quot; album, while also appearing with Jackson performing the song and another duet, &quot;Nobody Loves Me Like You Do&quot;, on an episode of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. All three songs eventually appeared on her debut album. During this period, Houston continued to model, appeared in a commercial for the Canada Dry soft drink, and also began singing commercial jingles, including one for the restaurant brand, Steak &amp; Ale.

=== 1985–86: &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; and rise to international prominence ===
After more than a year of sessions, &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; was released on Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14, 1985. After debuting at number 166 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for the week of March 30, 1985, the album would hit the top 10 of the chart in its 23rd week. On its 50th week, it reached number one in March 1986, starting a 14-week run, which remains the longest run for a female debut album in history. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in seven other countries and reached the top five in seven others. Critics praised Houston and the album, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling her &quot;one of the most exciting new voices in years&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the album &quot;an impressive, musically conservative showcase for an exceptional vocal talent&quot;.

The album&#x27;s leading single, &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;, produced by Kashif, became Houston&#x27;s first top-10 single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in July. The song generated some controversy after advice columnist Ann Landers included it in her list of songs she deemed &quot;trashy music&quot;. Houston later defended the song during an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Later, in October, Houston scored her first number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;. When &quot;How Will I Know&quot; and &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot; hit number one on the same chart, Houston set a record by being the first female artist to produce three number one singles off a single album. Eventually, the album would be certified Diamond in the United States for sales of 14 million copies, and sell over 25 million worldwide becoming the best-selling debut album in music history and remains the best-selling debut album in history by a female artist. The album is listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the best-selling R&amp;B studio album by a female artist in history. The album also produced the international hit, &quot;All at Once&quot;, which hit the top five in several European countries and went gold in Japan.

Houston would win her first Grammy Award at the 1986 ceremony for the ballad, &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;, which won the Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, to which she had performed in the program to a stunning reception that later resulted in her winning an Emmy Award that September. Houston&#x27;s album was also nominated for Album of the Year, losing out to Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;. Houston failed to receive a nomination for Best New Artist, prompting Clive Davis to write an angry open letter to the Recording Academy, who defended the decision citing Houston&#x27;s 1984 hit with Teddy Pendergrass. Houston also won two American Music Awards, including Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Song for &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;, as well as the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding New Artist. Houston eventually received five more American Music Awards at the 1987 ceremony, including American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist. Houston won 14 &quot;Billboard&quot; Number One awards in 1985 and 1986, winning Top Pop Artist in the latter year, with the album earning Top Pop Album honors, the first album by a female artist to receive that distinction.

The initial success of the album was attributed to Houston&#x27;s appearances in late-night talk shows as well as music videos; both formats were not usually available to emerging black acts. During the album&#x27;s early promotional run, Houston and her label struggled to submit the music video to &quot;You Give Good Love&quot; for MTV. At that time, the channel received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by artists of color while favoring predominantly white acts. Years later, Houston explained in an interview with the channel how the video was rejected because it was a &quot;very kind of R&amp;B song&quot;. However, the music video to &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot; eventually got airplay due to the song &quot;hit(ting) so hard and explod(ing) so heavy&quot; that the channel &quot;had no choice but to play it&quot;, according to Houston. In December 1985, the video to &quot;How Will I Know&quot; was submitted and accepted by MTV brass and sent the video to heavy rotation almost immediately after it debuted that month, then a rare occurrence for a black female artist. Following opening spots on tours by Jeffrey Osborne and Luther Vandross, Houston opened at Carnegie Hall in October 1985. In July 1986, she embarked on her first world tour, &quot;The Greatest Love World Tour&quot;, performing a total of 53 dates.

Houston&#x27;s debut album is listed as one of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s Definitive 200 list. Houston&#x27;s grand entrance into the music industry is considered one of the 25 musical milestones of the last 25 years, according to &quot;USA Today&quot;.

=== 1987–89: &quot;Whitney&quot; ===

In June 1987, Houston&#x27;s second album, &quot;Whitney&quot;, was released. Critics complained that the material was too similar to her previous album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;the narrow channel through which this talent has been directed is frustrating&quot;. The album nonetheless enjoyed commercial success. Houston became the first woman in music history to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Houston was also the first artist ever to enter number one in the US and UK simultaneously, while also reaching number one in every country it charted. The album stayed at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for its first eleven weeks, a record for an R&amp;B female artist and only one of five albums to spend their first 10 weeks or more at number one on the chart. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;, was also a massive hit worldwide, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the singles chart in 17 countries, including Australia, West Germany and the UK. Houston made more history when three more singles from the album - &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Have It All&quot;, &quot;So Emotional&quot; and &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot; – also reached number one on the same chart within a six-month stretch, making Houston the first female artist to earn four number one singles on a single album, besting her previous record of three from her debut. Along with the aforementioned three number ones, Houston again made history as the first artist to score seven consecutive number one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, beating the previous record of six, held by the Beatles and Bee Gees. Houston remains the only artist to ever accomplish this feat as of 2025. A fifth single, &quot;Love Will Save the Day&quot;, reached number nine on the Hot 100, making Houston one of several artists to record more than five top-10 singles off a single album. &quot;Whitney&quot; has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, with 10 million copies sold in the United States alone, where it has been certified Diamond.

Houston earned several accolades from the album, including the Grammy Award nomination for Album of the Year, winning her second Grammy for &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot; in the female pop vocal performance category. 
Additional accolades include four American Music Awards, six &quot;Billboard&quot; awards and a Soul Train Music Award. Houston launched her second world tour, the &quot;Moment of Truth World Tour&quot;, in July 1987. The North American leg of the tour grossed more than $20 million, becoming the highest-grossing female tour of the year and one of the top 10 North American tours of 1987. Houston eventually toured 150 dates, including eight sold-out dates at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena. The singer&#x27;s unprecedented successes helped her to earn notices on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. In 1987, she was ranked the eighth highest-ranking entertainer of the year on its &quot;Forbes&quot; 40 list, earning $43 million in that year alone. The highest-earning musician and highest black female entertainer on the list, she was only the third highest after Bill Cosby and Eddie Murphy. In 1988, she ranked 17th.

During this period, Houston showed support to Nelson Mandela and the anti-apartheid movement, participating in the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium on June 11, 1988, which was watched by more than half a billion viewers and raised $1 million in charities, while also bringing awareness to apartheid. Houston had refused to work with agencies who did business with South Africa during her modeling years in the early-80s. In August of the year, Houston headlined Madison Square Garden for a United Negro College Fund benefit concert to raise money to fund historically black colleges and universities, raising a quarter of a million dollars. That same year, Houston recorded a song for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics, &quot;One Moment in Time&quot;, which became a top five hit in the US, while reaching number one in the UK, Germany and Europe and later won Houston a Grammy nomination and a Sports Emmy, alongside producer Narada Michael Walden. In January 1989, Houston formed The Whitney Houston Foundation For Children, a nonprofit organization that has raised funds for the needs of children around the world. The organization cares for homelessness, children with cancer or AIDS and other issues of self-empowerment. The organization now functions under the name, the Whitney E. Houston Legacy Foundation.

=== 1990–91: &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot; and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; ===

With the success of her first two albums, Houston became an international crossover superstar, appealing to all demographics. However, some black critics believed she was &quot;selling out&quot;. They felt her singing on record lacked the soul that was present during her live concerts. At the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards, when Houston&#x27;s name was called out for a nomination, a few in the audience jeered. Houston defended herself against the criticism, stating, &quot;If you&#x27;re gonna have a long career, there&#x27;s a certain way to do it and I did it that way. I&#x27;m not ashamed of it.&quot; Houston took a more urban direction with her third studio album, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot;, released in November 1990. The first album in which she served as executive producer and exerted creative control for the first time in her career, Houston chose mostly black producers such as the team of L.A. Reid and Babyface, as well as Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder, while maintaining Narada Michael Walden as one of the main producers. The album showed Houston&#x27;s versatility on a new batch of tough rhythmic grooves, soulful ballads and uptempo dance tracks. Reviews were mixed to positive. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt it was her &quot;best and most integrated album&quot;, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, at the time thought Houston&#x27;s shift towards an urban direction was &quot;superficial&quot;.

The album reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, staying inside the top 10 for 22 weeks, becoming the tenth best-selling album of 1991, while topping the Top R&amp;B Albums chart, staying there for eight consecutive weeks, becoming the best-selling R&amp;B album of 1991. Houston set another chart record when the first two singles from the album, the title track and &quot;All the Man That I Need&quot;, each topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making Houston the first solo female artist to produce multiple number one singles from three albums. The album included another top-10 pop hit, &quot;Miracle&quot;, and the top 20 hit, &quot;My Name Is Not Susan&quot;, which produced one of the first remixes of a pop song to feature a rapper, as female rapper Monie Love, participated. The album became her third consecutive multi-platinum album, going four-times platinum in the US, while selling 10 million copies worldwide. Houston earned Grammy Award nominations for three songs from the album as well as four American Music Award nominations, while winning eight &quot;Billboard&quot; awards, including four Billboard Music Awards, such as Top R&amp;B Artist and Top R&amp;B Album. A bonus track from the album&#x27;s Japanese edition, &quot;Higher Love&quot;, was remixed by Norwegian DJ and record producer Kygo and released posthumously in 2019 to commercial success. It topped the US Dance Club Songs chart and reached number two in the UK, becoming Houston&#x27;s highest-charting single in the country since 1999.
During the Persian Gulf War, on January 27, 1991, Houston performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the US national anthem, at Super Bowl XXV at Tampa Stadium. Houston&#x27;s vocals were pre-recorded, prompting criticism. Dan Klores, a spokesman for Houston, said: &quot;This is not a Milli Vanilli thing. She sang live, but the microphone was turned off. It was a technical decision, partially based on the noise factor. This is standard procedure at these events.&quot; Nevertheless, a commercial single and video of the performance reached the Top 20 on the US Hot 100, giving Houston the biggest chart hit for a performance of the national anthem.

Houston donated her share of the proceeds to the American Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund and was named to the Red Cross Board of Governors. Her rendition was critically acclaimed and is considered the benchmark for singers; VH1 listed the performance as one of the greatest moments that rocked TV. Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the single was rereleased, with all profits going towards the firefighters and victims of the attacks. It reached number 6 in the Hot 100 and was certified platinum. The song&#x27;s re-charting made Houston the first woman in history to chart the same song inside the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. Later in 1991, Houston put together her &quot;Welcome Home Heroes&quot; concert with HBO for the soldiers fighting in the Persian Gulf War and their families. The free concert took place at Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia in front of 3,500 servicemen and women. HBO descrambled the concert so that it was free for everyone to watch. The show gave HBO its highest ratings ever. Houston then embarked on her third world tour, the &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight World Tour&quot;, which Houston would give 96 shows, including a historic 10- date sold-out residency at Wembley Arena in London. The concert tour produced mixed to positive reviews. While &quot;The Sun Sentinel&quot; argued that Houston should&#x27;ve opted for smaller venues and theaters that were &quot;far more suitable to her sophistication and talent&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot; praised Houston for &quot;shak[ing] the confinements of her recordings&#x27; calculated productions and gets downright gutsy and soulful&quot;.

=== 1992–94: &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; ===
With the success of her music, Houston received offers of film work, including work with Robert De Niro, Quincy Jones and Spike Lee, but she did not feel the time was right. Her first film role was in &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, released in 1992. Houston played a star who is being stalked by a crazed fan and hires a bodyguard (played by Kevin Costner) to protect her. Houston&#x27;s mainstream appeal allowed audiences to look past the interracial nature of her character&#x27;s relationship with Costner&#x27;s character. However, controversy arose as some felt Houston&#x27;s face had been intentionally left out of the advertising to hide the film&#x27;s interracial relationship. In a 1993 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Houston said that &quot;people know who Whitney Houston is – I&#x27;m black. You can&#x27;t hide that fact.&quot;

The film received mixed reviews. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley wrote that Houston was merely &quot;playing herself&quot;, but came out &quot;largely unscathed if that is possible in so cockamamie an undertaking&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that Houston lacked chemistry with Costner. Houston was nominated for a Razzie Award but also received favorable acting nods, including a nomination for Outstanding Actress at the NAACP Image Awards, four acting nods at the 1993 MTV Movie Awards and a People&#x27;s Choice Award nod for Favorite Actress in a Dramatic Motion Picture. Upon its release, &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; grossed more than $121 million in the U.S. and $410 million worldwide, making it one of the top 100 highest-grossing films in history at its time of release. It remains in the top 50 of most successful R-rated films in box-office history.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack also enjoyed success. Houston executive produced the soundtrack along with Davis and recorded six songs for the album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;nothing more than pleasant, tasteful and urbane&quot;. The soundtrack&#x27;s lead single was &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, written and originally recorded by Dolly Parton in 1974. Houston&#x27;s version was highly acclaimed by critics, regarding it as her &quot;signature song&quot; or &quot;iconic performance&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; called her rendition a . The single reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot R&amp;B Singles charts for 14 and 11 weeks respectively, record-setting numbers at the time, while also topping the Adult Contemporary chart for five weeks, resulting in her fourth record-setting &quot;triple-crown&quot; number one single. The single was later certified diamond by the RIAA for sales of 10 million copies, becoming Houston&#x27;s first diamond single. Houston is only one of just four female artists to earn both a diamond single and album along with Taylor Swift, Mariah Carey and Katy Perry and was only the third in history to do so. In January 1993, the song became the first single by a solo artist in US history to sell four million copies, later being certified 4× platinum by the RIAA and becoming the best-selling single in US history, a feat later surpassed by Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Candle in the Wind &#x27;97&quot;. It remains the bestselling US physical single in history by a female recording artist.

The song was a global success, topping the charts in almost all countries. With 24 million copies sold, it became the best-selling single ever by a female solo artist. Houston won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1994 for &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. In addition, it won a second Grammy in the best female pop vocal category, two American Music Awards, two Soul Train Music Awards, and an MTV Movie Award. The soundtrack topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and remained there for 20 weeks, a first for a female album. It remains the second longest cumulative number-one album by a female artist on the chart after singer Adele&#x27;s &quot;21&quot;. The soundtrack became one of the fastest-selling albums in history. During Christmas week of 1992, it sold more than a million copies within a week, becoming the first album in music history to achieve that feat under the Nielsen SoundScan system.

Houston released four more singles from the soundtrack. Two of which, &quot;I&#x27;m Every Woman&quot; and &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;, both reaching the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. On the week of March 13, 1993, Houston became the first solo artist in history to ever have three singles in the top 11 on the Hot 100 simultaneously and the first artist in general to do so since the beginning of SoundScan. Both &quot;I&#x27;m Every Woman&quot; and &quot;I Have Nothing&quot; hit number one in other &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, with the former topping the Dance Club Songs chart, and the latter becoming Houston&#x27;s tenth number one song on the adult contemporary chart; in addition, the two songs alongside &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; all hit number one on the Cashbox pop singles chart. &quot;Run to You&quot; was a top-40 US and top-20 UK hit, while &quot;Queen of the Night&quot; reached the top 40 in several international charts and a remixed version topped the US dance chart, giving Houston her first number one as a songwriter. On November 3, 1993, Houston made history again when &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; became the first album by a female artist to be certified 10 times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, which also made it the first album by a female artist to be certified Diamond. It has since gone on to sell more than 18 million copies alone in the United States, with total sales reaching 45 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female artist ever and also the best-selling soundtrack album in history, earning Houston several Guinness World Records.

Houston won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of the Year for the soundtrack, making her just the second black female artist to win in the category after Natalie Cole won it in 1992 for her album, &quot;Unforgettable... with Love&quot;. Houston won a record eight American Music Awards, with the album winning in the pop, R&amp;B and adult contemporary album categories, the only album in its history to do so. Houston also received its highest honor, the Award of Merit, becoming at 30, the youngest female recipient. In addition, the album won Houston a record 15 &quot;Billboard&quot; awards, including 11 at the actual ceremony, three Soul Train Music Awards, including the Sammy Davis Jr. Award as Entertainer of the Year, five NAACP Image Awards including Entertainer of the Year, a record five World Music Awards, a Juno Award and a BRIT award. Houston was a cover story for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, appearing on the June 10, 1993, issue.
Following the success of &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, Houston embarked on another expansive global tour (&quot;The Bodyguard World Tour&quot;) in 1993–94. Her concerts, movie and recording grosses made her the third highest-earning female entertainer of 1993–94, just behind Oprah Winfrey and Barbra Streisand according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. Houston placed in the top five of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s annual &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot; ranking and was labeled by &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine as one of the 100 most powerful people in Hollywood.

In October 1994, Houston attended and performed at a state dinner in the White House honoring newly elected South African president Nelson Mandela. At the end of her world tour, Houston performed three concerts in South Africa to honor President Mandela, playing to more than 200,000 people; this made her the first major musician to visit the newly unified and apartheid free nation following Mandela&#x27;s winning election. Portions of were broadcast live on HBO with funds of the concerts being donated to various charities in South Africa. The event was considered the nation&#x27;s &quot;biggest media event since the inauguration of Nelson Mandela&quot;. After two performances in Brunei and Singapore in April 1995, Houston&#x27;s children&#x27;s charity organization was awarded a VH1 Honor for all the charitable work that June.

=== 1995–97: &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot; ===
In 1995, Houston starred alongside Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon in her second film, &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, a motion picture about four African-American women struggling with relationships. Houston played the lead character Savannah Jackson, a TV producer in love with a married man. She chose the role because she saw the film as &quot;a breakthrough for the image of black women because it presents them both as professionals and as caring mothers&quot;. After opening at number one and grossing $67 million in the US at the box office and $81 million worldwide, it proved that a movie primarily targeting a black audience could cross over to success, while paving the way for other all-black movies such as &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot; and the Tyler Perry movies that became popular in the 2000s. The film is also notable for its portrayal of black women as strong middle class citizens rather than as stereotypes. The reviews were mainly positive for the ensemble cast. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;Ms. Houston has shed the defensive hauteur that made her portrayal of a pop star in &#x27;The Bodyguard&#x27; seem so distant.&quot; Houston was nominated for a second acting NAACP Image Awards nod for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture for her role in the film, but lost to her co-star Bassett. In 1995, Houston hosted the 8th Annual Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards.

The film&#x27;s accompanying soundtrack was written and produced by Babyface and was executive produced by Houston and Clive Davis. Though Babyface originally wanted Houston to record the entire album, she declined. Instead, she &quot;wanted it to be an album of women with vocal distinction&quot; and thus gathered several African-American female artists for the soundtrack, to go along with the film&#x27;s message about strong women. Consequently, the album featured a range of contemporary R&amp;B female recording artists along with Houston, such as Mary J. Blige, Brandy, Toni Braxton, Aretha Franklin and Patti LaBelle. Houston&#x27;s &quot;Exhale (Shoop Shoop)&quot; became just the third single in music history to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 after Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; and Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy&quot;. It would be Houston&#x27;s eleventh and final number one single in her lifetime. It also would spend a record 11 consecutive weeks at the number-two spot and eight weeks on top of the R&amp;B charts, her second most successful single on that chart after &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;.

&quot;Count On Me&quot;, a song Houston co-wrote and composed with her brother Michael and Babyface and made into a duet with longtime friend CeCe Winans, hit the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and later won Houston two ASCAP Awards, a BMI Award and two Grammy Award nominations including Best Song Written for Visual Media. A third Houston single, and the last song from the soundtrack to be released, &quot;Why Does It Hurt So Bad&quot;, reached number 26 on the Hot 100. The album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in January 1996 and would later be certified seven-times platinum in the United States, with total worldwide sales reaching 12 million. The soundtrack received strong reviews; as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated: &quot;the album goes down easy, just as you&#x27;d expect from a package framed by Whitney Houston tracks ... the soundtrack waits to exhale, hovering in sensuous suspense&quot; and has since ranked it as one of the 100 Best Movie Soundtracks. Houston would win two American Music Awards at the 1997 ceremony for the soundtrack including Top Soundtrack and for Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist.

In 1996, Houston starred in the holiday comedy &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot;, with Denzel Washington. She plays the gospel-singing wife of a pastor (Courtney B. Vance). It was largely an updated remake of the 1948 film &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;, which starred Loretta Young, David Niven and Cary Grant. Houston earned $10 million for the role, making her one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood at the time and the highest-earning African-American actress in Hollywood. The movie, with its all African-American cast, was a moderate success, earning about $50 million at the U.S. box offices. The movie gave Houston the strongest reviews of her acting career. &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said Houston &quot;is rather angelic herself, displaying a divine talent for being virtuous and flirtatious at the same time&quot; and she &quot;exudes gentle yet spirited warmth, especially when praising the Lord in her gorgeous singing voice&quot;. Houston won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture for her role in the film.

For the film&#x27;s accompanying gospel soundtrack, Houston co-produced nine of the album&#x27;s 15 tracks with Mervyn Warren. Six of the more traditional gospel material was recorded with the Georgia Mass Choir at the Great Star Rising Baptist Church in Atlanta. Houston also recorded a duet with Shirley Caesar and the soundtrack also featured her mother Cissy Houston. Upon its release, it became the first gospel album by a female artist to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Gospel Albums chart. The album sold six million copies worldwide, including three million alone in the United States, becoming the best-selling gospel album ever. The album featured two hit singles, the Grammy-nominated &quot;I Believe in You and Me&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot;. In addition to its commercial success, it was also received positively by critics. The album itself was nominated for the Best R&amp;B Album at the 1998 Grammys. However, Houston snubbed the ceremony due to the album not getting a gospel nomination. That year, Houston received two Dove Awards for the album, including Best Traditional Gospel Recorded Song for &quot;I Go to the Rock&quot;, while also receiving the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Gospel Artist alongside the Georgia Mass Choir.

In 1997, Houston&#x27;s production company changed its name to BrownHouse Productions from Houston Productions and was joined by Debra Martin Chase. Their goal was &quot;to show aspects of the lives of African-Americans that have not been brought to the screen before&quot; while improving how African-Americans are portrayed in film and television. Their first project was a made-for-television remake of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In addition to co-producing, Houston starred in the film as the Fairy Godmother along with Brandy, Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg and Bernadette Peters. Houston was initially offered the role of Cinderella in 1993, but other projects intervened. The film is notable for its multi-racial cast and non-stereotypical message. An estimated 60 million viewers tuned into the special giving ABC its highest TV ratings in 16 years. The movie received seven Emmy nominations including Outstanding Variety, Musical or Comedy, while winning Outstanding Art Direction in a Variety, Musical or Comedy Special.

Houston and Chase then obtained the rights to the story of Dorothy Dandridge. Houston was to play Dandridge, the first African-American actress to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Houston wanted the story told with dignity and honor. However, Halle Berry also had rights to the project and got her version going first. Later that year, Houston paid tribute to her idols, such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross and Dionne Warwick, by performing their hits during the three-night HBO Concert &quot;Classic Whitney: Live from Washington, D.C.&quot; The special raised more than $300,000 for the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. In February 1998, Houston, 34, received the Quincy Jones Award for outstanding career achievements in the field of entertainment at the 12th Soul Train Music Awards.

=== 1998–2000: &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; and &quot;Whitney: The Greatest Hits&quot; ===
By 1998, Houston had not recorded a full-length studio album in eight years. During discussion about a possible greatest hits album with Clive Davis, however, it was agreed that Houston should return to the studio for a brand new album instead. Recorded and mixed in a six-week period - fastest for any Houston recording – Houston released the album, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;, on November 17, 1998. The album featured production from Rodney Jerkins, Wyclef Jean and Missy Elliott. Led by the Academy Award-winning duet, &quot;When You Believe&quot;, with singer Mariah Carey off the &quot;Prince of Egypt&quot; soundtrack in a week full of star-studded releases, the album debuted and peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while later topping the European Top 100 Albums chart for six weeks, starting in August 1999. The album gave Houston some of her strongest reviews ever. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said Houston was singing &quot;with a bite in her voice&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;Whitney&#x27;s sharpest and most satisfying so far&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine noted the album had a &quot;funkier and edgier sound than past releases&quot; and saw Houston &quot;handling urban dance, hip hop, mid-tempo R&amp;B, reggae, torch songs and ballads all with great dexterity&quot;.

The album launched five top 40 singles in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including three top five singles, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Right but It&#x27;s Okay&quot; and &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;. &quot;When You Believe&quot; reached No. 15 on the Hot 100 while the album&#x27;s final single, &quot;I Learned from the Best&quot;, reached No. 27. The album would itself stay on the charts for more than two years and would later be certified four times platinum in the US for sales of four million copies, moving 15 million copies globally altogether. Four of the five singles reached number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart thanks to remixes by the likes of Hex Hector, Junior Vasquez and Thunderpuss. In Europe, the title track became massively successful, topping the Eurochart Hot 100 and selling more than three million copies worldwide. In February 2000, Houston won her sixth and final competitive Grammy for &quot;It&#x27;s Not Right but It&#x27;s Okay&quot; in the Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance category. The European success of the album helped it to win the MTV Europe Music Award for Best R&amp;B. Houston earned four additional Grammy nominations for the album and the music video for &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; gave Houston her first MTV Video Music Award nomination in 13 years.

In 1999, Houston participated in VH-1&#x27;s Divas Live &#x27;99, alongside Brandy, Mary J. Blige, Tina Turner and Cher. The same year, Houston hit the road with her 70-date &quot;My Love Is Your Love World Tour&quot;. While the North American leg was plagued by cancellations with Houston&#x27;s publicist citing &quot;throat problems and a &#x27;bronchitis situation&#x27;&quot;, the European leg became hugely successful ending the year as the highest-grossing arena tour of the year in Europe. In November 1999, the Recording Industry Association of America hosted its Century Awards and named Houston the top-selling R&amp;B female artist of the century with certified US sales of 51 million records at the time while the soundtrack to &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; received awards for being the top-selling soundtrack album of the century and the best-selling album of the century by a female artist. In March 2000, Houston earned a special honor at the 2000 Soul Train Music Awards as the female artist of the decade for her extraordinary artistic contributions during the 1990s.

In May 2000, &quot;&quot; was released worldwide. The double disc set reached number five in the United States, reaching number one in the United Kingdom. In addition, the album reached the Top 10 in many other countries. While ballad songs were left unchanged, the album features house/club remixes of many of Houston&#x27;s up-tempo hits. Included on the album were four new songs: &quot;Could I Have This Kiss Forever&quot; (a duet with Enrique Iglesias), &quot;Same Script, Different Cast&quot; (a duet with Deborah Cox), &quot;If I Told You That&quot; (a duet with George Michael) and &quot;Fine&quot; and three hits that had never appeared on a Houston album: &quot;One Moment in Time&quot;, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;If You Say My Eyes Are Beautiful&quot;, a duet with Jermaine Jackson from his 1986 &quot;Precious Moments&quot; album. Along with the album, an accompanying VHS and DVD was released featuring the music videos to Houston&#x27;s greatest hits, as well as several hard-to-find live performances including her 1983 debut on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and interviews. The set was later certified five times platinum in the US for sales of five million copies, while worldwide sales reached 11 million.

=== 2000–2008: &quot;Just Whitney&quot; ===

Houston&#x27;s &quot;good girl&quot; image from previous decades came under scrutiny in the beginning of the 2000s. Reports of erratic behavior, showing up hours late to interviews, photo shoots, rehearsals and canceling several concerts, had been following her since the late 1990s. 

Houston failed to show up to induct Clive Davis into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2000. Weeks later, Houston was scheduled to perform at the Academy Awards but was fired from the event by musical director and longtime friend Burt Bacharach. At the time, her publicist cited throat problems as the reason for the cancellation. In his book, &quot;The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards&quot;, author Steve Pond revealed that &quot;Houston&#x27;s voice was shaky, she seemed distracted and jittery, and her attitude was casual, almost defiant&quot;; though she was supposed to perform &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, she would sing a different song during rehearsals. Houston later admitted she had been fired. Houston, however, did show up for a scheduled performance to celebrate Arista&#x27;s 25th anniversary with Clive Davis, her performance received good reviews.

In May 2000, Houston&#x27;s longtime executive assistant and friend, Robyn Crawford, resigned from Houston&#x27;s management company.

Despite increasing negative press, Houston continued to find success. She produced the film &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; (2001) alongside fellow BrownHouse partner Debra Martin Chase. Starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews, the film became an unexpected success in the box office, grossing more than $165 million worldwide. Houston and Chase became the first black people in box office history to produce a film that surpassed $100 million in the box office. In August 2001, Houston signed one of the biggest record deals in music history, with Arista/BMG. She renewed her contract for $100 million to release six new albums, for which she would also earn royalties.

A performance at &quot;Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special&quot; in September 2001 led to increasing rumors of drug use and possible health issues due to Houston&#x27;s extremely thin frame. She canceled a second performance scheduled for the following night. Within weeks, Houston&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was re-released after the September 11 attacks, with the proceeds donated to the New York Firefighters 9/11 Disaster Relief Fund and the New York Fraternal Order of Police. The single reached No. 6 on the US Hot 100, topping its previous position.

Houston released her fifth studio album, &quot;Just Whitney&quot;, in December 2002. The album debuted at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum, though it received mixed reviews. In August 2003, Houston&#x27;s second television film as a producer, &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot;, premiered on the Disney Channel. A soundtrack of the film, executive produced by Houston, became successful, reaching double platinum status in the US. Later that November, Houston released her first Christmas album, &quot;One Wish: The Holiday Album&quot;, which featured traditional holiday songs and was certified gold in the US.

In April 2004, Houston&#x27;s second film as producer, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;, was equally successful in the box office like its predecessor, earning $134 million in the box office. For most of the year, Houston toured internationally. Houston&#x27;s success behind the scenes continued in 2006 with the airing of &quot;The Cheetah Girls 2&quot;, which Houston served as executive producer. The film remains one of the highest-rated Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOM) in history with more than 8.1 million viewers tuning in for the premiere.

=== 2009–2012: &quot;I Look to You&quot; ===
Houston released &quot;I Look to You&quot; in August 2009. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 305,000 copies sold, marking a strong return. The album&#x27;s success was followed by her performance on various European television shows and her appearance as a guest mentor on &quot;The X Factor&quot; in the UK. Despite a wardrobe malfunction during her performance of &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot;, the single still achieved commercial success. Following the album&#x27;s release, Houston embarked on the Nothing but Love World Tour, her first world tour in more than 10 years. Despite some negative reviews and rescheduled concerts, Houston continued to perform.

In January 2010, Houston was nominated for two NAACP Image Awards and won Best Music Video for &quot;I Look to You&quot;. On January 16, she received the Entertainers Award at the BET Honors, acknowledging her lifetime achievements spanning more than 25 years. 

Later in 2010, Houston was cast in the remake of the 1976 film &quot;Sparkle&quot;, where she served as both a star and executive producer. The film marked her final acting role before her untimely death. The movie was released on August 17, 2012. It and featured &quot;Celebrate&quot;, the last song Houston recorded, which was released in May 2012.

== Personal life ==
Houston was a Christian, and she made it a point to sing gospel songs when on tour.

===Relationships, marriage, and family===
Houston first met Robyn Crawford when Crawford was 19 and Houston was 16; the two were summer camp counselors. According to Crawford, the two were romantically involved for a few years until Whitney signed her first record contract at 19. Crawford and Houston continued their professional relationship and platonic friendship until Crawford left Houston&#x27;s employ in 2000.

In the 1980s, Houston was romantically linked to musician Jermaine Jackson, American football star Randall Cunningham, and actor Eddie Murphy.

Houston met R&amp;B singer Bobby Brown at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards. After a three-year courtship, the two were married on July 18, 1992. The two singers occasionally collaborated on songs, including the hit record, &quot;Something in Common&quot;. The following year, Houston gave birth to their daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown (March 4, 1993 – July 26, 2015), the couple&#x27;s only child. Houston and Brown tried having another child throughout their marriage; however, Houston suffered several miscarriages, including one during the filming of &quot;The Bodyguard,&quot; another in July 1994, and another in December 1996.

During their marriage, Brown had several run-ins with the law for drunken driving, drug possession and battery, including some jail time. In December 2003, Brown was charged with battery following an altercation during which he threatened to beat Houston and then assaulted her. Police reported that Houston had visible injuries to her face.

Starting in April of the following year, the reality show &quot;Being Bobby Brown&quot; was taped and later premiered on &quot;Bravo&quot;, in June 2005. The show drew criticism for what critics perceived to be unflattering moments from the couple, but still achieved high ratings. However, the show was not renewed for a second season after Houston declined further participation. In September 2006, a year after &quot;Being Bobby Brown&quot; aired, Houston filed for legal separation from Brown, later filing for divorce the following month, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was granted on April 24, 2007.

===Legal issues===
On January 11, 2000, while Houston was traveling with her husband Bobby Brown, airport security guards discovered half an ounce of marijuana in her handbag at Keahole-Kona International Airport in Hawaii. She departed before authorities could arrive. Charges against her were later dropped.

In 2002, Houston became embroiled in a legal dispute with John Houston Enterprise, a company started by her father. The company, run by Kevin Skinner, sued her for $100 million, claiming unpaid compensation. Houston&#x27;s father died in February 2003, and the lawsuit was dismissed in April 2004, with no compensation awarded. 

===Health===
Houston had several miscarriages during her marriage.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published a story in June 2000 stating that Cissy Houston and others had held a July 1999 intervention in which they unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Whitney to obtain drug treatment.

In her 2019 memoirs, &quot;A Song for You: My Life with Whitney Houston&quot;, Houston&#x27;s longtime executive assistant and friend, Robyn Crawford, said she departed from Houston&#x27;s management company after Houston declined to seek help for her drug dependency. Houston claimed in an interview that they parted ways over Houston&#x27;s husband, Bobby Brown. 

In September 2001, Houston&#x27;s extremely thin appearance led to rumors about her health. Her publicist stated, &quot;Whitney has been under stress due to family matters and when she is under stress she doesn&#x27;t eat.&quot; In 2009, Houston acknowledged that drug use had been the reason for her weight loss in 2001. 

In 2002, Houston gave an interview with Diane Sawyer to promote her upcoming album. During the interview, she addressed rumors of drug use, famously saying, &quot;crack is wack&quot;. She admitted to using various substances but denied having an eating disorder.

In September 2009, Houston was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey. In the interview, she admitted to using drugs with Brown during their marriage and described her struggles with addiction. She told Winfrey that before &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; her drug use was light, that she used drugs more heavily after the film&#x27;s success and the birth of her daughter and that by 1996 &quot;[doing drugs] was an everyday thing ... I wasn&#x27;t happy by that point in time. I was losing myself.&quot; Houston told Oprah that she had attended a 30-day rehabilitation program. Houston also acknowledged to Oprah that her drug use had continued after rehabilitation, and that at one point, her mother obtained a court order and the assistance of law enforcement to press her into receiving further drug treatment. (In her 2013 book, &quot;Remembering Whitney: My Story of Love, Loss, and the Night the Music Stopped&quot;, Cissy Houston described the scene she encountered at Whitney Houston&#x27;s house in 2005 as follows: &quot;Somebody had spray-painted the walls and door with big glaring eyes and strange faces. Evil eyes, staring out like a threat ... In another room there was a big framed photo of [Whitney] — but someone had cut [her] head out. It was beyond disturbing, seeing my daughter&#x27;s face cut out like that&quot;.) When Winfrey asked Houston if she was drug-free, Houston responded, &quot;&#x27;Yes, ma’am. I mean, you know, don’t think I don’t have desires for it.&#x27;&quot;

In May 2011, Houston enrolled in rehabilitation again due to drug and alcohol problems, which she stated was part of her &quot;longstanding recovery process&quot;.

== Death ==
On February 11, 2012, Houston was found unconscious in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton, submerged in the bathtub. Houston reportedly appeared &quot;disheveled&quot; and &quot;erratic&quot; in the days before her death. Beverly Hills paramedics arrived about 3:30 pm, found Houston unresponsive, and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 pm PST. The cause of death was not immediately known; local police said there were &quot;no obvious signs of criminal intent&quot;. On March 22, 2012, the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office reported that Houston&#x27;s death was caused by drowning and the &quot;effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use&quot;. The manner of death was listed as &quot;accident&quot;.

Houston&#x27;s death coincided with the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, which took place the day following her death and included a tribute to Houston; it was later credited for the Grammys&#x27; second-highest ratings in history. The February 11, 2012, Clive Davis pre-Grammy party that Houston had been expected to attend, which featured many of the biggest names in music and film, went on as scheduled – although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Numerous other public figures also expressed their grief, including Mariah Carey, Quincy Jones, Darlene Love, Aretha Franklin and Oprah Winfrey. Houston&#x27;s death was covered internationally in the media, along with her memorial service, which was held for Houston at her home church, New Hope Baptist Church, in Newark, New Jersey, on February 18, 2012.

Houston&#x27;s music surged in popularity following her death. According to representatives from Houston&#x27;s record label, Houston sold 8 million records worldwide in the first 10 months of the year she died. The single &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; returned to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 after almost 20 years, peaking at number three and becoming a posthumous top-10 single for Houston, the first one since 2001. Houston set a Guinness World Record for a female artist by placing 10 albums inside the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 simultaneously. In October 2023, Houston made the list of the top 10 highest-earning posthumous celebrities on &quot;Forbes&quot; earning $30 million, later winning Houston a posthumous Guinness World Records entry as the highest-earning posthumous female celebrity, her record 30th.

== Artistry ==

Houston had a four-octave vocal range. She was referred to as &quot;the Voice&quot; because of her vocal talent. 

Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated Houston &quot;always had a great big voice, a technical marvel from its velvety depths to its ballistic middle register to its ringing and airy heights&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Houston second on their list of the greatest singers of all time, stating, &quot;The standard-bearer for R&amp;B vocals, Whitney Houston possessed a soprano that was as powerful as it was tender. Take her cover of Dolly Parton&#x27;s &#x27;I Will Always Love You&#x27;, which became one of the defining singles of the 1990s; it opens with her gently brooding, her unaccompanied voice sounding like it&#x27;s turning over the idea of leaving her lover behind with the lightest touch. By the end, it&#x27;s transformed into a showcase for her limber, muscular upper register; she sings the title phrase with equal parts bone-deep feeling and technical perfection, turning the conflicted emotions at the song&#x27;s heart into a jumping-off point for her life&#x27;s next step.&quot;

Matthew Perpetua of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also acknowledged Houston&#x27;s vocal prowess, enumerating 10 performances, including &quot;How Will I Know&quot; at the 1986 MTV VMAs and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the 1991 Super Bowl. &quot;Whitney Houston was blessed with an astonishing vocal range and extraordinary technical skill, but what truly made her a great singer was her ability to connect with a song and drive home its drama and emotion with incredible precision&quot;, he stated. &quot;She was a brilliant performer and her live shows often eclipsed her studio recordings.&quot; 

Elysa Gardner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in her review for &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife Soundtrack&quot; highly praised Houston&#x27;s vocal ability, commenting, &quot;She is first and foremost a pop diva – at that, the best one we have. No other female pop star – not Mariah Carey, not Celine Dion, not Barbra Streisand – quite rivals Houston in her exquisite vocal fluidity and purity of tone and her ability to infuse a lyric with mesmerizing melodrama.&quot; Singer and entertainer Michael Jackson named Houston as one of his musical inspirations, calling her a &quot;wonderful singer, real stylist. You hear one line, and you know who it is.&quot;

R&amp;B singer Faith Evans stated: &quot;Whitney was not just a singer with a beautiful voice. She was a true musician. Her voice was an instrument and she knew how to use it. With the same complexity as someone who has mastered the violin or the piano, Whitney mastered the use of her voice. From every run to every crescendo—she was in tune with what she could do with her voice and it&#x27;s not something simple for a singer—even a very talented one—to achieve. Whitney is &#x27;the Voice&#x27; because she worked for it. This is someone who was singing backup for her mom when she was 14 years old at nightclubs across the country. This is someone who sang backup for Chaka Khan when she was only 17. She had years and years of honing her craft on stage and in the studio before she ever got signed to a record label. Coming from a family of singers and surrounded by music; she pretty much had a formal education in music, just like someone who might attend a performing arts high school or major in voice in college.&quot;

Jon Caramanica of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;Her voice was clean and strong, with barely any grit, well suited to the songs of love and aspiration. [ ... ] Hers was a voice of triumph and achievement and it made for any number of stunning, time-stopping vocal performances.&quot; Mariah Carey stated, &quot;She [Whitney] has a really rich, strong mid-belt that very few people have&quot;. In her review of &quot;I Look to You&quot;, music critic Ann Powers of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;[Houston&#x27;s voice] stands like monuments upon the landscape of 20th century pop, defining the architecture of their times, sheltering the dreams of millions and inspiring the climbing careers of countless imitators&quot;. Powers added, &quot;When she was at her best, nothing could match her huge, clean, cool mezzo-soprano&quot;.

Lauren Everitt from BBC News commented on the melisma used in Houston&#x27;s recording. &quot;An early &#x27;I&#x27; in Whitney Houston&#x27;s &#x27;I Will Always Love You&#x27; takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs a series of different notes into the single syllable&quot;, stated Everitt. &quot;The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;you&#x27;. The vocal technique is called melisma and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, but it was her rendition of Dolly Parton&#x27;s love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. [ ... ] But perhaps what Houston nailed best was moderation.&quot; Everitt said that &quot;[i]n a climate of reality shows ripe with &#x27;oversinging,&#x27; it&#x27;s easy to appreciate Houston&#x27;s ability to save melisma for just the right moment.&quot;

Houston&#x27;s vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry. Stephen Holden from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in his review of Houston&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall concert on July 20, 1993, praised her attitude as a singer, writing, &quot;Whitney Houston is one of the few contemporary pop stars of whom it might be said: the voice suffices. While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer&#x27;s bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather just stand there and sing.&quot; With regard to her singing style, he added: &quot;Her [Houston&#x27;s] stylistic trademarks – shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song, twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration – infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning.&quot;

Houston struggled with vocal problems in her later years. Gary Catona, a voice coach who began working with Houston in 2005, stated: &quot;&#x27;When I first started working with her in 2005, she had lost 99.9 percent of her voice ... She could barely speak, let alone sing. Her lifestyle choices had made her almost completely hoarse&#x27;&quot;. After Houston&#x27;s death, Catona asserted that Houston&#x27;s voice reached &quot;&#x27;about 75 to 80 percent&#x27;&quot; of its former capacity after he had worked with her. However, during the world tour that followed the release of &quot;I Look to You&quot;, &quot;YouTube videos surfaced, showing [Houston&#x27;s] voice cracking, seemingly unable to hold the notes she was known for&quot;.

Houston&#x27;s vocal performances incorporated a wide variety of genres, including R&amp;B, pop, rock, soul, gospel, funk, dance, Latin pop, disco, house, hip hop soul, new jack swing, opera, reggae, and Christmas. The lyrical themes of her songs are mainly love, religion, and feminism. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated: &quot;Her sound expanded through collaborations with a wide array of artists, including Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Babyface, Missy Elliott, Bobby Brown, and Mariah Carey.&quot; While AllMusic commented that, &quot;Houston was able to handle big adult contemporary ballads, effervescent, stylish dance-pop and slick urban contemporary soul with equal dexterity&quot;.

== Legacy and cultural impact ==

Houston has been regarded as one of the greatest vocalists of all time and a cultural icon. She is also recognized as one of the most influential R&amp;B artists in history. During the 1980s, MTV was coming into its own and received criticism for not playing enough videos by black artists. With Michael Jackson breaking down the color barrier for black men, Houston did the same for black women. She became the first black woman to receive heavy rotation on the network following the success of the &quot;How Will I Know&quot; video. According to author Ann Kaplan in her book &quot;Rocking Around the Clock: Television, Postmodernism and Consumer Culture&quot;, &quot;until the recent advent of Whitney Houston, Tina Turner was the only female Black singer featured regularly, and even so, her videos are far and few between.&quot; Houston was credited for breaking barriers for black female artists on the channel resulting in videos by Janet Jackson, Jody Watley and Tracy Chapman to be immediately accepted to the channel&#x27;s playlist.

Black female artists, such as Anita Baker and Jackson, were successful in popular music partly because Houston paved the way. Baker commented that &quot;Because of what Whitney and Sade did, there was an opening for me ... For radio stations, black women singers aren&#x27;t taboo anymore.&quot;

AllMusic noted her contribution to the success of black artists on the pop scene. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;Houston was a major catalyst for a movement within black music that recognized the continuity of soul, pop, jazz and gospel vocal traditions&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine commented on her initial success breaking various barriers:

Of her first album&#x27;s ten cuts, six were ballads. This chanteuse [Houston] had to fight for air play with hard rockers. The young lady had to stand uncowed in the locker room of macho rock. The soul strutter had to seduce a music audience that anointed few black artists with superstardom. [ ... ] She was a phenomenon waiting to happen, a canny tapping of the listener&#x27;s yen for a return to the musical middle. And because every new star creates her own genre, her success has helped other blacks, other women, other smooth singers find an avid reception in the pop marketplace.
Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Houston &quot;revitalized the tradition of strong gospel-oriented pop-soul singing&quot;. Ann Powers of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to Houston as a &quot;national treasure&quot;. Jon Caramanica, another music critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called Houston &quot;R&amp;B&#x27;s great modernizer&quot;, adding &quot;slowly but surely reconciling the ambition and praise of the church with the movements and needs of the body and the glow of the mainstream&quot;. He also drew comparisons between Houston&#x27;s influence and other big names on 1980s pop:

She was, alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna, one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s, though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers. Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential than they were in the years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houston&#x27;s voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated.

&quot;The Independent&quot;″s music critic Andy Gill also wrote about Houston&#x27;s influence on modern R&amp;B and singing competitions, comparing it to Michael Jackson&#x27;s. &quot;Because Whitney, more than any other single artist – Michael Jackson included – effectively mapped out the course of modern R&amp;B, setting the bar for standards of soul vocalese and creating the original template for what we now routinely refer to as the &#x27;soul diva&#x27; &quot;, stated Gill. &quot;Jackson was a hugely talented icon, certainly, but he will be as well remembered (probably more so) for his presentational skills, his dazzling dance moves, as for his musical innovations. Whitney, on the other hand, just sang and the ripples from her voice continue to dominate the pop landscape.&quot; Gill said that there &quot;are few, if any, Jackson imitators on today&#x27;s TV talent shows, but every other contestant is a Whitney wannabe, desperately attempting to emulate that wondrous combination of vocal effects – the flowing melisma, the soaring mezzo-soprano confidence, the tremulous fluttering that carried the ends of lines into realms of higher yearning&quot;.

Similarly, Steve Huey from Allmusic wrote that the shadow of Houston&#x27;s prodigious technique still looms large over nearly every pop diva and smooth urban soul singer – male or female – in her wake and spawned a legion of imitators. According to Linda Lister in &quot;Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars&quot;, she has been called the &quot;Queen of Pop&quot; for her influence during the 1990s, commercially rivaling Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. Daphne Brooks wrote in a tribute to Houston that her vocal talent during the performance of the &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; &quot;cemented her title as the voice of the post–civil rights era.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that Houston &quot;redefined the image of a female soul icon and inspired singers ranging from Mariah Carey to Rihanna&quot;. The magazine placed her 34th on their 2008 &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot; list. Fifteen years later, in 2023, Houston was placed at second place, behind just Aretha Franklin. &quot;Essence&quot; ranked Houston at number five on their list of 50 Most Influential R&amp;B Stars ever, calling her &quot;the diva to end all divas&quot;. In October 2022, the same magazine ranked Houston at number one on its list of the 10 greatest R&amp;B solo artists of all time. In 2015, she was placed at number nine (second as a female) by &quot;Billboard&quot; on the list &quot;35 Greatest R&amp;B Artists Of All Time&quot;. 

In May 2003, Houston placed at number three on VH1&#x27;s list of &quot;50 Greatest Women of the Video Era&quot;. She was also ranked as one of the &quot;Top 100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; and “Top 200 Greatest Cultural Icons of All Time”by VH1. Houston&#x27;s entrance into the music industry is considered one of the 25 musical milestones of the last 25 years, according to &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2007. It stated that she paved the way for Mariah Carey&#x27;s chart-topping vocal gymnastics. She was ranked as the best female vocalist of all time by &quot;Smooth Radio&quot;. Many major publications including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Fox News, NBC News, &quot;The Independent&quot; dubbed Houston the “greatest singer of her generation”. 

In March 2020, the Library of Congress announced that Houston&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; had been added to its National Recording Registry, a list of &quot;aural treasures worthy of preservation&quot; due to their &quot;cultural, historical and aesthetic importance&quot; in the American soundscape. Houston&#x27;s debut album is listed as one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and is on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s Definitive 200 list. In 2004, &quot;Billboard&quot; picked the success of her first release on the charts as one of 110 Musical Milestones in its history. The first single “I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)” from her second album was named as the best pop song in history by &quot;Billboard.&quot; On August 5, 2022, Beyoncé released &quot;The Queens Remix&quot; to her single &quot;Break My Soul&quot;, in which she mentions Houston, along with other cultural icons.

A number of artists have acknowledged Whitney as an influence and inspiration, including Michael Jackson, Aaliyah, Rihanna, Beyoncé, Sam Smith, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Celine Dion, Adele, Lucky Daye, Demi Lovato, Kelly Clarkson, Nicole Scherzinger, Kelly Rowland, Toni Braxton, Ashanti, Deborah Cox, Robin Thicke, Ciara, Brandy, Monica, LeAnn Rimes, Melanie Fiona, Jennifer Hudson, Christina Aguilera, Jordin Sparks, Alicia Keys, Leona Lewis, Ariana Grande, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Coco Jones, and Nicki Minaj.

== Awards and achievements ==
Houston won numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Emmy Awards, eight Grammy Awards (including two Grammy Hall of Fame honors), 14 World Music Awards, 16 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards (36 &quot;Billboard&quot; awards in all) and 22 American Music Awards. Houston currently holds the record for most American Music Awards in a single night with eight, a record for a woman and tied in general with fellow musician Michael Jackson. Houston was the first artist to win more than 11 awards in one night at its fourth annual ceremony in 1993, which set a Guinness World Record at the time. Houston continues to hold the record for the most WMAs won in a single year, winning five trophies at the sixth World Music Awards in 1994. Houston is also the black female artist with the most Guinness World Records in history with 31.

A premier black female entertainer, Houston was inducted into the BET Walk of Fame and the Soul Train Hall of Fame. In 2001, Houston became the first artist to receive the BET Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2010, she was honored at The BET Honors with the Entertainers Award. Along with singer Patti LaBelle, Houston remains the only other artist to be bestowed with all three honors from the network. In 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine released a list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists to celebrate the US singles chart&#x27;s 50th anniversary, ranking Houston at number nine. In November 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; released its &quot;Top 50 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years&quot; list and ranked Houston at number three who not only went on to earn eight number-one singles on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, but also landed five number ones on R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

Houston is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, with more than 220 million records sold worldwide. She was certified as the best-selling female R&amp;B artist of the 20th century by the RIAA in 1999. Houston had sold more physical singles than any other female solo artist in history. As of 2025, she was ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the United States by the RIAA with 61 million certified albums. Houston released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have been certified diamond, multi-platinum or platinum.

Houston became the first female artist to go diamond with an album after her soundtrack to &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; went ten-time platinum in November 1993. Two months later, in January 1994, her debut album, &quot;Whitney Houston&quot;, was the first studio album by a woman to be certified ten-time platinum, making her the first female artist to receive two diamond albums. When her sophomore album, &quot;Whitney&quot; (1987), was certified diamond in October 2020, Houston became the first black recording artist in history to have three diamond-certified albums. Those three albums are also among the best-selling albums of all time. Houston is the only black female artist with six or more albums to sell more than ten million units worldwide. &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; remains the best-selling soundtrack and best-selling female album of all time, with global units of over 50 million, while &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; remains the best-selling single by a female artist at 24 million units worldwide. In addition, her soundtrack for &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; is the best-selling gospel release ever.

She held an honorary Doctorate in Humanities from Grambling State University, Louisiana. Houston was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2013. In August 2014, she was inducted into the official Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in its second class. In January 2020, nearly eight years after her death, Houston was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after her first nomination. In October 2020, the music video for &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; surpassed 1 billion views on YouTube, making Houston the first solo 20th-century artist to have a video reach that milestone. In May 2023, Houston was one of the first of 13 artists to be given the Brits Billion Award by the BPI for reaching 1 billion career streams in the United Kingdom. In July 2023, Houston became the first solo artist who debuted in the 1980s to have a song streamed more than a billion times after her 1987 hit, &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;, reached that feat. Houston achieved a second billion-streamed song on Spotify after her and Kygo&#x27;s &quot;Higher Love&quot; reached the milestone in November 2024.

== Philanthropy ==
Houston was a long-time supporter of charities around the world. In 1989, she established the Whitney Houston Foundation for Children. It offered medical assistance to sick and homeless children, fought to prevent child abuse, taught children to read, created inner-city parks and playgrounds and granted college scholarships, including one to the Juilliard School. At a 1988 Madison Square Garden concert, Houston earned more than $250,000 for the United Negro College Fund (UNCF).

Houston donated all of the earnings from her 1991 Super Bowl XXV performance of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; sales to Gulf War servicemen and their families. The record label followed suit and she was voted to the &quot;American Red Cross Board of Directors&quot; as a result. Following the terrorist attacks in 2001, Houston re-released &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; to support the New York Firefighters 9/11 Disaster Relief Fund and the New York Fraternal Order of Police. She waived her royalty rights to the song, which reached number one on charts in October 2001 and generated more than $1 million. Houston declined to perform in apartheid-era South Africa in the 1980s. Her participation at the 1988 Freedomfest performance in London (for a then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela) grabbed the attention of other musicians and the media.

In addition, Houston became an activist for the fight against HIV and AIDS during the first decade of the AIDS epidemic. The Whitney Houston Foundation for Children, in particular, focused on helping children who suffered from HIV/AIDS, among other issues. In 1990, Whitney took part in Arista Records&#x27; 15th anniversary gala, which was an AIDS benefit, where she sang &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;, &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot; and, with cousin Dionne Warwick, &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;. A year later, Whitney participated in the Reach Out &amp; Touch Someone AIDS vigil at London in September 1991 while she was finishing her historic ten-date residency at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena; there, she stressed the importance of AIDS research and addressing HIV stigma.

In June 1999, Whitney gave a surprise performance at the 13th Annual New York City Lesbian &amp; Gay Pride Dance at one of the city&#x27;s West Side piers. According to &quot;Instinct&quot; magazine, Houston&#x27;s unannounced performance at the Piers &quot;ushered in a new era that would eventually make high-profile artists performing at LGBTQ events virtually commonplace&quot;. Before hitting the stage, Houston was asked by MTV veejay John Norris why she decided to attend the event. Houston replied, &quot;We&#x27;re all God&#x27;s children, honey&quot;.

<text>The World Games are an international multi-sport event comprising sports and sporting disciplines that are not contested in the Olympic Games. They are usually held every four years, one year after a Summer Olympic Games, over the course of 11 days. The World Games are governed by the International World Games Association, under the patronage of the International Olympic Committee.

In the most recent editions, between 25 and 34 sports have been included in the official program. Several sports or disciplines that were on the program of The World Games have been discontinued because they are now included in the programme of the Olympic Games. Around 3500 participants from around 100 nations take part.

The World Games differs from other multi-sport events, such as the Olympic Games, in that host cities are not required to construct new venues or facilities for the Games. The competitors are selected by the sports&#x27; international federations, as opposed to by National Olympic Committees or national governing bodies. In most disciplines, qualification is by a top ranking at the world championships or a qualification tournament. This is intended to ensure the top athletes in a sport compete at the Games.

The event is officially known as &quot;The World Games&quot;, spelled with a capital T.

The first edition of The World Games was held in Santa Clara, California, United States, in 1981, and the eleventh edition was held in Birmingham, Alabama, United States from 7 to 17 July 2022. That edition was originally intended to be held in 2021, but it was delayed one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== History ==
===Inauguration===
The idea for a multi-sport event for non-Olympic sports came from the General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF). Realising that there were few opportunities to become part of the Olympic program, non-Olympic federations wanted to form their own showcase event to increase the publicity of their sports, which they called The World Games. These federations formed a steering group in early 1979 to decide on the structure and principles of the games and search for a venue.

In May 1979, the steering group announced that they had found a venue for the first event: Santa Clara, USA.

The GAISF steering committee became the World Games Executive Council in October 1979, and the inaugural meeting of the World Games Council was held on 19–22 May 1980, with a purpose of creating the concept of the Games. The World Games Council was renamed the International World Games Association, or IWGA in 1985.

The first edition of The World Games was held in Santa Clara, USA, in 1981. It was opened by Kim Un-yong, president of the World Games executive committee, at Buck Shaw Stadium. At the opening ceremony, the athletes marched sorted by sport and not by nation.

The 15 sports at the inaugural games included badminton, casting, racquetball, and taekwondo. The first medals of the Games were awarded in the 640 kilo class of tug-of-war, with the gold going to the team from England.

===Twentieth century===

After the inaugural Games, the West Nally Group, which had provided financing for the Games in Santa Clara, became owners of the rights to the event, and took the second edition to their headquarters in London.

For the third Games in Karlsruhe, 1989, the West Nally Group still owned the commercial rights to the Games, but the host city was responsible for the staff and volunteers organising the event. After this, the IWGA bought back the commercial rights, and the organising committees of the host cities have been responsible for the organisation and financing since. This led to the organisers of The World Games in The Hague (1993) asking the participants to pay accommodation costs.

The 1997 edition of the Games was due to be held in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, but in August 1994, Port Elizabeth pulled out of hosting the Games due to the political situation in the country. Lahti in Finland volunteered to host instead and signed the host contract in January 1995. Airsports, dancesport, aerobics and jujitsu made their debut in Lahti and have been contested at the Games ever since.

Following the Games in Lahti, the IWGA and IOC agreed on a memorandum of understanding, which was signed in 2000 Here, the IOC recognised the importance of The World Games and set out shared values, including the IOC providing patronage to Organising Committees, encouraging multi-sport national teams, and working together on anti-doping. It also set out that &quot;disciplines/events of sport that are not on the Olympic Games program could be included on the program of the World Games&quot;. A further memorandum of understanding was signed in 2016.

===Twenty-first century===

In 2001, the Games were held in Akita, Japan – the first time it had been held outside of North America or Europe. Several competitions were delayed or moved to an alternative venue when a typhoon hit the city. For the first time, some National Olympic Committees organised hotel accommodation for their athletes, beyond the time they were hosted by the IWGA.

The World Games in 2005, in Duisburg, Germany, were the first World Games where athletes paraded into the opening ceremony grouped by nation. Also several standards were set in place which continue to this day, such as the television production of all sports and sports grouped by category, such as ball sports and precision sports.

The 2013 Games in Cali, Colombia were particularly noted for the large numbers of spectators, estimated at 500,000. For example, the Bullfight Ring, which was the venue for dancesport, was &#x27;packed&#x27; for the salsa dance finals. This edition of the Games saw the first time a competition was cancelled: due to concerns about temperature and air flow at the Del Pueblo Gymnasium, where the sport of rhythmic gymnastics was taking place, the ribbons event was cancelled.

The 2017 Games in Wrocław, Poland were the first to be broadcast on the Olympic Channel, to 130 countries. Both the raffa and lyonnaise disciplines of boules were cancelled after a storm destroyed the venue and it could not be repaired in time.

In 2015, it was announced that the 11th edition of The World Games was to be held in Birmingham, Alabama, USA in 2021, beating bids from Lima, Peru and Ufa, Russia. On 2 April 2020, the Games were postponed to 2022 so as not to clash with the postponement of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo due to the coronavirus pandemic.

No parasport federations are currently part of the IWGA, but The World Games in Birmingham was the first edition to include parasports, with the inclusion of wheelchair rugby. Birmingham was also to include disabled athletes (one per gender) in archery. The IWGA is also aiming to secure a partnership with the International Paralympic Committee and include a quota for para-athletes.

In 2019, it was announced that The World Games in 2025 will take place in Chengdu, China.

==Features==

===Venues===

In order for hosting to be sustainable, organisers of The World Games are not required to build any new venues or facilities.
For example, Sloss Furnaces, a former pig iron-producing blast furnace now in public use, hosted the sport climbing, breakdancing, parkour and beach handball competitions in Birmingham 2022. Athletes stayed at the student accommodations of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), several of whose sports facilities were used for various events.

Past venues have included the Lahti City Theatre (bodybuilding), Landschaftspark Nord (a former iron foundry in Duisburg), Wrocław Zoo, and Wrocław&#x27;s Philharmonic Hall, the National Forum of Music.

Even though it is not required, some venues are constructed or renovated for The World Games. For instance, for the 2017 World Games in Wrocław, a new swimming pool and speed skating rink were built, and Olympic Stadium, built in 1928, was renovated and is still used for American football and speedway. Also, for the 2009 World Games, Kaohsiung built a National Stadium – the first stadium in the world to use solar energy technology for its power. Other editions used new facilities that were built for purposes other than the World Games; the main stadium of the 2022 edition, Protective Stadium, was built for UAB&#x27;s American football team.

===Athlete selection===

Athletes are selected to compete at The World Games by their sport&#x27;s international federation, as opposed to their sport&#x27;s national governing body or National Olympic Committee, as in other multi-sport events. The selections are intended to &quot;achieve a satisfactory balance between competitors&#x27; positions on world ranking lists and the fair representation of as many as possible of its member nations&quot;.

International federations are obliged to send their best athletes, with The World Games development agenda setting out that sports are only to be included if &quot;the best athletes/teams in the world are present&quot;.

==International World Games Association==
The International World Games Association (IWGA) is the international association responsible for the direction and control of The World Games. Its headquarters are located in Lausanne, Switzerland, and its official language is English.

Its membership consists of 39 international sporting federations. It also works very closely with the Local Organising Committees (LOCs), temporary committees responsible for the organisation of each World Games. LOCs are dissolved after each Games. The IWGA is officially recognised by the International Olympic Committee.

==Ceremonies==

===Opening ceremony===

The opening ceremony marks the official start of The World Games. Until Duisburg 2005, athletes paraded into the ceremony grouped by sport. From 2005, they were grouped by nation, and now march in alphabetical order, with the host country and then the judges last.

The Athletes&#x27; Oath is taken by an athlete of the host nation, and the Judges&#x27; Oath is taken by the chairman of the Tournament Judges&#x27; Commission. Parading of flags, speeches and official opening also make up the required parts of the ceremony.
There is also often a musical and artistic aspect of the ceremony. For example, more than 400 artists took part in the opening ceremony of the 2017 World Games in Wroclaw.

===Athlete party===
Since 1993 at The Hague, an athlete party has been held in the middle of the competition. It was intended to allow all athletes to participate in at least one ceremony (opening, athlete party, or closing) during the competition.

===Closing ceremony===

The closing ceremony ends The World Games and follows the last awards ceremony. Official aspects include speeches, a presentation by the next host city and a handing of the flag of the Games to the representatives of the next host city. In Wroclaw, the second part of the ceremony was a concert performed by local artists.

==Editions==

==Sports==

===Official sports===
For The World Games in 2017 and before, official sports were selected solely by the IWGA. Only sports whose international federations were members of the IWGA could be selected. From 2022, the official sports are selected by both the IWGA and host city and can include some sports whose federations are not part of the IWGA.

As formalised in the memorandum of understanding, &quot;only events that are not on the program of the Olympic Games can be included in the program of The World Games&quot;. For example, canoe polo is a discipline at The World Games, while canoe sprint and canoe slalom are disciplines at the Olympic Games, despite all three being governed by the International Canoe Federation.

Sports that depend on the availability of snow or ice for competitions are ineligible for inclusion in The World Games.

Sports which have been contested at all editions of The World Games are bowling, finswimming, trampoline and tumbling disciplines of gymnastics, karate, powerlifting, roller sports, tug of war and water skiing. Bowling and water skiing are not on the program of the 2025 World Games.

===Invitational sports===
In addition to the official sports, the host city, in coordination with the IWGA, has been allowed to invite sports to participate in the individual program. These sports optionally are permitted to include international sports federations that were not members of the IWGA. Before Birmingham 2022, these were deemed &quot;invitational sports&quot;.

Starting in Birmingham 2022, there was no distinction between official and invitational sports. Host cities are still able to select up to five optional sports, but they are designated &quot;official&quot; sports, rather than invitational. In addition, the host city will be able to designate &quot;display sports&quot;. José Perurena, IWGA President, stated, &quot;In Birmingham, for the first time, invitational sports were no longer presented separately but were also part of the official programme.&quot; For example, the Birmingham Organising Committee selected men&#x27;s lacrosse (women&#x27;s being selected by the IWGA), duathlon, flag football and wushu. For the first time ever, a paralympic sport was part of the program as a wheelchair rugby tournament was held.

Some sports or disciplines started in The World Games as invitational sports and then became official, often as their international federations became part of the IWGA. These include the lyonnaise discipline of boules sports, beach handball, sumo, and indoor tug of war.

===Olympic sports===
Sports or disciplines which have been part of The World Games and the Olympics include badminton, baseball and softball, karate, rugby, sport climbing, taekwondo, target archery, triathlon, beach volleyball and water polo. Target archery is currently on the programs of both, but The World Games only holds events in divisions that are not contested in the Olympics.

=== Other sports presented ===
In addition to official and invitational sports, other sports have been presented during The World Games, including through &quot;The World Games Garden&quot;. Among such sports are: Rhönrad (Wheel Gymnastics), Karlsruhe-based Ring Tennis, Skateboard, Baton twirling and others.

<doc id="34074" wikidata="Q275175" url="?curid=34074" title="Witold Gombrowicz">
<text>Witold Marian Gombrowicz (August 4, 1904 – July 24, 1969) was a Polish writer and playwright. His works are characterised by deep psychological analysis, a certain sense of paradox and absurd, anti-nationalist flavor. In 1937, he published his first novel, &quot;Ferdydurke&quot;, which presented many of his usual themes: problems of immaturity and youth, creation of identity in interactions with others, and an ironic, critical examination of class roles in Polish society and culture. 

He gained fame only during the last years of his life, but is now considered one of the foremost figures of Polish literature. His diaries were published in 1969 and are, according to the &quot;Paris Review&quot;, &quot;widely considered his masterpiece&quot;, while &quot;Cosmos&quot; is considered, according to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;his most accomplished novel&quot;. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times, from 1966 to 1969.

==Biography==
===Polish years===

Gombrowicz was born in Małoszyce near Opatów, then in Radom Governorate, Congress Poland, Russian Empire, to a wealthy gentry family. He was the youngest of four children of Jan and Antonina (née Ścibor-Kotkowska of the Clan of Ostoja). In an autobiographical piece, &quot;A Kind of Testament&quot;, he wrote that his family had lived for 400 years in Lithuania on an estate between Vilnius and Kaunas but were displaced after his grandfather was accused of participating in the January Uprising of 1863. He later described his family origins and social status as early instances of a lifelong sense of being &quot;between&quot; (&quot;entre&quot;). In 1911 his family moved to Warsaw. After completing his education at Saint Stanislaus Kostka&#x27;s Gymnasium in 1922, Gombrowicz studied law at Warsaw University, earning a MJur in 1927. He spent a year in Paris, where he studied at the Institute of Higher International Studies (French: &quot;Institut des Hautes Etudes Internationales&quot;). He was less than diligent in his studies, but his time in France brought him in constant contact with other young intellectuals. He also visited the Mediterranean.

When Gombrowicz returned to Poland, he began applying for legal positions with little success. In the 1920s he started writing. He soon rejected the legendary novel, whose form and subject matter were supposed to manifest his &quot;worse&quot; and darker side of nature. Similarly, his attempt to write a popular novel in collaboration with Tadeusz Kępiński was a failure. At the turn of the 1920s and 1930s, Gombrowicz began to write short stories, later printed under the title &quot;Memoirs of a Time of Immaturity&quot;, edited by Gombrowicz and published under the name &quot;Bacacay&quot;, the street where he lived during his exile in Argentina. From the moment of this literary debut, his reviews and columns began appearing in the press, mainly the &quot;Kurier Poranny&quot; (&quot;Morning Courier&quot;). Gombrowicz met with other young writers and intellectuals, forming an artistic café society in Zodiak and Ziemiańska, both in Warsaw. The publication of &quot;Ferdydurke&quot;, his first novel, brought him acclaim in literary circles.

===Exile in Argentina===

Just before the outbreak of the Second World War, Gombrowicz took part in the maiden voyage of the Polish transatlantic liner MS Chrobry to South America. When he learned of the outbreak of war in Europe, he decided to wait in Buenos Aires until it was over; he reported to the Polish legation in 1941 but was considered unfit for military duties. He stayed in Argentina until 1963—often, especially during the war, in poverty.

At the end of the 1940s Gombrowicz was trying to gain a position in Argentine literary circles by publishing articles, giving lectures at the Fray Mocho café, and, finally, by publishing in 1947 a Spanish translation of &quot;Ferdydurke&quot;, with the help of friends including Virgilio Piñera. This version of the novel is now considered a significant event in the history of Argentine literature, but at the time of its publication it did not bring Gombrowicz any great renown, nor did the 1948 publication of his drama &quot;Ślub&quot; in Spanish (&quot;The Marriage&quot;, &quot;El Casamiento&quot;). From December 1947 to May 1955 Gombrowicz worked as a bank clerk in Banco Polaco, the Argentine branch of Bank Pekao, and formed a friendship with Zofia Chądzyńska, who introduced him to Buenos Aires&#x27;s political and cultural elite. In 1950 he started exchanging letters with Jerzy Giedroyc, and in 1951 he began to publish work in the Parisian journal &quot;Culture&quot;, in which fragments of &quot;Dziennik&quot; (&quot;Diaries&quot;) appeared in 1953. In the same year he published a volume of work that included &quot;Ślub&quot; and the novel &quot;Trans-Atlantyk&quot;, in which the subject of national identity on emigration was controversially raised. After October 1956 four of Gombrowicz&#x27;s books appeared in Poland and brought him great renown, even though the authorities did not allow the publication of &quot;Dziennik&quot; (&quot;Diary&quot;).

Gombrowicz had affairs with both men and women. In his later serialised &quot;Diary&quot; (1953–69) he wrote about his adventures in the homosexual underworld of Buenos Aires, particularly his experiences with young men from the lower class, a theme he picked up again when interviewed by Dominique de Roux in &quot;A Kind of Testament&quot; (1973).

===Last years in Europe===
In the 1960s Gombrowicz became recognised globally, and many of his works were translated, including &quot;Pornografia&quot; (&quot;Pornography&quot;) and &quot;Kosmos&quot; (&quot;Cosmos&quot;). His dramas were staged in theatres around the world, especially in France, Germany and Sweden.

Having received a scholarship from the Ford Foundation, Gombrowicz returned to Europe in 1963. In April 1963 he embarked on an Italian ship, landing at Cannes and then taking a train to Paris. A record of the journey can be found in his diary. Gombrowicz stayed for a year in West Berlin, where he endured a slanderous campaign organised by the Polish authorities. His health deteriorated during this stay, and he was unable to return to Argentina. He went back to France in 1964 and spent three months in Royaumont Abbey, near Paris, where he met Rita Labrosse, a Canadian from Montreal who studied contemporary literature. In 1964 he moved to the Côte d&#x27;Azur in the south of France with Labrosse, whom he employed as his secretary. He spent the rest of his life in Vence, near Nice.

Gombrowicz&#x27;s health prevented him from thoroughly benefiting from his late renown. It worsened notably in spring 1964; he became bedridden and was unable to write. In May 1967 he was awarded the Prix International. The following year, on December 28, he married Labrosse. On the initiative of his friend Dominique de Roux, who hoped to cheer him up, he gave a series of 13 lectures on the history of philosophy to de Roux and Labrosse, ironically titled &quot;Guide to Philosophy in Six Hours and Fifteen Minutes&quot;, which de Roux transcribed. The lectures began with Kant and ended with existentialism. The series ended before Gombrowicz could deliver the last part, interrupted by his death on July 24, 1969. He was buried in the cemetery in Vence.

==Writing==

Gombrowicz wrote in Polish, but he did not allow his works to be published in Poland until the authorities lifted the ban on the unabridged version of &quot;Dziennik&quot;, his diary, in which he described their attacks on him. Because he refused publication in Poland, he remained largely unknown to the general reading public until the first half of the 1970s. Still, his works were printed in Polish by the Paris Literary Institute of Jerzy Giedroyć and translated into more than 30 languages. Moreover, his dramas were repeatedly staged around the world by prominent directors such as Jorge Lavelli, Alf Sjöberg, Ingmar Bergman, and Jerzy Jarocki and Jerzy Grzegorzewski in Poland.

The salient characteristics of Gombrowicz&#x27;s writing include incisive descriptions of characters&#x27; psychological entanglement with others, an acute awareness of conflicts that arise when traditional cultural values clash with contemporary values, and an exasperated yet comedic sense of the absurd. Gombrowicz&#x27;s clear and precise descriptions criticise Polish Romanticism, and he once claimed he wrote in defiance of Adam Mickiewicz (especially in &quot;Trans-Atlantic&quot;). Gombrowicz&#x27;s work has links with existentialism and structuralism. It is also known for its playful allusions and satire, as in a section of &quot;Trans-Atlantic&quot; written in the form of a stylised 19th-century diary, followed by a parody of a traditional fable.

For many critics and theorists, the most engaging aspects of Gombrowicz&#x27;s work are the connections with European thought in the second half of the 20th century, which link him with the intellectual heritage of Foucault, Barthes, Deleuze, Lacan, and Sartre. As Gombrowicz said, &quot;&quot;Ferdydurke&quot; was published in 1937 before Sartre formulated his theory of the &quot;regard d&#x27;autrui&quot;. But it is owing to the popularization of Sartrean concepts that this aspect of my book has been better understood and assimilated.&quot;

Gombrowicz uses first-person narrative in his novels, except &quot;Opętani&quot;. The language includes many neologisms. Moreover, he created &quot;keywords&quot; that shed their symbolic light on the sense covered under the ironic form (e.g. &quot;gęba&quot;, &quot;pupa&quot; in &quot;Ferdydurke&quot;).

In the story &quot;Pamiętnik z okresu dojrzewania&quot; Gombrowicz engages in paradoxes that control the entrance of the individual into the social world and the repressed passions that rule human behaviour. In &quot;Ferdydurke&quot; he discusses form as a universal category that is understood in philosophical, sociological, and aesthetic senses, and is a means of enslavement of the individual by other people and society as a whole. Certain turns of phrase in the novel became common usage in Polish, such as &quot;upupienie&quot; (imposing on the individual the role of somebody inferior and immature) and &quot;gęba&quot; (a personality or an authentic role imposed on somebody). &quot;Ferdydurke&quot; can be read as a satire of various Polish communities: progressive bourgeoisie, rustic, conservative. The satire presents the human either as a member of a society or an individual who struggles with himself and the world.

Adaptations of &quot;Ferdydurke&quot; and other works of Gombrowicz were presented by many theatres, especially before 1986, when the first nine volumes of his works were published. It was the only official way to gain access to his work.

Gombrowicz&#x27;s first dramatic text was &quot;Iwona, księżniczka Burgunda&quot; (&quot;Ivona, Princess of Burgundia&quot;, 1938), a tragicomedy. It describes what the enslavement of form, custom, and ceremony brings.

In 1939 he published in installments in two daily newspapers the popular novel &quot;Opętani&quot;, in which he interlaced the form of the Gothic novel with that of sensational modern romance.

In &quot;Ślub&quot;, written just after the war, Gombrowicz used the form of Shakespeare&#x27;s and Calderón’s theatre. He also critically undertook the theme of the romantic theatre (Zygmunt Krasiński, Juliusz Słowacki) and portrayed a new concept of power and a human being created by other people.

In &quot;Trans-Atlantyk&quot; Gombrowicz juxtaposes the traditional vision of a human who serves values with a new vision according to which an individual frees oneself of this service and fulfills oneself. The representative of this model of humanity is the eccentric millionaire Gonzalo.

The novel &quot;Pornografia&quot; shows Poland in wartime, when the eternal order of traditional culture, based on faith in God, collapsed. In its place appears a new reality where the elderly and the young cooperate to realise their cruel fascinations streaked with eroticism.

&quot;Kosmos&quot; is Gombrowicz&#x27;s most complex and ambiguous work. In it he portrays how human beings create a vision of the world, what forces, symbolic order, and passion take part in this process and how the novel form organises itself in the process of creating sense.

&quot;Operetka&quot;, Gombrowicz&#x27;s last play, uses operetta form to grotesquely present 20th-century totalitarianism. At the same time, he expresses a tentative faith in rebirth through youth.

According to many scholars, his most outstanding work is &quot;Dziennik&quot; (&quot;Diaries&quot;), not only as a literary work but also philosophical: &quot;The affectingly cool critic of European tradition, the diagnostician of the disease afflicting contemporary thought, the great artist and moralist. If I were to designate a worthy successor to the &quot;Joyful science&quot; of Nietzschean criticism and poetry in twentieth century literature, I would answer: Gombrowicz in his &quot;Diary&quot;&quot; (Wojciech Karpiński). &quot;Dziennik&quot; was published in serial form in &quot;Kultura&quot; from 1953 to 1969. It is not only Gombrowicz&#x27;s record of life but also a philosophical essay, polemic, collection of auto-reflection on folk poetry, views on politics, national culture, religion, tradition, and many other themes. He writes in ostensibly casual anecdotes and uses a wide range of literary devices.

Three of Gombrowicz&#x27;s novels were adapted for film: &quot;Ferdydurke&quot; (1991) directed by Jerzy Skolimowski, &quot;Pornografia&quot; (2003) directed by Jan Jakub Kolski, and &quot;Cosmos&quot; (2015) directed by Andrzej Żuławski.

2004, the centenary of his birth, was declared the Year of Gombrowicz.

Gombrowicz&#x27;s last extensive work, &quot;Kronos&quot;, was published in Poland by Wydawnictwo Literackie on May 23, 2013. From May 2024, a manuscript of the &quot;Kronos&quot; is presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth in Warsaw.

==Style==
Gombrowicz&#x27;s works are characterised by deep psychological analysis, a certain sense of paradox, and an absurd, anti-nationalist flavor. &quot;Ferdydurke&quot; presents many themes explored in his later work: the problems of immaturity and youth, the masks people wear, and an ironic, critical examination of class roles in Polish society and culture, specifically the nobility and provincials. It provoked sharp critical reactions and immediately divided Gombrowicz&#x27;s audience into worshipers and sworn enemies.

In his work, Gombrowicz struggled with Polish traditions and the country&#x27;s difficult history. This battle was the starting point for his stories, which were deeply rooted in this tradition and history. Gombrowicz is remembered by scholars and admirers as a writer and a man unwilling to sacrifice his imagination or his originality for any price, person, god, society, or doctrine.

<text>Winona is a city in and the county seat of Montgomery County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 4,505 at the 2020 census, down from 5,043 in 2010. Winona is known in the local area as &quot;The Crossroads&quot;; the intersection of U.S. Interstate 55 and U.S. Highway 51 and 82 run through here.

== History ==

=== Middleton ===
Middleton was a town that developed in the 19th century two miles west of Winona&#x27;s present location. Some locals consider it the predecessor to Winona. After the railroad was built to the east of Middleton, development shifted to what became Winona, bypassing Middleton.

=== Winona ===
The first European-American settler in the area, which was originally part of Carroll County, was Colonel O.J. Moore, who arrived from Virginia in 1848. He agreed to the railroad being constructed through his property, and a station was built in 1860 near his plantation home.

As a result of the railroad line and station being built here rather than Middleton, Winona was founded and began to grow. The railroad attracted business, which developed around the station as Moore sold off some property. Winona was incorporated as a town on May 2, 1861. Settlers were attracted because of the railroad access, and Winona became a busy trading town.

Captain William Witty, an early settler from North Carolina, was for years a leading Winona merchant and established the first bank in the county. Other names of early settlers were Curtis, Burton, Palmer, Spivey, Townsend, Hart, Turner and Campbell. The early businesses were mainly grocery stores.

In 1871, the Reconstruction-era state legislature organized Montgomery County from portions of Carroll and other counties, and Winona was designated as its county seat. A yellow fever epidemic struck the area in 1878 and resulted in the deaths of many residents. Some people left the town in an effort to outrun the epidemic, which spread with river passengers throughout the waterways of the Mississippi Delta and nearby counties.

In April 1888, a great fire destroyed almost the entire business section of the town. Forty of the 50 businesses burned. In 1890 the state passed a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised most blacks, excluding them from the political system. In addition, Jim Crow laws were passed imposing second-class status on them, a condition enforced by whites for decades.

===20th century to present===
Following their service in World War II, many African Americans began to press to regain their constitutional rights. Activism increased in the South into the 1950s and 1960s.

Many whites in Winona and elsewhere in Mississippi opposed such changes. In 1963, Fannie Lou Hamer and other state activists stopped to eat in Winona on their way to a literacy workshop in Charleston, South Carolina. On June 9, 1963, Hamer and the other activists stopped again in Winona on their return. The group was arrested on a false charge and jailed by white policemen. Once in jail, Hamer and her colleagues were, per orders of local law officers, beaten savagely by inmates of the Montgomery County jail, almost to the point of death.

While touring the country in this period, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), made a stop in Winona. He was ambushed by local barber Ryan Lynch, an outspoken white supremacist. King was saved by his assigned bodyguard, a local police officer named Garrit Howard.

In 1996, the owner of the Tardy Furniture store in Winona, Bertha Tardy, and three employees of the store were found fatally shot. Curtis Flowers was arrested in January 1997 and charged with four counts of capital murder. Flowers was tried a total of six times, and in 2020 the Office of the Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss the charges.

=== 2023 tornado ===

On Friday, March 24, 2023, just after 9:30 p.m. CDT, the southern side of Winona was struck and heavily damaged by a large, destructive and fast-moving EF3 tornado that caused three deaths.

<text>Winona Laura Horowitz (born ), known professionally as Winona Ryder, is an American actress. Having come to attention playing quirky characters in the late 1980s, she achieved success with her more dramatic performances in the 1990s. Ryder&#x27;s many accolades include a Golden Globe, as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award, and a Grammy Award.

Following her film debut in &quot;Lucas&quot; (1986), Ryder rose to prominence when she starred in the comedy &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988). Major parts in &quot;Heathers&quot; (1989), &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990), &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990), and &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992) came next. She earned two consecutive Oscar nominations—Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress—for her portrayals of a socialite in &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993) and Jo March in &quot;Little Women&quot; (1994), respectively. Her subsequent work included starring roles in &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994), &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot; (1995), &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996), &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998), &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; (1999), and &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; (2002).

Ryder took a break from acting in the early 2000s, after the significant negative media attention brought by her arrest in 2001 for shoplifting, later returning with smaller appearances in films such as &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Dilemma&quot; (2011). She portrayed Lois Wilson in the Hallmark television film &quot;When Love Is Not Enough&quot; (2010). Since 2016, she has played Joyce Byers on the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, for which she received her third Golden Globe nomination. She has since starred in the HBO miniseries &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; (2020) and the comedy horror sequel &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; (2024).

==Early life==
Winona Laura Horowitz was born in Winona County, Minnesota, to Cynthia Palmer (née Istas) and Michael D. Horowitz. Winona&#x27;s mother is an author, video producer, and editor, and her father is an author, editor, publisher, and antiquarian bookseller. He also worked as an archivist for psychologist Timothy Leary (Ryder&#x27;s godfather). Winona&#x27;s father&#x27;s family is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and hails from Ukraine and Romania. Growing up, Winona visited her paternal grandparents in Brooklyn for the Jewish Holiday of Passover, every year.

Named after Winona, Minnesota, Winona Ryder was given her middle name, Laura, because of her parents&#x27; friendship with Laura Huxley, writer Aldous Huxley&#x27;s wife. Winona&#x27;s stage name derives from Mitch Ryder, a soul and rock singer of whom her father was a fan. Her father is an atheist and her mother is a Buddhist. Winona has a younger brother, Urie (named in honor of the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin), and two older half-siblings from her mother&#x27;s prior marriage: half-brother Jubal Palmer and half-sister Sunyata Palmer. Winona&#x27;s family friends were her godfather Timothy Leary, the Beat Movement poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and the science fiction novelist Philip K. Dick. In 1978, when she was seven years old, she and her family relocated to Rainbow, a commune near Elk, Mendocino County, California, where they lived with seven other families on a plot of land. As the remote property had no electricity or television sets, Winona began to devote her time to reading and became an avid fan of J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.
When she was ten, Winona Ryder and her family moved to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied by children who mistook her for an effeminate boy. In 1983, 12-year-old Ryder enrolled at the American Conservatory Theater in nearby San Francisco, where she took her first acting lessons. During the same year, she nearly drowned; the experience caused her to develop aquaphobia. The psychological trauma caused problems later in her life during the underwater scenes in &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), some of which had to be reshot numerous times. Ryder continued to be bullied through high school, when she achieved early film success with &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;: &quot;I remember thinking, &#x27;Ooh, it&#x27;s like the number-one movie. This is going to make things great at school.&#x27; But it made things worse. They called me a witch.&quot;

Ryder has said that her natural hair color is brown, but she was &quot;really blonde as a kid&quot;; when she was 11 or 12, she started dyeing her blonde hair blue and purple. At the time of her audition for the 1986 film &quot;Lucas&quot;, her hair had been dyed black and the filmmakers asked her to keep it.

==Career==

===1985–1990: Early roles and breakthrough===

In 1985, Ryder sent a videotaped audition, where she recited a monologue from the novel &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; by J. D. Salinger, to appear in the film &quot;Desert Bloom&quot;. Although the role went to Annabeth Gish, writer/director David Seltzer cast her in his high school drama &quot;Lucas&quot; (1986), which starred Corey Haim, Charlie Sheen, and Kerri Green. When asked how she wanted her name to appear in the credits, she suggested &quot;Ryder&quot; as her surname because a Mitch Ryder album that belonged to her father was playing in the background. Winona&#x27;s next film was &quot;Square Dance&quot; (1987), where her teenage character creates a bridge between two different worlds—a traditional farm in the middle of nowhere and a large city. She won acclaim for the performance, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; calling it &quot;a remarkable debut.&quot; Both films were only marginally successful commercially.

After seeing her in &quot;Lucas&quot;, director Tim Burton cast Winona Ryder in his film &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988). She starred as a goth teenager whose family moves to a haunted house populated by ghosts played by Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, and Michael Keaton. The film was a success at the box office, and the film as well as Ryder&#x27;s performance received mostly positive reviews from critics. Also in 1988, she appeared alongside Kiefer Sutherland and Robert Downey Jr. in &quot;1969&quot;, a drama about the Vietnam War and the tensions it created in American families.

Ryder next starred in the independent film &quot;Heathers&quot; (1989). The film, a satirical take on teenage life, featured Ryder and Christian Slater as high school sweethearts who begin killing off popular students. Her agent initially begged her to turn the role down, saying the film would &quot;ruin her career&quot;. Critical reaction to the film was largely positive, and Ryder&#x27;s performance was positively received, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calling Ryder &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s most impressive ingénue […] Ryder […] makes us love her teen-age murderess, a bright, funny girl with a little Bonnie Parker in her. She is the most likable, best-drawn young adult protagonist since the sexual innocent of &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Girl&quot;.&quot; Despite its critical success, &quot;Heathers&quot; was a box-office flop, but has achieved the status of a cult film in following decades. Ryder&#x27;s other 1989 starring role was in the biopic &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot;, in which she played the 13-year-old bride (and cousin) of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll idol Jerry Lee Lewis. The film was a box-office failure and received mixed reviews from critics. Ryder also appeared in 1989 in the music video for Mojo Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant with My Two-Headed Love Child&quot;.

Ryder began the 1990s with three starring roles. In the fantasy film &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990), she reunited with director Tim Burton to play the female lead alongside her then-boyfriend Johnny Depp. The film was a significant box office success, grossing $86 million and receiving much critical devotion. Ryder&#x27;s second role of the year was in the family comedy-drama &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990), which co-starred Cher, Bob Hoskins, and Christina Ricci. &quot;Mermaids&quot; was a moderate box-office success and Ryder&#x27;s performance was acclaimed; critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Winona Ryder, in another of her alienated outsider roles, generates real charisma.&quot; For her performance, Ryder received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and a National Board Review award for the same category. Following &quot;Mermaids&quot;, Ryder had the lead role as a troubled teenager in the comedy-drama &quot;Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael&quot; (1990). The film co-starred Jeff Daniels and was deemed a commercial flop. In 1990, Ryder also made a cameo in Roy Orbison&#x27;s music video &quot;A Love So Beautiful&quot; with Matthew Modine, and was awarded &#x27;ShoWest&#x27;s Female Star of Tomorrow&#x27; by The National Association of Theatre Owners. She was next slated to appear as Mary Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, but withdrew from the project in the beginning of filming in 1990 due to nervous exhaustion.

===1991–2000: Established actress===
In 1991, Ryder played a young taxicab driver in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s independent film &quot;Night on Earth&quot;. The film was given a limited release, but received critical praise. Ryder then starred in three big-budget adaptations of literary classics. The first was &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992), directed by Francis Ford Coppola and featuring Ryder in the dual role of Mina Murray and Count Dracula&#x27;s past lover, Princess Elisabeta. The script was originally intended for a television adaptation but Ryder liked it so much she brought it to Coppola&#x27;s attention. The film premiered in November 1992 to critical and commercial success.

Ryder continued her work in period films with Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993), an adaptation of Edith Wharton&#x27;s novel that co-starred Michelle Pfeiffer and Daniel Day-Lewis. Ryder considers Scorsese &quot;the best director in the world&quot;. For her portrayal of May Welland, the fiancée of Newland Archer (Day-Lewis), Ryder won a Golden Globe and received Academy Award and BAFTA nominations as well. Although not a commercial success, the &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; received critical praise upon its release in October 1993. Vincent Canby in the New York Times wrote, &quot;Ms Ryder is wonderful as this sweet young thing who&#x27;s hard as nails, as much out of ignorance as of self-interest.&quot;

Ryder next starred alongside Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Antonio Banderas, and Glenn Close in the melodrama &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; (1993), based on Isabel Allende&#x27;s novel. Also released in October 1993, the film was poorly reviewed and a box-office flop, grossing just $6 million on its $40 million budget. Ebert wrote that Ryder &quot;seems an unlikely casting choice but she is more convincing, with more abandon and passion, and she makes her character work.&quot; Ryder was next set to star in &quot;Broken Dreams&quot; with actor River Phoenix. The project was put on hold due to his death on October 31, 1993. In 1993, Ryder also appeared on the music video &quot;Without a Trace&quot; by Soul Asylum, whose member Dave Pirner was her boyfriend at the time.

Ryder&#x27;s next film, the Generation X drama &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994), marked a departure from period films. Directed by Ben Stiller and co-starring Ethan Hawke, the film featured Ryder as a recent college graduate searching for direction in life. According to Hawke and Stiller, the film got greenlit only due to Ryder&#x27;s star status. Her performance received acclaim but the film did not meet its studio&#x27;s expectations in the box office. Ryder returned to period films later that year, appearing as Jo March in &quot;Little Women&quot;, an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s novel. The film received widespread praise; critic Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that it was the greatest adaptation of the novel and that &quot;Ms. Ryder, whose banner year also includes a fine comic performance in &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, plays Jo with spark and confidence. Her spirited presence gives the film an appealing linchpin, and she plays the self-proclaimed &#x27;man of the family&#x27; with just the right staunchness.&quot; Ryder received her second Oscar nomination for the role, this time as Best Actress. In 1994, Ryder also made a guest appearance in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot; as Allison Taylor, whose intelligence and over-achieving personality makes her an adversary of Lisa.

Ryder&#x27;s next starring role was in &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot; (1995), an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Whitney Otto, co-starring Anne Bancroft, Maya Angelou, and Ellen Burstyn. The film grossed nearly four times its budget and received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The same year, Ryder narrated Anne Frank&#x27;s &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl&quot;, for which she received a Grammy Award nomination. A review by &quot;Audiofile&quot; praised her performance, saying, &quot;Winona Ryder is the perfect narrator for this work. Her voice sounds very young, matching the 14-year-old&#x27;s enthusiasm and frustrations.&quot;

Ryder made several film appearances in 1996, the first in &quot;Boys&quot;. The film failed to become a box office success and attracted mostly negative critical reaction. Ebert wrote: &quot;&quot;Boys&quot; is a low-rent, dumbed-down version of &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, with a rent-a-plot substituting for clever dialogue&quot;, calling the film a waste of Ryder&#x27;s talent. Her next role was in &quot;Looking for Richard&quot;, Al Pacino&#x27;s meta-documentary on a production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, which grossed only $1 million at the box office but drew moderate critical acclaim. She starred in &quot;The Crucible&quot; with Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen. The film, an adaptation of Arthur Miller&#x27;s play, centered on the Salem witch trials. It was expected to be a success, considering its budget, but was a commercial failure. Despite this, it was well received and Ryder&#x27;s performance was lauded, with Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writing, &quot;Ryder offers a transfixing portrait of warped innocence.&quot; Ryder later claimed that the role of Abigail Williams was the hardest in her whole career.

Ryder next took on a role as an android in &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), alongside Sigourney Weaver, who stars in the first four &quot;Alien&quot; films. Ryder&#x27;s brother, Uri, was a fan of the series, and when approached about it, she agreed to the project. The film became one of the least successful entries in the &quot;Alien&quot; film series, but was otherwise considered a success as it grossed $161 million worldwide. Ryder&#x27;s and Weaver&#x27;s performances drew mostly positive reviews, and Ryder won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Actress. In his review of the film, Ebert commented that Ryder lacked the conviction and presence to stand alongside Weaver and the rest of the cast. He compared her with Jenette Goldstein in &quot;Aliens&quot;. &quot;Ryder is a wonderful actress, one of the most gifted of her generation, but wrong for this movie,&quot; he wrote. At 1997&#x27;s ShoWest event, she was presented with the &#x27;Female Star of the Year&#x27; award.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day, 1998, Ryder performed in Eve Ensler&#x27;s play &quot;The Vagina Monologues.&quot; She then starred in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998), after Drew Barrymore turned down Ryder&#x27;s role, in an ensemble cast. The film satirizes the lives of several celebrities. In 1998, Ryder also appeared in the music video for Jon Spencer Blues Explosion&#x27;s song &quot;Talk About the Blues&quot;; a screenshot from the video later appeared on the cover of their album &quot;Xtra-Acme USA&quot;. In 1998, Ryder and Leonardo DiCaprio narrated &quot;Survivors: Testimonies of the Holocaust&quot;, a CD-ROM produced by Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Shoah Foundation. She also served as a member of the jury, led by Martin Scorsese, at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

In 1999, Ryder starred in and served as an executive producer for &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, based on the 1993 memoir of the same name by Susanna Kaysen. The film had been in development since late 1996, but took time to begin filming. Ryder was deeply attached to the project, calling it her &quot;child of the heart.&quot; She played Kaysen, who has borderline personality disorder and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for recovery. Directed by James Mangold and co-starring Angelina Jolie, the film was expected to mark Ryder&#x27;s comeback playing leading roles. Instead, it turned out to be the &quot;welcome-to-Hollywood coronation&quot; for Jolie, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Ebert wrote: &quot;Ryder shows again her skill at projecting mental states; one of her gifts is to let us know exactly what she&#x27;s thinking, without seeming to.&quot; He later called Ryder one of the reasons to see the film. The same year, Ryder was parodied in &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;. She also started her own music company, Roustabout Studios, in 1999.

In April 2000, Ryder was awarded the Peter J. Owens Award at the San Francisco Film Festival. Her next film, the melodrama &quot;Autumn in New York&quot;, co-starring Richard Gere, was released in August. The film received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success, grossing $90 million at the worldwide box office. In September, Ryder made a guest appearance in the series finale of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot;. She then played a nun of a secret society loosely connected to the Roman Catholic Church and determined to prevent Armageddon in &quot;Lost Souls&quot; (2000), a commercial failure. Ryder refused to do commercial promotion for the film. She later said, &quot;I was attracted to &quot;Lost Souls&quot; because I know nothing about this subject. I personally don&#x27;t believe in demonic possession. For me to play this woman was a real challenge. She is the ultimate believer. Most of all, I just wanted to do a movie in the thriller genre, at least one.&quot; On October 6, 2000, Ryder received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

===2001–2005: Hiatus===
In 2001, Ryder began a four-year career hiatus. Apart from a guest appearance on NBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, playing Rachel&#x27;s college sorority sister, and a brief cameo in Ben Stiller&#x27;s comedy &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001), she appeared in no new releases in 2001. She was scheduled to appear in &quot;Lily and the Secret of Planting&quot;, but withdrew from the project after being hospitalized for a severe stomach-related disorder in August 2001. 

In December 2001, Ryder was arrested for shoplifting, which made it difficult for her to be insured for further film projects. After her courtroom appearances in Marc Jacobs clothes were noted in the media, she appeared in Jacobs&#x27; Spring 2003 advertising campaign.

Woody Allen wanted to cast Robert Downey Jr. and Ryder in his film &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; (2004), but was unable to do so because &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get insurance on them ... We couldn&#x27;t get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them. ... We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before [on &quot;Celebrity&quot;] and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again.&quot;

In 2002, Ryder appeared in two movies filmed before her arrest. The first was a romantic comedy, &quot;Mr. Deeds,&quot; with Adam Sandler, grossing over $126 million in the United States alone. The film was not a critical success; film critic Philip French called it a terrible film, saying that &quot;remakes are often bad, but this one was particularly bad.&quot; The second film was the science fiction drama &quot;Simone,&quot; in which she portrayed a glamorous star who is replaced by a computer simulated actress due to the clandestine machinations of a director, portrayed by Al Pacino. On May 18, 2002, Ryder hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 2005, Ryder co-produced and co-narrated the documentary &quot;The Day My God Died&quot; (2004) with Tim Robbins, which focuses on international child sex trafficking.

===2006–2015: Return to film===

Ryder made a career return with appearances in several independent films in 2006 and 2007. The first was &quot;The Darwin Awards&quot; (2006), in which she acted alongside Joseph Fiennes. The second was Richard Linklater&#x27;s &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;, a film adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel, in which she co-starred opposite Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey, Jr. and Woody Harrelson. The film was made entirely with rotoscope software, which was used to turn live-action scenes into animation. The next year, Ryder appeared in David Wain&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Ten&quot;, and reunited with &quot;Heathers&quot; screenwriter Daniel Waters for the surreal black comedy &quot;Sex and Death 101&quot;. She also starred in the Kirsten Dunst-directed short horror film &quot;Welcome&quot; and made a brief appearance in the music video for &quot;We&#x27;re All Stuck Out In The Desert&quot; by Jonathan Rice.

In 2008, Ryder played the female lead opposite Wes Bentley and Ray Romano in Geoffrey Haley&#x27;s offbeat romantic drama &quot;The Last Word&quot;. She then starred as a newscaster in the film adaptation of &quot;The Informers&quot;. She also appeared in director J. J. Abrams&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as Spock&#x27;s human mother Amanda Grayson. Several media outlets noted Ryder&#x27;s return to film during this time. In 2009, Ryder starred alongside Robin Wright and Julianne Moore in Rebecca Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Private Lives of Pippa Lee&quot; (2009).

The next year, Ryder had a prominent supporting role as an aging ballet star in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;Black Swan&quot;. She also starred in the independent film &quot;Stay Cool&quot; alongside Hilary Duff, Mark Polish and Chevy Chase, and in the television movie &quot;When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story&quot;. For her performance as Lois Wilson, whose husband co-founded Alcoholics Anonymous in 1930s, Ryder was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Ryder played her character with wide eyes of both innocence and terror.&quot; Ryder next appeared in a leading role in Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Dilemma&quot; (2011), co-starring Vince Vaughn and Kevin James.

Ryder then played Deborah Kuklinski, the wife of contract killer Richard Kuklinski, in the thriller &quot;The Iceman&quot; (2012), co-starring Michael Shannon. She also appeared with her &quot;The Iceman&quot; co-star James Franco in &quot;The Letter&quot; (2012). She reunited with director Tim Burton, who directed her in the music video for The Killers&#x27; single, &quot;Here with Me&quot;, and cast her in the animated 3D feature film &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (2012). Ryder also worked with the classic film channel TCM in 2012, guest hosting for a week in September, while Robert Osborne was on vacation, and introducing some of her favorite classic films in December.

In 2013, Ryder appeared in the action thriller &quot;Homefront&quot; (2013), again opposite James Franco, this time playing a meth-addicted woman. Steven Boone of RogerEbert.com wrote: &quot;Ryder often seems on the verge of laughing in Franco&#x27;s face as he attempts to manhandle and pimp-talk her. But it&#x27;s nice to see her raven eyes and regal cheekbones on a big screen again, in whatever capacity.&quot; Ryder also starred in a segment of the Comedy Central television series &quot;Drunk History&quot; (2013) called &quot;Boston&quot;. She played religious protester Mary Dyer opposite stern Puritan magistrate John Endicott, played by Michael Cera. She then took on the role of Peggy Shippen, the wife of Benedict Arnold, in her appearance of the second season of &quot;Drunk History&quot; (2014). In 2014, Ryder appeared in the British television film &quot;Turks &amp; Caicos&quot; (2014) and modeled in the Fall advertising campaign of fashion label Rag &amp; Bone.

In 2015, Ryder was a juror at the Sundance Film Festival. She continued her work in television with the HBO miniseries &quot;Show Me a Hero&quot; (2015), in which she played the president of the Yonkers City Council. She then starred alongside Peter Sarsgaard in the biopic &quot;Experimenter&quot;, playing the wife of Stanley Milgram. &quot;Experimenter&quot; was released to positive reviews in October 2015. Ryder also appeared in advertisements for Marc Jacobs, both for their cosmetics and for their spring 2016 collection.

===2016–present: &quot;Stranger Things&quot; and resurgence===
Since 2016, Ryder has starred in the Netflix science fiction-horror series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, created by The Duffer Brothers, playing Joyce Byers, a single mother whose 12-year-old son Will vanishes mysteriously. The Duffer brothers said that Ryder &quot;has a very intense energy about her ... a wiry unpredictability, a sort of anxiousness that we thought we&#x27;d really lean into.&quot; The series&#x27; first season premiered in July 2016 to critical acclaim and high audience ratings. Ryder also received praise for her performance, and the cast won the SAG Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2017. The second and third seasons of the series were released in October 2017 and July 2019. For season 3, she was paid a reported $350,000 per episode. The filming for the fourth season had been halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but resumed in September 2020. The first volume of season 4 premiered on May 27, 2022, and the second volume on July 1, 2022. Kate Bush&#x27;s 1985 song &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; reached number one on iTunes after the song was included in scenes of &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, after Ryder frequently wore Kate Bush T-shirts and lapel badges on set.

In 2018, Ryder appeared in the film &quot;Destination Wedding&quot;, alongside Keanu Reeves. The same year, Ryder also starred in a L&#x27;Oréal shampoo commercial, and in H&amp;M&#x27;s spring collection campaign co-starring Elizabeth Olsen. In 2020, Ryder appeared in Squarespace&#x27;s Super Bowl commercial, which aired during the first half of the game. Later that year, she starred in &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;, an HBO limited series based on Philip Roth&#x27;s 2004 novel of the same name. David Simon, the creator of the series, said: &quot;Winona always had the standing of the great American ingenue. Now we&#x27;re ready for the second act, because she&#x27;s always been a remarkable actor—always asking questions about the role, doing the research, and then feeling the camera instinctively once the work begins.&quot; The series was Ryder&#x27;s second collaboration with Simon; in 2014, she appeared in his HBO miniseries &quot;Show Me a Hero&quot;.

In 2021, Ryder reprised her role as Kim Boggs in &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; alongside Timothée Chalamet in a Super Bowl ad for Cadillac. Her next film was &quot;Gone in the Night&quot;, co-starring Dermot Mulroney. As early as 1992, Ryder had expressed her willingness to appear in a sequel to &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, hinting at such a return in a November 2013 interview, provided that Burton and Keaton were involved, and confirmed again in August 2015 that she would reprise her role in the sequel. The sequel, &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;, finally went forward in the 2020s, with filming wrapped in late 2023 for a 2024 release.

==Personal life==

Ryder maintains homes in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Williamsburg in New York City. She is Jewish and has experienced antisemitism. She suffers from insomnia and has been a victim of stalking.

She has credited her career to director Tim Burton.

Ryder has been involved in philanthropic work since her twenties for the American Indian College Fund, which sends low-income Native Americans to universities.

===Relationships===
Ryder met Johnny Depp at the &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot; premiere in June 1989. In February 1990, the 18-year-old Ryder began dating the 26-year-old Depp after they were reintroduced by a mutual friend. They became engaged in July of that year, but split up in June 1993. She dated Soul Asylum band member Dave Pirner and Helmet frontman Page Hamilton. She dated actor Matt Damon from 1998 to 2000. Since 2011, she has been in a relationship with fashion designer Scott Mackinlay Hahn.

===Polly Klaas===

In 1993, Ryder offered a reward in the hope that it would lead to the return of kidnapped child Polly Klaas. Klaas lived in Petaluma, where Ryder grew up. Ryder offered a $200,000 reward for Klaas&#x27;s safe return. After the girl&#x27;s death, Ryder dedicated her performance as Jo in the 1994 film adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot;, one of Klaas&#x27;s favorite novels, to Klaas&#x27;s memory.

During a sentencing hearing related to her 2001 shoplifting incident, Ryder&#x27;s attorney, Mark Geragos, referred to her work with the Polly Klaas Foundation and other charitable causes. In response, Deputy District Attorney Ann Rundle said, &quot;What&#x27;s offensive to me is to trot out the body of a dead child.&quot; Polly&#x27;s father, Marc Klaas, defended Ryder and expressed outrage at the prosecutor&#x27;s comments.

===Legal issues===
On December 12, 2001, Ryder was arrested on shoplifting charges in Beverly Hills, California, accused of stealing $5,500 worth of designer clothes and accessories from a Saks Fifth Avenue department store. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley assembled a team of eight prosecutors and filed four felony charges against her. Ryder hired celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos. Negotiations failed to produce a plea bargain at the end of summer 2002 as the prosecution insisted on charging Ryder with a felony and not a misdemeanor. Joel Mowbray from &quot;National Review&quot; noted that the prosecution also refused the store&#x27;s request to drop the charges.

She was accused of using drugs, including oxycodone, diazepam, and Vicodin without valid prescription, but prosecutors dropped a drug possession count after it was proved that a doctor provided it to her as a medical treatment. She was convicted of grand theft and shoplifting but acquitted on the charge of burglary. In December 2002, she was sentenced to three years of probation, 480 hours of community service, $3,700 in fines, and $6,355 in restitution to the Saks Fifth Avenue store, and ordered to attend psychological counseling and drug counseling. On June 18, 2004, Superior Court Judge Elden Fox reviewed Ryder&#x27;s probation report and observed that she had served 480 hours of community service, and the felonies were reduced to misdemeanors. She finished her probation in December 2005.

Ryder later explained that the incident occurred during a difficult time in her life in which she was clinically depressed. She added that the pain-killing medication, which a &quot;quack&quot; physician had prescribed her, clouded her judgment significantly. Jules Mark Lusman, who prescribed the medication, subsequently had his medical license revoked by the Medical Board of California for unethically prescribing medication to his patients.

==Filmography and awards==
Ryder has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:
*66th Academy Awards (1994): Best Supporting Actress, nomination, for &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;
*67th Academy Awards (1995): Best Actress, nomination, for &quot;Little Women&quot;

Ryder has been nominated for three Golden Globe Awards (winning one), one British Academy Film Award, seven Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning one), and one Grammy Award.

<text>The world&#x27;s tallest human-made structure is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building gained the official title of &quot;tallest building in the world&quot; and the tallest self-supported structure at its opening on January 9, 2010. The second-tallest structure in the world is the Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, while the third-tallest self-supporting structure and the tallest tower in the world is the Tokyo Skytree (). The tallest guyed structure is the KRDK-TV mast in North Dakota, U.S. at .

The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an organization that certifies buildings as the &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest&quot;, recognizes a building only if at least 50% of its height is made up of floor plates containing habitable floor area. Structures that do not meet this criterion, such as the CN Tower, are defined as &quot;towers&quot;.

There are dozens of radio and television broadcasting towers which measure over 600 metres (about 2,000 ft) in height, and only the tallest are recorded in publicly available information sources.

== Debate over definition ==
The assessment of the height of artificial structures has been controversial. Because varying standards have been used by different organizations, the accepted height of these structures or buildings depends on which standards are accepted. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat has changed its definitions over time. Some of the controversy regarding the definitions and assessment of tall structures and buildings has included the following:
* the definition of a structure, a building and a tower 
* whether a structure, building or tower under construction should be included in any assessment
* whether a structure, building or tower has to be officially opened before it is assessed
* whether structures built in and rising above water should have their below-water height included in any assessment.
* whether a structure, building or tower that is guyed is assessed in the same category as self-supporting structures.

Within an accepted definition of a building further controversy has included the following factors:
* whether only habitable height of the building is considered
* whether communication towers with observation galleries should be considered &quot;habitable&quot; in this sense
* whether rooftop antennas, viewing platforms or any other architecture that does not form a habitable floor should be included in the assessment
* whether a floor built at a high level of a telecommunications or viewing tower should change the tower&#x27;s definition to that of a &quot;building&quot;

==Tallest structures==


This category does not require the structure to be &quot;officially&quot; open, but does require it to be &quot;topped out&quot;.

The tallest artificial structure is Burj Khalifa, a skyscraper in Dubai that reached in height on January 17, 2009. By April 8, 2008, it had been built higher than the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, US. That September it officially surpassed Poland&#x27;s Warsaw radio mast, which stood from 1974 to 1991, to become the tallest structure ever built. Guyed lattice towers such as these masts had held the world height record since 1954.

The Petronius Platform stands off the sea floor, leading some, including &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; 2007, to claim it as the tallest freestanding structure in the world, until surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in 2010. However, it is debated whether underwater height should be counted, in the same manner as height below ground is ignored on buildings. The Troll A platform is , without any part of that height being supported by wires. The tension-leg type of oil platform has even greater below-water heights with several examples more than deep. However, these platforms are not considered constant structures as the vast majority of their height is made up of the length of the tendons attaching the floating platforms to the sea floor. Despite this, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; 2009 listed the Ursa tension leg platform as the tallest structure in the world with a total height of . Shell&#x27;s floating production, storage, and offloading oil platform &quot;Turritella&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico is a moored platform approximately tall.

Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, set records in three of the four skyscraper categories at the time it opened in 2004; at the time the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010 it remained the world&#x27;s tallest inhabited building as measured to its architectural height (spire). The height of its roof and highest occupied floor had been surpassed by the Shanghai World Financial Center with corresponding heights of . Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was the highest in the final category: the greatest height to top of antenna of any building in the world at .

The Burj Khalifa broke the height record in all four categories for completed buildings.

===Tallest structure by category===
Due to the disagreements over how to measure height and classify structures, engineers have created various definitions for categories of buildings and other structures. One measure includes the absolute height of a building, another includes only spires and other permanent architectural features, but not antennas. The tradition of including the spire on top of a building and not including the antenna dates to the rivalry between the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street. A modern-day example is that the antenna on top of Willis Tower is not considered part of its architectural height, while the spires on top of the Petronas Twin Towers are counted.

&quot;Note:&quot; The following table is a list of the tallest completed structure in each of the structural categories below. For a list of structures by function see the list later in the article. There can only be one structure in each category, unless the tallest is the same for more than one structure in the same category.

===Tallest destroyed structures by category, not surpassed by existing structures===
There are some destroyed architectural structures which were taller than the tallest existing structure of their type. There are also destroyed structures omitted from this list that had been surpassed in height prior to being destroyed.

===Tallest structure by function===
* &quot;Mixed-use&quot; is defined as having three or more real estate uses (such as retail, office, hotel, etc.) that are physically and functionally integrated in a single property and are mutually supporting.

== Tallest buildings ==
Up until the late 1990s, the definition of &quot;tallest building&quot; was not altogether clear. It was generally understood to be the height of the building to the top of its architectural elements including spires, but not including &quot;temporary&quot; structures (such as antennas or flagpoles), which could be added or changed relatively easily without requiring major changes to the building&#x27;s design. Other criteria for height measurement generally were not considered, which occasionally caused some controversy.

One historic case involved the building now famous for the Times Square Ball. Known as One Times Square (at 1475 Broadway in Midtown Manhattan), it was the headquarters for&quot; The New York Times, &quot;which gave Times Square its name. Completed in 1905, it reached a height of to its roof, or including its rooftop flagpole, which the &quot;Times&quot; hoped would give it a record high status but because a flagpole is not an integral architectural part of a building, One Times Square was not generally considered to be taller than the Park Row Building in Lower Manhattan, which was therefore still New York&#x27;s tallest.

A bigger controversy was the rivalry between two New York City skyscrapers built in the Roaring Twenties—the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street. The latter was tall, had a shorter pinnacle, and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very long spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world&#x27;s tallest building with a total height of , despite having a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings&#x27; spires are not counted in their heights. Although the architects of record for 40 Wall were H. Craig Severance and Yasuo Matsui, the firm of Shreve &amp; Lamb (who also designed the Empire State Building) served as consulting architects. They wrote a newspaper article claiming that 40 Wall was actually the tallest, since it contained the world&#x27;s highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck of 40 Wall was nearly higher than the top floor of the Chrysler, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and essentially inaccessible. Despite the protest, the Chrysler Building was generally accepted as the tallest building in the world for almost a year, until it was surpassed by the Empire State Building&#x27;s in 1931.

That was in turn surpassed by the Twin Towers of New York&#x27;s original World Trade Center in 1972, which were in turn surpassed by the Sears Tower in Chicago in 1974. Now called the Willis Tower since 2009, it was to its flat rooftop, or including its original antennas. But in 1978 One World Trade Center (commonly known as the North Tower) attained a taller absolute height when it added its new broadcasting antenna, for a total height of . The WTC North Tower maintained this height record (including its antenna) from 1978 until 2000, when the owners of the Willis Tower extended its broadcasting antennae for a total height of . Thus the status of the Willis Tower as the &quot;totally&quot; tallest was restored in the face of a new threat looming in the Far East—the &quot;Siamese Twins&quot;.

A major controversy erupted upon completion of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. These Twin Towers, at , had a higher architectural height (spires, not antennas), but a lower absolute pinnacle height and a lower top occupied floor than the Willis Tower in Chicago. Counting buildings as structures with floors throughout, and with antenna masts excluded, the Willis was still considered the tallest at that time. Excluding their spires, which are higher than the flat roof of Willis, the Petronas Towers are not taller than Willis. At their convention in Chicago, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) found the Willis Tower (without its antennas) to be the third-tallest building, and the Petronas Towers (with their spires) to be the world&#x27;s two tallest buildings.

Responding to the ensuing controversy, the CTBUH then revised their criteria and defined four categories in which the world&#x27;s tallest building can be measured, retaining the old criterion of height to architectural top, and adding three new categories:

# Height to architectural top (including spires and pinnacles, but not antennas, masts or flagpoles). This measurement is the most widely used and is used to define the rankings of the 100 Tallest Buildings in the World.
# Highest occupied floor
# Height to top of roof (omitted from criteria from November 2009 onwards)
# Height to tip

The height-to-roof criterion was discontinued because relatively few modern tall buildings possess flat rooftops, making this criterion difficult to determine and measure. The CTBUH has further clarified their definitions of building height, including specific criteria concerning subbasements and ground level entrances (height measured from lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance rather than from a previously undefined &quot;main entrance&quot;), building completion (must be topped out both structurally and architecturally, fully clad, &quot;and&quot; able to be occupied), condition of the highest occupied floor (must be continuously used by people living or working and be conditioned, thus including observation decks, but not mechanical floors) and other aspects of tall buildings.

The height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance. At the time, the Willis Tower held first place in the second and third categories, the Petronas Towers held the first category, and the original WTC North Tower held the fourth (height to tip) category with its antenna. In 2000, however, a new antenna mast was placed on the Willis Tower, giving it the record in the fourth category. On April 20, 2004, the 101-story Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, was completed, taking the world record for the first three categories. On July 21, 2007, it was announced that Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE, had surpassed Taipei 101. Since its completion in early 2010, Burj Khalifa leads in all categories (the first building to do so) with its spire height of .

Before Burj Khalifa was completed, Willis Tower led in the height-to-tip category with after its antenna was extended in 2000, making Willis Tower slightly taller height-to-tip than the World Trade Center (WTC) North Tower&#x27;s antenna that measured . After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the WTC became the world&#x27;s tallest two buildings to be destroyed or demolished. They took that distinction from the Singer Building, which stood tall until the late 1960s where One Liberty Plaza now stands right across Church Street from the WTC site.

A different superlative for skyscrapers is their number of floors. The original World Trade Center set that record at 110 in the early 1970s, and this was not surpassed until the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010.

Tall freestanding structures such as the CN Tower, the Ostankino Tower and the Oriental Pearl Tower are excluded from these categories because they are not &quot;habitable buildings&quot;, which are defined as frame structures made with floors and walls throughout.

===History of record holders in each CTBUH category===
==Tallest freestanding structures on land==
Freestanding structures must not be supported by guy wires, the sea or other types of support. It therefore does not include guyed masts, partially guyed towers and drilling platforms but does include towers, skyscrapers (pinnacle height) and chimneys.

The world&#x27;s tallest freestanding structure on land is defined as the tallest self-supporting artificial structure that stands above ground. This definition is different from that of world&#x27;s tallest building or world&#x27;s tallest structure based on the percentage of the structure that is occupied and whether or not it is self-supporting or supported by exterior cables. Likewise, this definition does not count structures that are built underground or on the seabed, such as the Petronius Platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Visit world&#x27;s tallest structure by category for a list of various other definitions.

The tallest freestanding structure on land is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building surpassed the height of the previous record holder, the CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario, on September 12, 2007. It was completed in 2010, with final height of .

===History===
The following is a list of structures that have held the title as the tallest freestanding structure on land.


Notable mentions include the Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria, built in the third century BC and estimated between . It was the world&#x27;s tallest non-pyramidal structure for many centuries. Another notable mention includes the Jetavanaramaya stupa in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, which was built in the third century, and was similarly tall at . These were both the world&#x27;s tallest or second-tallest non-pyramidal structure for over a thousand years.

The tallest &quot;secular&quot; building between the collapse of the Pharos and the erection of the Washington Monument may have been the Torre del Mangia in Siena, Italy, which is tall, and was constructed in the first half of the fourteenth century; and the Torre degli Asinelli in Bologna, Italy, built between 1109 and 1119.

===World&#x27;s highest observation deck===

Timeline of development of world&#x27;s highest observation deck since inauguration of Eiffel Tower.

Higher observation decks have existed on mountain tops or cliffs, rather than on tall structures. The Grand Canyon Skywalk, constructed in 2007, protrudes over the west rim of the Grand Canyon and is approximately above the Colorado River, making it the highest of these types of structures.

===Timeline of guyed structures on land===
As most of the tallest structures are guyed masts, here is a timeline of world&#x27;s tallest guyed masts, since the beginning of radio technology.

As many large guyed masts were destroyed at the end of World War II, the dates for the years between 1945 and 1950 may be incorrect. If Wusung Radio Tower survived World War II, it was the tallest guyed structure shortly after World War II.

==Tallest towers==

Towers include observation towers, monuments and other structures not generally considered to be &quot;habitable buildings&quot;, they are meant for &quot;regular access by humans, but not for living in or office work, and are self-supporting or freestanding, which means no guy-wires for support&quot;, meaning it excludes from this list of continuously habitable buildings and skyscrapers as well as radio and TV masts.

Bridge towers or pylons, chimneys, transmission towers, and most large statues allow human access for maintenance, but not as part of their normal operation, and are therefore not considered to be towers. 

The Tokyo Skytree, completed in February 2012, is , making it the tallest tower, and third-tallest freestanding structure in the world.

=== History of tallest towers ===

The following is a list of structures that have historically held the title as the tallest towers in the world.
==Tallest structures, freestanding structures, and buildings==
The list categories are:
*The structures (supported) list uses pinnacle height and includes architectural structures of any type that might use some external support constructions like cables and are fully built in air. Only the three tallest are listed, as more than fifty US TV masts have stated heights of .
*The structures (media supported) list uses pinnacle height and includes architectural structures of any type that are not totally built in the air but are using support from other, denser media like salt water. All structures greater than are listed.
*The freestanding structures list uses pinnacle height and includes structures over that do not use guy-wires or other external supports. This means truly free standing on its own or, in similar sense, non-supported structures.
*The building list uses architectural height (excluding antennas) and includes only buildings, defined as consisting of habitable floors. Both of these follow CTBUH guidelines.
Notes:
*Eight buildings appear on the &quot;freestanding structures&quot; category list with heights different from another category. This is due to the different measurement specifications of those lists.
*Only current heights and, where reasonable, target heights are listed. Historical heights of structures that no longer exist, for example, for having collapsed, are excluded.

<text>Windows Media Audio (WMA) is a series of audio codecs and their corresponding audio coding formats developed by Microsoft. It is a proprietary technology that forms part of the Windows Media framework. WMA consists of four distinct codecs. The original WMA codec, known simply as &quot;WMA&quot;, was conceived as a competitor to the popular MP3 and RealAudio codecs. &quot;WMA Pro&quot;, a newer and more advanced codec, supports multichannel and high-resolution audio. A lossless codec, &quot;WMA Lossless&quot;, compresses audio data without loss of audio fidelity (the regular WMA format is lossy). &quot;WMA Voice&quot;, targeted at voice content, applies compression using a range of low bit rates. Microsoft has also developed a digital container format called Advanced Systems Format to store audio encoded by WMA.

==Development history==
The first WMA codec was based on earlier work by Henrique Malvar and his team which was transferred to the Windows Media team at Microsoft. Malvar was a senior researcher and manager of the Signal Processing Group at Microsoft Research, whose team worked on the &quot;MSAudio&quot; project. The first finalized codec was initially referred to as &quot;MSAudio 4.0&quot;. It was later officially released as &quot;Windows Media Audio&quot;, as part of Windows Media Technologies 4.0. Microsoft claimed that WMA could produce files that were half the size of equivalent-quality MP3 files; Microsoft also claimed that WMA delivered &quot;near CD-quality&quot; audio at 64 kbit/s. The former claim however was rejected by some audiophiles and both claims have been refuted through publicly-available codec listening tests. RealNetworks also challenged Microsoft&#x27;s claims regarding WMA&#x27;s superior audio quality compared to RealAudio.

Newer versions of WMA became available: &quot;Windows Media Audio 2&quot; in 1999, &quot;Windows Media Audio 7&quot; in 2000, &quot;Windows Media Audio 8&quot; in 2001, and &quot;Windows Media Audio 9&quot; in 2003. Microsoft first announced its plans to license WMA technology to third parties in 1999. Prior to Windows XP, WMA files were primarily streamed using the Windows Media Source Filter (DirectShow codec), later being removed in Windows Vista with the addition of Media Foundation. Although earlier versions of Windows Media Player played WMA files, support for WMA file creation was not added until the seventh version. In 2003, Microsoft released new audio codecs that were not compatible with the original WMA codec. These codecs were &quot;Windows Media Audio 9 Professional&quot;, &quot;Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless&quot;, and &quot;Windows Media Audio 9 Voice&quot;.

All versions of WMA released since version 9.0namely 9.1, 9.2, and 10have been backwards compatible with the original v9 decoder and are therefore not considered separate codecs. The sole exception to this is the WMA 10 Professional codec whose Low Bit Rate (LBR) mode is only backwards compatible with the older WMA Professional decoders at a half sampling rate (similar to how HE-AAC is backwards compatible with AAC-LC). Full fidelity decoding of WMA 10 Professional LBR bitstreams requires a WMA version 10 or newer decoder.

==Container format==

A WMA file is in most circumstances contained in the Advanced Systems Format (ASF), a proprietary Microsoft container format for digital audio or digital video. The ASF container format specifies how metadata about the file is to be encoded, similar to the ID3 tags used by MP3 files. Metadata may include song name, track number, artist name, and also audio normalization values. This container can optionally support digital rights management (DRM) using a combination of elliptic curve cryptography key exchange, DES block cipher, a custom block cipher, RC4 stream cipher and the SHA-1 hashing function. See Windows Media DRM for further information.

Since 2008 Microsoft has also been using WMA Professional in its Protected Interoperable File Format (PIFF) based on the ISO Base Media File Format and most commonly used for Smooth Streaming, a form of adaptive bitrate streaming over HTTP. Related industry standards such as DECE UltraViolet and MPEG-DASH have not standardized WMA as a supported audio codec, deciding in favor of the more industry-prevalent MPEG and Dolby audio codecs.

==Codecs==
Each WMA file features a single audio track in one of the four sub-formats: WMA, WMA Pro, WMA Lossless, or WMA Voice. These formats are implemented differently from one another, such that they are technically distinct and mutually incompatible; that is to say, a device or software compatible with one sub-format does not therefore automatically support any of the other codecs. Each codec is further explained below.

===Windows Media Audio===
Windows Media Audio (WMA) is the most common codec of the four WMA codecs. The colloquial usage of the term &quot;WMA&quot;, especially in marketing materials and device specifications, usually refers to this codec only. The first version of the codec released in 1999 is regarded as WMA 1. In the same year, the bit stream syntax, or compression algorithm, was altered in minor ways and became WMA 2. Since then, newer versions of the codec have been released, but the decoding process remained the same, ensuring compatibility between codec versions. WMA is a lossy audio codec based on the study of psychoacoustics. Audio signals that are deemed to be imperceptible to the human ear are encoded with reduced resolution during the compression process.

WMA can encode audio signals sampled at up to 48 kHz with up to two discrete channels (stereo). WMA 9 introduced variable bit rate (VBR) and average bit rate (ABR) coding techniques into the MS encoder although both were technically supported by the original format. WMA 9.1 also added support for low-delay audio, which reduces latency for encoding and decoding.

Fundamentally, WMA is a transform coder based on modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), somewhat similar to AAC, Cook and Vorbis. The bit stream of WMA is composed of superframes, each containing 1 or more frames of 2048 samples. If the bit reservoir is not used, a frame is equal to a superframe. Each frame contains several blocks, which are 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048 samples long after being transformed into the frequency domain via the MDCT. In the frequency domain, masking for the transformed samples is determined, and then used to requantize the samples. Finally, the floating point samples are decomposed into coefficient and exponent parts and independently huffman coded. Stereo information is typically mid/side coded. At low bit rates, line spectral pairs (typically less than 17 kbit/s) and a form of noise coding (typically less than 33 kbit/s) can also be used to improve quality.

Like AAC and Ogg Vorbis, WMA was intended to address perceived deficiencies in the MP3 standard. Given their common design goals, the three formats ended up making similar design choices. All three are pure transform codecs. Furthermore, the MDCT implementation used in WMA is essentially a superset of those used in Ogg and AAC such that WMA iMDCT and windowing routines can be used to decode AAC and Ogg Vorbis almost unmodified. However, quantization and stereo coding is handled differently in each codec. The primary distinguishing trait of the WMA Standard format is its unique use of 5 different block sizes, compared to MP3, AAC, and Ogg Vorbis which each restrict files to just two sizes. WMA Pro extends this by adding a 6th block size used at 88.2/96 kHz sampling rate.

Certified PlaysForSure devices, as well as a large number of uncertified devices, ranging from portable hand-held music players to set-top DVD players, support the playback of WMA files. Most PlaysForSure-certified online stores distribute content using this codec only. In 2005, Nokia announced its plans to support WMA playback in future Nokia handsets. In the same year, an update was made available for the PlayStation Portable (version 2.60) which allowed WMA files to be played on the device for the first time.

===Windows Media Audio Professional===

Windows Media Audio Professional (WMA Pro) is an improved lossy codec closely related to WMA standards. It retains most of the same general coding features, but also features improved entropy coding and quantization strategies as well as more efficient stereo coding. Notably, many of the WMA standard&#x27;s low bitrate features have been removed, as the core codec is designed for efficient coding at most bitrates. Its main competitors include AAC, HE-AAC, Vorbis, Dolby Digital, and DTS. It supports 16-bit and 24-bit sample bit depth, sampling rates up to 96 kHz, and up to eight discrete channels (7.1 channel surround). WMA Pro also supports dynamic range compression, which reduces the volume difference between the loudest and quietest sounds in the audio track. According to Microsoft&#x27;s Amir Majidimehr, WMA Pro could theoretically go beyond 7.1 surround sound and support &quot;an unlimited number of channels&quot;; however, Microsoft chose to limit its current capability to eight (7.1 discrete channels).

The codec&#x27;s bit stream syntax was frozen at the first version, WMA 9 Pro. Later versions of WMA Pro introduced low-bit rate encoding, low-delay audio, frequency interpolation mode, and an expanded range of sampling rate and bit-depth encoding options. A WMA 10 Pro file compressed with frequency interpolation mode comprises a WMA 9 Pro track encoded at half the original sampling rate, which is then restored using a new compression algorithm. In this situation, WMA 9 Pro players which have not been updated to the WMA 10 Pro codec can only decode the lower quality WMA 9 Pro stream. Starting with WMA 10 Pro, eight channel encoding starts at 128 kbit/s, and tracks can be encoded at the native audio CD resolution (44.1 kHz, 16-bit), previously the domain of WMA Standard.

Despite a growing number of supported devices and its superiority over WMA, WMA Pro still has little hardware and software support. Some notable exceptions to this are the Microsoft Zune (limited to stereo), Xbox 360, Windows Mobile-powered devices with Windows Media Player 10 Mobile, newer Toshiba Gigabeat and Motorola devices, and devices running recent versions of the Rockbox alternative firmware. In addition, WMA Pro is a requirement for the WMV HD certification program. On the software side, Verizon utilizes WMA 10 Pro for its V CAST Music Service, and Windows Media Player 11 has promoted the codec as an alternative to WMA for copying audio CD tracks. WMA Pro is supported in Silverlight as of version 2 (though only in stereo mode). In the absence of the appropriate audio hardware, WMA Pro can automatically downmix multichannel audio to stereo or mono, and 24-bit resolution to 16-bit during playback.

A notable example of WMA Pro being used instead of WMA Standard is the NBC Olympics website which uses WMA 10 Pro in its low-bitrate mode at 48 kbit/s.

===Windows Media Audio Lossless===
Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless is a lossless incarnation of Windows Media Audio, an audio codec by Microsoft, released in early 2003. It compresses an audio CD to a range of 206 to 411 MB, at bit rates of 470 to 940 kbit/s. The result is a bit-for-bit duplicate of the original audio file; in other words, the audio quality on the CD will be the same as the file when played back. WMA Lossless uses the same .WMA file extension as other Windows Media Audio formats. It supports 6 discrete channels and up to 24-bit/96 kHz lossless audio. The format has never been publicly documented, although an open-source decoder has been reverse-engineered for non-Microsoft platforms by the libav and ffmpeg projects.

Windows Media Audio Lossless (WMA Lossless) is a lossless audio codec that competes with ATRAC Advanced Lossless, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, Shorten, Monkey&#x27;s Audio, FLAC, Apple Lossless, and WavPack (Since late 2011, the last three have the advantage of being open source software and available for nearly any operating system.) Designed for archival purposes, it compresses audio signals without loss of quality from the original using VBR. When decompressed, the audio signal is an exact replica of the original. The first version of the codec, WMA 9 Lossless, and its revisions support up to 96 kHz, 24-bit audio for up to 6 discrete channels (5.1 channel surround) with dynamic range compression control. The typical compression ratio for music varies between 1.7:1 and 3:1.

Hardware support for the codec is available on the Cowon A3, Cowon S9, Bang &amp; Olufsen Serenata Sony Walkman NWZ-A and NWZ-S series, Zune 4, 8, 80 30, Zune 120 (with firmware version 2.2 or later) and the Zune HD, Xbox 360, Windows Mobile-powered devices with Windows Media Player 10 Mobile, Windows Phone (version 8 and above), Toshiba Gigabeat S and V models, Toshiba T-400, the Meizu M3, and Best Buy&#x27;s Insignia NS-DV, Pilot, and Sport music players. The Logitech Squeezebox Touch now supports the format natively despite previously only supporting it via transcoding. Like WMA Standard, WMA Lossless is being used by a few online stores to distribute music online. Similar to WMA Pro, the WMA Lossless decoder can perform downmixing when capable audio hardware is not present. As of 2012, the ffmpeg and libav projects have open source WMA Lossless decoders based on reverse engineering of the official decoder. Only 16-bit WMA files can be successfully decoded by ffmpeg as of June 20, 2012.

===Windows Media Audio Voice===
Windows Media Audio Voice (WMA Voice) is a lossy audio codec that competes with Speex (used in Microsoft&#x27;s own Xbox Live online service), ACELP, and other codecs. Designed for low-bandwidth, voice playback applications, it employs low-pass and high-pass filtering of sound outside the human speech frequency range to achieve higher compression efficiency than WMA. It can automatically detect sections of an audio track containing both voice and music and use the standard WMA compression algorithm instead. WMA Voice supports up to 22.05 kHz for a single channel (mono) only. Encoding is limited to constant bit rate (CBR) and up to 20 kbit/s. The first and only version of the codec is WMA 9 Voice.

Windows Mobile-powered devices with Windows Media Player 10 Mobile have native support for WMA 9 Voice playback. In addition, BBC World Service has employed WMA Voice for its Internet radio streaming service.

==Sound quality==
:&quot;See codec listening test for a table of double-blind listening test results.&quot;

Microsoft claims that audio encoded with WMA sounds better than MP3 at the same bit rate; Microsoft also claims that audio encoded with WMA at lower bit rates sound better than MP3 at higher bit rates. Double blind listening tests with other lossy audio codecs have shown varying results, from failure to support Microsoft&#x27;s claims about its superior quality to supremacy over other codecs. One independent test conducted in May 2004 at 128 kbit/s showed that WMA was roughly equivalent to LAME MP3; inferior to AAC and Vorbis; and superior to ATRAC3 (software version).

Some studies concluded:
*At 32 kbit/s, WMA Standard was noticeably better than LAME MP3, but not better than other modern codecs in a collective, independent test in July 2004.
*At 48 kbit/s , WMA 10 Pro was ranked second after Nero HE-AAC and better than WMA 9.2 in an independent listening test organized and supported by Sebastian Mares and Hydrogenaudio Forums in December 2006. This test, however, used CBR for WMA 10 Pro and VBR for the other codecs.
*At 64 kbit/s, WMA Pro outperformed Nero HE-AAC in a listening test commissioned by Microsoft but independently performed by the National Software Testing Labs in 1999. Out of 300 participants, &quot;71% of all listeners indicated that WMA Pro was equal to or better than HE AAC.&quot; However, a September 2003 public listening test conducted by Roberto Amorim found that listeners preferred 128 kbit/s MP3 to 64 kbit/s WMA audio with greater than 99% confidence.
*At 80 kbit/s and 96 kbit/s, WMA had lower quality than HE-AAC, AAC-LC, and Vorbis; near-equivalent quality to MP3, and better quality than MPC in individual tests done in 2005.
*At 128 kbit/s, there was a four-way tie between aoTuV Vorbis, LAME MP3, WMA 9 Pro and AAC in a large scale test in January 2006, with each codec sounding close to the uncompressed music file for most listeners.
*At 768 kbit/s, WMA 9 Pro delivered full-spectrum response at half the bit rate required for DTS in a comparative test done by EDN in October 2003. The test sample was a 48 kHz, 5.1 channel surround audio track.

===Criticism of claimed quality===
Microsoft&#x27;s claims of WMA sound quality have frequently drawn complaints. &quot;Some audiophiles challenge Microsoft&#x27;s claims regarding WMA&#x27;s quality&quot;, according to a published article from EDN. Another article from MP3 Developments wrote that Microsoft&#x27;s claim about CD-quality audio at 64 kbit/s with WMA was &quot;very far from the truth&quot;. At the early stages of WMA&#x27;s development, a representative from RealNetworks claimed that WMA was a &quot;clear and futile effort by Microsoft to catch up with RealAudio 8&quot;.

Microsoft has sometimes claimed that the sound quality of WMA at 64 kbit/s equals or exceeds that of MP3 at 128 kbit/s (both WMA and MP3 are considered near-transparent at 192 kbit/s by most listeners). In a 1999 study funded by Microsoft, National Software Testing Laboratories (NSTL) found that listeners preferred WMA at 64 kbit/s to MP3 at 128 kbit/s (as encoded by MusicMatch Jukebox). 

Both MP3 and WMA encoders have undergone active development and improvement for many years, so their relative quality may change over time.

Apart from Windows Media Player, most of the WMA compression formats can be played using ALLPlayer, VLC media player, Media Player Classic, MPlayer, RealPlayer, Winamp, Zune Software (with certain limitations—DSP plugin support and DirectSound output is disabled using the default WMA plugin), and many other software media players. The Microsoft Zune media management software supports most WMA codecs, but uses a variation of Windows Media DRM which is used by PlaysForSure.

The FFmpeg project has reverse-engineered and re-implemented the WMA codecs to allow their use on POSIX-compliant operating systems such as Linux. The Rockbox project further extended this codec to be suitable for embedded cores, allowing playback on portable MP3 players and cell phones running open source software. RealNetworks has announced plans to support playback of DRM-free WMA files in RealPlayer for Linux. On the Macintosh platform, Microsoft released a PowerPC version of Windows Media Player for Mac OS X in 2003, but further development of the software has ceased. Microsoft currently endorses the third-party Flip4Mac WMA, a QuickTime component that allows Macintosh users to play WMA files in any player that uses the QuickTime framework. Flip4Mac, however, does not currently support the Windows Media Audio Voice codec.

The core Android platform does not itself support WMA, but there is third-party WMA software for Android devices.

WMA format can be played on almost all Windows Mobile and later Windows Phone devices.

==Encoders==
There are many proprietary and open source software packages that can export audio in WMA format, including amongst many others Windows Media Player, Windows Movie Maker, Microsoft Expression Encoder, Sony Sound Forge, GOM Player, RealPlayer, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition, Adobe Soundbooth, and VLC media player. Microsoft Office OneNote supports encoding in all WMA codecs, and Windows Media Encoder supports all available bit rate and resolution options as well.

==Digital rights management==

The WMA codecs are most often used with the ASF container format, which has an optional DRM facility. Windows Media DRM, which can be used in conjunction with WMA, supports time-limited music subscription services such as those offered by unlimited download services, including MTV&#x27;s URGE, Napster, Rhapsody, Yahoo! Music Unlimited, and Virgin Digital. Windows Media DRM, a component of PlaysForSure and Windows Media Connect, is supported on many modern portable audio devices and streaming media clients such as Roku, SoundBridge, Xbox 360, and Wii. Players that support the WMA format but not Windows Media DRM cannot play DRM-protected files.

<doc id="34085" wikidata="Q14334" url="?curid=34085" title="Wolverine">
<text>The wolverine ( , ; Gulo gulo), also called the carcajou or quickhatch (from East Cree, &quot;kwiihkwahaacheew&quot;), is the largest land-dwelling member of the family Mustelidae. It is a muscular carnivore and a solitary animal. The wolverine has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey many times larger than itself.

The wolverine is found primarily in remote reaches of the Northern boreal forests and subarctic and alpine tundra of the Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest numbers in Northern Canada, the U.S. state of Alaska, the mainland Nordic countries of Europe, and throughout western Russia and Siberia. Its population has steadily declined since the 19th century owing to trapping, range reduction and habitat fragmentation. The wolverine is now essentially absent from the southern end of its range in both Europe and North America.

==Naming==
The wolverine&#x27;s questionable reputation as an insatiable glutton (reflected in its Latin genus name &quot;Gulo&quot;, meaning &quot;glutton&quot;) may be in part due to a false etymology. The less common name for the animal in Norwegian, &quot;fjellfross&quot;, meaning &quot;mountain cat&quot;, is thought to have worked its way into German as &quot;Vielfraß&quot;, which means &quot;glutton&quot; (literally &quot;devours much&quot;). Its name in other West Germanic languages is similar (e.g. ).

The Finnish name is &quot;ahma&quot;, derived from &quot;ahmatti,&quot; which is translated as &quot;glutton&quot;. Similarly, the Estonian name is &quot;ahm&quot;, with the equivalent meaning to the Finnish name. In Lithuanian, it is &quot;ernis&quot;; in Latvian, &quot;tinis&quot; or &quot;āmrija&quot;.

The Eastern Slavic росомаха (&quot;rosomakha&quot;) and the Polish and Czech name &quot;rosomák&quot; seem to be borrowed from the Finnish &quot;rasva-maha&quot; (fat belly). Similarly, the Hungarian name is &quot;rozsomák&quot; or &quot;torkosborz&quot; which means &quot;gluttonous badger&quot;.

In French-speaking parts of Canada, the wolverine is referred to as &quot;carcajou&quot;, borrowed from the Innu-aimun or Montagnais &quot;kuàkuàtsheu&quot;. However, in France, the wolverine&#x27;s name is &quot;glouton&quot; (glutton).

Purported gluttony is reflected neither in the English name &quot;wolverine&quot; nor in the names used in North Germanic languages. The English word wolverine (alteration of the earlier form, wolvering, of uncertain origin) probably implies &quot;a little wolf&quot;. The name in Proto-Norse, &quot;erafaz&quot; and Old Norse, &quot;jarfr&quot;, lives on in the regular Icelandic name &quot;jarfi&quot;, regular Norwegian name &quot;jerv&quot;, regular Swedish name &quot;järv&quot; and regular Danish name &quot;jærv&quot;.

==Taxonomy and evolutionary history==
===Classification===

Genetic evidence suggests that the wolverine is most closely related to the tayra and martens, all of which shared a Eurasian ancestor.

There are two subspecies: the Old World form, &quot;Gulo gulo gulo&quot;, and the New World form, &quot;G. g. luscus&quot;. Some authors had described as many as four additional North American subspecies, including ones limited to Vancouver Island (&quot;G. g. vancouverensis&quot;) and the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska (&quot;G. g. katschemakensis&quot;). However, the most currently accepted taxonomy recognizes either the two continental subspecies or &quot;G. gulo&quot; as a single Holarctic taxon.

===Evolution===

Recently compiled genetic evidence suggests most of North America&#x27;s wolverines are descended from a single source, likely originating from Beringia during the last glaciation and rapidly expanding thereafter, though considerable uncertainty to this conclusion is due to the difficulty of collecting samples in the extremely depleted southern extent of the range.

==Physical characteristics==
Anatomically, the wolverine is an elongated animal that is low to the ground. With strong limbs, broad and rounded head, small eyes and short rounded ears, it most closely resembles a large fisher. Though its legs are short, its large, five-toed paws with crampon-like claws and plantigrade posture enable it to climb up and over steep cliffs, trees and snow-covered peaks with relative ease.

The adult wolverine is about the size of a medium dog, with a body length ranging from ; standing at the shoulder; and a tail length of . Weight is usually in males, and in females . Exceptionally large males of as much as are referenced in Soviet literature, though such weights are deemed in &quot;Mammals of the Soviet Union&quot; to be improbable. The males are often 10–15% larger than the females in linear measurements and can be 30–40% greater in weight. According to some sources, Eurasian wolverines are claimed to be larger and heavier than those in North America, with weights of up to . However, this may refer more specifically to areas such as Siberia, as data from Fennoscandian wolverines shows they are typically around the same size as their American counterparts. It is the largest of terrestrial mustelids; only the marine-dwelling sea otter, the giant otter of the Amazon basin and the semi-aquatic African clawless otter are larger—while the European badger may reach a similar body mass, especially in autumn.

Wolverines have thick, dark, oily fur which is highly hydrophobic, making it resistant to frost. This has led to its traditional popularity among hunters and trappers as a lining in jackets and parkas in Arctic conditions. A light-silvery facial mask is distinct in some individuals, and a pale buff stripe runs laterally from the shoulders along the side and crossing the rump just above a bushy tail. Some individuals display prominent white hair patches on their throats or chests.

Like many other mustelids, it has potent anal scent glands used for marking territory and sexual signaling. The pungent odor has given rise to the nicknames &quot;skunk bear&quot; and &quot;nasty cat.&quot; The anal gland secretion for the samples obtained from six animal&#x27;s secretion was complex and variable: 123 compounds were detected in total, with the number per animal ranging from 45 to 71 compounds. Only six compounds were common to all extracts: 3-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, phenylacetic acid, alpha-tocopherol, cholesterol, and a compound tentatively identified as 2-methyldecanoic acid. The highly odoriferous thietanes and dithiolanes found in anal gland secretions of some members of the Mustelinae [ferrets, mink, stoats, and weasels (Mustela spp.) and zorillas (Ictonyx spp.)] were not observed. The composition of the wolverine&#x27;s anal gland secretion is similar to that of two other members of the Mustelinae, the pine and beech marten (Martes spp.)

Wolverines, like other mustelids, possess a special upper molar in the back of the mouth that is rotated 90 degrees, towards the inside of the mouth. This special characteristic allows wolverines to tear off meat from prey or carrion that has been frozen solid.

==Distribution==

Wolverines live primarily in isolated arctic, boreal, and alpine regions of northern Canada, Alaska, Siberia, and Fennoscandia; they are also native to European Russia, the Baltic countries, the Russian Far East, northeast China and Mongolia.

Wolverine remains have been found in Ukraine, but they are extirpated there today and it is unclear whether the wolverines would have formed sustainable populations.

Unique records of encounters with wolverines have been noted in Latvia, the most recent one being in late July 2022 (although it can be disputed because of the unclear footage); the population was widespread in the 16th and 17th centuries, but nowadays it is not native to the area.

Most New World wolverines live in Canada and Alaska. However, wolverines were once recorded as also being present in Colorado, areas of the southwestern United States (Arizona and New Mexico), the Midwest (Indiana, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Ohio, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), New England (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts) and in New York and Pennsylvania.

In the Sierra Nevada, wolverines were sighted near Winnemucca Lake in spring 1995 and at Toe Jam Lake north of the Yosemite border in 1996; and later photographed by baited cameras, including in 2008 and 2009, near Lake Tahoe. According to a 2014 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service publication, &quot;wolverines are found in the North Cascades in Washington and the Northern Rocky Mountains in Idaho, Montana, Oregon (Wallowa Range), and Wyoming. Individual wolverines have also moved into historic range in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and the Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado, but have not established breeding populations in these areas&quot;. In 2022, Colorado Parks and Wildlife considered plans to reintroduce the wolverine to the state.

Wolverines are also found in Utah but are very rarely seen, with only six confirmed sightings since the first confirmed sighting in 1979. Three of these six confirmed Utah sightings have been caught on video. A wolverine, a male, was finally captured and tagged in Utah in 2022 before being released back into the wild to better understand the animal&#x27;s range.

In August 2020, the National Park Service reported that wolverines had been sighted at Mount Rainier, Washington, for the first time in more than a century. The sighting was of a reproductive female and her two offspring.

In 2004, the first confirmed sighting of a wolverine in Michigan since the early 19th century took place, when a Michigan Department of Natural Resources wildlife biologist photographed a wolverine in Ubly, Michigan. The specimen was found dead at the Minden City State Game Area in Sanilac County, Michigan in 2010.

==Behavior and ecology==
=== Diet and hunting ===
Wolverines are primarily scavengers. Most of their food is carrion, especially in winter and early spring. They may find carrion themselves, feed on it after the predator (often, a wolf pack) has finished, or simply take it from another predator. Wolverines are known to follow wolf and lynx trails to scavenge the remains of their kills. Whether eating live prey or carrion, the wolverine&#x27;s feeding style appears voracious, leading to the nickname of &quot;glutton&quot; (also the basis of the scientific name). However, this feeding style is believed to be an adaptation to food scarcity, especially in winter.

The wolverine is also a powerful and versatile predator. Its prey mainly consists of small to medium-sized mammals, but wolverines have been recorded killing prey many times larger than itself, such as adult deer. Prey species include porcupines, squirrels, chipmunks, beavers, marmots, moles, gophers, rabbits, voles, mice, rats, shrews, lemmings, caribou, roe deer, white-tailed deer, mule deer, sheep, goats, cattle, bison, moose, and elk. Smaller predators are occasionally preyed on, including martens, mink, foxes, Eurasian lynx, weasels, coyote, and wolf pups. Wolverines have also been known to kill Canada lynx in the Yukon of Canada. Wolverines often pursue live prey that are relatively easy to obtain, including animals caught in traps, newborn mammals, and deer (including adult moose and elk) when they are weakened by winter or immobilized by heavy snow. Their diets are sometimes supplemented by birds&#x27; eggs, birds (especially geese), roots, seeds, insect larvae, and berries. Adult wolverines appear to be one of the few conspecific mammal carnivores to actively pose a threat to golden eagles. Wolverines were observed to prey on nestling golden eagles in Denali National Park. During incubation in Northern Sweden, an incubating adult golden eagle was killed in its nest by a wolverine.

Wolverines inhabiting the Old World (specifically, Fennoscandia) hunt more actively than their North American relatives. This may be because competing predator populations in Eurasia are less dense, making it more practical for the wolverine to hunt for itself than to wait for another animal to make a kill and then try to snatch it. They often feed on carrion left by wolves, so changes in wolf populations may affect the population of wolverines. They are also known on occasion to eat plant material.

Wolverines often cache their food during times of plenty. This is of particular importance to lactating females in the winter and early spring, a time when food is scarce.

===Reproduction===
Wolverines are induced ovulators. Successful males will form lifetime relationships with two or three females, which they will visit occasionally, while other males are left without a mate. Mating season is in the summer, but the actual implantation of the embryo (blastocyst) in the uterus is stayed until early winter, delaying the development of the fetus. Females will often not produce young if food is scarce. The gestation period is 30–50 days, and litters of typically two or three young (&quot;kits&quot;) are born in the spring. Kits develop rapidly, reaching adult size within the first year. The typical longevity of a wolverine in captivity is around 15 to 17 years, but in the wild the average lifespan is more likely between 8 and 10 years. Fathers make visits to their offspring until they are weaned at 10 weeks of age; also, once the young are about six months old, some reconnect with their fathers and travel together for a time.

===Interspecies interactions===
Wolves, American black bears, brown bears and cougars are capable of killing adult wolverines, while smaller predators (like golden eagles) can kill young and inexperienced individuals. Wolves are thought to be the wolverine&#x27;s most important natural predator, with the arrival of wolves to a wolverine&#x27;s territory presumably leading the latter to abandon the area. Armed with powerful jaws, sharp claws, and a thick hide, wolverines, like most mustelids, are remarkably strong for their size. They may defend against larger or more numerous predators such as wolves or bears. By far, their most serious predator is the grey wolf, with an extensive record of wolverine fatalities attributed to wolves in both North America and Eurasia. In North America, another predator (less frequent) is the cougar. At least one account reported a wolverine&#x27;s apparent attempt to steal a kill from a black bear, although the bear won what was ultimately a fatal contest for the wolverine. There are a few accounts of brown bears killing and consuming wolverines as well and, although also reported at times to be chased off prey, in some areas such as Denali National Park, wolverines seemed to try to actively avoid encounters with grizzly bears as they have been reported in areas where wolves start hunting them.

===Urine scent marking===

Wolverines have been observed to use urine as a scent-marking behavior. Headspace analysis of the volatiles emanating from urine samples identified 19 potential semiochemicals. The major classes of identified chemicals are the ketones: 2-heptanone, 4-heptanone and 4-nonanone and the monoterpenes: alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, linalool and geraniol. In other mammals, the excretion of these terpenes is unusual. The conifer needles that are found in wolverine scat are likely the source of these monoterpenes.

==Threats and conservation==
The world&#x27;s total wolverine population is not known. The animal exhibits a low population density and requires a very large home range. The wolverine is listed by the IUCN as Least Concern because of its &quot;wide distribution, remaining large populations, and the unlikelihood that it is in decline at a rate fast enough to trigger even Near Threatened&quot;.

The range of a male wolverine can be more than , encompassing the ranges of several females which have smaller home ranges of roughly 130–260 km2 (50–100 mi2). Adult wolverines try for the most part to keep nonoverlapping ranges with adults of the same sex. Radio tracking suggests an animal can range hundreds of miles in a few months.

Female wolverines burrow into snow in February to create a den, which is used until weaning in mid-May. Areas inhabited nonseasonally by wolverines are thus restricted to zones with late-spring snowmelts. This fact has led to concern that global warming will shrink the ranges of wolverine populations.

This requirement for large territories brings wolverines into conflict with human development, and hunting and trapping further reduce their numbers, causing them to disappear from large parts of their former range; attempts to have them declared an endangered species have met with little success. In February 2013, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed giving Endangered Species Act protections to the wolverine due to its winter habitat in the northern Rockies diminishing. This was as a result of a lawsuit brought by the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife. In November 2023, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it was adding the wolverine in the United States Lower 48 states to the threatened list.

The Wildlife Conservation Society reported in June 2009 that a wolverine researchers had been tracking for almost three months had crossed into northern Colorado. Society officials had tagged the young male wolverine in Wyoming near Grand Teton National Park, and it had traveled southward for about . It was the first wolverine seen in Colorado since 1919, and its appearance was also confirmed by the Colorado Division of Wildlife. In May 2016 the same wolverine was killed by a cattle ranch-hand in North Dakota, ending a greater-than- trip by this lone male wolverine, dubbed M-56. This was the first verified sighting of a Wolverine in North Dakota in 150 years. In February 2014, a wolverine was seen in Utah, the first confirmed sighting in that state in 30 years.
===In captivity===
Around a hundred wolverines are held in zoos across North America and Europe, and they have been bred in captivity, but only with difficulty and high infant mortality.

==Human interactions==
Many North American cities, sports teams, and organizations use the wolverine as a mascot. For example, the US state of Michigan is, by tradition, known as &quot;the Wolverine State&quot;, and the University of Michigan takes the animal as its mascot. There have also been professional baseball and football clubs called the &quot;Wolverines&quot;. The association is well and long established: for example, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and George Armstrong Custer, who led the Michigan Brigade, called them the &quot;Wolverines&quot;. The origins of this association are obscure; it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in Sault Ste. Marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the vicious mammal. Wolverines are, however, extremely rare in Michigan. A sighting in February 2004 near Ubly was the first confirmed sighting in Michigan in 200 years. The animal was found dead in 2010.

The Marvel Comics superhero James &quot;Logan&quot; Howlett was given the nickname &quot;Wolverine&quot; while cage fighting because of his skill, short stature, keen animal senses, ferocity, and most notably, claws that retract from both sets of knuckles.

The wolverine is prevalent in stories and oral history from various Algonquian tribes and figures prominently in the mythology of the Innu people of eastern Quebec and Labrador. The wolverine is known as Kuekuatsheu, a conniving trickster who created the world. The story of the formation of the Innu world begins long ago when Kuekuatsheu built a big boat similar to Noah&#x27;s Ark and put all the various animal species in it. There was a great deal of rain, and the land was flooded. Kuekuatsheu told a mink to dive into the water to retrieve some mud and rocks which he mixed together to create an island, which is the world that is presently inhabited along with all the animals. Many tales of Kuekuatsheu are often humorous and irreverent and include crude references to bodily functions. Some Northeastern tribes, such as the Miꞌkmaq and Passamaquoddy, refer to the wolverine as Lox, who usually appears in tales as a trickster and thief (although generally more dangerous than its Innu counterpart) and is often depicted as a companion to the wolf. Similarly, the Dené, a group of the Athabaskan-speaking natives of northwestern Canada, have many stories of the wolverine as a trickster and cultural transformer much like the coyote in the Navajo tradition or raven in Northwest Coast traditions.

<text>A warlock is a male practitioner of witchcraft.

==Etymology and terminology==
The most commonly accepted etymology derives &quot;&quot; from the Old English &quot;&quot;, which meant &quot;breaker of oaths&quot; or &quot;deceiver&quot;. The term came to apply specially to the devil around 1000 AD. In early modern Scots, the word came to refer to the male equivalent of a &quot;witch&quot; (which can be male or female, but has historically been used predominantly for females). The term may have become associated in Scotland with male witches owing to the idea that they had made pacts with Auld Hornie (the devil) and thus had betrayed the Christian faith and broke their baptismal vows or oaths. From this use, the word passed into Romantic literature and ultimately into 20th-century popular culture. A derivation from the Old Norse &quot;varð-lokkur&quot;, &quot;caller of spirits&quot;, has also been suggested, but the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary &quot; considers this implausible owing to the extreme rarity of the Norse word and because forms without hard &quot;-k&quot;, which are consistent with the Old English etymology (&quot;traitor&quot;), are attested earlier than forms with a &quot;-k&quot;. 

==History==
Although most victims of the witch trials in early modern Scotland were women, some men were executed as warlocks.

In his day, the Scottish mathematician John Napier (1550–1617) was often perceived as a warlock or magician because of his interests in divination and the occult, though his establishment position likely kept him from being prosecuted.

<text>The Western Bulldogs are a professional Australian rules football club based in Footscray, a suburb of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. The club competes in the Australian Football League (AFL), the sport&#x27;s premier competition.

Originally named the Footscray Football Club the club cites a foundation year of 1877, and it adopted the name of the local borough. The club won nine premierships in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) before gaining admission to the Victorian Football League (which became the AFL in 1990) in 1925. The club has won two VFL/AFL premierships, in 1954 and 2016 and was runner-up in 1961 and 2021.

The club has developed a strong support base to the west of the city, traditionally a working-class area. Docklands Stadium, in the city&#x27;s inner-west, has served as the club&#x27;s home ground since 2000, while its headquarters and training facilities are at its traditional home ground, the Whitten Oval. The club also plays home games at Mars Stadium in the city of Ballarat west of Melbourne. The Western Bulldogs guernsey features two thick horizontal hoops—one red and one white—on a royal blue background. Fourteen players from the club are members of the Australian Football Hall of Fame, including inaugural inductee and Legend Ted Whitten. Marcus Bontempelli and Luke Beveridge serve as the club&#x27;s current captain and head coach respectively.

At the end of 1996, as part of a broader rebranding scheme, the club changed its name from Footscray to Western Bulldogs. The club has fielded a side in AFL Women&#x27;s since the competition&#x27;s 2017 inception, winning a premiership in 2018, and also has a reserves side in the Victorian Football League and VFL Women&#x27;s League.

==History==

===1877–1880s: Origins===
Newspapers record Australian rules football being played in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray in the mid-1870s, with several teams playing in and being called Footscray. The area&#x27;s main football ground was located between Napier, Bunbury and Hyde Streets in Lower Footscray. A stronger club named Footscray emerged in the area during the late 1870s. However there are few historical records and no records of its formation. No definitive documented connection has been established between the early clubs and the modern club. As such some club historians believe this club was established in 1876 though the official date is cited as 1877. Both dates of formation have been challenged by historians. Early matches weren&#x27;t played against any of the large Melbourne clubs and Footscray was thus classified as a &quot;junior&quot; club, playing mostly against teams from nearby Williamstown.

===1880s–1924: VFA years and Championship of Victoria===

Initially the club played at the Northern Reserve, also known as the Market Reserve located between Barkly Street and Geelong Road. In 1880, the club changed its name to the Prince Imperials in honour of Napoléon, Prince Imperial, the heir to French throne, who had recently died in battle. The club was initially based in a park in Lower Footscray. The name change coincided with a lack of support and players, with a meeting to discuss the future of the club held in June 1881. The members present voted to continue the club, although player availability continued to be an issue, with club chairman Charlie Lovett claiming in his memoirs that the name had left many not knowing that they were a club from Footscray. The club would revert to Footscray in April 1882, adopting the name of the local borough during the annual general meeting. The club began using the Western Oval and in 1886 was granted permanent use of the Western Oval by the City of Footscray. Footscray gained admission to the Victorian Football Association (VFA) after amalgamating with the Footscray Cricket Club to form a senior football club. The club tended to struggle over the next decade, occupying the lower rungs of the VFA ladder.

The club began to improve after the VFL breakaway of 1896, finishing on top of the VFA ladder in 1898, 1899 and 1900. As no finals were played, Footscray were declared premiers. The club played in and won its first finals match in 1903, against , the minor premiers, but lost the follow-up finals match to . After losing to West Melbourne in the 1906 VFA Grand Final, the club won its first premiership by defeating Brunswick in 1908. Another premiership followed in 1913.
The club entered two years of recess during World War I and returned in 1918. Still rebuilding, the club won the wooden spoon. From bottom to top in one year, 1919 saw the club win the premiership, and again in 1920. The club went back-to-back in 1923 and 1924.

The 1924 premiership would be Footscray&#x27;s last in the VFA. After the 1924 season, the club challenged the premiers of the VFL, Essendon, to a charity match, otherwise known as the Championship of Victoria, for the benefit of opera singer Dame Nellie Melba&#x27;s Limbless Soldiers&#x27; Appeal. Footscray recorded an upset victory, winning by 28 points. The win was a significant factor in Footscray gaining admission to the VFL.

===1925–1940s: Joining the VFL===

In 1919, there were nine clubs competing in the VFL, due to the return of all the foundation teams plus Richmond after World War I, as well as University Football Club deciding not to rejoin the VFL. This caused one team to be idle every Saturday and the VFL was keen to do away with this bye each week. On the night of 9 January 1925, a committee meeting of the VFL, chaired by Reg Hunt of Carlton, decided to expand the league from nine clubs to twelve. It was decided in the meeting to admit Footscray, along with two other VFA clubs, and .

Footscray played their first VFL match against on Saturday 2 May at the Brunswick Street Oval in front of 28,000 spectators. Former star George Bayliss had the honour of kicking Footscray&#x27;s first VFL goal, and although they ended up losing by nine points against an experienced league side, they earned great respect. Future Brownlow medallist Allan Hopkins was regarded as Footscray&#x27;s best player that day. The following week, playing their first VFL home game at the Western Oval against a strong team, the Tricolours recorded their first VFL victory by 10 points in front of 25,000 spectators with a strong team effort.

Footscray adapted relatively quickly to the standard of VFL football despite losing some of their VFA stars, and by 1928 were already a contender for the finals, missing only on percentage in 1931. Though they slipped to eleventh place in 1930, 1935 and 1937, in 1938 they became the first of the new clubs to reach the finals. They fell back drastically in 1939, but played better during the war-torn 1940s, winning their first nine games in 1946.

===1950–1954: First VFL flag===
Between 1938 and 1951, Footscray failed to win any finals matches, losing all six of its semi-final appearances. In 1953, however, the club set a record by conceding only 959 points in the home-and-away season due to a powerful defence featuring Dave Bryden, Wally Donald, Herb Henderson and Jim Gallagher. Footscray finally won its first semi-final, against Essendon, but lost the preliminary final to , a key factor being the absence of star full-forward Jack Collins, who had been suspended for four matches at the end of the home-and-away season.

The Bulldogs went into the 1954 VFL season as premiership contenders. However, the season did not start well with losses and , both of which finished in the bottom four the previous season. In the following two matches, against and , the club returned to form with Jack Collins booting eight and nine goals respectively to help propel the Bulldogs to victory. In Round 7 against at Glenferrie Oval, Footscray, led by Don Ross after Whitten injured his shoulder, came from 23 points down at the last break to kick seven goals and win by nine points. With Richmond upsetting at Victoria Park that same day, the Bulldogs went to the top of the ladder, where they would stay until Round 11, when they lost to Collingwood by ten points in a top-of-the-ladder clash at Victoria Park. Took out their first VFL premiership, beating Geelong and then in the 1954 VFL Grand Final.

===1955–1960s: Gradual decline===
Footscray failed to capitalise on their premiership success, falling off in the latter part of the decade and finishing with their first wooden spoon in 1959.

The 1960s started promisingly, with the club bouncing back to reach the 1961 Grand Final, where they faced who were in their first Grand Final. This was the first VFL Grand Final not to feature any of the foundation teams. In front of over 107,000 spectators, the Bulldogs worked their way to an eight-point lead at half-time, but were clearly struggling with the physicality of their hardened opponents. Rover Merv Hobbs recalled eight players needing first aid, while ruckman John Schultz remembered: &quot;The selectors looked around and could see we were in a bad way. In those days, strange to realise, we didn&#x27;t hydrate. We were told not to drink too much in case we got cramps. We just ran out of legs. And Hawthorn were brutal. They made every contest a physical clash. They wore us down.&quot; In the second half, the Hawks, led by centreman Brendan Edwards, pulled away from the tiring Bulldogs, kicking ten goals to two to take out their first VFL premiership. This was followed by winning the 1963 and 1964 night premierships, although this success was not transferred into the season proper. The rest of the decade was a bleak era for the club, particularly between 1965 and 1969, when they finished in the bottom three every year.

===1970s===

Ted Whitten Snr. retired as a player in 1970 and held the record for the most VFL games played at the time (321 games); he would continue in a coaching capacity until the end of 1971. The club was relatively strong in the 1970s, but did not win a final; by decade&#x27;s end they were back near the bottom.

The main stars of the decade included Gary Dempsey, the heroic ruckman who was badly burnt in Lara bushfire of January 1969 but managed to take out the game&#x27;s top individual award, the Brownlow Medal, in 1975. Promising South Australian import Neil Sachse had his neck broken in a freak accident while playing against Fitzroy at the Western Oval. He was left quadriplegic.
In 1978, Kelvin Templeton became the first Bulldogs player to kick 100 goals in a season, including a club record of 15.9 in Round 13 against St Kilda.

===1980s ===
After muddling its way through a disappointing decade, having to sell many of its key players to survive, the Bulldogs would endure another tumultuous decade in the 1980s. To try and improve the club&#x27;s fortunes, the committee appointed former Richmond champion Royce Hart as coach for the 1980 VFL season. Things hit an all-time low in 1982; the Bulldogs lost their opening round match to by 109 points and by the middle of the season, with only one win in 12 games and having lost the last eight matches, Hart was sacked and replaced with player Ian Hampshire, who promptly quit his playing duties. One of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary season was the performance of Western Australian recruit Simon Beasley, who kicked 82 goals for the season and proved himself one of the best full-forwards in the competition. He would go on to become the Bulldogs&#x27; record goalkicker.

Mick Malthouse was appointed senior coach in 1984, and a dramatic improvement saw them rise to second position in 1985 before a ten-point loss in the preliminary finals against Hawthorn. The club boasted a list of top players at this time, with Beasley, Doug Hawkins, Brian Royal, Rick Kennedy, Stephen Wallis, Peter Foster, Michael McLean, Jim Edmond, Andrew Purser, Stephen MacPherson and Brad Hardie.

The debt ridden club in 1986 was considered by the VFL extremely likely to fold if not for the lifeline provided by the VFL granting licenses to Brisbane and Perth.

Things didn&#x27;t bode well for the Bulldogs early in the 1987 VFL season. Hardie and Edmond had moved to the newly formed , while Hawkins&#x27; return from his knee injury was still some time away. By Round 3 they were sitting on the bottom of the ladder after heavy losses to Essendon, and . Footscray&#x27;s revival started when, in one of the upsets of the season, they defeated the reigning premiers Hawthorn by 41 points in a display characterised by teamwork and desperation. A seven-match winning streak mid-season saw them back in the Top Five. However, they just missed out on the finals when Melbourne defeated them in the last round in front of a record crowd at their home ground.

====1989: Proposed merger and fightback====
Discontent between players, officials and fans reached an all-time low during the 1989 VFL season. Club president Barrie Beattie was replaced by former Footscray board member, businessman and prominent racing personality Nick Columb in March. Things started promisingly with a 59-point win over a dispirited Carlton at Princes Park, with recruit John Georgiades kicking eight goals on debut. However, it proved to be a false dawn; the Bulldogs would only win five more games for the season, with one draw, to finish 13th. The prevailing mood was best captured in Footscray&#x27;s last win of the season in Round 20 against eventual wooden-spooners ; although the Bulldogs won by 78 points, a meagre crowd of 8,673 turned up to what many believed at the time would be Footscray&#x27;s last home game at the Western Oval. &quot;Age&quot; journalist Garry Linnell wrote: &quot;But saddest of all is that the suburb of Footscray has turned its back on the Western Oval and its football team. Without that support, one of the last remaining monuments to the days when Victorian football was a battle of suburban tribes has hit the dust.&quot;
Faced with the prospect of running a club with declining membership and sponsorship, Columb learned that Footscray&#x27;s debt situation was poor, and it reached the point when the VFL looked likely to appoint an administrator to wind up the club&#x27;s affairs at the end of the year. He decided the best way forward was a merger with , which was also in a weak financial position, although was not facing immediate bankruptcy. The two clubs announced a merger to form the Fitzroy Bulldogs, but the merger was derailed when the people of Footscray, led by lawyer Peter Gordon and a host of others, rallied to raise funds to pay off the club&#x27;s debts. In further developments, former club player Terry Wheeler was named as Malthouse&#x27;s replacement as senior coach, while champion veteran wingman Doug Hawkins was appointed captain. While Columb was branded by some as the villain of the story, the wisdom of hindsight shows that had he not instigated the merger, the Western Bulldogs would not exist as it does today.

===1990s===
The Bulldogs began the new decade in promising fashion, finishing in seventh place with twelve wins in 1990, including one against eventual premiers Collingwood, when rover Steven Kolyniuk ran around the man on the mark and kicked a goal to put his team in front. Although they just missed out on the finals, there was much to look forward to, and the year was capped off with diminutive rover Tony Liberatore winning the Brownlow Medal.

After a disappointing 1991, the Bulldogs bounced back in 1992, finishing second on the ladder and making their first finals appearance since 1985. Danny Del-Re was an excellent full-forward, while champion veterans Hawkins, Royal, Wallis, Foster and MacPherson helped ensure the club played its best football in many years. Scott Wynd capped a magnificent year with the Brownlow Medal, while Chris Grant and Simon Atkins also had outstanding seasons.

In 1994 and 1995, the Bulldogs again made the finals, only to be eliminated by Melbourne and Geelong, respectively. Leon Cameron and Daniel Southern were stars. In August, Ted Whitten died from prostate cancer; such was his status in the game that he was given a state funeral. In his honour, the club renamed the Western Oval the Whitten Oval, and a memorial statue of Whitten was erected outside the stadium.

Under the tightly focused management of club president David Smorgon, driven coaching by Terry Wallace, and the on-field leadership of Chris Grant (who narrowly missed a Brownlow Medal in 1996 and 1997) and Tony Liberatore, the club had a successful period through the mid- to late 1990s, making the finals from 1997 to 2000. The 1997 season is remembered for the club&#x27;s cruellest loss, to eventual premiers Adelaide in the preliminary final by two points after leading for much of the game and appearing to be headed for their first grand final since 1961. Rohan Smith, Brad Johnson, Chris Grant, Jose Romero, Paul Hudson and company were catalysts in a fine season.

The Bulldogs would again feature in the finals in 1998, after heavily defeating West Coast in the qualifying finals, they met Adelaide again in the losing preliminary final. The Bulldogs eventfully lost by 68 points against the reigning premiers who went on to claim their second consecutive premiership in the grand final that following week.

The Bulldogs would make their third consecutive top 4 finish in 1999 but they suffered consecutive finals losses to West Coast and Brisbane.

In late 1996, the club changed its playing name from &quot;Footscray&quot; to the &quot;Western Bulldogs&quot; to market the club more broadly (specifically the western suburbs of Melbourne). To coincide with the change, the club moved their home games from the Whitten Oval, originally to Optus Oval from 1997 to 1999, and then to the newly built Docklands Stadium for the 2000 season.

===2000s===

During the 2000 season, the Bulldogs handed the eventual premiers, Essendon, their only loss for the year. That victory secured the Bulldogs a place in the finals for the fourth consecutive year. They would bow out in the first week of finals after being defeated by the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba. The Bulldogs missed out on the finals over the next two seasons; in 2001, six players were in New York City during the September 11 attacks while they were attending the 2001 US Open. Terry Wallace left the club with one match left in 2002 and assistant coach Peter Rohde took charge. Philanthropist and long-time Bulldogs supporter Susan Alberti was elected to the club board in December 2004. After two miserable seasons, the Bulldogs appointed Rodney Eade as coach in 2005. Improvement was immediate, with the Bulldogs winning 11 games and finishing ninth on the ladder in 2005, missing out on the finals by just half a game. Missing the finals dealt a blow to both players and supporters of the team, as late season success led to the team being considered real premiership contenders.

In 2006, the Bulldogs continued to play well despite a disastrous run of injuries throughout the year; with five players having to have knee reconstructions, including captain Luke Darcy. Despite this setback, the Bulldogs finished the home-and-away season with 13 wins (see 2006 AFL season), making it to the finals for the first time since 2000, with Scott West and Brad Johnson continuing their excellent play. They won the Elimination Final against Collingwood in front of 84,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and reached the semi-finals before being defeated by eventual Premiers the West Coast Eagles at Subiaco Oval.

On 5 August 2006, Chris Grant broke the Western Bulldogs record for the most senior AFL/VFL games at the club. On this day he played his 330th game, breaking Doug Hawkins&#x27; previous record of 329 games.

Looking for new markets, the club had played one game every year at the Sydney Cricket Ground and one &quot;home&quot; game each year at Marrara Oval in Darwin. On 16 August 2006, the league announced that the Bulldogs&#x27; Sydney &quot;home&quot; game would be played at Manuka Oval, Canberra in 2007, 2008 and 2009.

Prior to the 2007 season, the Bulldogs made a splash by trading for Brisbane midfielder Jason Akermanis. They were premiership favourites early on in 2007, but yet again injuries took their toll, and they faltered in the last seven rounds, losing six games and drawing one, to finish 13th.

In the 2008 pre-season they traded away Jordan McMahon to Richmond and Sam Power to North Melbourne. They also recruited ruckman Ben Hudson and forward Scott Welsh from Adelaide and back Tim Callan from Geelong in what was a very successful trade week. In 2008, the Bulldogs were widely predicted for the bottom four after the pre-season, but had a successful home-and-away season, finishing in third place with fifteen wins, one draw and six losses (five of which occurred in the season&#x27;s last seven games). The team&#x27;s finals campaign began with a loss to Hawthorn by 51 points at the MCG in the first qualifying final, but won the subsequent semi-final against Sydney by 37 points. The Bulldogs lost their preliminary final match against reigning premiers Geelong.

Much was expected of the Bulldogs following their 3rd-place finish in 2008. They began the 2009 season with a 63-point thrashing of Fremantle in Perth, and then recorded solid wins over North Melbourne and Richmond before losing their next three games to West Coast (in Perth), Carlton and St Kilda. The Bulldogs then notched up their first away win against Adelaide since 2001, kicking eight goals to one in the third quarter to win by 32 points. The following week, they survived a determined effort from Melbourne, winning by 7 points, before succumbing to Geelong in one of the best and closest games of the season. They proceeded to win their next five games, including a 93-point drubbing of Port Adelaide in Darwin and an 88-point win over the reigning premiers Hawthorn. After a bit of a dip in form including losses to Collingwood, St Kilda and West Coast, the Bulldogs rebounded with an 18-point win against Brisbane at The Gabba. That was followed up by a 14-point win over Geelong. In the final round of the home-and-away season, the Bulldogs needed to defeat Collingwood by more than 22 points to reclaim third place on the ladder. The Bulldogs managed win by 24 points, earning the right to play Geelong in the first week of the finals.

===2010s===
There was media expectation that the Western Bulldogs would again feature in the top four in 2010 after doing so in 2008 and 2009. The pre-season delivered the Western Bulldogs their first competition victory since 1970 as they defeated by 40 points in the NAB Cup Grand Final, with new recruit Barry Hall starring with seven goals and winning the Michael Tuck Medal for being the best player. However, after a promising pre-season, the Bulldogs failed to make their first grand final in 49 years after being demolished by in the first round of the finals, coming back against the Sydney Swans and losing again to St Kilda in the preliminary final, captain Brad Johnson&#x27;s last game.

The pain of three consecutive Preliminary final exits took its toll in 2011. After a 55-point thrashing at the hands of Essendon in the opening round, the season never looked on track. The Bulldogs lost 9 of their first 12 games, including 7 from 8 games between Rounds 5 and 12. Following a 49-point loss to Essendon in Round 21, coach Rodney Eade was sacked by the Western Bulldogs after seven years at the helm. The club finished the year with wins against Port Adelaide and Fremantle and a loss against Hawthorn. The Bulldogs finished 2011 with a 9-win, 13-loss record for the season. Shortly after the 2011 season was completed, long-time Geelong and Essendon assistant Brendan McCartney was appointed as the senior coach on a three-year contract. During the following months, the Bulldogs assembled a coaching panel consisting of senior coach McCartney, former Geelong and St Kilda ruckman Steven King, former Sydney Swans and North Melbourne midfielder Shannon Grant, former Bulldogs champion and 300 game player Rohan Smith, and former Bulldogs and Port Adelaide player Brett Montgomery.

In October 2012, long-time president David Smorgon stepped down from the role to be replaced by former president Peter Gordon. Smorgon served as president from 1996 to 2012, overseeing two rebuilding phases, the erasure of much debt and a period of stability after decades of uncertainty surrounding the club&#x27;s future.

In 2013, the Bulldogs ended their affiliation with Williamstown Football Club, establishing a reserves team in the Victorian Football League for the 2014 season. The team played under the name of Footscray and the decision proved an instant hit on and off the field, with supporters of the AFL club taking a strong liking to the newly established VFL team. The success flowed onto the field as well, with the club securing the VFL Premiership in its first season in the competition since 1924, defeating the Box Hill Hawks by 22 points in the VFL Grand Final.

===Luke Beveridge era (2015–present)===
Following a disappointing 2014 AFL season, the Bulldogs endured a tumultuous off-season. It began when Ryan Griffen, who was widely regarded as the club&#x27;s best player and had only been captain for one season, shocked the football world by requesting a trade to . He later cited the stress of captaincy as his reason for nearly giving up the game altogether. Two days later, senior coach McCartney handed in his resignation to the board. President Gordon agreed that the decision was in the best interests of the club and also stressed to the press that the club was not in crisis. Adam Cooney requested a trade out of the club, and Shaun Higgins joined North Melbourne via free agency. On November 14, the club&#x27;s coach selection panel, headed by club champion and football director Chris Grant and including CEO Simon Garlick, football manager Graham Lowe, former captain Luke Darcy and former West Coast coach John Worsfold, appointed former player Luke Beveridge as the Bulldogs&#x27; new senior coach. Beveridge had recently served as an assistant coach at Collingwood and Hawthorn, and was due to take up a position at St Kilda as director of coaching before applying for the job as Bulldogs coach. In a series of important first steps, he decided to keep the existing coaches and appointed veteran Robert Murphy as captain.

In January 2015, Simon Garlick announced his resignation as club CEO, having first taken on the position in December 2010. Having been at the Bulldogs for more than 13 years as a player and administrator, Garlick felt the time was right to &quot;start a new chapter in his life&quot;. President Gordon paid tribute to Garlick for his work in keeping the Bulldogs competitive during what had been a difficult period for the club. After losing over 700 games of experience during the off-season, the Bulldogs were expected to again struggle in 2015, and those feelings were further strengthened when Tom Liberatore, the reigning Charles Sutton Medallist, went down with a rupture to his anterior cruciate ligament in the NAB Challenge match against Richmond. However, the Bulldogs exceeded expectations to finish the home-and-away season in sixth position to feature in the finals for the first time since 2010. In the elimination final, they lost to Adelaide by 7 points in front of over 60,000 fans at the MCG, the largest crowd at any Bulldogs game since the 2010 finals.

====2016: AFL premiership====
The Bulldogs fought through numerous injuries in 2016 to finish 7th in the home and away season. In a series of against-the-odds finals victories, the club eliminated the previous year&#x27;s runners-up, the West Coast Eagles, in Perth; thwarted &#x27;s bid for a fourth successive premiership; and, away from home, scraped through against to qualify for the Grand Final for the first time in 55 years. In doing so, it became the first club to reach the premiership decider from such a low position on the ladder.

The club ended a 62-year premiership drought with a 22-point victory over minor premiers the Sydney Swans. Jason Johannisen won the Norm Smith Medal, with Liam Picken (WB), Tom Boyd (WB) and Josh Kennedy (SYD) close behind, while coach Luke Beveridge gave his Jock McHale Medal to captain and club veteran Robert Murphy—who suffered a season-ending knee injury in round 3—saying, &quot;This is yours, mate. You deserve it more than anyone.&quot; This gesture, described as &quot;one of the most touching&quot; in football history, was met with a standing ovation by the crowd. Murphy, though thankful, returned the medal to Beveridge the following day, saying he could not keep it. They decided to gift the medal to the Bulldogs museum.

====2017–18: Post-premiership disappointment====
Despite a promising start to the 2017 AFL season, which saw the reigning premiers win five of their first seven matches, the Bulldogs lost six of the next eight games. A four-game winning streak towards the end of the season proved to be a false dawn, as the Bulldogs failed to secure a spot in the top eight after losing the last three games of the season. They finished tenth with an 11–11 win–loss record, becoming the first team since Hawthorn in 2009 to miss the finals the year after winning the premiership. The club would farewell two long-serving veterans: the retiring captain Murphy and ex-captain Matthew Boyd.

2018 proved to be an even more difficult year for the club. Tom Liberatore suffered a second season-ending knee injury in the opening round 82-point loss to Greater Western Sydney; he would be the first of eight Bulldogs to have their season ended by injury. They suffered six heavy losses in the first half of the season and would win only once between Round 9 and Round 19, with the sole win in that period a thrilling two-point upset win over finalists Geelong in Round 15. Injuries aside, there were also issues with inconsistent form – players such as premiership heroes Jordan Roughead, Caleb Daniel, Shane Biggs and Fletcher Roberts spending time in the VFL – and a forward set-up that was struggling to function effectively.Improved form in the final four rounds of the season saw the Bulldogs win three consecutive games and lose gallantly to reigning premiers Richmond, to finish 13th with an 8–14 win–loss record, becoming the first team since Adelaide in 2000 to miss the finals in successive years after a premiership triumph.

====2019–22: Return to the finals====
Defying expectations that they would again miss the finals, the Bulldogs were one of the surprise packets of the 2019 season. The season started well enough with victories in the first two games, defeating Sydney by 17 points in Round 1 and then kicking nine goals in the last quarter against Hawthorn to win by 19 points in Round 2. However, they then lost their next four matches. The Dogs would continue to have up-and-down form, winning their next two before losing four of five afterwards. Staring at a third consecutive year out of the finals with a disappointing 5–8 record at the end of Round 14, the Bulldogs would go on to win seven of their last nine matches of the season, securing a spot in the finals for the first time since the 2016 premiership after defeating Adelaide by 34 points in Round 23. They would finish the home-and-away season in seventh position with a 12–10 win–loss record. Despite having strong form heading into the finals and having defeated eventual finals opponent Greater Western Sydney by 61 points in Round 22, the Bulldogs were thrashed by 58 points in their elimination final encounter with the Giants, who would eventually go on to play in that year&#x27;s grand final.

The Western Bulldogs entered the 2020 AFL season looking to improve on their strong finish to 2019. They had strengthened their squad during the off-season trading period, recruiting key position players Josh Bruce from St Kilda and Alex Keath from Adelaide. Veteran defender Easton Wood, who had been acting captain in the 2016 premiership and then served as official captain after Bob Murphy retired, stepped down at the end of 2019 and was replaced by Marcus Bontempelli in an almost unanimous player vote, with Lachlan Hunter as his deputy. Bontempelli would be supported by a leadership group which included Wood, Jason Johannisen, Mitch Wallis and Josh Dunkley.After losing the traditional season opener to Collingwood, the season was then plunged into chaos when the COVID-19 pandemic reached Australia, causing the competition to be suspended for over two months. After significant modifications in consultation with state governments, the AFL resumed the season in mid-June, having cut the home-and-away season to 17 rounds, shortening quarter lengths to 16 minutes plus time-on, and not permitting crowd attendances at Victorian venues due to government-imposed restrictions. As state borders began to close in a bid to curb the spread of the virus, the Victorian-based teams flew out of Melbourne after Round 5 and spent the rest of the season based in interstate quarantine hubs; the Bulldogs would be based in Queensland. The Bulldogs secured their spot in the 2020 finals series after another strong finish, winning five of their last six games and ending in seventh position on the ladder with a 10–7 record. Their Elimination final opponents, sixth-placed St Kilda, also finished with the same win–loss record but a higher percentage. The match, which was hosted at the Gabba, was a close-fought affair; the Bulldogs worked their way to a five-point lead at quarter time, only for the Saints to take control in the second and third terms to lead by 24 points at the last change. In a desperate bid to keep their season alive, the Bulldogs made one last charge in the final minutes to reduce the margin to under a goal with two minutes remaining, but the Saints held on by three points, winning their first final since 2010, which had also been against the Bulldogs.Despite another disappointing early finals exit, there was still much to celebrate in terms of individual recognition; diminutive playmaker Caleb Daniel had a career-best season, winning the Charles Sutton Medal and All-Australian honours, while Marcus Bontempelli and Jack Macrae earned their second consecutive All-Australian blazer. Also promising was the continued development of the younger players; Aaron Naughton (for the second straight year) and Bailey Smith were named in the 22 Under 22 team, while Laitham Vandermeer won the Chris Grant Best First Player award.

The Bulldogs headed into the 2021 AFL season with the aim of progressing past the first week of the finals series. They had been one of the big winners in the trading period, recruiting Mitch Hannan from Melbourne, Stefan Martin from Brisbane, and Adam Treloar from Collingwood, while managing to keep Josh Dunkley after he had requested a trade to Essendon. They had also secured promising Next Generation Academy member Jamarra Ugle-Hagan as the Number 1 pick at the 2020 AFL draft. 
For much of the season, the Bulldogs had been one of the clear standout teams, winning nine of the opening ten matches and appearing on track to win their first minor premiership after defeating in Round 19. However, an ill-timed late season slump saw the Bulldogs consigned to a third consecutive year without the double chance, finishing outside of the top four by just 0.5% after the Brisbane Lions supplanted them in the final round. Despite the disappointing end to the regular season, the Bulldogs were finally able to progress to the second week of the finals after a thumping 49-point win over Essendon in the first elimination final. The Bulldogs would then go on to progress to their first preliminary final since 2016 after an enthralling one-point win over Brisbane in the semi-final, before securing a second Grand Final appearance in six years after thrashing Port Adelaide by 71 points in the prelim. However, the Bulldogs were comprehensively outplayed by Melbourne in the grand final, losing to the Demons by 74 points.

The Bulldogs were looking to atone for their galling grand final defeat ahead of the 2022 season. However, the Dogs were very inconsistent and were fortunate to qualify for a fourth consecutive finals berth, finishing eighth with a 12–10 win-loss record and narrowly supplanting ninth-placed Carlton by 0.6%. The Bulldogs started their elimination final encounter with Fremantle strongly, leading by as much as 41 points during the second quarter, but would fade out dramatically to lose by 13 points.

===2023–present: Rebuilding period===

The Western Bulldogs continued to perform inconsistently in 2023. The Bulldogs stayed in contention for the finals right throughout the season, but costly losses to cellar-dwellers Hawthorn and West Coast in the final stretch of the season eventually scuppered their hopes of a fifth consecutive finals appearance. Greater Western Sydney defeated Carlton in the final match of the home-and-away season and secured their spot in the 2023 finals series at the Bulldogs&#x27; expense. The Dogs ultimately finished ninth with a 12–11 record to miss out on September for the first time since 2018.

During the 2023 offseason, superstar midfielder Bailey Smith suffered an ACL tear at training, ruling him out for essentially the entire 2024 campaign.

The Bulldogs would return to the finals in 2024. After showing inconsistent form once again for most of the season, the Dogs would enter the finals in sixth place with a 14–9 win-loss record after winning six of their last seven games. Despite expectations of a third deep September run in nine years, the Bulldogs were bounced out in the first week after losing to a resurgent Hawthorn by 37 points in the elimination final.

==Identity==
===Nickname and mascots===

Footscray went by a variety of nicknames during the VFA years, including the Bone Mill Fellows, the Saltwater Lads, and, most popularly, the Tricolours, in reference to the club guernsey. Footscray came to be known locally as the Bulldogs during the 1920s. At a club social function on 1 November 1920, &quot;a red, white, and blue flag, bearing the words &quot;bulldog tenacity&quot; blazoned in gold, and bearing a picture of a typical bulldog, was presented to [then president David] Mitchell on behalf of the club&quot;. As early as the 1922 season, an image of a bulldog was being stamped on the football club&#x27;s members&#x27; tickets. In a game against Collingwood at the Western Oval on 23 June 1928, a bulldog mascot was &quot;led onto the field at three-quarter time ... to the wild applause of the callow youth&quot;, and was photographed with Footscray captain Paddy Scanlan. In another report on the same match, mention was made that &quot;the Bulldogs were contesting every inch in the air&quot;, indicating a widening use of the club nickname.

The real-life mascot for the Western Bulldogs is a bulldog named Caesar. He can be seen walking around the perimeter of the ground prior to each match. He then waits for the players to come out on the ground; they give him a pat as they run past to the banner. Sid, the club&#x27;s previous real-life mascot, officially retired his club jumper at Etihad Stadium on 6 May 2017 and was given a lap of honour for his seven years of service to the Western Bulldogs. Sid died in 2019 at age 9.5 years old.

During home games, Caesar has a reserved area at the Footscray End (Gate 7), where fans can come and give him a pat and have their photo taken.

===Song===
Western Bulldogs&#x27; club song is sung to the tune of &quot;Sons of the Sea&quot;.
Before the club changed its name from Footscray to Western Bulldogs, the club song was called &quot;Sons of the &#x27;Scray&quot;, sung to the same tune but with different lyrics.

The club song for the Men&#x27;s team is called &quot;Sons of the west&quot;
:&quot;Sons of the west,&quot;
:&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;white&quot; &quot;and blue,&quot;
:&quot;We come out snarling,&quot;
:&quot;Bulldogs through and through,&quot;
:&quot;Bulldogs bite and Bulldogs roar,&quot;
:&quot;We give our very best,&quot;
:&quot;But you can&#x27;t beat the boys of the Bulldog breed,&quot;
:&quot;We&#x27;re the team of the mighty West!&quot;

The club song for the Women&#x27;s team is called &quot;Daughters of the west&quot;
:&quot;Daughters of the west,&quot;
:&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;white&quot; &quot;and blue,&quot;
:&quot;We come out snarling,&quot;
:&quot;Bulldogs through and through,&quot;
:&quot;Bulldogs bite and Bulldogs roar,&quot;
:&quot;We give our very best,&quot;
:&quot;But you can&#x27;t beat the girls of the Bulldog breed,&quot;
:&quot;We&#x27;re the team of the mighty West!&quot;

===Grounds===

The club played its home matches at the Western Oval, located in the inner-western Melbourne suburb of Footscray, from 1884 until 1997 (except for a brief period at nearby Yarraville Oval, from 1941 to 1943). Home to the club&#x27;s training facilities and administrative headquarters, the oval, nicknamed &quot;The Kennel&quot;, was officially renamed Whitten Oval in 1995 in honour of club legend Ted Whitten, who died earlier that year. It underwent a A$20 million redevelopment in 2005.

Melbourne&#x27;s Princes Park became the Western Bulldogs&#x27; primary home ground from 1997 until 1999. Since 2000, the club has been based at Docklands Stadium (currently known as Marvel Stadium), and as of 2017, two home games will be played each season at Eureka Stadium (known as Mars Stadium for sponsorship reasons) in Ballarat.

===Guernsey===
*The home guernsey is primarily royal blue with a red and white hoop. The player numbers are white, and located high upon the back. Although the team officially trades under the name &quot;Western Bulldogs&quot;, the initials &quot;F.F.C.&quot; for Footscray Football Club, which still remains the club&#x27;s official name, are placed on the front of the jumper beneath the sponsor&#x27;s logo in small blue capital letters.
*The clash jumper is primarily white, with a red and blue hoop around the chest area. The player&#x27;s number is blue, and located high upon the back.

=== Uniform evolution ===
Below are some significant uniforms in the history of the Western Bulldogs. Most are generalisations and saw minor changes over the period of their use.

Pre-VFL
VFL/AFL
===Banners===
In 2014, the Bulldogs accepted an offer from comedian and supporter Danny McGinlay to write the messages that appear on the club&#x27;s banners. While AFL clubs traditionally use banners to celebrate milestones or to write motivational messages, McGinlay&#x27;s &quot;amusing pieces of throwaway banter&quot; at the expense of opposing clubs have acquired cult status in the game, and occasionally proved controversial.
===In popular culture===
William Ellis Green (&quot;WEG&quot;), cartoonist for &quot;The Herald&quot;, began a VFL/AFL Grand Final tradition in 1954 after drawing a full-page caricature of the Western Bulldogs mascot. It is the most valuable and sought-after of WEG&#x27;s Grand Final posters.

Martin Flanagan&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;Southern Sky, Western Oval&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;National Library of Australia – Trove – Southern Sky, Western Oval / Martin Flanagan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; reflects on the Western Bulldogs&#x27; fight for survival when it faced a merger with Fitzroy in the late 1980s. The award-winning documentary &quot;Year of the Dogs&quot; gives an inside look at the Western Bulldogs over the course of the 1996 AFL season.

Footscray Bulldogs merchandise is seen to be worn in 1992 film Romper Stomper by the main character &#x27;Hando&#x27;. The film revolves around the exploits and downfall of a violent skinhead gang based in Footscray.

In season 1 Degrassi Junior High episode &#x27;It&#x27;s Late!&#x27; character &#x27;Wheels&#x27; is seen wearing a 1980s Footscray Bulldogs VFL long-sleeve jumper.

==Membership and attendance==

Compared to other Victorian AFL clubs, the Western Bulldogs have had historically low membership numbers. However, the club broke its membership record in 2006 and continued to sustain these figures before another significant increase in 2010. In 2015, the club reached 35,000 members for the first time, and ended the season with an official tally of 36,213. In 2016, the Bulldogs equalled the club&#x27;s previous year&#x27;s tally by mid-May, and again reached record-breaking membership numbers by July, with 39,459 fans having signed up. It was also the second successive year in which the club had recorded double-digit percentage growth in membership.

* Bulldogs Taskforce VFL Coaches Award
* Best in Finals – only awarded in years when Bulldogs play in the finals

==Reserves team==

The Footscray Bulldogs are the reserves team of the club, competing in the Victorian Football League.

===History===
In 1925, the year Footscray was admitted to the VFL, the club&#x27;s reserves team began competing in the VFL reserves grade competition. The team won six premierships between 1936 and 1998, and were runners-up five times between 1938 and 1986.

Following the demise of AFL reserves competition at the end of the 1999 season, the reserves team was dissolved and a joint reserves affiliation was established with the Victorian Football League&#x27;s two western clubs − Werribee and Williamstown − for the 2000 VFL season. From 2001 to 2007, the Bulldogs were solely aligned with Werribee, and from 2008 until 2013, solely aligned with Williamstown.

After a fourteen-year recess, the club re-established a stand-alone reserves team to compete in the Victorian Football League from 2014 onward. The new reserves team was formally named the Footscray Bulldogs, reflecting the club&#x27;s original name prior to the decision to trade as the Western Bulldogs in the AFL from 1997. They play home games at Whitten Oval.

In its inaugural year, Footscray claimed the VFL premiership, defeating the Box Hill Hawks by 22 points in front of 23,816 at Docklands Stadium. Their second premiership came in 2016, defeating by 31 points.

Footscray claimed the minor premiership in the COVID-19 pandemic-affected 2021 season.

===Individual records (VFL)===
*Most games: Will Hayes − 96 (2014–2021)
*Most goals: Jack Redpath − 73 (2014–2017)

==Women&#x27;s teams==
In June 2013, the Western Bulldogs fielded a women&#x27;s football side against in the first AFL-sanctioned women&#x27;s exhibition match, held at the MCG. The two teams competed annually over the next three years for the Hampson-Hardeman Cup. In 2016, when the AFL announced plans for AFL Women&#x27;s, an eight team national women&#x27;s league competition, the Bulldogs were asked to submit an application for a license alongside other AFL clubs. The club was one of four Melbourne-based clubs to be granted a license that year.

The club&#x27;s first players were marquee signings Katie Brennan and Ellie Blackburn. They were joined in August by priority player Emma Kearney who had previously worked in an off-field role at the club. In October, the club completed its inaugural playing list by adding 22 other senior listed and two rookie players in the league&#x27;s draft and signing period. Former Monash Blues (VAFA) coach Paul Groves was named as the team&#x27;s first head coach and football manager in August 2016. The following month, the club signed three-year sponsorship agreements with Priceline, Bob Jane T-Marts and Pancake Parlour.

The team&#x27;s training base and administrative headquarters are located alongside the men&#x27;s team at the Whitten Oval, and as part of the initial application, it plans to play home games at Whitten Oval, Eureka Stadium and Docklands Stadium. The club has also fielded a team in the second-tier VFL Women&#x27;s league since 2016, the league&#x27;s inaugural year.

In 2018, the Western Bulldogs and Carlton women&#x27;s teams held the first Pride game in the AFLW, to celebrate gender diversity, promote inclusion for LGBTIQA+ players, and to help stamp out homophobia. After being joined by other clubs, in 2020, the first full AFLW Pride Round was held in 2021, supported by all 18 clubs in the league.

<text>Wilma Glodean Rudolph (June 23, 1940 – November 12, 1994) was an American sprinter who overcame polio as a child and went on to become a world-record-holding Olympic champion and international sports icon in track and field following her successes in the 1956 and 1960 Olympic Games. Rudolph competed in the 200-meter dash and won a bronze medal in the 4 × 100-meter relay at the 1956 Summer Olympics at Melbourne, Australia. She also won three gold medals, in the 100- and 200-meter individual events and the 4 x 100-meter relay at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Rudolph was acclaimed as the fastest woman in the world in the 1960s; she became the first American woman to win three gold medals in track and field during a single Olympic Games.

With the worldwide television coverage of the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rudolph became an international star, along with other Olympic athletes such as Cassius Clay (later known as Muhammad Ali), Oscar Robertson, and Rafer Johnson.

As an Olympic champion in the early 1960s, Rudolph was among the most highly visible black women in America and abroad. She became a role model for black and female athletes; her Olympic successes helped elevate women&#x27;s track and field in the United States. Rudolph is also regarded as a civil rights and women&#x27;s rights pioneer. In 1962, Rudolph retired from competition at the peak of her athletic career as the world record-holder in the 100- and 200-meter individual events and the 4 × 100-meter relays. After competing in the 1960 Summer Olympics, the 1963 graduate of Tennessee State University became an educator and coach. Rudolph died of brain and throat cancer in 1994, and her achievements are memorialized in a variety of tributes, including a U.S. postage stamp, documentary films, and a made-for-television movie, as well as in numerous publications, especially books for young readers.

==Early life and education==
Wilma Rudolph was born prematurely to Blanche Rudolph at on June 23, 1940, in Saint Bethlehem, Tennessee (now part of Clarksville). She was the 20th of 22 children from her father Ed Rudolph&#x27;s two marriages. Shortly after Wilma&#x27;s birth, her family moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, where she grew up and attended elementary and high school. Her father, Ed, who worked as a railway porter and did odd jobs in Clarksville, died in 1961; her mother, Blanche, worked as a maid in Clarksville homes and died in 1994.

Rudolph had several early childhood illnesses, including pneumonia and scarlet fever, and she contracted infantile paralysis (caused by the poliovirus) at the age of five. Rudolph recovered from polio but lost strength in her left leg and foot. Physically disabled for much of her early life, Rudolph wore a leg brace until she was 12 years old. Because there was little medical care available to African American residents of Clarksville in the 1940s, Rudolph&#x27;s parents sought treatment for her at the historically black Meharry Medical College (now Nashville General Hospital at Meharry) in Nashville, Tennessee, about from Clarksville.

For two years, Rudolph and her mother made weekly bus trips to Nashville for treatments to regain the use of her weakened leg. Rudolph also received subsequent at-home massage treatments four times a day from members of her family and wore an orthopedic shoe for support of her foot for another two years. Because of the treatments she received at Meharry and the daily massages from her family members, Rudolph was able to overcome the debilitating effects of polio and learned to walk without a leg brace or orthopedic shoe for support by the time she was 12 years old.

Rudolph was initially homeschooled due to the frequent illnesses that caused her to miss kindergarten and first grade. Rudolph began attending second grade at Cobb Elementary School in Clarksville in 1947 at age seven. She attended Clarksville&#x27;s all-black Burt High School, where Rudolph excelled in basketball and track. During her senior year of high school, Rudolph became pregnant with her first child, Yolanda, who was born in 1958, a few weeks before her enrollment at Tennessee State University in Nashville. In college, Rudolph continued to compete in track. She also became a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. In 1963, Rudolph graduated from Tennessee State with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education. Her college education was paid by her participation in a work-study scholarship program that required Rudolph to work on the TSU campus for two hours a day.

==Career==
===Early years===
Rudolph was first introduced to organized sports at Burt High School, the center of Clarksville&#x27;s African American community. After completing several years of medical treatments to regain the use of her left leg, Rudolph chose to follow in her sister Yvonne&#x27;s footsteps and began playing basketball in the eighth grade. Rudolph continued to play basketball in high school, where she became a starter on the team and began competing in track. In her sophomore year, Rudolph scored 803 points and set a new record for high school girls&#x27; basketball. Rudolph&#x27;s high school coach, C. C. Gray, gave her the nickname of &quot;Skeeter&quot; (for mosquito) because she moved so fast.

While playing for her high school basketball team, Rudolph was spotted by Ed Temple, Tennessee State&#x27;s track and field coach, a major break for the active young athlete. The day that Temple saw the tenth grader for the first time, he knew Rudolph was a natural athlete. She had already gained some track experience on Burt High School&#x27;s track team two years earlier, mostly as a way to keep busy between basketball seasons. As a high school sophomore, Rudolph competed at Alabama&#x27;s Tuskegee Institute in her first major track event. Although she lost the race, Rudolph was determined to continue competing and win.

Temple invited 14-year-old Rudolph to join his summer training program at Tennessee State. After attending the track camp, Rudolph won all nine events she entered at an Amateur Athletic Union track meet in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Under Temple&#x27;s guidance, she continued to train regularly at TSU while still a high school student. Rudolph raced at amateur athletic events with TSU&#x27;s women&#x27;s track team, known as the Tigerbelles, for two more years before enrolling at TSU as a student in 1958.

===1956 Summer Olympics===
When Rudolph was 16 and a junior in high school, she attended the 1956 U.S. Olympic track and field team trials in Seattle, Washington, and qualified to compete in the 200-meter individual event at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Rudolph, the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic team, was one of five TSU Tigerbelles to qualify for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.

Rudolph was defeated in a preliminary heat of the 200-meter race at the Melbourne Olympic Games but ran the third leg of the 4 × 100 m relay. The American team of Rudolph, Isabelle Daniels, Mae Faggs, and Margaret Matthews, all of whom were TSU Tigerbelles, won the bronze medal, matching the world-record time of 44.9 seconds. The British team won the silver medal. The Australian team, with the 100- and 200-meter gold medalist Betty Cuthbert as their anchor leg, won the gold medal in a time of 44.5 seconds. After Rudolph returned to her Tennessee home from the Melbourne Olympic Games, Rudolph showed her high school classmates the bronze medal that she had won and decided to try to win a gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy.

In 1958, Rudolph enrolled at Tennessee State, where Temple continued as her track coach. At the Pan American Games in Chicago, Illinois the following year, Rudolph won a silver medal in the 100-meter individual event, as well as a gold medal in the 4 × 100-meter relay with teammates Isabelle Dan, Barbara Joe, and Lucinda Williams. She also won the AAU 200-meter title in 1959 and defended it for four consecutive years. During her career, Rudolph also won three AAU indoor titles.

===1960 Summer Olympics===
While she was still a sophomore at Tennessee State, Rudolph competed in the U.S. Olympic track and field trials at Abilene Christian University in Abilene, Texas, where she set a world record in the 200-meter dash that stood for eight years. Rudolph also qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics in the 100-meter dash.

At the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy, Rudolph competed in three events on a cinder track in Rome&#x27;s Stadio Olimpico: the 100- and 200-meter sprints, as well as the 4 × 100-meter relay. Rudolph, who won a gold medal in each of these events, became the first American woman to win three gold medals in a single Olympiad.

Rudolph ran the finals in the 100-meter dash in a wind-aided time of 11.0 seconds. (The record-setting time was not credited as a world record, because the wind, at per second, exceeded the maximum of .) Rudolph became the first American woman to win a gold medal in the 100-meter race since Helen Stephens did so in the 1936 Summer Olympics. Rudolph won another gold medal in the finals of the 200-meter dash with a time of 24.0 seconds, after setting a new Olympic record of 23.2 seconds in the opening heat. After these wins, she was hailed throughout the world as &quot;the fastest woman in history.&quot;

On September 7, 1960, the temperature climbed toward as thousands of spectators jammed the stadium. Rudolph combined efforts with her Olympic teammates from Tennessee State—Martha Hudson, Lucinda Williams, and Barbara Jones—to win the 4 × 100-meter relays with a time of 44.5 seconds, after setting a world record of 44.4 seconds in the semifinals. Rudolph ran the anchor leg for the American team in the finals and nearly dropped the baton after a pass from Williams, but she overtook Germany&#x27;s anchor leg to win the relay in a close finish. Rudolph had a special, personal reason to hope for victory—to pay tribute to Jesse Owens, the celebrated American athlete and star of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, who had been her inspiration.

Rudolph was one of the most popular athletes of the 1960 Rome Olympics and emerged from the Olympic Games as &quot;The Tornado, the fastest woman on earth.&quot; The Italians nicknamed her &quot;La Gazzella Nera&quot; (&quot;The Black Gazelle&quot;). The French called her &quot;La Perle Noire&quot; (&quot;The Black Pearl&quot;), as well as &quot;La Chattanooga Choo-Choo. Along with other 1960 Olympic athletes such as Cassius Clay (later known as Muhammad Ali), Oscar Robertson, and Rafer Johnson, Rudolph became an international star due to the first worldwide television coverage of the Olympics that year. The 1960 Rome Olympics launched her into the public spotlight and the media cast her as America&#x27;s athletic &quot;leading lady&quot; and a &quot;queen,&quot; with praises of Rudolph&#x27;s athletic accomplishments as well as her feminine beauty and poise.

===Post-Olympic career===
Rudolph returned home to Clarksville after completing a post-games European tour, where she and her Olympic teammates competed in meets in London, West Germany, the Netherlands, and at other venues in Europe. Rudolph&#x27;s hometown of Clarksville celebrated &quot;Welcome Wilma Day&quot; on October 4, 1960, with a full day of festivities. Governor Buford Ellington had created these plans to welcome Rudolph home with a parade. Ellington was elected because he had old fashioned segregationist beliefs. This was the complete opposite of what Rudolph stood for. Rudolph heard this and refused to attend her own celebration of it being segregated. Due to the concert of Rudolph not attending her own event, the parade was changed to be integrated. She makes everlasting history by standing up for what she believes in as this marks the first ever integrated event in her hometown of Clarksville, Tennessee. An estimated 1,100 attended the banquet in Rudolph&#x27;s honor and thousands lined the city streets to watch the parade.

Rudolph&#x27;s gold-medal victories in Rome also &quot;propelled her to become one of the most highly visible black women across the United States and around the world.&quot; Her Olympic star status also &quot;gave an enormous boost to the indoor track circuit in the months following the Olympic Games in Rome.&quot; In 1961, Rudolph competed in the prestigious, Los Angeles Invitational indoor track meet, where thousands turned out to watch her run. Besides, Rudolph was invited to compete in New York Athletic Club track events and became the first woman invited to compete at the Millrose Games. She was also invited to compete at the Penn Relays and the Drake Relays, among others.

Following Rudolph&#x27;s Olympic victories, the United States Information Agency made a 10-minute documentary film, &quot;Wilma Rudolph: Olympic Champion&quot; (1961), to highlight her accomplishments on the track. Rudolph&#x27;s appearance in 1960 on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, an American television game show, and later as a guest on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; also helped promote her status as an iconic sports star.

In 1961, Rudolph married William Ward, a North Carolina College at Durham track team member; they divorced in 1963. In the interim, Rudolph retired from track competition at age 22, following victories in the 100-meter and 4 x 100-meter-relay races at the U.S.–Soviet meet at Stanford University in 1962. At the time of her retirement, Rudolph was still the world record-holder in the 100-meter (11.2 seconds set on July 19, 1961), 200-meter (22.9 seconds set on July 9, 1960), and 4 x 100-meter-relay events. She had also won seven national AAU sprint titles and set the women&#x27;s indoor track record of 6.9 seconds in the 60-yard dash. As Rudolph explained it, she retired at the peak of her athletic career because Rudolph wanted to leave the sport while still at her best. As such, Rudolph did not compete at the 1964 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, saying, &quot;If I won two gold medals, there would be something lacking. I&#x27;ll stick with the glory I&#x27;ve already won like Jesse Owens did in 1936.&quot;

After retiring from competition, Rudolph continued her education at Tennessee State and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in elementary education in 1963. That same year, she made a month-long trip to West Africa as a goodwill ambassador for the U.S State Department. Rudolph served as U.S. representative to the 1963 Friendship Games in Dakar, Senegal, and visited Ghana, Guinea, Mali, and Upper Volta, where she attended sporting events, visited schools, and made guest appearances on television and radio broadcasts. Rudolph also attended the premiere of the U.S. Information Agency&#x27;s documentary film that highlighted her track career.

In May 1963, a few weeks after returning from Africa, Rudolph participated in a civil rights protest in her hometown of Clarksville to desegregate one of the city&#x27;s restaurants. Within a short time, the mayor announced that the city&#x27;s public facilities, including its restaurants, would become fully integrated. Rudolph also married Robert Eldridge, who had fathered her child when she was in high school, later that year. The couple had three additional children, but divorced after 17 years of marriage.

==Later years==
Rudolph did not earn significant money as an amateur athlete and shifted to a career in teaching and coaching after her retirement from track competition. She began as a second-grade teacher at Cobb Elementary School, which Rudolph had attended as a child, and coached track at Burt High School, where she had once been a student-athlete herself, but conflict forced Rudolph to leave the position.

Rudolph moved several times over the years and lived in various places such as Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; Saint Louis, Missouri; Detroit, Michigan; Tennessee; California; and Maine.

Rudolph&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Wilma: The Story of Wilma Rudolph&quot;, was published in 1977. It served as the basis for several other publications and films. By 2014, at least 21 books on Rudolph&#x27;s life had been published for children, from pre-school youth to high school students.

In addition to teaching, Rudolph worked for nonprofit organizations and government-sponsored projects that supported athletic development among American children. In Boston, Massachusetts, she became involved in the federal Job Corps program, and Rudolph served as a track specialist for Operation Champion in 1967. In 1981, Rudolph established and led the Wilma Rudolph Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Indianapolis, Indiana, that trains youth athletes. Six years later, she joined DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, as director of its women&#x27;s track program and served as a consultant on minority affairs to the university&#x27;s president.

Rudolph went on to host a local television show in Indianapolis. She was also a publicist for Universal Studios as well as a television sports commentator for ABC Sports during the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, and lit the cauldron to open the Pan American Games in Indianapolis in 1987 in front of 80,000 spectators at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. In 1992, two years before her untimely death, Rudolph became a vice president at Nashville&#x27;s Baptist Hospital.

==Marriage and family==
Rudolph dated boxing legend Muhammad Ali during the early 1960s. She was married twice, with both marriages ending in divorce. On October 14, 1961, Rudolph married William &quot;Willie&quot; Ward, a member of the North Carolina College at Durham track team. They divorced in May 1963. After her graduation from Tennessee State in 1963, Rudolph married Robert Eldridge, her high school sweetheart, with whom she already had a daughter, Yolanda, born in 1958. Rudolph and Eldridge had four children: two daughters (Yolanda, born in 1958, and Djuanna, born in 1964) and two sons (Robert Jr., born in 1965, and Xurry, born in 1971). They divorced in 1980.

==Death and legacy==
In July 1994 (shortly after her mother&#x27;s death), Rudolph was diagnosed with brain cancer. She also had been diagnosed with throat cancer. Her condition deteriorated rapidly, and Rudolph died on November 12, 1994, at her home in Brentwood, a suburb of Nashville, Tennessee; she was only 54 years old.

Rudolph&#x27;s legacy lies in her efforts to overcome obstacles that included childhood illnesses and a physical disability to become the fastest woman runner in the world in 1960. At the 1960 Rome Olympics, Rudolph became the first American woman to win three gold medals in a single Olympiad. Rudolph was one of the first role models for black and female athletes. Her Olympic success &quot;gave a tremendous boost to women&#x27;s track in the United States.&quot; Rudolph&#x27;s celebrity also caused gender barriers to be broken at previously all-male track and field events such as the Millrose Games.

In addition to her athletic accomplishments, Rudolph is remembered for her contributions to youth, including founding and heading the Wilma Rudolph Foundation, which trains youth athletes. Her life is remembered in numerous publications, especially books for young readers. Rudolph&#x27;s life has been featured in documentary films and made-for-television movies too: 
* Walter de Hoog directed &quot;Wilma Rudolph: Olympic Champion&quot; (1961), the United States Information Agency&#x27;s ten-minute film documentary of her accomplishments on the track. 
* In 1977, Bud Greenspan produced &quot;Wilma&quot; (also known as &quot;The Story of Wilma Rudolph&quot;), a made-for-television docudrama adaptation of her autobiography starring Shirley Jo Finney as Rudolph and costarring Cicely Tyson, Jason Bernard, and Denzel Washington in one of his first roles.
* In 2015, Positive Edge Education Ltd. commissioned Pixel Revolution Films, a United Kingdom-based film company, to produce three short inspiration dramas to be screened in schools, including one about Rudolph&#x27;s life. &quot;Unlimited&quot; (2015) was written and directed by Ian and Dominic Higgins.

==Awards and honors==

Rudolph was named United Press International Athlete of the Year (1960) and Associated Press Woman Athlete of the Year (1960 and 1961). She was also the recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award (1960) for the top amateur athlete in the United States and the Babe Didrikson Zaharias Award (1962). In addition, Rudolph had
a private meeting with President John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office. Rudolph was also honored with the National Sports Award (1993).

Rudolph was inducted into several women&#x27;s and sports halls of fame: 
* Black Sports Hall of Fame (1973)
* U.S. National Track and Field Hall of Fame (1974)
* U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame (1983) 
* National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame (1994)
* National Black Sports and Entertainment Hall of Fame (2001)

In 1984, the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation selected Rudolph as one of the five greatest women athletes in the United States. In 1996, the foundation presented its first Wilma Rudolph Courage Award to Jackie Joyner-Kersee.

In 1994, a portion of U.S. Route 79 was named Wilma Rudolph Boulevard, extending from Interstate 24, exit 4, in Clarksville to the Red River (Lynnwood-Tarpley) bridge near the Kraft Street intersection. On November 21, 1995, the Wilma Rudolph Memorial Commission placed a black marble marker at her grave site in Edgefield Missionary Baptist Church. In April 1996, a life-size bronze statue of Rudolph was erected &quot;at the southern end of the Cumberland River Walk at the base of the Pedestrian Overpass&quot; at College Street and Riverside Drive in Clarksville.

In 2012, the city of Clarksville, Tennessee built the Wilma Rudolph Event Center, located at Liberty Park on Cumberland Drive. The life-size bronze statue was moved there from its previous location at Riverside Drive, and stands near the entrance of the building.

On December 2, 1980, Tennessee State University named its indoor track in Rudolph&#x27;s honor. On August 11, 1995 (nine months after Rudolph&#x27;s death), Tennessee State University dedicated a new, six-story dormitory as the Wilma G. Rudolph Residence Center. The building, which includes a computer lab, beauty salon, and cafeteria, houses upper class and graduate women. In 1997, Governor Don Sundquist proclaimed June 23 as &quot;Wilma Rudolph Day&quot; in Tennessee.

The December 29, 1999, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked Rudolph first on its list of the top 50 greatest sports figures of the twentieth-century from Tennessee. ESPN ranked Rudolph forty-first in its listing of the twentieth century&#x27;s greatest athletes.

Following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Berlin in 1994, Berlin American High School (BAHS) was turned over to the people of Berlin and became the &quot;Gesamtschule Am Hegewinkel&quot;. The school was renamed the &quot;Wilma Rudolph Oberschule&quot; in her honor in the summer of 2000.

On July 14, 2004, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 23-cent postage stamp, the fifth in its Distinguished Americans series, in recognition of Rudolph&#x27;s accomplishments.

<doc id="34096" wikidata="Q1135620" url="?curid=34096" title="Wire (band)">
<text>Wire are an English rock band, formed in London in October 1976 by Colin Newman (vocals, guitar), Graham Lewis (bass, vocals), Bruce Gilbert (guitar), George Gill (lead guitar) and Robert Grey (aka Robert Gotobed; drums). They were originally associated with the punk rock scene, appearing on &quot;The Roxy London WC2&quot; album, and were instrumental to the development of post-punk, while their debut album, &quot;Pink Flag&quot;, was influential for hardcore punk.

Wire are considered a definitive and highly influential art punk and post-punk band, due to their richly detailed and atmospheric sound and obscure lyrical themes. They steadily developed from an early noise rock style to a more complex, structured sound involving increased use of guitar effects and synthesizers (1978&#x27;s &quot;Chairs Missing&quot; and 1979&#x27;s &quot;154&quot;). The band gained a reputation for experimenting with song arrangements throughout their career.

==History==

===1976 to 1980===

Wire began as a five-piece band in October 1976. Initially, the band&#x27;s main songwriter was guitarist George Gill but after he broke his leg and was unable to perform, the band moved on without him in February 1977. They dropped most of the songs written by Gill, although many of these early songs have been released as demos or on compilation albums. Wire&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Pink Flag&quot; (1977) – &quot;perhaps the most original debut album to come out of the first wave of British punk&quot;, according to AllMusic – contains songs that are diverse in mood and style, but most use a minimalist punk approach combined with unorthodox structures. &quot;Field Day for the Sundays&quot;, for example, is only 28 seconds long.


Their second album, &quot;Chairs Missing&quot; (1978), marked a retreat from the stark minimalism of &quot;Pink Flag&quot;, with longer, more atmospheric songs and synthesizer parts added by producer Mike Thorne. &quot;Outdoor Miner&quot; was a minor hit, peaking at number 51 in the UK singles chart. The experimentation was even more prominent on &quot;154&quot; (1979).

Wire&#x27;s unorthodox ideas to promote &quot;154&quot; led to a falling out with their label. According to Newman, &quot;We&#x27;d worked out a sales strategy for &quot;154&quot; that EMI couldn&#x27;t see at all...They couldn&#x27;t understand a rock band that wanted to do a week in a theater as an event, and wanted to promote &quot;154&quot; with videos or left-field TV adverts. We wanted to help them sell records; they thought we were simply being intransigent.&quot; According to Jim Green in an interview with Newman, &quot;personnel changes at EMI had left Wire without any support.&quot; Colin Newman&#x27;s solo album, &quot;&quot;A-Z&quot; was planned as the fourth Wire album, but EMI cancelled studio time in the wake of failed negotiations with the band, and then dropped Wire&#x27;s option.&quot;

Lacking a recording deal and money, creative differences split the band in 1979, leading to the &quot;Document and Eyewitness&quot; LP (1981), a recording of a live performance that featured, almost exclusively, new material. The album was described as &quot;disjointed&quot;, &quot;unrecognizable as rock music&quot; and &quot;almost unlistenable&quot;. The LP came packaged with an EP of a different performance of more new material. Some of these songs, along with others performed but not included on the album, were included on Newman&#x27;s post-Wire solo albums (&quot;5/10&quot;, &quot;We Meet Under Tables&quot;), while others were released by Gilbert&#x27;s and Lewis&#x27; primary post-Wire outlet Dome (&quot;And Then...&quot;, &quot;Ritual View&quot;).

Between 1981 and 1985, Wire ceased recording and performing in favour of solo and collaborative projects such as Dome, Cupol, Duet Emmo and several Colin Newman solo efforts.

===1985 to 1992===

In 1985, the group re-formed as a &quot;beat combo&quot; (a joking reference to early 1960s beat music), with greater use of electronic musical instruments. Wire announced that they would perform none of their older material, hiring The Ex-Lion Tamers (a Wire cover band named after a song title from &quot;Pink Flag&quot;) as their opening act. The Ex-Lion Tamers played Wire&#x27;s older songs, and Wire played their new material.

In June 1988, Wire were part of a lineup that included Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Thomas Dolby supporting Depeche Mode at the Pasadena Rose Bowl where they played to over 60,000 people. In 1989, Wire released &quot;IBTABA&quot;, a &quot;live&quot; album of mostly reworked versions of songs from &quot;The Ideal Copy&quot; and &quot;A Bell Is a Cup&quot;, heavily rearranged, edited, and remixed. A new song from the album, &quot;Eardrum Buzz&quot;, was released as a single and peaked at number 68 in the UK singles chart.

Gotobed left the band in 1990, after the release of the album &quot;Manscape&quot;. After his departure, the band dropped one letter from its name, becoming &quot;Wir&quot; (still pronounced &quot;wire&quot;), and released &quot;The First Letter&quot; in 1991. There followed a further period of solo recordings, during which Newman founded the swim ~ label, and later Githead with his wife (ex-Minimal Compact bassist Malka Spigel), while Wire remained an occasional collaboration. It was not until 1999 that Wire again became a full-time entity.

===1999 to present===

With Gotobed back in the line-up (now using his birth name, Robert Grey), the group initially reworked much of their back catalogue for a performance at Royal Festival Hall in 2000. Wire&#x27;s reception during a short tour in early May of the US, and a number of UK gigs, convinced the band to continue. Two EPs, &quot;Read &amp; Burn 01&quot; and &quot;Read &amp; Burn 02&quot; were released in 2002. Seven of the tracks from the two EPs were collected with four previously unreleased tracks on the 2003 album, &quot;Send&quot;. Wire collaborated with stage designer Es Devlin and artists Jake and Dinos Chapman. In 2005, &quot;The Scottish Play: 2004&quot;, which contained recordings of live performances from this era, was released.

In 2006, Wire&#x27;s 1970s albums were remastered and re-released with the original vinyl track listings. In 2007, &quot;Read &amp; Burn 03&quot; was released. According to Newman, Gilbert featured in a minimal capacity on this EP; Gilbert would no longer feature in Wire after this release. Later, in 2020, Wire would release &quot;Send Ultimate&quot; which added a bonus disc to the &quot;Send&quot; album. &quot;Send Ultimate&quot; collected all the tracks from the first two Read and Burn EPs along with other unreleased material and both sides of the &quot;Twelve Times You&quot; single. A full-length album of new material entitled &quot;Object 47&quot; was released in July 2008 with Wire now consisting of three members.

In January 2011, Wire released &quot;Red Barked Tree&quot;, which according to the band&#x27;s press release &quot;rekindles a lyricism sometimes absent from Wire&#x27;s previous work and reconnects with the live energy of performance, harnessed and channelled from extensive touring over the past few years&quot;. The album was written and recorded by Newman, Lewis and Grey, but speaking to Marc Riley on the day of the release, Newman introduced as &quot;a new boy&quot; guitarist Matt Simms (from It Hugs Back), who had been a touring member with the band since April 2010.

In March 2013 the band released &quot;Change Becomes Us&quot;, their 13th studio album, which was very well received. Their fourteenth album, eponymously titled &quot;Wire&quot;, was released in April 2015. The following year, in April 2016, the band&#x27;s 15th studio album, entitled &quot;Nocturnal Koreans,&quot; was released on their label Pinkflag. The album consisted of eight songs recorded during the sessions for their previous album which were as of then unreleased. Stereogum named &quot;Nocturnal Koreans&quot; the Album of the Week. Reviews for the album were mostly positive. In 2017 Wire celebrated 40 years since their debut gig on 1 April 1977 by releasing their 16th studio album, &quot;Silver/Lead&quot;, and headlining the Los Angeles edition of their DRILL : FESTIVAL.

In 2018, Wire released multi-disc special editions of their first three albums. Each album was housed in a book containing lyrics and other information about the album. The three releases collected non-LP singles and the demo sessions from this era along with remastered versions of the original albums.

In January 2020, Wire released &quot;Mind Hive&quot; on their own Pinkflag label. The band appeared on the front cover of &quot;Wire&quot; magazine (issue 432) published in January 2020; it featured an interview with the band about the new album and discussed the enduring nature of the group.

On Record Store Day, June 2020, Wire released an eight-song album entitled &quot;10:20&quot;. Side one of the vinyl LP consists of four tracks that were originally released as the limited edition &quot;Strays&quot; EP, which was given away with mail ordered copies of &quot;Red Barked Trees&quot;. Side two contains four tracks that were recorded during the &quot;Mind Hive&quot; sessions but not released until their appearance on &quot;10:20&quot;.

In June 2021, in conjunction with Record Store Day, Wire released &quot;PF456 Deluxe&quot; an 18-song vinyl-only compilation of the first two Read and Burn EPs, the &quot;Twelve Times You&quot; single, and the four unreleased tracks from &quot;Send&quot;. Concurrently, Wire released a CD version of &quot;PF456 Redux&quot;, a 16-song vinyl-only compilation, originally released in 2003, of edited versions of all the songs from the first two Read and Burn EPs along with the unreleased songs on &quot;Send&quot;.

In April 2022, in conjunction with Record Store Day, Wire released &quot;Not About to Die&quot; which was originally released as a bootleg in the early 1980s. The album consists of recordings made for EMI as demos for the 1978 and 1979 albums, &quot;Chairs Missing&quot; and &quot;154&quot;. The songs on &quot;Not About to Die&quot; were also previously released in 2018 by Wire on the special editions of the two EMI albums.

== Musical style and influences ==
Despite Wire being considered pioneers of post-punk, Newman has denied any association with punk. He has stated: &quot;Wire really never were a punk band... we happened to be there at the same time. You could list the Ramones as one of our influences, but we were never interested in just doing that genre. (...) [T]here&#x27;s basically two views of Wire: you either think we were not a punk band, or that we were the best punk band ever because we broke every single rule of punk.&quot;

In addition to the Ramones, the band have also cited Neu!, Can, early Roxy Music, Captain Beefheart, Patti Smith, and Television as influences.

==Legacy==
Wire&#x27;s influence has outshone their comparatively modest record sales. In the 1980s and 1990s, Big Black, Minutemen, and Sonic Youth all expressed a fondness for the group. Minutemen bassist Mike Watt described their influence as key, saying of &quot;Pink Flag&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what we would have sounded like if we didn&#x27;t hear it.&quot;

Wire were influential on American hardcore punk. Fans included Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat and Henry Rollins, formerly of Black Flag. Minor Threat covered &quot;12XU&quot; for the &quot;Flex Your Head&quot; compilation, as did Boss Hog on their &quot;I Dig You&quot; EP. Rollins, as Henrietta Collins &amp; The Wife-Beating Childhaters, covered &quot;Ex Lion Tamer&quot; on the EP &quot;Drive by Shooting&quot;. Michael Azerrad reported, in the book &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot;, that at Minor Threat&#x27;s second gig, each of the seven bands on the roster performed a version of a Wire song.

Robert Pollard once declared Wire&#x27;s &quot;154&quot; to be &quot;the greatest album of all time&quot;, and has stated that &quot;There&#x27;s always some Wire influence in my stuff.&quot; Numerous other bands and artists have cited Wire as an influence, including Soundgarden, Manic Street Preachers, Hüsker Dü, Quicksand, Mary Timony, and Mission of Burma.

Big Black covered Wire&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat&quot; twice, once as a studio version that was released as a single (also included on &quot;The Rich Man&#x27;s Eight Track Tape&quot; compilation) and also as a live version, featuring Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis, included on the VHS version of the live album &quot;Pigpile&quot;. R.E.M. covered &quot;Strange&quot; on their album &quot;Document.&quot; My Bloody Valentine covered &quot;Map Ref 41°N 93°W&quot; for the Wire tribute album &quot;Whore.&quot; The slowcore band Low included an early, previously unreleased cover of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; on their career-spanning box set in 2007. Ampere and New Bomb Turks have both covered Wire&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Suit&quot;. The British electronic band Ladytron included Wire&#x27;s &quot;The 15th&quot; on the mix compilation &quot;Softcore Jukebox&quot;. Ladytron member Reuben Wu claimed Wire as a musical influence.

A plagiarism case between Wire&#x27;s music publisher and Elastica over the similarity between Wire&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Three Girl Rhumba&quot; and Elastica&#x27;s 1995 hit &quot;Connection&quot; resulted in an out-of-court settlement. It has also been noted that two other songs on Elastica&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Line Up&quot; and &quot;2:1&quot;, both borrowed heavily from the Wire song &quot;I Am The Fly&quot;.

Alternative Press included Wire in their 1996 list of 100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years, stating that &quot;as long as there are listeners equally lured by tough, intelligent riffs and fearless experimentalism, Wire will remain a crucial benchmark.&quot;

Fischerspooner (who covered &quot;The 15th&quot; on their album &quot;#1&quot;), Britpop bands like Elastica and Menswe@r and post-punk revival bands like Bloc Party, Futureheads, Blacklist and Franz Ferdinand have cited Wire as an influence. The Smiths&#x27; Johnny Marr has confirmed that he is a fan of the band and has acknowledged that seeing Wire live helped give him the confidence to release his first solo album in 2013.

The chorus of Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Thieves&quot; was influenced by the Wire song &quot;Mr. Suit&quot;. Helmet guitarist Page Hamilton cites Wire as one of his &quot;top five bands&quot; and as an influence on his music.
