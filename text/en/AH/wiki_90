<text>Norfolk ( ) is a ceremonial county in England, located in East Anglia and officially part of the East of England region. It borders Lincolnshire and The Wash to the north-west, the North Sea to the north and east, Cambridgeshire to the west, and Suffolk to the south. The largest settlement is the city of Norwich.

The county has an area of and a population of 859,400. It is largely rural with few large towns: after Norwich (147,895), the largest settlements are King&#x27;s Lynn (42,800) in the north-west, Great Yarmouth (38,693) in the east, and Thetford (24,340) in the south. For local government purposes Norfolk is a non-metropolitan county with seven districts.

The centre of Norfolk is gently undulating lowland. To the east are the Broads, a network of rivers and lakes which extend into Suffolk and which are protected by the Broads Authority, which give them a similar status to a national park. To the west the county contains part of the Fens, an extremely flat former marsh, and to the south is part of Thetford Forest. The geology of the county includes clay and chalk deposits, which make its coast susceptible to erosion; the northern coast has been designated a national landscape.

There is evidence of Prehistoric settlement in Norfolk. In the Roman era the region was home to the Iceni, whose leader Boudica led a major revolt in AD60. The Angles settled the area in the fifth century, and it became part of the Kingdom of East Anglia. During the later Middle Ages the county was very prosperous and heavily involved in the wool trade; this allowed the construction of many large churches. 

In 1549 Norfolk was the scene of Kett&#x27;s Rebellion, which unsuccessfully protested the enclosure of land. The county was not heavily industrialised during the Industrial Revolution, and Norwich lost its status as one of England&#x27;s largest cities. The contemporary economy is largely based on agriculture and tourism.

==History==

The area that was to become Norfolk was settled in pre-Roman times (there were Palaeolithic settlers as early as 950,000 years ago), with camps along the higher land in the west, where flints could be quarried. A Brittonic tribe, the Iceni, emerged in the 1st century BC. The Iceni revolted against the Roman invasion in AD 47, and again in 60 led by Boudica. The crushing of the second rebellion opened the area to the Romans. During the Roman era roads and ports were constructed throughout the area and farming was widespread.

Situated on the east coast, the homelands of the Iceni were vulnerable to attacks from continental Europe and other parts of Britain, and forts were built to defend against raids by the Saxons and the Picts. A period of depopulation, which may have been due to these threats, seems to have followed the departure of the Romans. Soon afterward, Germanic peoples from the North Sea area settled in the region. Though they became known as Angles, they were likely not affiliated to any tribe in particular at the time of their migration. It is thought that the settlement here was early (possibly beginning at the start of the fifth century, thereby preceding the alleged date of Hengist and Horsa&#x27;s arrival in Kent) and that it occurred on a large scale.

By the 5th century the Angles had established control of the region and later became the &quot;north folk&quot; and the &quot;south folk&quot;; hence &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot;. Norfolk, Suffolk and several adjacent areas became the kingdom of East Anglia (one of the heptarchy), which later merged with Mercia and then with Wessex. The influence of the early English settlers can be seen in the many place names ending in &quot;-ham&quot;, &quot;-ingham&quot; and &quot;-ton&quot;. Endings such as &quot;-by&quot; and &quot;-thorpe&quot; are also fairly common, indicating Danish toponyms: in the 9th century the region again came under attack, this time from Danes who killed the king, Edmund the Martyr. Several place names around the Fenland area contain Celtic elements; this has been taken by some scholars to represent a possibly significant concentration of Britons in the area.

In the centuries before the Norman Conquest the wetlands of the east of the county began to be converted to farmland, and settlements grew in these areas. Migration into East Anglia must have been high: by the time of the Domesday Book survey it was one of the most densely populated parts of the British Isles. During the high and late Middle Ages the county developed arable agriculture and woollen industries. Norfolk&#x27;s prosperity at that time is evident from the county&#x27;s large number of medieval churches: out of an original total of over one thousand some 659 have survived, more than in any other county in Britain and the greatest concentration in the world. The economy was in decline by the time of the Black Death, which dramatically reduced the population in 1349.

Kett&#x27;s Rebellion occurred in Norfolk during the reign of Edward VI, largely in response to the enclosure of land by landlords, leaving peasants with nowhere to graze their animals, and to the general abuses of power by the nobility. It was led by Robert Kett, a yeoman farmer, who was joined by recruits from Norwich and the surrounding countryside. His group numbered some 16,000 by the time the rebels stormed Norwich on 29 July 1549 and took the city. Kett&#x27;s rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland at the Battle of Dussindale. Some 3,000 rebels were killed. Kett was captured, held in the Tower of London, tried for treason, and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle.

By the late 16th century Norwich had grown to become the second-largest city in England, but over one-third of its population died in the plague epidemic of 1579, and in 1665 the Great Plague again killed around one-third of the population. During the English Civil War Norfolk was largely Parliamentarian. The economy and agriculture of the region declined somewhat. During the Industrial Revolution Norfolk developed little industry, except in Norwich, which was a late addition to the railway network.

Early military units included the Norfolk Militia. In the 20th century the county developed a role in aviation. The first development in airfields came with the First World War; there was then a massive expansion during the Second World War with the growth of the Royal Air Force and the influx of the American USAAF 8th Air Force which operated from many Norfolk airfields.

The local British Army regiments included the Royal Norfolk Regiment (now the Royal Anglian Regiment) and the Norfolk Yeomanry.

During the Second World War agriculture rapidly intensified, and it has remained very intensive since, with the establishment of large fields for growing cereals and oilseed rape.

==Economy and industry==
In 1998 Norfolk had a Gross Domestic Product of £9,319 million, which represents 1.5% of England&#x27;s economy and 1.25% of the United Kingdom&#x27;s economy. The GDP per head was £11,825, compared to £13,635 for East Anglia, £12,845 for England and £12,438 for the United Kingdom. In 1999–2000 the county had an unemployment rate of 5.6%, compared to 5.8% for England and 6.0% for the UK.

Data from 2017 provided a useful update on the county&#x27;s economy. The median hourly gross pay was £12.17 and the median weekly pay was £496.80; on a per year basis, the median gross income was £25,458. The employment rate among persons aged 16 to 64 was 74.2% while the unemployment rate was 4.6%. The Norfolk economy was &quot;treading water with manufacturing sales and recruitment remaining static in the first quarter of the year&quot; according to research published in April 2018. A spokesperson for the
Norfolk Chamber of Commerce made this comment: &quot;At a time when Norfolk firms face steep up-front costs, the apprenticeship system is in crisis, roads are being allowed to crumble, mobile phone and broadband &#x27;not-spots&#x27; are multiplying, it&#x27;s obvious that the key to improved productivity and competitiveness lies in getting the basics right&quot;. The solution was seen as a need for the UK government to provide &quot;a far stronger domestic economic agenda ... to fix the fundamentals needed for business to thrive here...&quot;

In 2017, tourism was adding £3.25 billion to the economy per year and supported some 65,000 jobs, being the fifth most important employment in Norfolk. The visitor economy had increased in value by more than £500 million since 2012.
Important business sectors also include energy (oil, gas and renewables), advanced engineering and manufacturing, and food and farming.

Much of Norfolk&#x27;s fairly flat and fertile land has been drained for use as arable land. The principal arable crops are sugar beet, wheat, barley (for brewing) and oil seed rape. The county also boasts a saffron grower. Over 20% of employment in the county is in the agricultural and food industries.

Well-known companies in Norfolk are Aviva (formerly Norwich Union), Colman&#x27;s (part of Unilever), Lotus Cars and Bernard Matthews Farms. The Construction Industry Training Board is based on the former airfield of RAF Bircham Newton. Brewer Greene King, food producer Cranswick and feed supplier were seeing growth in 2016–2017.

A local enterprise partnership was being established by business leaders to help grow jobs across Norfolk and Suffolk. They secured an enterprise zone to help grow businesses in the energy sector, and established the two counties as a centre for growing services and products for the green economy.

To help local industry in Norwich, the local council offered a wireless internet service, but this was subsequently withdrawn as funding had ceased.

The fishery business still continued in 2018, with individuals such as John Lee, a fifth generation crabman, who sells Cromer Crabs to eateries such as M Restaurants and the Blueprint Café. The problem that he has found is attracting young people to this small industry which calls for working many hours per week during the season. Lobster trapping also continued in North Norfolk, around Sheringham and Cromer, for example.

===Management of the shoreline===
Norfolk&#x27;s low-lying land and easily eroded cliffs, many of which are composed of chalk and clay, make it vulnerable to weathering by the sea. The most recent major erosion event occurred during the North Sea flood of 1953.

The low-lying section of coast between Kelling and Lowestoft Ness in Suffolk is currently managed by the British Environment Agency to protect the Broads from sea flooding. Management policy for the North Norfolk coastline is described in the &quot;North Norfolk Shoreline Management Plan&quot; published in 2006, but has yet to be accepted by local authorities. The Shoreline Management Plan states that the stretch of coast will be protected for at least another 50 years, but that in the event of sea level rise and post-glacial lowering of land levels in the South East, there may a need for further research to inform future management decisions, including the possibility that the sea defences may have to be realigned to a more sustainable position. Natural England have contributed some research into the impacts on the environment of various realignment options. The draft report of their research was leaked to the press, who created great anxiety by reporting that Natural England plan to abandon a large section of the Norfolk Broads, villages and farmland to the sea to save the rest of the Norfolk coastline from the impact of any adverse climate change.

== Media ==
=== Television ===
The county is covered by BBC East and ITV Anglia, which both broadcast from Norwich. Television signals are received from the Tacolneston TV transmitter. However, northwestern parts of Norfolk including King&#x27;s Lynn, Hunstanton and Wells-next-the-Sea are covered by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, broadcasting from Hull, and ITV Yorkshire, which broadcast from Leeds. The area receives its television signals from the Belmont TV transmitter.

=== Radio ===
BBC Local Radio for the county is served by BBC Radio Norfolk. County-wide commercial radio stations are Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio East, Amber Radio, and Kiss. Community based stations are Future Radio (serving Norwich), Harbour Radio (for Great Yarmouth), KL1 Radio (covering North West Norfolk) and Poppyland Community Radio (serving North Norfolk).

=== Newspapers ===
Norfolk is served by these local newspapers:
* &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; (county-wide)
* &quot;Norwich Evening News&quot; (Norwich)
* &quot;Great Yarmouth Mercury&quot; (Great Yarmouth)

* &quot;Diss Express&quot; (Diss)
* &quot;North Norfolk News&quot; (North Norfolk)

==Education==

===Primary and secondary education===
Before 2011, Norfolk had a completely comprehensive state education or &quot;maintained&quot; system managed by Norfolk County Council, with secondary school age from 11 to 16 or in some schools with sixth forms, 18 years old. Since then, a number of schools formerly in the &quot;maintained&quot; system have left it to become academies, or members of academy groups. Others have become free schools. Both academies and free schools are still publicly funded by the Department of Education but are not with county council management.

In many of the rural areas, there is no nearby sixth form, and so sixth form colleges are found in larger towns. There are twelve private, or private schools, including Gresham&#x27;s School in Holt in the north of the county, Thetford Grammar School in Thetford, which is Britain&#x27;s fifth oldest extant school, Langley School in Loddon, and several in the city of Norwich, including Norwich School and Norwich High School for Girls. The King&#x27;s Lynn district has the largest school population. Norfolk is also home to Wymondham College, the UK&#x27;s largest remaining state boarding school.

===Tertiary education===
The University of East Anglia is located on the outskirts of Norwich, and Norwich University of the Arts is based in seven buildings in and around St George&#x27;s Street in the city centre, next to the River Wensum.

The City College Norwich and the College of West Anglia are colleges covering Norwich and King&#x27;s Lynn as well as Norfolk as a whole. Easton &amp; Otley College, west of Norwich, provides agriculture-based courses for the county, parts of Suffolk, and nationally.

The University of Suffolk also runs higher education courses in Norfolk, from multiple locations including Great Yarmouth College.

==Politics==

===Local===

Norfolk is administered by Norfolk County Council, which is the top tier local government authority, based at County Hall in Norwich. For details of the authority click on the link Norfolk County Council.

Below Norfolk County Council the county is divided into seven second tier district councils: Breckland District, Broadland District, Great Yarmouth Borough, King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough, North Norfolk District, Norwich City and South Norfolk District.

Below the second tier councils the majority of the county is divided into parish and town councils, the lowest tier of local government (the only exceptions being parts of Norwich and King&#x27;s Lynn urban areas).

Currently the Conservative Party control five of the seven district councils: Breckland District, Broadland District, King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough, Great Yarmouth Borough and South Norfolk District while Norwich City is controlled by the Labour Party and North Norfolk District by the Liberal Democrats.

Norfolk County Council has been under Conservative control since 2017. There have been two periods when the council has not been run by the Conservative Party, both when no party had overall control, these were 1993–2001 and 2013–2017.

===National===

The county is divided into ten parliamentary constituencies, with Waveney Valley straddling the border with Suffolk:
In the 1945 United Kingdom general election, all seats in Norfolk were won by the Labour Party and the National Liberal Party.

In the 2010 General Election seven seats were held by the Conservatives and two by the Liberal Democrats. The Labour Party no longer held the urban constituencies they once held in Norwich North and Great Yarmouth, leaving them with no MP&#x27;s in the whole of East Anglia; the former Labour Home Secretary Charles Clarke was a high level casualty of that election.

In the 2015 General Election seven seats were won by the Conservative Party, with Labour winning Norwich South and the Liberal Democrats winning North Norfolk.

In the 2017 General Election the 2015 result was repeated.

In the 2024 General Election, Norfolk became the only county in the United Kingdom to be represented by MPs from five different parties.

===Norwich Unitary Authority dispute (2006–2010)===
In October 2006, the Department for Communities and Local Government produced a Local Government White Paper inviting councils to submit proposals for unitary restructuring. In January 2007 Norwich submitted its proposal, but this was rejected in December 2007 as it did not meet the criteria for acceptance. In February 2008, the Boundary Committee for England (from 1 April 2010 incorporated in the Local Government Boundary Commission for England) was asked to consider alternative proposals for the whole or part of Norfolk, including whether Norwich should become a unitary authority, separate from Norfolk County Council. In December 2009, the Boundary Committee recommended a single unitary authority covering all of Norfolk, including Norwich.

However, on 10 February 2010, it was announced that, contrary to the December 2009 recommendation of the Boundary Committee, Norwich would be given separate unitary status. The proposed change was strongly resisted, principally by Norfolk County Council and the Conservative opposition in Parliament. Reacting to the announcement, Norfolk County Council issued a statement that it would seek leave to challenge the decision in the courts. A letter was leaked to the local media in which the Permanent Secretary for the Department for Communities and Local Government noted that the decision did not meet all the criteria and that the risk of it &quot;being successfully challenged in judicial review proceedings is very high&quot;. The Shadow Local Government and Planning Minister, Bob Neill, stated that should the Conservative Party win the 2010 general election, they would reverse the decision.

Following the 2010 general election, Eric Pickles was appointed Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government on 12 May 2010 in a Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government. According to press reports, he instructed his department to take urgent steps to reverse the decision and maintain the status quo in line with the Conservative Party manifesto. However, the unitary plans were supported by the Liberal Democrat group on the city council, and by Simon Wright, LibDem MP for Norwich South, who intended to lobby the party leadership to allow the changes to go ahead.

The Local Government Act 2010 to reverse the unitary decision for Norwich (and Exeter and Suffolk) received Royal Assent on 16 December 2010. The disputed award of unitary status had meanwhile been referred to the High Court, and on 21 June 2010 the court (Mr. Justice Ouseley, judge) ruled it unlawful, and revoked it. The city has therefore failed to attain unitary status, and the two-tier arrangement of County and District Councils (with Norwich City Council counted among the latter) remains as of 2017.

==Settlements==


Norfolk&#x27;s county town and only city is Norwich, one of the largest settlements in England during the Norman era. Norwich is home to the University of East Anglia, and is the county&#x27;s main business and culture centre. Other principal towns include the port town of King&#x27;s Lynn and the seaside resort and Broads gateway town of Great Yarmouth.

Based on the 2011 Census the county&#x27;s largest centres of population are:
Norwich (213,166),
Great Yarmouth (63,434),
King&#x27;s Lynn (46,093),
Thetford (24,883),
Dereham (20,651),
Wymondham (13,587),
North Walsham (12,463),
Attleborough (10,549),
Downham Market (9,994),
Diss (9,829),
Fakenham (8,285),
Cromer (7,749),
Sheringham (7,367)
and Swaffham (7,258).
There are also several smaller market towns: Aylsham (6,016), Harleston (4,458) and Holt (3,810).

Much of the county remains rural in nature and Norfolk is believed to have around 200 lost settlements which have been largely or totally depopulated since the medieval period. These include places lost to coastal erosion, agricultural enclosure, depopulation and the establishment of the Stanford Training Area in 1940.

==Transport==
=== Roads ===

Norfolk is one of the few counties in England that does not have a motorway. The A11 connects Norfolk to Cambridge and London, via the M11. From the west, there are only two routes from Norfolk that provide a direct link with the A1: the A47 to the East Midlands and Birmingham, via Peterborough, and the A17 to the East Midlands, via Lincolnshire. These two routes both meet at King&#x27;s Lynn, which is also the starting point of the A10, providing West Norfolk with a direct link with London, via Ely, Cambridge and Hertford.
===Railways===
There are two main railway lines that link Norfolk with London. The Great Eastern Main Line hosts inter-city services from to Liverpool Street, via and . The Fen line provides regular services between and King&#x27;s Cross, via and .

In addition, the Breckland line provides access from Norwich and to destinations to the west including , , , Manchester and Liverpool.

===Air===
Norwich Airport provides flights to various European destinations, including a link to Amsterdam which offers onward flights throughout the world.

==Dialect, accent and nickname==

The Norfolk dialect is also known as &quot;Broad Norfolk&quot;, although over the modern age much of the vocabulary and many of the phrases have died out due to a number of factors, such as radio, TV and people from other parts of the country coming to Norfolk. As a result, the speech of Norfolk is more of an accent than a dialect, though one part retained from the Norfolk dialect is the distinctive grammar of the region.

People from Norfolk are sometimes known as Norfolk Dumplings, an allusion to the flour dumplings that were traditionally a significant part of the local diet.

More cutting, perhaps, was the alleged pejorative medical slang term &quot;Normal for Norfolk&quot;, alluding to the county&#x27;s perceived status as a quirky rustic backwater due to a high level of inbreeding among residents.

==Tourism==
Norfolk is a popular tourist destination and has several major holiday attractions. There are many seaside resorts, including some of the finest British beaches, such as those at Great Yarmouth, Cromer and Holkham. Norfolk contains the Broads and other areas of outstanding natural beauty and many areas of the coast are wild bird sanctuaries and reserves with some areas designated as national parks such as the Norfolk Coast AONB.

The King&#x27;s residence at Sandringham House in Sandringham provides a year-round tourist attraction whilst the coast and some rural areas are popular locations for people from the conurbations to purchase weekend holiday homes. Arthur Conan Doyle first conceived the idea for &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; whilst holidaying in Cromer with Bertram Fletcher Robinson, after hearing local folklore tales regarding the mysterious hound known as Black Shuck.

===Amusement parks and zoos===

Norfolk has several amusement parks and zoos.

*Thrigby Hall near Great Yarmouth was built in 1736 by Joshua Smith Esquire and features a zoo which houses a large tiger enclosure, primate enclosures and the swamp house which has many crocodiles and alligators.
*Holkham Hall is an 18th-century stately home and visitor attraction, constructed in the Palladian style and at the centre of a 3,000-acre deer park on the North Norfolk coast with a woodland play area, walled garden and farming exhibition.
*Roarr! Dinosaur Adventure (formerly Dinosaur Adventure) is a dinosaur themed adventure park in Lenwade. It is set in 85 acres of parkland and has a dinosaur trail, indoor play area, high ropes course and outdoor water play area.
*Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach is a free-entry theme park, hosting over twenty large rides as well as a crazy golf course, water attractions, children&#x27;s rides and &quot;white knuckle&quot; rides.
*BeWILDerwood is an adventure park situated in the Norfolk Broads and is the setting for the book &quot;A Boggle at BeWILDerwood&quot; by local children&#x27;s author Tom Blofeld.
*Britannia Pier on the coast of Great Yarmouth has rides which include a ghost train. Also on the pier is the famous Britannia Pier Theatre.
*Banham Zoo is set amongst of parkland and gardens with enclosures for animals including big cats, birds of prey, siamangs and shire horses. Its annual visitor attendance is in excess of 200,000 people. 
*Pensthorpe Nature Reserve, near the town of Fakenham in north Norfolk, is a nature reserve with many captive birds and animals. Such species include native birds such as lapwing and Eurasian crane, to much more exotic examples like Marabou stork, Greater flamingo, and Manchurian crane. The site played host to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Springwatch&quot; from 2008 until 2010. A number of human-made lakes are home to a range of wild birds, and provide stop-off points for many wintering ducks and geese.
*The Sea Life Centre in Great Yarmouth is One of the biggest sea life centres in the country. The Great Yarmouth centre is home to a tropical shark display, one resident of which is Britain&#x27;s biggest shark &#x27;Nobby&#x27; the Nurse Shark. The same display, with its walk-through underwater tunnel, also features the wreckage of a World War II aircraft. The centre also includes over 50 native species including shrimps, starfish, sharks, stingrays and conger eels.
*The Sea Life Sanctuary in Hunstanton is Norfolk&#x27;s leading marine rescue centre and works both as a visitor attraction as well as a location for rescuing and rehabilitating sick and injured sea creatures found in the nearby Wash and North Sea. The attractions main features are similar to that of the Sea Life Centre in Great Yarmouth, albeit on a slightly smaller scale.

<text>The putamen (; from Latin, meaning &quot;nutshell&quot;) is a subcortical nucleus with a rounded structure, in the basal ganglia nuclear group. It is located at the base of the forebrain and above the midbrain. 

The putamen and caudate nucleus together form the dorsal striatum. Through various pathways, the putamen is connected to the substantia nigra, the globus pallidus, the claustrum, and the thalamus, in addition to many regions of the cerebral cortex. A primary function of the putamen is to regulate movements at various stages such as in preparation and execution; and to influence various types of learning. It employs GABA, acetylcholine, and enkephalin to perform its functions. The putamen also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==History==
The word &quot;putamen&quot; is from Latin, referring to that which &quot;falls off in pruning&quot;, from &quot;putare&quot;, meaning &quot;to prune, to think, or to consider&quot;.

Most MRI research was focused broadly on the basal ganglia as a whole, for reasons such as poor resolution or hemorrhage within the putamen. Later studies have focused on the basal ganglia and relevant brain-behavior relationships. In the 1970s, the first single-unit recordings were carried out with monkeys, monitoring pallidal neuronal activity related to movement. Since then, more extensive neuronal tracing, stimulation, and imaging research methods including functional MRI, and diffusion weighted MRI that allow for investigation of the putamen have been developed.

==Anatomy==

The putamen is a structure in the forebrain. Along with the caudate nucleus it forms the dorsal striatum. The caudate and putamen contain the same types of neurons and circuits – many neuroanatomists consider the dorsal striatum to be a single structure, divided into two parts by a large fiber tract, the internal capsule, passing through the middle. The putamen, together with the globus pallidus, makes up the lentiform nucleus. The putamen is the outermost portion of the basal ganglia. These are a group of nuclei in the brain that are interconnected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. The basal ganglia include the striatum, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, and the subthalamic nucleus.

In mammals, the basal ganglia are associated with motor control, cognition, emotions, learning, and domain-general functions important for executive functioning as well as support for domain-specific languages. The basal ganglia are located bilaterally, and have rostral and caudal divisions. The putamen is located in the rostral division as part of the striatum. The basal ganglia receive input from the cerebral cortex, via the striatum.

===Caudate nucleus===
The caudate works with the putamen to receive the input from cerebral cortex. Collectively, they can be considered the &quot;entrance&quot; to the basal ganglia. Projections from the putamen reach the caudate directly via the caudolenticular grey bridges. The putamen and caudate are jointly connected with the substantia nigra, however the caudate outputs more densely to the substantia nigra pars reticulata while the putamen sends more afferents to the internal globus pallidus.

===Substantia nigra===
The substantia nigra contains two parts: the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). The SNpc obtains input from the putamen and caudate, and sends information back. The SNpr also obtains input from the putamen and caudate. However, it sends the input outside the basal ganglia to control head and eye movements. The SNpc produces dopamine, which is crucial for movements. The SNpc degenerates during Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

===Globus pallidus===
The globus pallidus contains two parts: the external globus pallidus (GPe) and the internal globus pallidus (GPi). Both regions acquire input from the putamen and caudate and communicate with the subthalamic nucleus. However, mostly the GPi sends GABAergic inhibitory output to the thalamus. The GPi also sends projections to parts of the midbrain, which have been assumed to affect posture control.

==Physiology==

===Types of pathways===
The putamen (and striatum in general) has numerous, parallel circuits that allow for cortico-subcortico-cortico communication loops. These have been described, broadly, as the direct, indirect, and hyper direct pathways. GABAergic projections of the putamen have an inhibitory effect on the thalamus. Thalamic projections from the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei have an excitatory effect on the putamen. Unlike the thalamus, which has broad reciprocal connectivity, cortical projections with the putamen are afferent, thus sending information as opposed to receiving it. Cortical communication is accomplished via multi-fiber pathways as outlined previously (i.e. via other subcortical structures).

===Dopamine===
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that has a dominant role in the putamen, most of it is supplied from the substantia nigra. When a cell body of a neuron (in the putamen or caudate nuclei) fires an action potential, dopamine is released from the presynaptic terminal. Since projections from the putamen and caudate nuclei modulate the dendrites of the substantia nigra, the dopamine influences the substantia nigra, which affects motor planning. This same mechanism is involved in drug addiction. In order to control the amount of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, and the amount of dopamine binding to post synaptic terminals, presynaptic dopaminergic neurons function to reuptake the excess dopamine.

===Other neurotransmitters===
The putamen also plays a role in modulation of other neurotransmitters. It releases GABA, enkephalin, substance P, and acetylcholine. It receives serotonin and glutamate.

==Function: motor skills==
The putamen is interconnected with many other structures, and works in conjunction with them to influence many types of motor behaviors. These include motor planning, learning, and execution, motor preparation, specifying amplitudes of movement, and movement sequences.

Some neurologists hypothesize that the putamen also plays a role in the selection of movement (e.g. Tourette syndrome) and the &quot;automatic&quot; performance of previously learned movements (e.g. Parkinson&#x27;s disease).

In one study it was found that the putamen controls limb movement. The goal of this study was to determine whether particular cell activity in the putamen of primates was related to the direction of limb movement or to the underlying pattern of muscular activity. Two monkeys were trained to perform tasks that involved the movement of loads. The tasks were created so that movement could be distinguished from muscle activity. Neurons in the putamen were selected for monitoring only if they were related both to the task and to arm movements outside the task. It was shown that 50% of the neurons that were monitored were related to the direction of movement, independent of the load.

Another study was done to investigate movement extent and speed using PET mapping of regional cerebral blood flow in 13 humans. Movement tasks were performed with a joystick-controlled cursor. Statistical tests were done to calculate the extent of movements and what regions of the brain the movements correlate to. It was found that &quot;increasing movement extent was associated with parallel increases of rCBF in bilateral basal ganglia (BG; putamen and globus pallidus) and ipsilateral cerebellum.&quot; This not only shows that the putamen affects movement but it also shows that the putamen integrates with other structures in order to perform tasks.

One study was done in order to specifically investigate how the basal ganglia influences the learning of sequential movements. Two monkeys were trained to press a series of buttons in sequence. The methods used were designed to be able to monitor the well-learned tasks versus the new tasks. Muscimol was injected into various parts of the basal ganglia, and it was found that &quot;the learning of new sequences became deficient after injections in the anterior caudate and putamen, but not the middle-posterior putamen&quot;. This shows that different areas of the striatum are utilized when performing various aspects of the learning of sequential movements.

==Role in learning==
In many studies, it has become apparent that the putamen plays a role in many types of learning. Some examples are listed below:

===Reinforcement and implicit learning===
Along with various types of movement, the putamen also affects reinforcement learning and implicit learning.

Reinforcement learning is interacting with the environment and catering actions to maximize the outcome. Implicit learning is a passive process where people are exposed to information and acquire knowledge through exposure. Although the exact mechanisms are not known, it is clear that dopamine and tonically active neurons play a key role here. Tonically active neurons are cholinergic interneurons that fire during the entire duration of the stimulus and fire at about 0.5–3 impulses per second. Phasic neurons are the opposite and only fire an action potential when movement occurs.

===Category learning===
One particular study used patients with focal lesions on the basal ganglia (specifically the putamen) due to stroke in order to study category learning. The advantage to using these types of patients is that dopaminergic projections to the prefrontal cortex are more likely to be intact. Also, in these patients, it is easier to relate specific brain structures to function because the lesion only occurs in a specific place. The goal of this study was to determine whether or not these lesions affect rule-based and information-integration task learning. Rule-based tasks are learned via hypothesis-testing dependent on working memory. Information-integration tasks are ones wherein the accuracy is maximized when information from two sources are integrated at a pre-decisional stage, which follows a procedural-based system.

Seven participants with basal ganglia lesions were used in the experiment, along with nine control participants. It is important to note that the caudate was not affected. The participants were tested for each type of learning during separate sessions, so the information processes would not interfere with each other. During each session, participants sat in front of a computer screen and various lines were displayed. These lines were created by using a randomization technique where random samples were taken from one of four categories. For ruled-based testing, these samples were used to construct lines of various length and orientation that fell into these four separate categories. After the stimulus was displayed, the subjects were asked to press 1 of 4 buttons to indicate which category the line fell into. The same process was repeated for information-integration tasks, and the same stimuli were used, except that the category boundaries were rotated 45°. This rotation causes the subject to integrate the quantitative information about the line before determining what category it is in.

It was found that subjects in the experimental group were impaired while performing rule-based tasks, but not information-integration ones. After statistical testing, it was also hypothesized that the brain began using information-integration techniques to solve the rule-based learning tasks. Since rule-based tasks use the hypothesis-testing system of the brain, it can be concluded that the hypothesis-testing system of the brain was damaged/weakened. It is known that the caudate and working memories are part of this system. Therefore, it was confirmed that the putamen is involved in category learning, competition between the systems, feed-back processing in rule-based tasks, and is involved in the processing of pre-frontal regions (which relate to working memory and executive functioning). Now it is known that not only the basal ganglia and caudate affect category learning.

==Role in &quot;hate circuit&quot;==
Tentative studies have suggested that the putamen may play a role in the so-called &quot;hate circuit&quot; of the brain. A recent study was done by the department of cell and developmental biology at University College London. An fMRI was carried out on subjects while they viewed a picture of people they hated and people who were &quot;neutral&quot;. During the experiment, a &quot;hate score&quot; was recorded for each picture. The activity in subcortical areas of the brain implied that the &quot;hate circuit&quot; involves the superior frontal gyrus, the putamen and the insula. It has been theorized that the &quot;putamen plays a role in the perception of contempt and disgust, and may be part of the motor system that&#x27;s mobilized to take action.&quot; It was also found that the amount of activity in the hate circuit correlates with the amount of hate a person declares, which could have legal implications concerning malicious crimes.

==Role in transgender individuals==
The putamen of transgender women was found to have significantly larger amounts of grey matter compared to the putamen of cisgender men. This possibly suggests that a difference in the putamen may exist between trans women and cisgender men.

==Pathology==

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
After discovering the function of the putamen, it has become apparent to neurologists that the putamen and other parts of the basal ganglia play an important role in Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other diseases that involve the degeneration of neurons.

Parkinson&#x27;s disease is the slow and steady loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. In Parkinson&#x27;s disease the putamen plays a key role because its inputs and outputs are interconnected to the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus. In Parkinson&#x27;s disease the activity in direct pathways to interior globus pallidus decreases and activity in indirect pathways to external globus pallidus increases. It has also been noted that Parkinson&#x27;s patients have a difficult time with motor planning.

===Other diseases and disorders===
The following diseases and disorders are linked with the putamen:

* Cognitive decline in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease
* Huntington&#x27;s disease
* Wilson&#x27;s disease
* Dementia with Lewy bodies
* Corticobasal degeneration
* Tourette syndrome
* Schizophrenia
* Depression
* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
* Chorea
* Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
* Kernicterus
* Other anxiety disorders

==In other animals==
The putamen in humans is relatively similar in structure and function to other animals. Therefore, many studies on the putamen have been done on animals (monkeys, rats, cats, etc.), as well as humans. However, inter-species variations are indeed observed in mammals, and have been documented for white matter putaminal connectivity. Variation is primarily related to structural connectivity patterns, while somatotopic organization principles are retained. Primate research since the 1980s through to the present has established that cortical regions related to higher-order cognition primarily send afferent neurons to the rostral-most portion of the putamen, while the remainder of this structure in primates primarily serves sensorimotor functions and is densely interconnected with primary and supplementary motor regions.

<text>The striatum (: striata) or corpus striatum is a cluster of interconnected nuclei that make up the largest structure of the subcortical basal ganglia. The striatum is a critical component of the motor and reward systems; receives glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs from different sources; and serves as the primary input to the rest of the basal ganglia.

Functionally, the striatum coordinates multiple aspects of cognition, including both motor and action planning, decision-making, motivation, reinforcement, and reward perception. The striatum is made up of the caudate nucleus and the lentiform nucleus. However, some authors believe it is made up of caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum. The lentiform nucleus is made up of the larger putamen, and the smaller globus pallidus. Strictly speaking the globus pallidus is part of the striatum. It is common practice, however, to implicitly exclude the globus pallidus when referring to striatal structures.

In primates, the striatum is divided into the ventral striatum and the dorsal striatum, subdivisions that are based upon function and connections. The ventral striatum consists of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. The dorsal striatum consists of the caudate nucleus and the putamen. A white matter nerve tract (the internal capsule) in the dorsal striatum separates the caudate nucleus and the putamen. Anatomically, the term &quot;striatum&quot; describes its striped (striated) appearance of grey-and-white matter.

==Structure==
The striatum is the largest structure of the basal ganglia. The striatum is divided into two subdivisions, a ventral striatum and a dorsal striatum, based upon function and connections. It is also divisible into a matrix and embedded striosomes.

===Ventral striatum===
The ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. The nucleus accumbens is made up of the nucleus accumbens core and the nucleus accumbens shell, which differ by neural populations. The olfactory tubercle receives input from the olfactory bulb but has not been shown to play a role in processing smell. In non-primate species, the islands of Calleja are included. The ventral striatum is associated with the limbic system and has been implicated as a vital part of the circuitry for decision making and reward-related behavior.

===Dorsal striatum===
The dorsal striatum is composed of the caudate nucleus and the putamen.
Primarily it mediates cognition and involves motor and executive function. The dorsal striatum can be further subdivided into the dorsomedial striatum, and the dorsolateral striatum. Both of these areas have different roles in the acquisition of learnt behaviour and skill formation. The dorsomedial region receives projections from the frontal and the parietal cortices. The dorsolateral region receives projections from the sensorimotor cortex.

====Matrix and striosomes====
Neurochemistry studies have used staining techniques on the striatum that have identified two distinct striatal compartments, the matrix, and the striosome (or patch). The matrix is seen to be rich in acetylcholinesterase, while the embedded striosomes are acetylcholinesterase-poor. The matrix forms the bulk of the striatum, and receives input from most areas of the cerebral cortex. Clusters of neurons in the matrix, called matrisomes receive a similar input. Their output goes to both regions of the globus pallidus and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata.

The striosomes receive input from the prefrontal cortex and give outputs to the substantia nigra pars compacta. There are more striosomes present in the dorsal striatum making up 10-15% of the striatal volume, than in the ventral striatum.

===Cell types===

Types of cells in the striatum include:
* Medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are the principal neurons of the striatum. They are GABAergic and, thus, are classified as inhibitory neurons. Medium spiny projection neurons comprise 95% of the total neuronal population of the human striatum. Medium spiny neurons have two characteristic types: D1-type MSNs and D2-type MSNs. A subpopulation of MSNs contain both D1-type and D2-type receptors, with approximately 40% of striatal MSNs expressing both DRD1 and DRD2 mRNA.
* Cholinergic interneurons release acetylcholine, which has a variety of important effects in the striatum. In humans, other primates, and rodents, these interneurons respond to salient environmental stimuli with stereotyped responses that are temporally aligned with the responses of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. The large aspiny cholinergic interneurons themselves are affected by dopamine through D5 dopamine receptors. Dopamine also directly controls communication between cholinergic interneurons.
* There are many types of GABAergic interneurons. The best known are parvalbumin expressing interneurons, also known as fast-spiking interneurons, which participate in powerful feedforward inhibition of principal neurons. Also, there are GABAergic interneurons that express tyrosine hydroxylase, somatostatin, nitric oxide synthase and neuropeptide-y. Recently, two types of neuropeptide-y expressing GABAergic interneurons have been described in detail, one of which translates synchronous activity of cholinergic interneurons into inhibition of principal neurons. These neurons of the striatum are not distributed evenly.

There are two regions of neurogenesis in the brain – the subventricular zone (SVZ) in the lateral ventricles, and the dentate gyrus in the hippocampal formation. Neuroblasts that form in the lateral ventricle adjacent to the striatum, integrate in the striatum. This has been noted in the human striatum following an ischemic stroke. Injury caused to the striatum stimulates the migration of neuroblasts from the SVZ, to the striatum, where they differentiate into adult neurons. The normal passage of SVZ neuroblasts is to the olfactory bulb but this traffic is diverted to the striatum after an ischemic stroke. However, few of the new developed neurons survive.

===Inputs===
The largest connection is from the cortex, in terms of cell axons. Many parts of the neocortex the dorsal striatum. The cortical pyramidal neurons projecting to the striatum are located in layers II-VI, with the most dense projections come from layer V. They end mainly on the dendritic spines of the spiny neurons. They are glutamatergic, exciting striatal neurons.

The striatum is seen as having its own internal microcircuitry. The ventral striatum receives direct input from multiple regions in the cerebral cortex and limbic structures such as the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, as well as the entorhinal cortex and the inferior temporal gyrus. Its primary input is to the basal ganglia system. Additionally, the mesolimbic pathway projects from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum.

Another well-known afferent is the nigrostriatal connection arising from the neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. While cortical axons synapse mainly on spine heads of spiny neurons, nigral axons synapse mainly on spine shafts.
In primates, the thalamostriatal afferent comes from the central median-parafascicular complex of the thalamus (see primate basal ganglia system). This afferent is glutamatergic. The participation of truly intralaminar neurons is much more limited.
The striatum also receives afferents from other elements of the basal ganglia such as the subthalamic nucleus (glutamatergic) or the external globus pallidus (GABAergic).

===Targets===

The primary outputs of the ventral striatum project to the ventral pallidum, then the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, which is part of the frontostriatal circuit. Additionally, the ventral striatum projects to the globus pallidus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Some of its other outputs include projections to the extended amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and pedunculopontine nucleus.

Striatal outputs from both the dorsal and ventral components are primarily composed of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a type of projection neuron, which have two primary phenotypes: &quot;indirect&quot; MSNs that express D2-like receptors and &quot;direct&quot; MSNs that express D1-like receptors.

The main nucleus of the basal ganglia is the striatum which projects directly to the globus pallidus via a pathway of striatopallidal fibers. The striato-pallidal pathway has a whitish appearance due to the myelinated fibers. This projection comprises successively the external globus pallidus (GPe), the internal globus pallidus (GPi), the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNc), and the pars reticulata of substantia nigra (SNr). The neurons of this projection are inhibited by GABAergic synapses from the dorsal striatum. Among these targets, the GPe does not send axons outside the system. Others send axons to the superior colliculus. Two others comprise the output to the thalamus, forming two separate channels: one through the internal segment of the globus pallidus to the ventral oralis nuclei of the thalamus and from there to the cortical supplementary motor area and another through the substantia nigra to the ventral anterior nuclei of the thalamus and from there to the frontal cortex and the occulomotor cortex.

===Blood supply===
Deep penetrating striate arteries supply blood to the striatum. These arteries include the recurrent artery of Heubner arising from the anterior cerebral artery, and the lenticulostriate arteries arising from the middle cerebral artery.

==Function==

The ventral striatum, and the nucleus accumbens in particular, primarily mediates reward, cognition, reinforcement, and motivational salience. By contrast, the dorsal striatum primarily mediates cognition involving motor function, certain executive functions (e.g., inhibitory control and impulsivity), and stimulus-response learning. There is a small degree of overlap, as the dorsal striatum is also a component of the reward system that, along with the nucleus accumbens core, mediates the encoding of new motor programs associated with future reward acquisition (e.g., the conditioned motor response to a reward cue).

The striatum is also thought to play a role in an at least partially dissociable executive control network for language, applied to both verbal working memory and verbal attention. These models take the form of a frontal-striatal network for language processing. While the striatum is often not included in models of language processing, as most models only include cortical regions, integrative models are becoming more popular in light of imaging studies, lesion studies on aphasic patients, and studies of language disorders concomitant with diseases known to affect the striatum like Parkinson&#x27;s and Huntington&#x27;s disease.

Metabotropic dopamine receptors are present both on spiny neurons and on cortical axon terminals. Second messenger cascades triggered by activation of these dopamine receptors can modulate pre- and postsynaptic function, both in the short term and in the long term. In humans, the striatum is activated by stimuli associated with reward, but also by aversive, novel, unexpected, or intense stimuli, and cues associated with such events. fMRI evidence suggests that the common property linking these stimuli, to which the striatum is reacting, is salience under the conditions of presentation. A number of other brain areas and circuits are also related to reward, such as frontal areas. Functional maps of the striatum reveal interactions with widely distributed regions of the cerebral cortex important to a diverse range of functions.

The interplay between the striatum and the prefrontal cortex is relevant for behavior, particularly adolescent development as proposed by the dual systems model.

==Clinical significance==

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other movement disorders===
Parkinson&#x27;s disease results in loss of dopaminergic innervation to the dorsal striatum (and other basal ganglia) and a cascade of consequences. Atrophy of the striatum is also involved in Huntington&#x27;s disease, and movement disorders such as chorea, choreoathetosis, and dyskinesias. These have also been described as &quot;circuit disorders&quot; of the basal ganglia.

===Addiction===

Addiction, a disorder of the brain&#x27;s reward system, arises through the overexpression of DeltaFosB (ΔFosB), a transcription factor, in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the ventral striatum. ΔFosB is an inducible gene which is increasingly expressed in the nucleus accumbens as a result of repeatedly using an addictive drug or overexposure to other addictive stimuli.

===Bipolar disorder===
An association has been observed between striatal expression of variants of the PDE10A gene and some bipolar I disorder patients. Variants of other genes, DISC1 and GNAS, have been associated with bipolar II disorder.

===Autism spectrum disorder===

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by cognitive inflexibility and poor understanding of social systems. This inflexible behavior originates in defects in the pre-frontal cortex as well as the striatal circuits. The defects in the striatum seem to specifically contribute to the motor, social and communication impairments seen in ASD patients. In mice which have an ASD-like phenotype induced via the overexpression of the eukaryotic initiation of translation factor 4E, it has been shown that these defects seem to stem from the reduced ability to store and process information in the striatum, which leads to the difficulty seen in forming new motor patterns, as well as disengaging from existing ones.

===Dysfunction===

Dysfunction in the ventral striatum can lead to a variety of disorders, most notably depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Because of its involvement in reward pathways, the ventral striatum has also been implicated in playing a critical role in addiction. It has been well established that the ventral striatum is strongly involved in mediating the reinforcing effects of drugs, especially stimulants, through dopaminergic stimulation.

=== Language disorders ===
Lesions to the striatum have been associated with deficits in speech production and comprehension. While striatal damage can impact all levels of language, damage can broadly be characterized as affecting the ability to manipulate linguistic units and rules, resulting in the promotion of default linguistic forms in conflicting situations in which selection, inhibition, and monitoring load is increased. Two subregions of the striatum have been shown to be particularly important in language: the caudate nucleus and left putamen. Lesions localized to the caudate nucleus, as well as direct electrical stimulation, can result in lexical paraphasias and perservations (continuations of an utterance after the stimulus has ceased), which is associated with inhibited executive control, in the sense that executive control allows for the selection of the best choice among competing alternatives). Stimulation of the putamen results in the inhibition of articulatory sequences and the inability to initiate motor speech commands.

==History==
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the term &quot;corpus striatum&quot; was used to designate many distinct, deep, infracortical elements of the hemisphere. Etymologically, it is derived from (Latin) &quot;striatus&quot; = &quot;grooved, striated&quot; and the English &quot;striated&quot; = having parallel lines or grooves on the surface. In 1876 David Ferrier contributed decades of research to the subject; concluding that the corpus striatum was vital in the &quot;organization and generation of voluntary movement&quot;. In 1941, Cécile and Oskar Vogt simplified the nomenclature by proposing the term &quot;striatum&quot; for all elements in the basal ganglia built with striatal elements: the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the fundus striati, which is the ventral part linking the two preceding together ventrally to the inferior part of the internal capsule.

The term neostriatum was coined by comparative anatomists comparing the subcortical structures between vertebrates, because it was thought to be a phylogenetically newer section of the corpus striatum. The term is still used by some sources, including Medical Subject Headings.

==Other animals==
In birds the term used was the &quot;paleostriatum augmentatum&quot;, and in the new avian terminology listing (as of 2002) for &quot;neostriatum&quot; this has been changed to the &quot;nidopallium&quot;.

In non-primate species, the islands of Calleja are included in the ventral striatum.

<doc id="37612" wikidata="Q19773264" url="?curid=37612" title="Voicelessness">
<text>In linguistics, voicelessness is the property of sounds being pronounced without the larynx vibrating. Phonologically, it is a type of phonation, which contrasts with other states of the larynx, but some object that the word phonation implies voicing and that voicelessness is the lack of phonation.

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) has distinct letters for many voiceless and modally voiced pairs of consonants (the obstruents), such as . Also, there are diacritics for voicelessness, and , which is used for letters with a descender. Diacritics are typically used with letters for prototypically voiced sounds, such as vowels and sonorant consonants: .
In Russian use of the IPA, the voicing diacritic may be turned for voicelessness, e.g. .

==Voiceless vowels and other sonorants==
Sonorants are sounds such as vowels and nasals that are voiced in most of the world&#x27;s languages. However, in some languages sonorants may be voiceless, usually allophonically. For example, the Japanese word &quot;sukiyaki&quot; is pronounced and may sound like to an English speaker, but the lips can be seen to compress for the . Something similar happens in English words like &quot;peculiar&quot; and &quot;potato&quot; .

Voiceless vowels are also an areal feature in languages of the American Southwest (like Hopi and Keres), the Great Basin (including all Numic languages), and the Great Plains, where they are present in Numic Comanche but also in Algonquian Cheyenne, and the Caddoan language Arikara. It also occurs in Woleaian, in contrast to the other Micronesian languages, which instead delete it outright.

Sonorants may also be contrastively, not just environmentally, voiceless. Standard Tibetan, for example, has a voiceless in &quot;Lhasa&quot;, which sounds similar to but is less noisy than the voiceless lateral fricative in Welsh; it contrasts with a modally voiced . Welsh contrasts several voiceless sonorants: , , , and , the last represented by &quot;rh&quot;.

In Moksha, there is even a voiceless palatal approximant (written in Cyrillic as &quot;jh&quot;) along with and (written as &quot;lh&quot; and &quot;rh&quot;). The last two have palatalized counterparts and ( and ). Kildin Sami has also .

Contrastively voiceless vowels have been reported several times without ever being verified (L&amp;M 1996:315).

==Lack of voicing contrast in obstruents==
Many languages lack a distinction between voiced and voiceless obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives). This is the case in nearly all Australian languages, and is widespread elsewhere, for example in Mandarin Chinese, Korean, Danish, Estonian and the Polynesian languages.

In many such languages, obstruents are realized as voiced in voiced environments, such as between vowels or between a vowel and a nasal, and voiceless elsewhere, such as at the beginning or end of the word or next to another obstruent. That is the case in Dravidian and Australian languages and in Korean but not in Mandarin or Polynesian. Usually, the variable sounds are transcribed with the voiceless IPA letters, but for Australian languages, the letters for voiced consonants are often used.

It appears that voicelessness is not a single phenomenon in such languages. In some, such as the Polynesian languages, the vocal folds are required to actively open to allow an unimpeded (silent) airstream, which is sometimes called a &quot;breathed&quot; phonation (not to be confused with breathy voice). In others, such as many Australian languages, voicing ceases during the hold of a stop (few Australian languages have any other kind of obstruent) because airflow is insufficient to sustain it, and if the vocal folds open, that is only from passive relaxation.

Thus, Polynesian stops are reported to be held for longer than Australian stops and are seldom voiced, but Australian stops are prone to having voiced variants (L&amp;M 1996:53), and the languages are often represented as having no phonemically voiceless consonants at all.

In Southeast Asia, when stops occur at the end of a word, they are voiceless because the glottis is closed, not open, so they are said to be unphonated (have no phonation) by some phoneticians, who considered &quot;breathed&quot; voicelessness to be a phonation.

Yidiny consonants have no underlyingly voiceless consonants.

<doc id="37613" wikidata="Q208491" url="?curid=37613" title="BBC News (international TV channel)">
<text>BBC News (known as BBC World News until 2023) is an international English-language pay television channel owned by BBC Global News Ltd. – a subsidiary of BBC Studios – and operated by the BBC News division of the BBC. The network carries news bulletins, documentaries, and other factual programmes; it broadcasts from studios in London, Washington, D.C., and Singapore. As of April 2023, the channel largely operates as an international feed of the BBC News channel in the UK, sharing the majority of its schedule.

Launched on 11 March 1991 as BBC World Service Television outside Europe, its name was changed to BBC World on 16 January 1995 and to BBC World News on 21 April 2008 and again to BBC News (International) on 3 April 2023 after its consolidation with the domestic BBC News Channel. According to the BBC, the combined seven channels of the Global News operations have the largest audience market share among all its rivals, with an estimated 99 million viewers weekly in 2016–2017, part of the estimated 121 million weekly audience of all its operations.

Unlike the BBC&#x27;s domestic channels, it is funded by subscription and advertising revenues, and not by the United Kingdom television licence. As such, the channel is not broadcast in the UK directly, although selected programmes and bulletins have been carried on the domestic BBC News channel (especially during overnight hours), and vice versa (including domestic programmes such as &quot;Click&quot; and &quot;HARDtalk&quot;, and during breaking news and special events in the UK).

In April 2023, the BBC began to further consolidate the programming and talent of the two channels as part of a corporation-wide streamlining of operations, with both channels now using the BBC News branding. The international feed remains an advertising-supported service, but the two services are structured to use a common schedule with domestic opt-outs for UK-specific news coverage and programmes.

==History==

The channel originally started as BBC World Service Television and was a commercial operation. The British government refused to fund the new television service using grant-in-aid. (BBC World Service radio was funded by a grant-in-aid from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office until 2014.) The channel started broadcasting on 11 March 1991, after two weeks of real-time pilots, initially as a half-hour bulletin once a day at 19:00GMT.

On Thursday, 26 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT, BBC World Service Television was split into two services:
*BBC World started broadcasting on Monday, 16 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT and became a 24-hour English free-to-air international news channel.
*BBC Prime started broadcasting on Monday, 30 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT and became the BBC&#x27;s light entertainment channel, later replaced by &quot;BBC Entertainment&quot;.

BBC World&#x27;s on-air design was changed significantly on 3 April 2000, bringing it closer to the look of its sister channel in the UK which was then known as BBC News 24, the on-air look of which had been redesigned in 1999. The look of both channels was made up of red and cream and designed by Lambie-Nairn, with music based on a style described as &#x27;drums and beeps&#x27; composed by David Lowe, a departure from the general orchestral nature of music used by other news programmes.

On 8 December 2003, a second makeover, using the same &#x27;drums and beeps&#x27; style music but new graphics took place, although on a much smaller scale than that of 2000. The music was changed slightly, while the main colour scheme became black and red, with studios using frosted glass and white and red colours. Later in 2004, the channel&#x27;s slogan became &quot;Putting News First&quot;, replacing &quot;Demand a Broader View&quot;.

On 21 April 2008, as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC&#x27;s overall news output and visual identity, the channel was rebranded as &quot;BBC World News&quot;. It later moved to the renovated studio vacated by BBC News 24 (now the BBC News Channel). New graphics were produced by the Lambie-Nairn agency and the music was reworked by David Lowe. 

===Move to Broadcasting House===
The channel relocated to Broadcasting House from its previous home at Television Centre on 14 January 2013. This was part of the move of BBC News and other audio and vision departments of the BBC into one building in Central London. Broadcasting House was refurbished for £1 billion. A new newsroom and several state-of-the-art studios were built.

===Consolidation with the domestic BBC News channel===
On 26 May 2022, as part of planned cuts and streamlining across the broadcaster, the BBC announced plans for consolidation of the domestic BBC News channel in the UK with BBC World News. The domestic and international versions would share a larger amount of content while maintaining the ability for opt-outs when necessary. The BBC promoted the service as offering &quot;new flagship programmes built around high-profile journalists, and programmes commissioned for multiple platforms&quot;. In preparation for the expansion, the BBC began to add additional staff to its Washington, D.C. bureau.

The first stage of these changes took effect on 3 April 2023, when the BBC World News channel changed its name to BBC News, and began to consolidate its on-air lineups and programming with the UK BBC News channel. This resulted in layoffs of about 50 employees, including presenters David Eades, Joanna Gosling, and Tim Willcox. Despite the changes, the international feed of BBC News – which continues to be distributed by BBC Studios – still opts out of programmes that are specific to UK audiences, such as simulcasts of BBC One news bulletins and &quot;Newsnight&quot;. &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; has reported that in response to concerns over the arrangement by the telecom and broadcasting regulator Ofcom, BBC News was considering allowing for more UK-specific opt-outs.

==Broadcasting==
Live news output originates from studios B, C and E in Broadcasting House with some recorded programming from Broadcasting House studios A and D and the BBC Millbank studio, as well as Manchester, Nairobi, Singapore and Washington, D.C. The BBC News newsroom is now part of the new consolidated BBC Newsroom in Broadcasting House along with BBC World Service and UK domestic news services.

Previously, the channel was broadcast in 4:3, with the news output fitted into a 14:9 frame for both digital and analogue broadcasting, resulting in black bands at the top and bottom of the screen. On 13 January 2009 at 09:57 GMT, the then-named BBC World News switched its broadcast to 16:9 format, initially in Europe on the Astra 1L satellite, and then, from 20 January 2009, on the Eutelsat Hot Bird 6 satellite which fed other broadcast feeds in the Asian region. The channel ceased broadcasting on analogue satellite on 18 April 2006.

===High-definition===
As a result of the move to Broadcasting House, BBC News gained new studios and equipment to be able to broadcast in high-definition. On 5 August 2013, the international feed of BBC News was offered as a High Definition (HD) feed across the Middle East when it launched its international HD channel on the Arab Satellite Communications Organization. Arabsat was the BBC&#x27;s first distribution partner in the Middle East to offer the channel in HD. On 1 April 2015, the then-named BBC World News Channel started broadcasting in high definition on the 11.229 GHz/V transponder on Astra 1KR at the 19.2°E orbital position, available free-to-air to viewers with 60 cm dishes across Europe and coastal North Africa.

===Worldwide===
BBC News claims to be watched by a weekly audience of 74 million in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. BBC News is most commonly watched as a free-to-air (FTA) channel. The channel is available in Europe and many parts of the world via subscription television providers in cable, satellite, IPTV and streaming platforms.

In the United States, the channel is available through providers such as Cablevision, Comcast, Spectrum, Verizon Fios, and U-verse TV. As of 2023, the American distribution and advertising sales for the channel are handled by AMC Networks, who own and operate BBC America under license from the BBC.

In addition, BBC News syndicates its daytime and evening news programmes to public television stations throughout the US, originally maintaining a distribution partnership with Garden City, New York-based WLIW that lasted from 1998 until October 2008, when the BBC and WLIW mutually decided not to renew the contract. BBC News subsequently entered into an agreement with Community Television of Southern California, Inc., in which Los Angeles PBS member station KCET (which was a public independent station from 2011 to 2018) would take over distribution rights to &quot;BBC World News America&quot; (the KCET agreement has since been extended to encompass a half-hour simulcast of the 90-minute-long midday news bulletin &quot;GMT&quot;, which airs in the US as a morning show, and a weekly edition of the BBC news-magazine &quot;Newsnight&quot;). 

Since June 2019, the distribution of the programme has been handled by Washington, D.C. PBS member WETA, which also produces other networked news and public affairs programmes such as the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; and &quot;Washington Week&quot;. PBS separately began distributing another programme aired by the channel, &quot;Beyond 100 Days&quot;, as a tape-delayed late night broadcast on 2 January 2018, as an interim replacement for &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;. Unlike &quot;GMT&quot; and &quot;BBC World News America&quot;, &quot;Beyond 100 Days&quot; is distributed exclusively to PBS member stations as part of the service&#x27;s base schedule.

China banned BBC News in 2021, although access had already been heavily restricted before then and what was carried was censored, with parts of the show being blacked out by censors operating live. It was banned because of its coverage of the persecution of Uyghur people in China and in retaliation for CGTN being banned from the British market for violating national broadcast regulations.

===Online===
The channel is available in the US as part of Sling&#x27;s World News add-on package.

The international feed of BBC News was available on LiveStation from 2012 until the platform closed in 2016, along with the UK simulcast.

The channel was added to various free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) platforms in the United States, including Pluto TV, Xumo Play, Samsung TV Plus, and Sling Freestream, in March 2024. Apart from advertising, the FAST version of the channel is identical to the version already available through traditional U.S. cable and satellite providers.

===United Kingdom===
The TV platforms in the UK (i.e. Freeview, Sky, BT TV, Freesat, Virgin) do not officially offer the international feed of BBC News as a standalone full-time channel because it carries, and is funded by, advertising. (The BBC&#x27;s domestic channels are funded by a television licence fee which households and establishments that want to watch television programmes as they are being broadcast must pay). However, it can be easily received due to its free-to-air status on many European satellite systems, including Astra and Hot Bird, and is available in selected London hotels. The UK&#x27;s TV platforms, however, do provide the UK feed of BBC News channel, which carries much of the same programming. The international feed of BBC News can also be viewed in the public areas of Broadcasting House (in the lobby and café).

However, some programmes are officially available to UK audiences through the channel&#x27;s UK feed. Such programmes air on the BBC&#x27;s domestic channels, and some are available on demand on the BBC&#x27;s iPlayer. From 00:00 to 05:00 UK time, the top-of-the-hour news bulletins are broadcast on both the UK and international feeds of the channel. At 01:30 on weekdays, &quot;Asia Business Report&quot; and &quot;Sport Today&quot; also air on both channels. There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of &quot;The Briefing&quot; and &quot;Business Briefing&quot; on BBC One and the BBC News channel. This programme was previously branded as &quot;The World Today&quot; (later a generic BBC World News bulletin) and &quot;World Business Report&quot; respectively. At 08:30 UK time, &quot;Worklife&quot; airs on the BBC News Channel. BBC News also produces a version of &quot;Outside Source&quot; at 21:00 UK time Monday–Thursday (shown on the BBC News Channel), &quot;World News Today&quot; at 19:00 Monday–Friday (shown on BBC Four), and 21:00 Friday–Sunday (shown on the BBC News Channel). &quot;World News Today&quot; replaced &quot;The World&quot;, which had been broadcast as a simulcast on BBC Four between 2002 and 2007.

The COVID-19 pandemic saw an increase of simulcasts between BBC News and BBC World News with simulcasting running through the morning (10:00 to 11:00) that was also shared with BBC Two, and the evening (19:00 to 20:00 &amp; 12:00 to 22:00). The additional simulcasting was made permanent in August 2020. Consequently, the two channels now simulcast every day from 10:00 to 11:00; on weekdays from 19:00 to 06:00, apart from the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot; and for an hour at 20:00; and between 21:00 to 06:00, apart from the evening BBC One bulletin, over the weekend.

The BBC implemented a wider consolidation of the networks&#x27; lineups in April 2023.

===BBC News bulletins===

Half-hour &quot;BBC News&quot; bulletins are made available to PBS stations in the US through Los Angeles&#x27;s KCET, a non-commercial independent public television station which has been separate from PBS since the beginning of 2011 due to a rights-fee dispute (it returned to being a minor PBS member station in 2019 after a merger with the major PBS member-station in the market). 80 to 90% of Americans can receive the bulletins, with PBS member stations having scheduling discretion. The programme is broadcast on several PBS stations in markets such as New York City and Washington DC.

On PBS stations, &quot;BBC News&quot; is not broadcast with traditional commercials (the breaks are filled with news stories) but omits the Met Office international weather forecast at the end of the programme, replacing it with underwriting announcements. The PBS broadcasts are tape-delayed on some stations.

BBC America formerly aired a three-hour block of BBC News programmes from 05:00 to 08:00 on weekdays, until the stabilisation of the network&#x27;s carriage in the United States. Met Office forecasts were removed, and it was broadcast with advertisements.

Many airlines around the world also play pre-recorded extracts of BBC News, have text headlines from it, or have a full bulletin available on the in-flight entertainment systems.

===Previous bulletins===
Another BBC World News programme, the hour-long &quot;BBC World News America&quot;, aired on BBC America at 19:00 ET. A second broadcast at 22:00 ET ended in 2010 when BBC America introduced a second feed for the western time zones of the US. On 18 February 2011, it was announced that &quot;BBC World News America&quot; would no longer be broadcast on BBC America and would instead be broadcast only on BBC World and local PBS stations in the US as a 30-minute programme.

The channel also produced short bulletins for public transport services in Singapore and Hong Kong:
*Singapore Mass Rapid Transit service from Marina Bay to Changi International Airport
*Hong Kong MTR service from Chek Lap Kok International Airport-Disneyland Resort station to Disneyland Resort line

These broadcasts began with the statement: &quot;Welcome to BBC World News on board the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit and Hong Kong MTR&quot;. The short bulletin was updated twice a day and has since been replaced by a similar programme from Mediacorp&#x27;s CNA.

Travellers on the Heathrow Express rail service between London Paddington and Heathrow Airport could watch a summary of the headlines from BBC World News on the LCD screens provided.

==Presentation==

BBC News is, for the most part, the same channel around the world; the commercials are intended to be the only differences. However, there are some regional programming variations. For example, several programmes are made exclusively for regional viewings, such as the Indian feeds, and &quot;The Record Europe&quot;, which is only broadcast in Europe. Also, the weather forecasts focus more on the area the viewer is watching from.

On most feeds of BBC News, when no commercials are being inserted by the cable or satellite provider similar to other channels, the break filler shows promotions for upcoming programmes on the channel. During BBC News, a news story that has not been promoted airs during what would be the television advertisement. This is the case on the broadband versions of BBC News, and on versions of BBC News aired in the US on PBS stations. However, there are some global commercials and sponsorships which air throughout the network.

On 11 September 2007, the break filler was redesigned and now more closely resembles previous versions. The promotional videos now fill the entire screen and are interspersed with news and market updates, schedules, and other information. There is also no longer a unifying music composition. Instead, each 20-second promotional video uses music selected from a handful of themes, which have some unifying musical characteristics. The information screens, such as the 10-second plug for the website or the YouTube channel, and the 15-second weather/time/coming-up screens each feature their theme. The colour theme was updated following the relaunch of the channel in April 2008.

Since its inception, and more so since its extensive association with the BBC News channel, the countdown to the hourly news bulletin has been a feature of the channel&#x27;s presentation, accompanied by music composed by David Lowe. The current style of countdown features reporters and technical staff in many different locations working to bring news stories to air. The new countdown keeps the same music, but with Chameleon-style branding and a clock relocated to the middle from the bottom right corner, similar in style to that of BBC Alba. The countdown can range from 45 seconds to as little as 3 seconds.

==Awards==
The then-called BBC World News was named &quot;Best International News Channel&quot; at the Association for International Broadcasting Awards in November 2006. It won a Peabody Award in 2007 for &quot;White Horse Village&quot; and another in 2009 for &quot;Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence.&quot;

<text>A finger is a prominent digit on the forelimbs of most tetrapod vertebrate animals, especially those with prehensile extremities (i.e. hands) such as humans and other primates. Most tetrapods have five digits (pentadactyly), and short digits (i.e. significantly shorter than the metacarpal/metatarsals) are typically referred to as toes, while those that are notably elongated are called fingers. In humans, the fingers are flexibly articulated and opposable, serving as an important organ of tactile sensation and fine movements, which are crucial to the dexterity of the hands and the ability to grasp and manipulate objects.

== Land vertebrate fingers ==

As terrestrial vertebrates were evolved from lobe-finned fish, their forelimbs are phylogenetically equivalent to the pectoral fins of fish. Within the taxa of the terrestrial vertebrates, the basic pentadactyl plan, and thus also the metacarpals and phalanges, undergo many variations.
Morphologically the different fingers of terrestrial vertebrates are homolog. The wings of birds and those of bats are not homologous, they are analogue flight organs. However, the phalanges within them are homologous.

Chimpanzees have lower limbs that are specialized for manipulation, and (arguably) have fingers (instead of toes) on their lower limbs as well. In the case of primates in general, the digits of the hand are overwhelmingly referred to as &quot;fingers&quot;. Primate fingers have both fingernails and fingerprints.

Research has been carried out on the embryonic development of domestic chickens showing that an interdigital webbing forms between the tissues that become the toes, which subsequently regresses by apoptosis. If apoptosis fails to occur, the interdigital skin remains intact. Many animals have developed webbed feet or skin between the fingers from this like the Wallace&#x27;s flying frog.

== Human fingers ==
Usually humans have five digits, the bones of which are termed phalanges, on each hand, although some people have more or fewer than five due to congenital disorders such as polydactyly or oligodactyly, or accidental or intentional amputations. The first digit is the thumb, followed by the index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger or pinkie. According to different definitions, the thumb can be called a finger, or not.

English dictionaries describe finger as meaning either one of the five digits including the thumb, or one of the four digits excluding the thumb (in which case they are numbered from 1 to 4 starting with the index finger closest to the thumb).

===Structure===

====Skeleton====

The thumb (connected to the trapezium) is located on one of the sides, parallel to the arm.

The palm has five bones known as metacarpal bones, one to each of the five digits. Human hands contain fourteen digital bones, also called phalanges, or phalanx bones: two in the thumb (the thumb has no middle phalanx) and three in each of the four fingers. These are the distal phalanx, carrying the nail, the middle phalanx, and the proximal phalanx.
Joints are formed wherever two or more of these bones meet. Each of the fingers has three joints:

*metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) – the joint at the base of the finger
*proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) – the joint in the middle of the finger
*distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) – the joint closest to the fingertip.

Sesamoid bones are small ossified nodes embedded in the tendons to provide extra leverage and reduce pressure on the underlying tissue. Many exist around the palm at the bases of the digits; the exact number varies between different people.

The articulations are: interphalangeal articulations between phalangeal bones, and metacarpophalangeal joints connecting the phalanges to the metacarpal bones.

====Muscles====

Each finger may flex and extend, abduct and adduct, and so also circumduct. Flexion is by far the strongest movement. In humans, there are two large muscles that produce flexion of each finger, and additional muscles that augment the movement. The muscle bulks that move each finger may be partly blended, and the tendons may be attached to each other by a net of fibrous tissue, preventing completely free movement. Although each finger seems to move independently, moving one finger also moves the other fingers slightly which is called finger interdependence or finger enslaving.

Fingers do not contain muscles (other than arrector pili). The muscles that move the finger joints are in the palm and forearm. The long tendons that deliver motion from the forearm muscles may be observed to move under the skin at the wrist and on the back of the hand.

Muscles of the fingers can be subdivided into extrinsic and intrinsic muscles.
The extrinsic muscles are the long flexors and extensors. They are called extrinsic because the muscle belly is located on the forearm.

The fingers have two long flexors, located on the underside of the forearm. They insert by tendons to the phalanges of the fingers. The deep flexor attaches to the distal phalanx, and the superficial flexor attaches to the middle phalanx. The flexors allow for the actual bending of the fingers. The thumb has one long flexor and a short flexor in the thenar muscle group. The human thumb also has other muscles in the thenar group (opponens and abductor brevis muscle), moving the thumb in opposition, making grasping possible.

The extensors are located on the back of the forearm and are connected in a more complex way than the flexors to the dorsum of the fingers. The tendons unite with the interosseous and lumbrical muscles to form the extensorhood mechanism. The primary function of the extensors is to straighten out the digits. The thumb has two extensors in the forearm; the tendons of these form the anatomical snuff box. Also, the index finger and the little finger have an extra extensor, used for instance for pointing. The extensors are situated within six separate compartments. The first compartment contains abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis. The second compartment contains extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis. The third compartment contains extensor pollicis longus. The extensor digitorum indicis and extensor digitorum communis are within the fourth compartment. Extensor digiti minimi is in the fifth, and extensor carpi ulnaris is in the sixth.

The intrinsic muscle groups are the thenar and hypothenar muscles (thenar referring to the thumb, hypothenar to the small finger), the dorsal and palmar interossei muscles (between the metacarpal bones) and the lumbrical muscles. The lumbricals arise from the deep flexor (and are special because they have no bony origin) and insert on the dorsal extensor hood mechanism.

====Skin====
Aside from the genitals, the fingertips possess the highest concentration of touch receptors and thermoreceptors among all areas of the human skin, making them extremely sensitive to temperature, pressure, vibration, texture and moisture. A study in 2013 suggested fingers can feel nano-scale wrinkles on a seemingly smooth surface, a level of sensitivity not previously recorded. This makes the fingers commonly used sensory probes to ascertain properties of objects encountered in the world, making them prone to injury.

The &quot; of a finger&quot; is the fleshy mass on the palmar aspect of the extremity of the finger.

====Fingertip wrinkling in water====
Although a common phenomenon, the underlying functions and mechanism of fingertip wrinkling following immersion in water are relatively unexplored. Originally it was assumed that the wrinkles were simply the result of the skin swelling in water, but it is now understood that the furrows are caused by the blood vessels constricting due to signalling by the sympathetic nervous system in response to water exposure. One hypothesis for why this occurs, the &quot;rain tread&quot; hypothesis, posits that the wrinkles may help the fingers grip things when wet, possibly being an adaption from a time when humans dealt with rain and dew in forested primate habitats. A 2013 study supporting this hypothesis found that the wrinkled fingertips provided better handling of wet objects but gave no advantage for handling dry objects. However, a 2014 study attempting to reproduce these results was unable to demonstrate any improvement of handling wet objects with wrinkled fingertips.

====Regrowth of the fingertips====
Fingertips, after having been torn off children, have been observed to regrow in less than 8 weeks. However, these fingertips do not look the same, although they do look more appealing than a skin graft or a sewn fingertip. No healing occurs if the tear happens below the nail. This works because the distal phalanges are regenerative in youth, and stem cells in the nails create new tissue that ends up as the fingertip.

====Brain representation====
Each finger has an orderly somatotopic representation on the cerebral cortex in the somatosensory cortex area 3b, part of area 1 and a distributed, overlapping representations in the supplementary motor area and primary motor area.

The somatosensory cortex representation of the hand is a dynamic reflection of the fingers on the external hand: in syndactyly people have a clubhand of webbed, shortened fingers. However, not only are the fingers of their hands fused, but the cortical maps of their individual fingers also form a club hand. The fingers can be surgically divided to make a more useful hand. Surgeons did this at the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery in New York to a 32-year-old man with the initials O. G.. They touched O. G.&#x27;s fingers before and after surgery while using MRI brain scans. Before the surgery, the fingers mapped onto his brain were fused close together; afterward, the maps of his individual fingers did indeed separate and take the layout corresponding to a normal hand.

===Clinical significance===

====Anomalies, injuries and diseases====

A rare anatomical variation affects 1 in 500 humans, in which the individual has more than the usual number of digits; this is known as polydactyly. A human may also be born without one or more fingers or underdevelopment of some fingers such as symbrachydactyly. Extra fingers can be functional. One individual with seven fingers not only used them but claimed that they &quot;gave him some advantages in playing the piano&quot;.

Phalanges are commonly fractured. A damaged tendon can cause significant loss of function in fine motor control, such as with a mallet finger. They can be damaged by cold, including frostbite and non-freezing cold injury (NFCI); and heat, including burns.

The fingers are commonly affected by diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Individuals with diabetes often use the fingers to obtain blood samples for regular blood sugar testing. Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon and Paroxysmal hand hematoma are neurovascular disorders that affect the fingers.

Research has linked the ratio of lengths between the index and ring fingers to higher levels of testosterone, and to various physical and behavioral traits such as penis length and risk for development of alcohol dependence or video game addiction.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;finger&quot; stems from Old English &quot;finger&quot;, ultimately from Proto-Germanic &#x27; (&#x27;finger&#x27;). It is cognate with Gothic &#x27;, Old Norse &#x27;, or Old High German &#x27;. Linguists generally assume that &#x27; is a &quot;ro&quot;-stem deriving from a previous form &#x27;, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot; (&#x27;five&#x27;).

The name pinkie derives from Dutch , of uncertain origin. In English only the digits on the hand are known as fingers. However, in some languages the translated version of fingers can mean either the digits on the hand or feet. In English a digit on a foot has the distinct name of toe.

<text>Venus (; ) is a Roman goddess whose functions encompass love, beauty, desire, sex, fertility, prosperity, and victory. In Roman mythology, she was the ancestor of the Roman people through her son, Aeneas, who survived the fall of Troy and fled to Italy. Julius Caesar claimed her as his ancestor. Venus was central to many religious festivals, and was revered in Roman religion under numerous cult titles.

The Romans adapted the myths and iconography of her Greek counterpart Aphrodite for Roman art and Latin literature. In the later classical tradition of the West, Venus became one of the most widely referenced deities of Greco-Roman mythology as the embodiment of love and sexuality. As such, she is usually depicted nude.

== Etymology ==
The Latin theonym and the common noun (&#x27;love, charm&#x27;) stem from a Proto-Italic form reconstructed as &quot;*wenos-&quot; (&#x27;desire&#x27;), itself from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) &quot;&quot; (&#x27;desire&#x27;; cf. Messapic , Old Indic &#x27;desire&#x27;).

Derivatives include &quot;venustus&quot; (&#x27;attractive, charming&#x27;), &quot;venustās&quot; (&#x27;charm, grace&#x27;), &quot;venerius&quot; (&#x27;of Venus, erotic&#x27;), &quot;venerāre&quot; (&#x27;to adore, revere, honor, venerate, worship&#x27;), and &quot;venerātiō&quot; (&#x27;adoration&#x27;). &quot;Venus&quot; is also cognate with Latin (&#x27;favour, permission&#x27;) and (&#x27;to hunt&#x27;) through to common PIE root &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to strive for, wish for, desire, love&#x27;). 

== Origins ==
Venus has been described as perhaps &quot;the most original creation of the Roman pantheon&quot;, and &quot;an ill-defined and assimilative&quot; native goddess, combined &quot;with a strange and exotic Aphrodite&quot;. Her cults may represent the religiously legitimate charm and seduction of the divine by mortals, in contrast to the formal, contractual relations between most members of Rome&#x27;s official pantheon and the state, and the unofficial, illicit manipulation of divine forces through magic. The ambivalence of her persuasive functions has been perceived in the relationship of the root &quot;*wenos-&quot; with its Latin derivative &quot;venenum&quot; (&#x27;poison&#x27;; from &quot;*wenes-no&quot; &#x27;love drink&#x27; or &#x27;addicting&#x27;), in the sense of &quot;a charm, magic philtre&quot;.

Venus seems to have had no origin myth until her association with Greek Aphrodite. Venus-Aphrodite emerged, already in adult form, from the sea foam (Greek αφρός, &quot;aphros&quot;) produced by the severed genitals of Caelus-Uranus. Roman theology presents Venus as the yielding, watery female principle, essential to the generation and balance of life. Her male counterparts in the Roman pantheon, Vulcan and Mars, are active and fiery. Venus absorbs and tempers the male essence, uniting the opposites of male and female in mutual affection. She is essentially assimilative and benign, and embraces several otherwise quite disparate functions. She can give military victory, sexual success, good fortune and prosperity. In one context, she is a goddess of prostitutes; in another, she turns the hearts of men and women from sexual vice to virtue. Varro&#x27;s theology identifies Venus with water as an aspect of the female principle. To generate life, the watery matrix of the womb requires the virile warmth of fire. To sustain life, water and fire must be balanced; excess of either one, or their mutual antagonism, is unproductive or destructive.

Prospective brides offered Venus a gift &quot;before the wedding&quot;; the nature of the gift, and its timing, are unknown. The wedding ceremony itself, and the state of lawful marriage, belonged to Juno – whose mythology allows her only a single marriage, and no divorce from her habitually errant spouse, Jupiter – but Venus and Juno are also likely &quot;bookends&quot; for the ceremony; Venus prepares the bride for &quot;conubial bliss&quot; and expectations of fertility within lawful marriage. Some Roman sources say that girls who come of age offer their toys to Venus; it is unclear where the offering is made, and others say this gift is to the Lares. In dice-games played with knucklebones, a popular pastime among Romans of all classes, the luckiest, best possible roll was known as &quot;Venus&quot;.

== Epithets ==
Like other major Roman deities, Venus was given a number of epithets that referred to her different cult aspects, roles, and her functional similarities to other deities. Her &quot;original powers seem to have been extended largely by the fondness of the Romans for folk-etymology, and by the prevalence of the religious idea &quot;nomen-omen&quot; which sanctioned any identifications made in this way.&quot;

Venus Acidalia, in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (1.715–22, as &quot;mater acidalia&quot;). Servius speculates this &quot;rare&quot; and &quot;strangely recondite epithet&quot; as reference to a mooted &quot;Fountain of Acidalia&quot; (&quot;fons acidalia&quot;) where the Graces (Venus&#x27; daughters) were said to bathe; but he also connects it to the Greek word for &quot;dart&quot;, &quot;needle&quot;, &quot;arrow&quot;, whence &quot;love&#x27;s arrows&quot; and love&#x27;s bitter &quot;cares and pangs&quot;. Ovid uses &quot;acidalia&quot; only in the latter sense. &quot;Venus Acidalia&quot; is likely a literary conceit, formed by Virgil from earlier usages in which &quot;acidalia&quot; had no evident connection to Venus. It was almost certainly not a cultic epithet.

Venus Anadyomene (Venus &quot;rising from the sea&quot;), based on a once-famous painting by the Greek artist Apelles showing the birth of Aphrodite from sea-foam, fully adult and supported by a more-than-lifesized scallop shell. The Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli used the type in his The Birth of Venus. Other versions of Venus&#x27; birth show her standing on land or shoreline, wringing the sea-water from her hair. 

Venus Barbata (&quot;Bearded Venus&quot;), mentioned in Servius&#x27; commentary on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Macrobius&#x27;s Saturnalia describes a statue of Venus in Cyprus, bearded, with male genitalia but in female attire and figure (see also Aphroditus). Her worshippers cross-dressed - men wore women&#x27;s clothes, and women wore men&#x27;s. Macrobius says that Aristophanes called this figure &quot;Aphroditos&quot;. The Latin poet Laevius wrote of worshipping &quot;nurturing Venus&quot; whether female or male &quot;(sive femina sive mas)&quot;. Several examples of Greek and Roman sculpture show her in the attitude &quot;anasyrmene&quot;, from the Greek verb &quot;anasyromai&quot;, &quot;to pull up one&#x27;s clothes&quot; to reveal her male genitalia. The gesture traditionally held apotropaic or magical power.

Venus Caelestis (Celestial or Heavenly Venus), used from the 2nd century AD for Venus as an aspect of a syncretised supreme goddess. &quot;Venus Caelestis&quot; is the earliest known Roman recipient of a taurobolium (a form of bull sacrifice), performed at her shrine in Pozzuoli on 5 October 134. This form of the goddess, and the taurobolium, are associated with the &quot;Syrian Goddess&quot;, understood as a late equivalent to Astarte, or the Roman Magna Mater, the latter being another supposedly Trojan &quot;Mother of the Romans&quot;, as well as &quot;Mother of the Gods&quot;.

Venus Calva (&quot;Venus the bald one&quot;), a legendary form of Venus, attested only by post-Classical Roman writings which offer several traditions to explain this appearance and epithet. In one, it commemorates the virtuous offer by Roman matrons of their own hair to make bowstrings during a siege of Rome. In another, king Ancus Marcius&#x27; wife and other Roman women lost their hair during an epidemic; in hope of its restoration, unafflicted women sacrificed their own hair to Venus.
 

Venus Cloacina (&quot;Venus the Purifier&quot;); a fusion of Venus with the Etruscan water goddess Cloacina, who had an ancient shrine above the outfall of the Cloaca Maxima, originally a stream, later covered over to function as Rome&#x27;s main sewer. The rites conducted at the shrine were probably meant to purify the culvert&#x27;s polluted waters and noxious airs. In some traditions, Titus Tatius was responsible for the introduction of lawful marriage to Rome, and Venus-Cloacina promoted, protected and purified sexual intercourse between married couples.

Venus Erycina (&quot;Erycine Venus&quot;), a Punic statue of Astarte captured from Eryx, in Sicily, and worshiped in Romanised form by the elite and respectable matrons at a temple on the Capitoline Hill. A later temple, outside the Porta Collina and Rome&#x27;s sacred boundary, may have preserved some Erycine features of her cult. It was considered suitable for &quot;common girls&quot; and prostitutes.

Venus Euploia (Venus of the &quot;fair voyage&quot;), also known as Venus Pontia (Venus of the Sea&quot;), because she smooths the waves for mariners. She is probably based on the influential image of Aphrodite by Praxiteles, once housed in a temple by the sea but now lost. Most copies of its Venus image would have been supported by dolphins, and worn diadems and carved veils, inferring her birth from sea-foam, and a consequent identity as Queen of the Sea, and patron of sailors and navigation. Roman copies would have embellished baths and gymnasiums. 

Venus Frutis honoured by all the Latins with a federal cult at the temple named &quot;Frutinal&quot; in Lavinium. Inscriptions found at Lavinium attest the presence of federal cults, without giving precise details.

Venus Felix (&quot;Lucky Venus&quot;), probably a traditional epithet, combining aspects of Venus and Fortuna, goddess of both good and bad fortune and personification of luck, whose iconography includes the rudder of a ship, found in some Pompeian examples of the regal &quot;Venus Physica&quot;. A form of Venus usually identified as Venus Felix was adopted by the dictator Sulla to legitimise his victories over his domestic and foreign opponents during Rome&#x27;s late Republican civil and foreign wars; Rives finds it very unlikely that Sulla would have imposed this humiliating connection on unwilling or conquered domestic territories once allied to Samnium, such as Pompei.
The emperor Hadrian built a temple to &quot;Venus Felix et Roma Aeterna&quot; on the Via Sacra. The same epithet is used for a specific sculpture at the Vatican Museums.
Venus Genetrix (&quot;Venus the Mother&quot;), as a goddess of motherhood and domesticity, with a festival on September 26, a personal ancestress of the Julian lineage and, more broadly, the divine ancestress of the Roman people. Julius Caesar dedicated a Temple of Venus Genetrix in 46 BC. This name has attached to an iconological type of statue of Aphrodite/Venus.
Venus Heliopolitana (&quot;Venus of Heliopolis Syriaca&quot;), a Romano-Syrian form of Venus at Baalbek, variously identified with Ashtart, Dea Syria and Atargatis, though inconsistently and often on very slender grounds. She has been historically identified as one third of a so-called Heliopolitan Triad, and thus a wife to presumed sun-god &quot;Syrian Jupiter&quot; (Baal) and mother of &quot;Syrian Mercury&quot; (Adon). The &quot;Syrian Mercury&quot; is sometimes thought as another sun-god, or a syncretised form of Bacchus as a &quot;dying and rising&quot; god, and thus a god of Springtime. No such Triad seems to have existed prior to Baalbek&#x27;s 15 BC colonisation by Augustus&#x27; veterans. It may be a modern scholarly artifice.

Venus Kallipygos (&quot;Venus with the beautiful buttocks&quot;), a statue, and possibly a statue type, after a lost Greek original. From Syracuse, Sicily.

Venus Libertina (&quot;Venus the Freedwoman&quot;), probably arising through the semantic similarity and cultural links between &quot;libertina&quot; (as &quot;a free woman&quot;) and &quot;lubentina&quot; (possibly meaning &quot;pleasurable&quot; or &quot;passionate&quot;). Further titles or variants acquired by Venus through the same process, or through orthographic variance, include Libentia, Lubentina, and Lubentini. Venus Libitina links Venus to a patron-goddess of funerals and undertakers, Libitina, who also became synonymous with death; a temple was dedicated to Venus Libitina in Libitina&#x27;s grove on the Esquiline Hill, &quot;hardly later than 300 BC&quot;.
Venus Murcia (&quot;Venus of the Myrtle&quot;), merging Venus with the little-known deity Murcia (or Murcus, or Murtia). Murcia was associated with Rome&#x27;s Mons Murcia (the Aventine&#x27;s lesser height), and had a shrine in the Circus Maximus. Some sources associate her with the myrtle-tree. Christian writers described her as a goddess of sloth and laziness.

Venus Obsequens (&quot;Indulgent Venus&quot;), Venus&#x27; first attested Roman epithet. It was used in the dedication of her first Roman temple, on August 19 in 295 BC during the Third Samnite War by Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges. It was sited somewhere near the Aventine Hill and Circus Maximus, and played a central role in the Vinalia Rustica. It was supposedly funded by fines imposed on women found guilty of adultery.

Venus Physica, Venus as a universal, natural creative force that informs the physical world. She is addressed as &quot;Alma Venus&quot; (&quot;Mother Venus&quot;) by Lucretius in the introductory lines of his vivid, poetic exposition of Epicurean physics and philosophy, &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot;. She seems to have been a favourite of Lucretius&#x27; patron, Memmius. 

Venus Physica Pompeiana was Pompeii&#x27;s protective goddess, antedating Sulla&#x27;s imposition of a colonia named &quot;Colonia Veneria Cornelia&quot; after his family and Venus, following his siege and capture of Pompeii from the Samnites. Venus also had a distinctive, local form as Venus Pescatrice (&quot;Venus the Fisher-woman&quot;) a goddess of the sea, and trade. For Sulla&#x27;s claims of Venus&#x27; favour, see &quot;Venus Felix&quot; above). Pompeii&#x27;s Temple of Venus was built sometime in the 1st century BC, before Sulla&#x27;s colonisation. This local form of Venus had Roman, Oscan and local Pompeiian influences. Like &quot;Venus Physica&quot;, &quot;Venus Physica Pompeiana&quot; is also a regal form of &quot;Nature Mother&quot; and a guarantor of success in love.

Venus Urania (&quot;Heavenly Venus&quot;), used as the title of a book by Basilius von Ramdohr, a relief by Pompeo Marchesi, and a painting by Christian Griepenkerl. (cf. Aphrodite Urania)

Venus Verticordia (&quot;Venus the Changer of Hearts&quot;), celebrated at the Veneralia for her ability to transform untethered desire (&quot;libido)&quot; into &quot;pudicitia&quot;, sexuality expressed within socially permitted bounds, hence marriage. 

Venus Victrix (&quot;Venus the Victorious&quot;), a Romanised aspect of the armed Aphrodite that Greeks had inherited from the East, where the goddess Ishtar &quot;remained a goddess of war, and Venus could bring victory to a Sulla or a Caesar&quot;. Pompey vied with his patron Sulla and with Caesar for public recognition as her protégé. In 55 BC he dedicated a temple to her at the top of his theater in the Campus Martius. She had a shrine on the Capitoline Hill, and festivals on August 12 and October 9. A sacrifice was annually dedicated to her on the latter date. In neo-classical art, her epithet as Victrix is often used in the sense of &#x27;Venus Victorious over men&#x27;s hearts&#x27; or in the context of the Judgement of Paris (e.g. Canova&#x27;s &quot;Venus Victrix&quot;, a half-nude reclining portrait of Pauline Bonaparte).

== Cult history and temples ==
The first known temple to Venus was vowed to &quot;Venus Obsequens&quot; by Q. Fabius Gurges in the heat of a battle against the Samnites. It was dedicated in 295 BC, at a site near the Aventine Hill, and was supposedly funded by fines imposed on Roman women for sexual misdemeanours. Its rites and character were probably influenced by or based on Greek Aphrodite&#x27;s cults, which were already diffused in various forms throughout Italian Magna Graeca. Its dedication date connects &quot;Venus Obsequens&quot; to the &quot;Vinalia rustica&quot; festival.

In 217 BC, in the early stages of the Second Punic War with Carthage, Rome suffered a disastrous defeat at the battle of Lake Trasimene. The Sibylline oracle suggested that Carthage might be defeated if the Venus of Eryx (), patron goddess of Carthage&#x27;s Sicilian allies, could be persuaded to change her allegiance. Rome laid siege to Eryx and promised its goddess a magnificent temple as reward for her defection. They captured her image, brought it to Rome and installed it in a temple on the Capitoline Hill, as one of Rome&#x27;s twelve &quot;&quot;. Shorn of her more overtly Carthaginian characteristics, this &quot;foreign Venus&quot; became Rome&#x27;s &quot;Venus Genetrix&quot; (&quot;Venus the Mother&quot;), Roman tradition made Venus the mother and protector of the Trojan prince Aeneas, ancestor of the Romans, so as far as the Romans were concerned, this was the homecoming of an ancestral goddess to her people. Soon after, Rome&#x27;s defeat of Carthage confirmed Venus&#x27;s goodwill to Rome, her links to its mythical Trojan past, and her support of its political and military hegemony.

The Capitoline cult to Venus seems to have been reserved to higher status Romans. A separate cult to &quot;Venus Erycina&quot; as a fertility deity, was established in 181 BC, in a traditionally plebeian district just outside Rome&#x27;s sacred boundary, near the Colline Gate. The temple, cult and goddess probably retained much of the original&#x27;s character and rites. Likewise, a shrine to Venus Verticordia (&quot;Venus the changer of hearts&quot;), established in 114 BC but with links to an ancient cult of Venus-Fortuna, was &quot;bound to the peculiar milieu of the Aventine and the Circus Maximus&quot; – a strongly plebeian context for Venus&#x27;s cult, in contrast to her aristocratic cultivation as a Stoic and Epicurian &quot;all-goddess&quot;.

Towards the end of the Roman Republic, some leading Romans laid personal claims to Venus&#x27; favour. The general and dictator Sulla adopted &quot;Felix&quot; (&quot;Lucky&quot;) as a surname, acknowledging his debt to heaven-sent good fortune and his particular debt to &quot;Venus Felix&quot;, for his extraordinarily fortunate political and military career. His protégé Pompey competed for Venus&#x27; support, dedicating (in 55 BC) a large temple to &quot;Venus Victrix&quot; as part of his lavishly appointed new theatre, and celebrating his triumph of 54 BC with coins that showed her crowned with triumphal laurels.

Pompey&#x27;s erstwhile friend, ally, and later opponent Julius Caesar went still further. He claimed the favours of &quot;Venus Victrix&quot; in his military success and &quot;Venus Genetrix&quot; as a personal, divine ancestress – apparently a long-standing family tradition among the Julii. When Caesar was assassinated, his heir, Augustus, adopted both claims as evidence of his inherent fitness for office, and divine approval of his rule. Augustus&#x27; new temple to Mars Ultor, divine father of Rome&#x27;s legendary founder Romulus, would have underlined the point, with the image of avenging Mars &quot;almost certainly&quot; accompanied by that of his divine consort Venus, and possibly a statue of the deceased and deified Caesar.

Vitruvius recommends that any new temple to Venus be sited according to rules laid down by the Etruscan haruspices, and built &quot;near to the gate&quot; of the city, where it would be less likely to contaminate &quot;the matrons and youth with the influence of lust&quot;. He finds the Corinthian style, slender, elegant, enriched with ornamental leaves and surmounted by volutes, appropriate to Venus&#x27; character and disposition. Vitruvius recommends the widest possible spacing between the temple columns, producing a light and airy space, and he offers Venus&#x27;s temple in Caesar&#x27;s forum as an example of how not to do it; the densely spaced, thickset columns darken the interior, hide the temple doors and crowd the walkways, so that matrons who wish to honour the goddess must enter her temple in single file, rather than arm-in arm.

In 135 AD the Emperor Hadrian inaugurated a temple to Venus and &quot;Roma Aeterna&quot; (Eternal Rome) on Rome&#x27;s Velian Hill, underlining the Imperial unity of Rome and its provinces, and making Venus the protective &quot;genetrix&quot; of the entire Roman state, its people and fortunes. It was the largest temple in Ancient Rome.

=== Festivals ===
Venus was offered official (state-sponsored) cult in certain festivals of the Roman calendar. Her sacred month was April (Latin &quot;Mensis Aprilis&quot;) which Roman etymologists understood to derive from &quot;aperire&quot;, &quot;to open&quot;, with reference to the springtime blossoming of trees and flowers. In the of the Germanic pantheon during the early centuries AD, Venus became identified with the Germanic goddess &quot;Frijjo&quot;, giving rise to the loan translation &quot;Friday&quot; for &quot;dies Veneris&quot;.

Veneralia (April 1) was held in honour of Venus Verticordia (&quot;Venus the Changer of Hearts&quot;), and Fortuna Virilis (Virile or strong Good Fortune)), whose cult was probably by far the older of the two. Venus Verticordia was invented in 220 BC, in response to advice from a Sibylline oracle during Rome&#x27;s Punic Wars, when a series of prodigies was taken to signify divine displeasure at sexual offenses among Romans of every category and class, including several men and three Vestal Virgins. The statue of Venus Verticordia was dedicated by a young woman, chosen as the most &quot;pudica&quot; (sexually pure) in Rome by a committee of Roman matrons. At first, this statue was probably housed in the temple of &quot;Fortuna Virilis&quot;, perhaps as divine reinforcement against the perceived moral and religious failings of its cult. In 114 BC &quot;Venus Verticordia&quot; was given her own temple. She was meant to persuade Romans of both sexes and every class, whether married or unmarried, to cherish the traditional sexual proprieties and morality known to please the gods and benefit the State. During her rites, her image was taken from her temple to the men&#x27;s baths, where it was undressed and washed in warm water by her female attendants, then garlanded with myrtle. Women and men asked Venus Verticordia&#x27;s help in affairs of the heart, sex, betrothal and marriage. For Ovid, Venus&#x27;s acceptance of the epithet and its attendant responsibilities represented a change of heart in the goddess herself.

Vinalia urbana (April 23), a wine festival shared by Venus and Jupiter, king of the gods. It offered opportunity to supplicants to ask Venus&#x27; intercession with Jupiter, who was thought to be susceptible to her charms, and amenable to the effects of her wine. Venus was patron of &quot;profane&quot; wine, for everyday human use. Jupiter was patron of the strongest, purest, sacrificial grade wine, and controlled the weather on which the autumn grape-harvest would depend. At this festival, men and women alike drank the new vintage of ordinary, non-sacral wine (pressed at the previous year&#x27;s &quot;vinalia rustica&quot;) in honour of Venus, whose powers had provided humankind with this gift. Upper-class women gathered at Venus&#x27;s Capitoline temple, where a libation of the previous year&#x27;s vintage, sacred to Jupiter, was poured into a nearby ditch. Common girls (&quot;vulgares puellae&quot;) and prostitutes gathered at Venus&#x27; temple just outside the Colline gate, where they offered her myrtle, mint, and rushes concealed in rose-bunches and asked her for &quot;beauty and popular favour&quot;, and to be made &quot;charming and witty&quot;.

Vinalia Rustica (August 19), originally a rustic Latin festival of wine, vegetable growth and fertility. This was almost certainly Venus&#x27; oldest festival and was associated with her earliest known form, &quot;Venus Obsequens&quot;. Kitchen gardens and market-gardens, and presumably vineyards were dedicated to her. Roman opinions differed on whose festival it was. Varro insists that the day was sacred to Jupiter, whose control of the weather governed the ripening of the grapes; but the sacrificial victim, a female lamb (&quot;agna&quot;), may be evidence that it once belonged to Venus alone.

A festival of Venus Genetrix (September 26) was held under state auspices from 46 BC at her Temple in the Forum of Caesar, in fulfillment of a vow by Julius Caesar, who claimed her personal favour as his divine patron, and ancestral goddess of the Julian clan. Caesar dedicated the temple during his extraordinarily lavish quadruple triumph. At the same time, he was pontifex maximus and Rome&#x27;s senior magistrate; the festival is thought to mark the unprecedented promotion of a personal, family cult to one of the Roman state. Caesar&#x27;s heir, Augustus, made much of these personal and family associations with Venus as an Imperial deity. The festival&#x27;s rites are not known.

== Mythology and literature ==

As with most major gods and goddesses in Roman mythology, the literary concept of Venus is mantled in whole-cloth borrowings from the literary Greek mythology of her counterpart, Aphrodite, but with significant exceptions. In some Latin mythology, Cupid was the son of Venus and Mars, the god of war. At other times, or in parallel myths and theologies, Venus was understood to be the consort of Vulcan or as mother of the &quot;second cupid&quot;, fathered by Mercury. Virgil, in compliment to his patron Augustus and the &quot;gens Julia&quot;, embellished an existing connection between Venus, whom Julius Caesar had adopted as his protectress, and the Trojan prince Aeneas, refugee from Troy&#x27;s destruction and eventual ancestor of the Roman people. Virgil&#x27;s Aeneas is guided to Latium by Venus in her heavenly form, the morning star, shining brightly before him in the daylight sky; much later, she lifts Caesar&#x27;s soul to heaven. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; Venus came to Rome because she &quot;preferred to be worshipped in the city of her own offspring&quot;. In Virgil&#x27;s poetic account of Octavian&#x27;s victory at the sea-battle of Actium, the future emperor is allied with Venus, Neptune and Minerva. Octavian&#x27;s opponents, Antony, Cleopatra and the Egyptians, assisted by bizarre and unhelpful Egyptian deities such as &quot;barking&quot; Anubis, lose the battle.
=== The Cupids ===

Cupid (lust or desire) and Amor (affectionate love) are taken to be different names for the same Roman love-god, the son of Venus, fathered by Mercury, Vulcan or Mars. Childlike or boyish winged figures who accompany Venus, whether singly, in pairs or more, have been variously identified as Amores, Cupids, Erotes or forms of Greek Eros. The most ancient of these is Eros, whom Hesiod categorises as a primordial deity, emerging from Chaos as a generative power with neither mother nor father. Eros was the patron deity of Thespiae, where he was embodied as an aniconic stone as late as the 2nd century AD. From at least the 5th century BC he also had the form of an adolescent or pre-adolescent male, at Elis (on the Peloponnese) and elsewhere in Greece, acquiring wings, bow and arrows, and divine parents in the love-goddess Aphrodite and the war-god Ares. He had temples of his own, and shared others with Aphrodite.

At Elis, and in Athens, Eros shared cult with a twin, named Anteros. Xenophon&#x27;s Socratic &quot;Symposion&quot; 8. 1, features a dinner-guest with &quot;eros&quot; (love) for his wife; in return, she has &quot;anteros&quot; (reciprocal love) for him. Some sources suggest Anteros as avenger of &quot;slighted love&quot;. In Servius&#x27; 4th century commentary on Virgil&#x27;s Aeneas, Cupid is a deceptive agent of Venus, impersonating Aeneas&#x27; son and making Dido, queen of Carthage, forget her husband. When Aeneas rejects her love, and covertly leaves Carthage to fulfill his destiny as ancestor of the Roman people, Dido is said to invoke Anteros as &quot;contrary to Cupid&quot;. She falls into hatred and despair, curses Rome, and when Aeneas leaves, commits suicide. 

Ovid&#x27;s Fasti, Book 4, invokes Venus not by name but as &quot;Mother of the Twin Loves&quot;, the &quot;gemini amores&quot;. &quot;Amor&quot; is the Latin name preferred by Roman poets and &quot;literati&quot; for the personification of &quot;kindly&quot; love. Where Cupid (lust) can be imperious, cruel, prone to mischief or even war-like, Amor softly persuades. Cato the Elder, having a Stoic&#x27;s outlook, sees Cupid as a deity of greed and blind passion, morally inferior to Amor. The Roman playwright Plautus, however, has Venus, Cupid and Amor working together.

In Roman cult inscriptions and theology, &quot;Amor&quot; is rare, and &quot;Cupido&quot; relatively common. No Roman temples seem dedicated to Cupid alone but the joint dedication formula &quot;Venus Cupidoque&quot; (&quot;Venus and Cupid&quot;) is evidence of his cult, shared with Venus at her Temple just outside the Colline Gate and elsewhere. He would also have featured in many private household cults. In private and public areas alike, statues of Venus and Mars attended by Cupid, or Venus, Cupid and minor &quot;erotes&quot; were sometimes donated by wealthy sponsors, to serve both religious and artistic purposes. Cupid&#x27;s roles in literary myth are usually limited to actions on behalf of Venus; in Cupid and Psyche, one of the stories within &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, by the Roman author Apuleius, the plot and its resolution are driven by Cupid&#x27;s love for Psyche (&quot;soul&quot;), his filial disobedience, and his mother&#x27;s envy.

== Iconography ==
=== Signs, context and symbols ===
Images of Venus have been found in domestic murals, mosaics and household shrines (&quot;lararia&quot;). Petronius, in his &quot;Satyricon&quot;, places an image of Venus among the Lares (household gods) of the freedman Trimalchio&#x27;s &quot;lararium&quot;. 

The Venus types known as &quot;Venus Pompeiana&quot; (&quot;Venus of Pompeii&quot;) and &quot;Venus Pescatrice&quot; (&quot;Venus the Fisher-woman&quot;) are almost exclusive to Pompeii. Both forms of Venus are represented within Pompeian homes of the well-off, with &quot;Venus Pompeiana&quot; more commonly found in formal reception spaces, typically depicted in full regalia, draped with a mantle, standing rigidly upright with her right arm across her chest. Images of &quot;Venus Pescatrice&quot; tend to be more playful, usually found in less formal and less public &quot;non-reception&quot; areas: here, she usually holds a fishing rod, and sits amidst landscape scenery, accompanied by at least one cupid.

Venus&#x27; signs are for the most part the same as Aphrodite&#x27;s. They include roses, which were offered in Venus&#x27; Porta Collina rites, and above all, myrtle (Latin &quot;myrtus&quot;), which was cultivated for its white, sweetly scented flowers, aromatic, evergreen leaves and its various medical-magical properties. Venus&#x27; statues, and her worshipers, wore myrtle crowns at her festivals. Before its adoption into Venus&#x27; cults, myrtle was used in the purification rites of Cloacina, the Etruscan-Roman goddess of Rome&#x27;s main sewer; later, Cloacina&#x27;s association with Venus&#x27; sacred plant made her Venus Cloacina. Likewise, Roman folk-etymology transformed the ancient, obscure goddess Murcia into &quot;Venus of the Myrtles, whom we now call Murcia&quot;.

Myrtle was thought a particularly potent aphrodisiac. As goddess of love and sex, Venus played an essential role at Roman prenuptial rites and wedding nights, so myrtle and roses were used in bridal bouquets. Marriage itself was not a seduction but a lawful condition, under Juno&#x27;s authority; so myrtle was excluded from the bridal crown. Venus was also a patron of the ordinary, everyday wine drunk by most Roman men and women; the seductive powers of wine were well known. In the rites to Bona Dea, a goddess of female chastity, Venus, myrtle and anything male were not only excluded, but unmentionable. The rites allowed women to drink the strongest, sacrificial wine, otherwise reserved for the Roman gods and Roman men; the women euphemistically referred to it as &quot;honey&quot;. Under these special circumstances, they could get virtuously, religiously drunk on strong wine, safe from male intrusion and Venus&#x27; temptations. Outside of this context, ordinary wine (that is, Venus&#x27; wine) tinctured with myrtle oil was thought particularly suitable for women.

Venus&#x27; long association with wine reflects the inevitable connections between wine, intoxication and sex, expressed in the proverbial phrase (loosely translated as &quot;without food and wine, Venus freezes&quot;). It was used in various forms, notably by the Roman playwright, Terence, probably by others before him, and certainly into the early modern era. Although Venus played a central role in several wine festivals, the Roman god of wine was Bacchus, identified with Greek Dionysus and the early Roman wine-god Liber Pater (Father of Freedom).

Roman generals given an ovation, a lesser form of Roman triumph, wore a myrtle crown, perhaps to purify themselves and their armies of blood-guilt. The ovation ceremony was assimilated to Venus Victrix (&quot;Victorious Venus&quot;), who was held to have granted and purified its relatively &quot;easy&quot; victory.

=== Classical art ===
Roman and Hellenistic art produced many variations on the goddess, often based on the Praxitlean type Aphrodite of Cnidus. Many female nudes from this period of sculpture whose subjects are unknown are in modern art history conventionally called &quot;Venus&quot;, even if they originally may have portrayed a mortal woman rather than operated as a cult statue of the goddess.

Examples include:
* &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; (130 BC)
* Venus Pudica
:* Capitoline Venus
:* Venus de&#x27; Medici
* Esquiline Venus
* Venus Felix
* Venus of Arles
* Venus Anadyomene (also here)
* Venus, Pan and Eros
* Venus Genetrix
* Venus of Capua
* Venus Kallipygos
== Post-classical culture ==
=== Medieval art ===
Venus is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

=== Art in the classical tradition ===

Venus became a popular subject of painting and sculpture during the Renaissance period in Europe. As a &quot;classical&quot; figure for whom nudity was her natural state, it was socially acceptable to depict her unclothed. As the goddess of sexuality, a degree of erotic beauty in her presentation was justified, which appealed to many artists and their patrons. Over time, &quot;venus&quot; came to refer to any artistic depiction in post-classical art of a nude woman, even when there was no indication that the subject was the goddess.
* &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; (Botticelli) ()
* &quot;Sleeping Venus&quot; ()
* &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot; (1538)
* &quot;Venus with a Mirror&quot; ()
* &quot;Rokeby Venus&quot; (1647–1651)
* &quot;Olympia&quot; (1863)
* &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; (Cabanel) (1863)
* &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; (Bouguereau) (1879)
* Venus of Cherchell, Gsell museum in Algeria
* &quot;Venus Victrix&quot;, and &quot;Venus Italica&quot; by Antonio Canova

In the field of prehistoric art, since the discovery in 1908 of the so-called &quot;Venus of Willendorf&quot; small Neolithic sculptures of rounded female forms have been conventionally referred to as Venus figurines. Although the name of the actual deity is not known, the knowing contrast between the obese and fertile cult figures and the classical conception of Venus has raised resistance to the terminology.

<text>Hildegard Frieda Albertine Knef (; 28 December 19251 February 2002) was a German actress, singer, and writer. She was billed in some English-language films as Hildegard Neff or Hildegarde Neff.

==Early years==
Hildegard Knef was born in Ulm in 1925. Her parents were Hans Theodor and Friede Augustine Knef. Her father, a decorated First World War veteran, died when she was only six months old, and her mother moved to Berlin and worked in a factory. Knef began studying acting at age 14 in 1940. She left school at 15 to become an apprentice animator with Universum Film AG. After she had a successful screen test, she went to the State Film School at Babelsberg, Berlin, where she studied acting, ballet, and elocution. Joseph Goebbels, who was Hitler&#x27;s propaganda minister, wrote to her and asked to meet her, but Knef&#x27;s friends wanted her to stay away from him.

== German film career ==

When the film &quot;Träumerei&quot; was made in 1944, Knef shot some scenes, which would have marked her film debut, but these were left out of the final cut. She did appear in several films before the fall of Nazi Germany, but most were released only afterward. 

During the Battle of Berlin she dressed as a soldier to stay with her lover, Ewald von Demandowsky, and joined him in the defence of Schmargendorf. The Soviets captured her and sent her to a prison camp. Her fellow prisoners helped her escape and return to Berlin. Von Demandowsky was executed by the Russians on 7 October 1946, but before that he secured for Knef the protection of the well-known character actor Viktor de Kowa in Berlin. De Kowa gave her the opportunity to be a mistress of ceremonies in the theatre that he had opened. Knef also got a part in Marcel Pagnol&#x27;s &quot;Marius&quot;, which was directed by Boleslaw Barlog. De Kowa also directed Knef in other plays by Shakespeare, Pagnol, and George Abbott.

Her two best known film roles were &quot;Susanne Wallner&quot; in Wolfgang Staudte&#x27;s film &quot;Die Mörder sind unter uns&quot; (&quot;The Murderers Are Among Us&quot;), produced in 1946 by the East German state film company, and the first film released after the Second World War in East Germany; and &quot;Marina&quot; in &quot;Die Sünderin&quot; (&quot;The Sinner&quot;), in which she performed a brief nude scene, the first in German film history, which caused a scandal in 1951. The film was also criticised by the Catholic Church, which protested against the nude scene. Knef stated that she didn&#x27;t understand the tumult that the film was creating. She wrote that it was totally absurd that people considered her nudity to be scandalous, as Germany was the country that had created Auschwitz and had caused so much horror. She also wrote, &quot;I had the scandal, the producers got the money.&quot;

In 1948, she received the best-actress award from the Locarno Film Festival because of her role in the film &quot;Film Without a Title&quot;. Her singing career started in the 1960s once her film career was not going very well. She performed in television shows such as in episodes of &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot; and in a 2000 documentary in which she was playing by herself &quot;Marlene Dietrich: Her Own Song&quot;.

In the 1960s she appeared in a number of low-budget films, including &quot;The Lost Continent&quot;.

She appeared in the 1975 screen adaptation of the Hans Fallada novel, &quot;Every Man Dies Alone&quot; directed by Alfred Vohrer, released in English as &quot;Everyone Dies Alone&quot; in 1976, and for which she won an award for best actress at the International Film Festival in Karlovy Vary, then Czechoslovakia.

During her career, she performed in over 50 films. Nineteen of her films were produced in countries other than Germany: the United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Austria and Spain.

==Career in the United States==

David O. Selznick invited her to Hollywood, but she refused to agree to the conditions of the contract which reportedly included changing her name to Gilda Christian and pretending to be Austrian rather than German. Knef was cast as Hilde in the Hollywood film &quot;Decision Before Dawn&quot; (1951), directed by Anatole Litvak and co-starring with Richard Basehart and Oskar Werner in a story about the later part of World War II.

The following year Knef&#x27;s first husband, an American named Kurt Hirsch, encouraged her to try again for success in the U.S. She changed her name from Knef to Neff, but was only offered a supporting role in &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; (1952), an adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway short story.

Her reputation in the U.S. was hurt because of her nude scenes in the German film &quot;Die Sünderin&quot; (1951) and because she fell in love with a Nazi when she was 19.

Finally, in 1955, Knef was offered a starring role in the Broadway musical &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; by Cole Porter, which was based on the 1939 film &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, which had starred Greta Garbo in the title role. Knef had acted in at least 30 films in the United States and Europe, but her triumph came in New York when she played Ninotchka, an unemotional Soviet commissar. &quot;The New York Times&quot; drama critic Brooks Atkinson described her rendition as &quot;an immensely skillful performance.&quot;

==Singer==
In the 1960s, Knef took a break from acting and started writing song lyrics. In 1963 she started a concert and recording career, and she surprised her audiences with the deep, smoky quality of her voice and with lyrics that were written by herself. Fans around the world rallied in her support as she defeated cancer several times. She returned to Berlin after the reunification. In her peak, an entertainment columnist called her the &quot;willowy blonde&quot; who had a &quot;dusty voice&quot; and a &quot;generous mouth&quot;.

The song she is mostly remembered for is &quot;Für mich soll&#x27;s rote Rosen regnen&quot; (&quot;Red roses are to rain for me&quot;). She is also known for her version of the songs &quot;Ich hab noch einen Koffer in Berlin&quot; (&quot;I still have a suitcase in Berlin&quot;) and &quot;Mackie Messer&quot; (&quot;Mack the Knife&quot;). She sold more than three million records in total.

She launched 23 original albums which counted for 320 different songs. She wrote the lyrics for 130 songs herself.

==Publications==

Her autobiography &quot;Der geschenkte Gaul: Bericht aus einem Leben&quot; (&quot;The Gift Horse: Report on a Life&quot;, 1970) was a candid recount of her life in Germany during and after the Second World War, and reportedly became the best-selling German book in the post-war years. Her second book &quot;Das Urteil&quot; (&quot;The Verdict&quot;, 1975) was a moderate success, and dealt with her struggle with breast cancer. Knef not only achieved international best-seller status, her books were also widely praised by critics because her autobiographies were &quot;better-than-the-average celebrity&#x27;s&quot;.

In &quot;The Gift Horse: Report on a Life&quot; Knef recounted her childhood and difficult life being an actress and singer while living in Hitler&#x27;s Berlin and after the war in Europe and America. Arthur Cooper of &quot;Newsweek&quot; called it &quot;a bitterly honest book and a very good one&quot;. The book doesn&#x27;t try to persuade the public, depicting a made-up celebrity&#x27;s adventures, but truthfully recounts her struggles as a German woman who grew up in Berlin under the Nazis.&quot;The Gift Horse: Report on a Life&quot; was translated to English by Knef&#x27;s second husband, David Anthony Palastanga.

In &quot;The Verdict&quot;, which was also translated by Palastanga, Knef looked at her life from another perspective, because she knew that she had cancer. Rachel MacKenzie wrote that Knef had her 56th operation, a mastectomy, in Salzburg on 10 August 1973. MacKenzie stated that from that cancer surgery, life had to be thought of in terms of pre-verdict and post-verdict. The book is divided in these two sections but they are not chronologically ordered because Knef wrote the two sections in a way that the reader is moved forward and backward in time and space. &quot;The Verdict&quot; describes in great detail the hospital scenes as well as the doctors and nurses in New York, Los Angeles, Zürich and Hamburg, where she was hospitalised.

==Personal life==
Knef was married three times and divorced twice. Her first marriage was in 1947 to Kurt Hirsch, a U.S. information officer. They divorced in 1952. The second time she married the actor and record producer David Anthony Palastanga, on 30 June 1962. Knef had a daughter with him born in 1968, Christina Antonia. When she died, she was still married to her third husband, Paul von Schell.

On 1 February 2002, Knef died at the age of 76 of a lung infection in Berlin, where she had moved after the German reunification. She smoked heavily for most of her life and suffered from emphysema.

<text>The BBC World Service is a British public service broadcaster owned and operated by the BBC. It is the world&#x27;s largest external broadcaster in terms of reception area, language selection and audience reach. It broadcasts radio news, speech and discussions in more than 40 languages to many parts of the world on analogue and digital shortwave platforms, internet streaming, podcasting, satellite, DAB, FM, LW and MW relays. In 2024, the World Service reached an average of 450 million people a week (via TV, radio and online).

BBC World Service English maintains eight regional feeds with several programme variations, covering, respectively, East and Southern Africa; West and Central Africa; Europe and Middle East; the Americas and Caribbean; East Asia; South Asia; Australasia; and the United Kingdom. There are also two separate online-only streams, a general one and the other being more news-oriented, known as &quot;News Internet&quot;. The service broadcasts 24 hours a day.

The World Service states that its aim is to be &quot;the world&#x27;s best-known and most-respected voice in international broadcasting&quot;, while retaining a &quot;balanced British view&quot; of international developments. Former director Peter Horrocks visualised the organisation as fighting an &quot;information war&quot; of soft power against Russian and Chinese international state media, including RT. As such, the BBC has been banned in both Russia and China, the former following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The director of the BBC World Service is Jonathan Munro. The controller of the BBC World Service in English is Jon Zilkha.

==History==
===Early years===
The BBC World Service began on 19 December 1932 as the BBC Empire Service, broadcasting on shortwave and aimed principally at English speakers across the British Empire. In his first Christmas Message (1932), King George V characterised the service as intended for &quot;men and women, so cut off by the snow, the desert, or the sea, that only voices out of the air can reach them&quot;. First hopes for the Empire Service were low. The Director-General, Sir John Reith, said in the opening programme:

Don&#x27;t expect too much in the early days; for some time we shall transmit comparatively simple programmes, to give the best chance of intelligible reception and provide evidence as to the type of material most suitable for the service in each zone. The programmes will neither be very interesting nor very good.

This address was read out five times as the BBC broadcast it live to different parts of the world.

=== World War II ===

The BBC would continue to claim independence from the Government during the war, but as Asa Briggs noted, a complete picture of the wartime BBC would have to include &#x27;persistent references&#x27; to the various connected agencies of the government. Chiefly, the Political Warfare Executive, responsible for all broadcasts to Europe.

On 3 January 1938, the first foreign-language service was launched—in Arabic. Programmes in German, Italian and French began broadcasting on 27 September 1938 projecting the British quest for peace in the days prior to the conference on the Munich Agreement.

By the end of 1942, the BBC had started broadcasts in all major European languages. The Empire Service was renamed the BBC Overseas Service in November 1939, supplemented by the addition of a dedicated BBC European Service from 1941. Funding for these services—known administratively as the External Services of the BBC—came not from the domestic licence fee but from government grant-in-aid (from the Foreign Office budget).

The External Services broadcast propaganda during the Second World War, on the German-language service especially against Nazi rule, believed in the early days of the war at least to have weak support. Its French service &#x27; also sent coded messages to the French Resistance. George Orwell broadcast many news bulletins on the Eastern Service during the Second World War. The Belgian government in exile broadcast from Radio Belgique.

=== Cold War ===

The 1956 Hungarian uprising held enormous implications for international radio broadcasting as it related to western foreign policy during the Cold War. Western broadcasts (especially the US&#x27;s RFE) incited an expectation of support that had already been decided against by President Eisenhower. The BBC, unlike other broadcasters, did not lose credibility in the crisis. It showed sensitivity and acted as its own censor when diplomacy may have been jeopardised otherwise.

In stark contrast stood the BBC&#x27;s reporting on the Suez Crisis of the same year. Although the British government tried to censor the BBC, it continued its even-handed reporting to both home as well as all foreign audiences. The row had the government seriously consider taking over the service when then prime minister Anthony Eden wanted to ensure that only the government line—that the British and French only invaded Eqypt to keep peace and because its president Nasser was breaking international law—would reach the home (and international) audience.

By the end of the 1940s, the number of broadcast languages had expanded and reception had improved, following the opening of a relay in Malaya and of the Limassol relay in Cyprus in 1957.

Also in 1957, a number of foreign language services were discontinued, or reduced.

In 1962, the Foreign Office argued that the VOA&#x27;s philosophy, as presented to it by its then director Henry Loomis, not to broadcast to fully-developed allied countries in their respective languages should be adopted by the BBC. The reluctance of the BBC to drop those services was predicted also.

On 1 May 1965, the service took its current name of BBC World Service. It expanded its reach with the opening of the Ascension Island relay in 1966, serving African audiences with a stronger signal and better reception, and with the later relay on the Island of Masirah in Oman.

In August 1985, the service went off-air for the first time when workers went on strike in protest at the British government&#x27;s decision to ban a documentary featuring an interview with Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin.

Subsequently, financial pressures decreased the number and the types of services offered by the BBC. Audiences in countries with wide access to Internet services have less need for terrestrial radio. Broadcasts in German ended in March 1999, after research showed that the majority of German listeners tuned into the English-language service. Broadcasts in Dutch, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese and Malay stopped for similar reasons.

===Twenty-first century===

On 25 October 2005, the BBC announced that broadcasts in Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Kazakh, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Thai would end by March 2006, to finance the launch in 2007 of television news services in Arabic and Persian. Additionally, Romanian broadcasts ceased on 1 August 2008.

In 2007, the last FM broadcast of BBC News Russian was discontinued at the order of the Russian government. Finam owned Bolshoye Radio, the last of three services to drop the BBC Russia broadcasts. A spokesman for the organization claimed that &#x27;any media which is government-financed is propaganda – it&#x27;s a fact, it&#x27;s not negative&#x27;. Reports put the development in the context of criticism of the Russian government for curbing media freedom ahead of the 2008 Russian presidential election. Reporters Without Borders condemned the move as censorship.

In 2011, BBC Kyrgyz service newsreader and producer resigned from his BBC post after revelations and claims of involvement in the Kyrgyzstan revolution of April 2010. He had been based in London, but often travelled to Kyrgyzstan and used BBC resources to agitate against President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, appearing on a Kyrgyz radio station under a pseudonym with a disguised voice. One of the leaders of the revolution, Aliyasbek Alymkulov, named the producer as his mentor and claimed that they had discussed preparations for the revolution.
According to London newspaper the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;Mr Alymkulov claimed that Koichiev arranged secret meetings &quot;through the BBC&quot; and organised the march at the presidential palace on 7 April 2010&quot;

In October 2010, the UK government announced that it was reducing the service&#x27;s revenue funding by 16% and its capital funding by 52% by 2017. This necessitated over 650 staff leaving. Funding from the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office would end in April 2014, when funding would mainly be from the television licence fee. From 2010, the service started transforming from a mainly radio-based operation to multi-media.

In January 2011, the closure of the Albanian, Macedonian, and Serbian, as well as English for the Caribbean and Portuguese for Africa, services was announced. The British government announced that the three Balkan countries had wide access to international information, and so broadcasts in the local languages had become unnecessary. This decision reflected the financial situation the Corporation faced following transfer of responsibility for the Service from the Foreign Office, so that it would in future have been funded from within licence-fee income. The Russian, Ukrainian, Mandarin Chinese, Turkish, Vietnamese and Spanish for Cuba services ceased radio broadcasting, and the Hindi, Indonesian, Kyrgyz, Nepali, Swahili, Kinyarwanda and Kirundi services ceased shortwave transmissions. As part of the 16% budget cut, 650 jobs were eliminated.

In 2012, London staff moved from Bush House to Broadcasting House, so co-located with other BBC News departments. About 35% of its 1,518 full-time equivalent staff in 2014 were based overseas at 115 locations. From 2014 the service became part of World Service Group under the Director of BBC News and Current Affairs.

From 2016, 1,100 additional staff were recruited as part of an expansion of the World Service, about a 70% increase, funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office providing £254 million/year for five years, partly a reversal of the government decision that the television licence fee would fund the service from 2014. This was the biggest service expansion since World War II.

In 2022, a new London-based China unit was in development, described by the government as &quot;focused on exposing the challenges and realities currently facing China and its fight for global influence&quot;.

==Operation==

The Service broadcasts from Broadcasting House in London, which is also headquarters of the corporation. It is located in the newer parts of the building, which contains radio and television studios for use by the overseas language services. The building also contains an integrated newsroom used by the international World Service, the international television channel BBC World News, the domestic television and radio BBC News bulletins, the BBC News Channel and BBC Online.

At its launch, the Service was located along with most radio output in Broadcasting House. However, following the explosion of a parachute mine nearby on 8 December 1940, it relocated to premises away from the likely target of Broadcasting House. The Overseas service relocated to Oxford Street while the European service moved temporarily to the emergency broadcasting facilities at Maida Vale Studios. The European services moved permanently into Bush House towards the end of 1940, completing the move in 1941, with the Overseas services joining them in 1958. Bush House subsequently became the home of the BBC World Service and the building itself has gained a global reputation with the audience of the service. However, the building was vacated in 2012 as a result of the Broadcasting House redevelopment and the end of the building&#x27;s lease that year; the first service to move was the Burmese Service on 11 March 2012 and the final broadcast from Bush House was a news bulletin broadcast at 11.00GMT on 12 July 2012.

The BBC World Service encompasses an English 24-hour global radio network and separate services in 27 other languages. News and information is available in these languages on the BBC website, with many having RSS feeds and specific versions for use on mobile devices, and some also offer email notification of stories. In addition to the English service, 18 of the language services broadcast a radio service using the short wave, AM or FM bands. These are also available to listen live or can be listened to later (usually for seven days) over the Internet and, in the case of seven language services, can be downloaded as podcasts. News is also available from the BBC News &#x27;app&#x27;, which is available from both iTunes and the Google Play Store. In recent years, video content has also been used by the World Service: 16 language services show video reports on the website, and the Arabic and Persian services have their own television channels. TV is also used to broadcast the radio service, with local cable and satellite operators providing the English network (and occasionally some local language services) free to air. The English service is also available on digital radio in the UK and Europe.

Traditionally, the Service relied on shortwave broadcasts, because of their ability to overcome barriers of censorship, distance, and spectrum scarcity. The BBC has maintained a worldwide network of shortwave relay stations since the 1940s, mainly in former British colonies. These cross-border broadcasts have also been used in special circumstances for emergency messages to British subjects abroad, such as the advice to evacuate Jordan during the Black September incidents of September 1970. These facilities were privatised in 1997 as Merlin Communications, and later acquired and operated as part of a wider network for multiple broadcasters by VT Communications (now part of Babcock International Group). It is also common for BBC programmes to air on Voice of America or ORF transmitters, while their programming is relayed by a station located inside the UK. However, since the 1980s, satellite distribution has made it possible for local stations to relay BBC programmes.

BBC World Service is not regulated by Ofcom as the BBC generally is. Instead, the BBC is responsible for editorial independence and setting strategic direction. It defines the remit, scope, annual budget and main commitments of the World Service, and agrees &quot;objectives, targets and priorities&quot; with the British Foreign Secretary in a document named the BBC World Service Licence. The Chair of the BBC Board and the Foreign Secretary (or representatives) meet at least annually to review performance against these objectives, priorities and targets.

==Funding==
The World Service was funded for decades by grant-in-aid through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office until 1 April 2014. Since then it has been funded by a mixture of the United Kingdom&#x27;s television licence fee, limited advertising, profits of BBC Studios, and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office funding.

From 2014, the service was guaranteed £289 million (allocated over a five-year period ending in 2020) from the UK government. In 2016, the government announced that the licence fee funding for the World Service would be £254 million/year for the five years from 2017. From 2016 to 2022, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office contributed over £470 million to the World Service via its World 2020 Programme, about 80% of which is categorised as Overseas Development Assistance, amounting to about a quarter of the World Service budget. In November 2022, the government confirmed the continuing involvement of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in funding the World Service.

==Languages==

This table lists the various language services operated by the BBC World Service with start and closure dates, where known/applicable.

=== Current services ===
=== Former services ===
==Radio programming in English==
The World Service in English mainly broadcasts news and analysis. The mainstays of the current schedule are &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;Newshour&quot; and &quot;The Newsroom&quot;. Daily science programmes include: &quot;Health Check&quot;, and &quot;Science in Action&quot;. &quot;Sportsworld&quot;, which often includes live commentary of Premier League football matches is broadcast at weekends. Other weekend sport shows include &quot;The Sports Hour&quot; and &quot;Stumped&quot;, a cricket programme co-produced with All India Radio and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. On Sundays, the discussion programme &quot;&quot;The Forum&quot;&quot; is broadcast. &quot;Outlook&quot; is a human interest programme which was first broadcast in July 1966 and presented for more than thirty years by John Tidmarsh. &quot;Trending&quot; describes itself as &quot;explaining the stories the world is sharing...&quot; Regular music programmes were reintroduced with the autumn schedule in 2015. Many programmes, particularly speech-based ones, are also available as podcasts. &quot;Business Daily&quot; is a weekday live international business news programme, which broadcasts from 8:32:30am to 8:59:00am UK time from Broadcasting House in London.

==Previous radio programming in English==

Previous broadcasts included popular music programmes presented by John Peel and classical music programmes presented by Edward Greenfield. There have also been religious programmes, of mostly Anglican celebration and often from the Church of St. Martin in the Fields, weekly drama, English-language lessons, and comedy including &quot;Just A Minute&quot;. Other notable previous programmes include &quot;Letter from America&quot; by Alistair Cooke, which was broadcast for over fifty years; &quot;Off the Shelf&quot; with its daily reading from a novel, biography or history book; &quot;A Jolly Good Show&quot;, a music request programme presented by Dave Lee Travis; &quot;Waveguide&quot;, a radio reception guide; and &quot;The Merchant Navy Programme&quot;, a show for seafarers presented by Malcolm Billings; &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Africa&quot; and &quot;PM&quot;, all presented by Pete Myers in the 1960s and 1970s.

Since the late 1990s, the station has focused more on news, with bulletins added every half-hour following the outbreak of the Iraq War.

===News===
News is at the core of the scheduling. A five-minute bulletin is generally transmitted at 01 past the hour, with a two-minute summary at 30 past the hour. Sometimes these are separate from other programming, or alternatively made integral to the programme (such as with &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, &quot;Newshour&quot; or &quot;Newsday&quot;). In October 2024, it was announced that the bulletins would be broadcast on domestic BBC radio stations during the night. During such time slots as weeknights 11pm-12am GMT and that of &quot;Sportsworld&quot;, no news summaries are broadcast. As part of the BBC&#x27;s policy for breaking news, the Service is the first to receive a full report for foreign news.

==Availability==

===Americas===
BBC World Service is available by subscription to Sirius XM&#x27;s satellite radio service in the United States. Its Canadian affiliate, Sirius XM Canada, does the same in Canada. More than 300 public radio stations across the US carry World Service news broadcasts—mostly during the overnight and early-morning hours—over AM and FM radio, distributed by American Public Media (APM). Some public radio stations also carry the World Service in its entirety via HD Radio. The BBC and Public Radio International (PRI) co-produce the programme &quot;The World&quot; with WGBH Radio Boston, and the BBC was previously involved with &quot;The Takeaway&quot; morning news programme based at WNYC in New York City. BBC World Service programming also airs as part of CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;CBC Radio Overnight&quot; schedule in Canada.

BBC shortwave broadcasts to this region were traditionally enhanced by the Atlantic Relay Station and the Caribbean Relay Company, a station in Antigua run jointly with Deutsche Welle. In addition, an exchange agreement with Radio Canada International gave access to their station in New Brunswick. However, &quot;changing listening habits&quot; led the World Service to end shortwave radio transmission directed to North America and Australasia on 1 July 2001. A shortwave listener coalition formed to oppose the change.

The BBC broadcasts to Central America and South America in several languages. It is possible to receive the Western African shortwave radio broadcasts from eastern North America, but the BBC does not guarantee reception in this area. It has ended its specialist programming to the Falkland Islands but continues to provide a stream of World Service programming to the Falkland Islands Radio Service.

===Asia===
For several decades, the World Service&#x27;s largest audiences have been in Asia, the Middle East, Near East and South Asia. Transmission facilities in the UK and Cyprus were supplemented by the former BBC Eastern Relay Station in Oman and the Far Eastern Relay Station in Singapore, formerly in Malaysia. The East Asian Relay Station moved to Thailand in 1997 when Hong Kong was handed over to Chinese sovereignty. The relay station in Thailand was closed during January 2017, and in Singapore during July 2023; currently, a relay station in Masirah, Oman serves the Asian region. Together, these facilities have given the BBC World Service an easily accessible signal in regions where shortwave listening has traditionally been popular. The English shortwave frequencies of 6.195 (49m band), 9.74 (31m band), 15.31/15.36 (19m band) and 17.76/17.79 (16m band) were widely known. On 25 March 2018, the long-established shortwave frequency of 9.74 MHz was changed to 9.9 MHz.

The largest audiences are in English, Hindi, Urdu, Nepali, Bengali, Sinhala, Tamil, Marathi and other major languages of South Asia, where BBC broadcasters are household names. The Persian service is the &quot;de facto&quot; national broadcaster of Afghanistan, along with its Iranian audience. The World Service is available up to eighteen hours a day in English across most parts of Asia, and in Arabic for the Middle East. With the addition of relays in Afghanistan and Iraq these services are accessible in most of the Middle and Near East in the evening. In Singapore, the BBC World Service in English is essentially treated as a domestic broadcaster, easily available 24/7 through long-term agreement with MediaCorp Radio. For many years Radio Television Hong Kong broadcast BBC World Service 24/7 but as of 12 February 2021, Hong Kong has banned the BBC&#x27;s World Service radio from its airwaves, following swiftly on the heels of China&#x27;s decision to bar its World News television channels, seemingly in retaliation for Ofcom revoking the UK broadcasting licence of China Global Television Network. In the Philippines, DZRJ 810 AM and its FM sister station RJFM 100.3 broadcasts the BBC World Service in English from 06:00 to 20:00 PHT from Mondays to Saturdays.

Although this region has seen the launch of the only two foreign language television channels, several other services have had their radio services closed as a result of budget cuts and redirection of resources.

Japan and Korea have little tradition of World Service listening, although during the Second World War and in the 1970s to 1980s, shortwave listening was popular in Japan. In those two countries, the BBC World Service was only available via shortwave and the Internet. As of September 2007, a satellite transmission (subscription required) became available by Skylife (Channel 791) in South Korea. In November 2016, the BBC World Service announced it plans to start broadcasts in Korean. &quot;BBC Korean&quot;, a radio and web service, started on 25 September 2017.

====Jamming====

The Soviet Union, Iran, Iraq and Myanmar/Burma have all jammed the BBC in the past. Mandarin was heavily jammed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China until shortwave transmissions for that service ceased but China continues to jam transmissions in Uzbek and has since started to jam transmissions in English throughout Asia.

===Europe===
The BBC World Service is broadcast in Berlin on 94.8 MHz. FM relays are also available in Ceske Budjovice, Karlovy Vary, Plzen, Usti nad Labem, Zlin and Prague in the Czech Republic, Pristina, Riga, Tallinn, Tirana and Vilnius. The station is also available in Reykjavík, Iceland on 94.5 MHz FM. A BBC World Service channel is available on DAB+ in Brussels and Flanders and Amsterdam, the Hague, Utrecht and Rotterdam. Following a national reorganisation of DAB multiplexes in October 2017, the station is available on DAB+ across the whole of Denmark.

The World Service employed a medium wave transmitter at Orford Ness to provide English-language coverage to Europe, including on the frequency 648 kHz (which could be heard in parts of the south-east of England during the day and most of the UK after dark). Transmissions on this frequency were stopped on 27 March 2011, as a consequence of the budgetary constraints imposed on the BBC World Service in the 2010 budget review. A second channel (1296 kHz) traditionally broadcast in various Central European languages, but this frequency has also been discontinued and in 2005 it began regular English-language transmissions via the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) format. This is a digital shortwave technology that VT expects to become the standard for cross-border transmissions in developed countries.

In the 1990s, the BBC purchased and constructed large medium wave and FM networks in the former Soviet bloc, particularly the Czech (BBC Czech Section), Slovak Republics (BBC Slovak Section), Poland (BBC Polish Section) (where it was a national network) and Russia (BBC Russian Service). It had built up a strong audience during the Cold War, whilst economic restructuring made it difficult for these governments to refuse Western investment. Many of these facilities have now returned to domestic control, as economic and political conditions have changed.

On Monday, 18 February 2008, the BBC World Service stopped analogue shortwave transmissions to Europe. The notice stated, &quot;Increasing numbers of people around the world are choosing to listen to radio on a range of other platforms including FM, satellite and online, with fewer listening on shortwave.&quot; It is sometimes possible to pick up the BBC World Service in Europe on SW frequencies targeted at North Africa. The BBC&#x27;s powerful 198 kHz LW, which broadcasts the domestic BBC Radio 4 to Britain during the day (and carries the World Service during the night) can also be heard in nearby parts of Europe, including the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of France, Germany and Scandinavia.

In Malta, BBC News bulletins are carried by a number of radio stations, including Radju Malta and Magic 91.7, owned by national broadcaster PBS Ltd. These are broadcast at various points in the day and supplement news bulletins broadcast in Maltese from the PBS Newsroom.

Former BBC shortwave transmitters are located in the United Kingdom at Rampisham Down in Dorset, Woofferton in Shropshire and Skelton in Cumbria. The former BBC East Mediterranean Relay Station is in Cyprus.

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the BBC began broadcasting World Service English programming at shortwave frequencies 15.735 MHz and 5875 kHz for receivers in Ukraine and parts of Russia.

===Pacific===
The World Service is available as part of the subscription Digital Air package (available from Foxtel and Austar) in Australia. ABC NewsRadio, SBS Radio, and various community radio stations also broadcast many programmes. Many of these stations broadcast a straight feed during the midnight to dawn period. It was also available via the satellite service Optus Aurora, which is encrypted but available without subscription. In Sydney, Australia, a transmission of the service can be received at 152.025 MHz. It is also available on the DAB+ Network in Australia on SBS Radio 4 (except during Eurovision and special events). 2MBS-FM 102.5, a classical music station in Sydney, also carries the BBC World Service news programmes at 7a.m. and 8a.m. on weekdays, during its &quot;Music for a New Day&quot; breakfast programme.

Shortwave relays from Singapore (see Asia, above) continue, but historic relays via Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Radio New Zealand International were wound down in the late 1990s. BBC World Service relays on Radio Australia now carry the BBC Radio news programmes.

In the Pacific and New Zealand, the Auckland Radio Trust operates a BBC World Service network as a non-profit donation-funded public broadcaster. It broadcasts on 810 kHz in Auckland, 107.0 MHz in Whitianga and Whangamatā, 107.3 MHz in Kaipara Harbour, 88.2 MHz in Suva and Nadi, 100.0 MHz in Bairiki and Tarawa, 101.1 MHz in Pohnpei, 107.6 MHz in Port Moresby, 105.9 MHz in Honiara, 99.0 MHz in Port Vila and Luganville, and 100.1 MHz in Funafuti. The station also broadcasts local content.

In New Zealand, AREC FM carries the BBC World Service 24/7 in the Wellington region. Available on 107.0 MHz in the CBD, 87.6 MHz in Porirua/Mana, and 87.9 MHz in Waikanae/Paraparaumu. AREC FM is a non-profit donation funded LPFM broadcaster and a subscriber to the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia&#x27;s Community Radio Network (Australia).

In New Zealand, Radio Tarana and members of the Association of Community Access Broadcasters carry some BBC World Service programmes. The BBC World Service was previously available on 1233 kHz in Wellington between 1990 and 1994, and again from 1996 to 1997.

===UK===
The BBC World Service is broadcast on DAB, Freeview, Virgin Media and Sky platforms, as well as on BBC Sounds. It is also broadcast overnight on the frequencies of BBC Radio 4 and the Welsh language service BBC Radio Cymru following their closedown at 0000 or 0100 British time. The BBC World Service does not receive funding for broadcasts to the UK. In southeast England, the station could be picked up reliably on medium wave 648 kHz, which was targeted at mainland Europe.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 1.2 million with a listening share of 0.7% as of March 2024.

==Presentation==

===Opening tune===

The World Service uses several tunes and sounds to represent the station. A previous signature tune of the station was a five note motif, composed by David Arnold and which comprises a variety of voices declaim &quot;This is the BBC in...&quot; before going on to name various cities (e.g. Kampala, Milan, Delhi, Johannesburg), followed by the station&#x27;s slogan and the Greenwich Time Signal. This was heard throughout the network with a few variations – in the UK the full service name was spoken, whereas just the name of the BBC was used outside the UK. The phrase &quot;This is London&quot; was used previously in place of a station slogan.

The tune &quot;Lillibullero&quot; was another well known signature tune of the network following its broadcast previously as part of the top-of-the-hour sequence. This piece of music is no longer heard before news bulletins. The use of the tune gained minor controversy because of its background as a Protestant marching song in Northern Ireland.

The &quot;Prince of Denmark&#x27;s March&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;Trumpet Voluntary&quot;) was often broadcast by the BBC Radio during World War II, especially when programming was directed to occupied Denmark, as the march symbolised a connection between the two countries. It remained for many years the signature tune of the BBC European Service.
In addition to these tunes, the BBC World Service also uses several interval signals. The English service uses a recording of Bow Bells, made in 1926 and used a symbol of hope during the Second World War, only replaced for a brief time during the 1970s with the tune to the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;. The morse code of the letter &quot;V&quot; has also been used as a signal and was introduced in January 1941 and had several variations including timpani, the first four notes of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony (which coincide with the letter &quot;V&quot;), and electronic tones which until recently remained in use for some Western European services. In other languages, the interval signal is three notes, pitched B–B-C. However, these symbols have been used less frequently.

===Time===
The network operates using Greenwich Mean Time, regardless of the time zone and time of year, and is announced on the hour on the English service as &quot;13 hours GMT&quot; (1300 GMT) or &quot;Midnight Greenwich Mean Time&quot; (0000 GMT). The BBC World Service traditionally broadcasts the chimes of Big Ben in London at the start of a new year.

===&quot;This is London&quot;===
A BBC News report would begin with its station identification phrase &quot;This is London&quot; or &quot;This is London calling&quot;. The phrase has become a trademark of the BBC World Service, and has been influential in popular culture, such as music. In 1979, the British punk rock band The Clash released the hit song &quot;London Calling&quot;, which was partly based on the station identification phrase.

During the Eurovision Song Contest, before announcing the contest points from the UK, the broadcaster from the BBC delivering the votes usually begins with &quot;This is London Calling&quot;. In 2019, the BBC started a weekly podcast called &quot;Eurovision Calling&quot; with Jayde Adams and Scott Mills.

==Magazine publishing==

The BBC World Service previously published magazines and programme guides:

* &quot;London Calling&quot;: listings
* &quot;BBC Worldwide&quot;: included features of interest to an international audience (included &quot;London Calling&quot; as an insert)
* &quot;BBC on Air&quot;: mainly listings
* &quot;BBC Focus on Africa&quot;: current affairs

==Assessments==

===British soft power===
The World Service claims that its aim is to be &quot;the world&#x27;s best-known and most-respected voice in international broadcasting, thereby bringing benefit to the UK, the BBC, and to audiences around the world&quot;, while retaining a &quot;balanced British view&quot; of international developments. In 2022, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote that the World Service &quot;is considered a pillar of British soft power&quot;, and a House of Lords Library report noted the widespread recognition of this soft power. According to the American socialist magazine &quot;Monthly Review&quot; in 2022, former director Peter Horrocks inferred the World Service&#x27;s scope to Russian state broadcaster RT as a means of extending international influence and soft power.

In 2014, Conservative MP John Whittingdale, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, characterising the BBC&#x27;s primary mission as fighting an &#x27;Information War&#x27; (a role which some media scholars agree to), saying: &quot;We are being outgunned massively by the Russians and Chinese and that’s something I’ve raised with the BBC. It is frightening the extent to which we are losing the information war.” In March 2022, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, the UK government announced additional emergency funding for the World Service to provide &quot;independent, impartial and accurate news to people in Ukraine and Russia in the face of increased propaganda from the Russian state&quot; and to counter &quot;Putin’s lies and exposing his propaganda and fake news&quot;.

===BBC Persian Service===
In the context of the Iranian Revolution, the BBC World Service&#x27;s Persian-language service has been criticised for its role in promoting the Shah&#x27;s regime and undermining local norms in favour of British-selected values, with the British Ambassador in Iran, Peter Ramsbotham, stating in reaction to a Service-sponsored poetry contest (in celebration of the 2500th anniversary of the founding of the Archaemenid empire) that the organisation &quot;seems to be damaging its image by acquiring a reputation for employing and supporting &#x27;old brigade&#x27; expatriates.&quot;

Furthermore, it appears that the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office made a concerted effort to produce favourable coverage of Persia to BBC World Service audiences in order to maintain cordiality with the Shah&#x27;s regime. For example, in December 1973, a memo from Ramsbotham details a request from the Iranian Prime Minister for the text of a broadcast about Iran by Peter Avery, lecturer in Persian Studies and Fellow at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, which he deemed &#x27;excellent&#x27; and wanted to show the Shah. This later became the programme &quot;Iran: Oil and the Shah&#x27;s Arab Neighbours&quot; which was aired globally on 1 December 1973, much to the chagrin of the Iranian people, who began airing their frustrations against the British government out on the BBC Persian Service; By 1976, Ramsbotham&#x27;s successor, Sir Anthony Parsons, concluded that the Persian Service has lost its propaganda value and supported discontinuing the service: &quot;[It] is well known that the vernacular service is financed by the FCO and is therefore firmly considered by the Iranians as an official organ of the government.&quot;

In September 2022, the World Service announced the closure of its Persian and Arabic radio services as part of a cost-cutting plan, but the online and TV services would remain.

<text>A neutron bomb, officially defined as a type of enhanced radiation weapon (ERW), is a low-yield thermonuclear weapon designed to maximize lethal neutron radiation in the immediate vicinity of the blast while minimizing the physical power of the blast itself. The neutron release generated by a nuclear fusion reaction is intentionally allowed to escape the weapon, rather than being absorbed by its other components. The neutron burst, which is used as the primary destructive action of the warhead, is able to penetrate enemy armor more effectively than a conventional warhead, thus making it more lethal as a tactical weapon.

The concept was originally developed by the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was seen as a &quot;cleaner&quot; bomb for use against massed Soviet armored divisions. As these would be used over allied nations, notably West Germany, the reduced blast damage was seen as an important advantage.

ERWs were first operationally deployed for anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs). In this role, the burst of neutrons would cause nearby warheads to undergo partial fission, preventing them from exploding properly. For this to work, the ABM would have to explode within approximately of its target. The first example of such a system was the W66, used on the Sprint missile used in the US Nike-X system. It is believed the Soviet equivalent, the A-135&#x27;s 53T6 missile, uses a similar design.

The weapon was once again proposed for tactical use by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, and production of the W70 began for the MGM-52 Lance in 1981. This time, it led to protests as the growing anti-nuclear movement gained strength through this period. Opposition was so intense that European leaders refused to accept it on their territory. US President Ronald Reagan ordered the production of the W70-3, which remained in the US stockpile until they were retired in 1992. The last W70 was dismantled in February 1996.

==Basic concept==
In a standard thermonuclear design, a small fission bomb is placed close to a larger mass of thermonuclear fuel, usually lithium deuteride. The two components are then placed within a thick radiation case, usually made from uranium, lead, or steel. The case traps the energy from the fission bomb for a brief period, allowing it to heat and compress the main thermonuclear fuel. The case is normally made of depleted uranium or natural uranium metal, because the thermonuclear reactions give off extraordinarily large numbers of high-energy neutrons that can cause fission reactions in the casing material. These can add considerable energy to the reaction; in a typical design, as much as 50% of the total energy comes from fission events in the casing. For this reason, these weapons are technically known as fission-fusion-fission designs.

In a neutron bomb, the casing material is selected either to be transparent to neutrons or to actively enhance their production. The burst of neutrons created in the thermonuclear reaction is then free to escape the bomb, outpacing the physical explosion. By designing the thermonuclear stage of the weapon carefully, the neutron burst can be maximized while minimizing the blast itself. This makes the lethal radius of the neutron burst greater than that of the explosion itself. Since the neutrons are absorbed or decay rapidly, such a burst over an enemy column would kill the crews but leave the area able to be quickly reoccupied.

Compared to a pure fission bomb with an identical explosive yield, a neutron bomb would emit about ten times the amount of neutron radiation. In a fission bomb, at sea level, the total radiation pulse energy which is composed of both gamma rays and neutrons is approximately 5% of the entire energy released; in neutron bombs, it would be closer to 40%, with the percentage increase coming from the higher production of neutrons. Furthermore, the neutrons emitted by a neutron bomb have a much higher average energy level (close to 14 MeV) than those released during a fission reaction (1–2 MeV).

Technically speaking, every low-yield nuclear weapon is a radiation weapon, including non-enhanced variants. All nuclear weapons up to about 10 kilotons in yield have prompt neutron radiation as their furthest-reaching lethal component. For standard weapons above about 10 kilotons of yield, the lethal blast and thermal effects radius begins to exceed the lethal ionizing radiation radius. Enhanced radiation weapons also fall into this same yield range and simply enhance the intensity and range of the neutron dose for a given yield.

==History and deployment to present==
The conception of neutron bombs is generally credited to Samuel T. Cohen of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who developed the concept in 1958. Initial development was carried out as part of projects Dove and Starling, and an early device was tested underground in early 1962. Designs for a &quot;weaponized&quot; version were developed in 1963.

Development of two production designs for the Army&#x27;s MGM-52 Lance short-range missile began in July 1964, the W63 at Livermore and the W64 at Los Alamos. Both entered phase three testing in July 1964, and the W64 was cancelled in favor of the W63 in September 1964. The W63 was in turn cancelled in November 1965 in favor of the W70 (Mod 0), a conventional design. By this time, the same concepts were being used to develop warheads for the Sprint missile, an anti-ballistic missile (ABM), with Livermore designing the W65 and Los Alamos the W66. Both entered phase three testing in October 1965, but the W65 was cancelled in favor of the W66 in November 1968. Testing of the W66 was carried out in the late 1960s, and it entered production in June 1974, the first neutron bomb to do so. Approximately 120 were built, with about 70 of these being on active duty during 1975 and 1976 as part of the Safeguard Program. When that program was shut down they were placed in storage, and eventually decommissioned in the early 1980s.

Development of ER warheads for Lance continued, but in the early 1970s, attention had turned to using modified versions of the W70, the W70 Mod 3. Development was subsequently postponed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 following protests against his administration&#x27;s plans to deploy neutron warheads to ground forces in Europe. On November 17, 1978, in a test, the USSR detonated its first similar-type bomb. President Ronald Reagan restarted production in 1981. The Soviet Union renewed a propaganda campaign against the US&#x27;s neutron bomb in 1981 following Reagan&#x27;s announcement. In 1983, Reagan then announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, which surpassed neutron bomb production in ambition and vision and with that, neutron bombs quickly faded from the center of the public&#x27;s attention.
Three types of enhanced radiation weapons (ERW) were deployed by the United States. The W66 warhead, for the anti-ICBM Sprint missile system, was deployed in 1975 and retired the next year, along with the missile system. The W70 Mod 3 warhead was developed for the short-range, tactical MGM-52 Lance missile, and the W79 Mod 0 was developed for nuclear artillery shells. The latter two types were retired by President George H. W. Bush in 1992, following the end of the Cold War. The last W70 Mod 3 warhead was dismantled in 1996, and the last W79 Mod 0 was dismantled by 2003, when the dismantling of all W79 variants was completed.

According to the Cox Report, as of 1999, the United States had never deployed a neutron weapon. The nature of this statement is not clear; it reads, &quot;The stolen information also includes classified design information for an enhanced radiation weapon (commonly known as the &quot;neutron bomb&quot;), which neither the United States, nor any other nation, has ever deployed.&quot; However, the fact that neutron bombs had been produced by the US was well known at this time and part of the public record. Cohen suggests the report is playing with the definitions; while the US bombs were never deployed &quot;to Europe&quot;, they remained stockpiled in the US.

In addition to the two superpowers, France and China are known to have tested neutron or enhanced radiation bombs. France conducted an early test of the technology in 1967 and tested an actual neutron bomb in 1980. China conducted a successful test of neutron bomb principles in 1984 and a successful test of a neutron bomb in 1988. However, neither of those countries chose to deploy neutron bombs. Chinese nuclear scientists stated before the 1988 test that China had no need for neutron bombs, but it was developed to serve as a &quot;technology reserve&quot;, in case the need arose in the future.

In May 1998, Senior Pakistani Scientist, Dr. N. M. Butt, stated that &quot;PAEC built a sufficient number of neutron bombs—a battlefield weapon that is essentially a low yield device&quot;.

In August 1999, the Indian government stated that India was capable of producing a neutron bomb.

Although no country is currently known to deploy them in an offensive manner, all thermonuclear dial-a-yield warheads that have about 10 kiloton and lower as one dial option, with a considerable fraction of that yield derived from fusion reactions, can be considered able to be neutron bombs in use, if not in name. The only country definitely known to deploy dedicated (that is, not dial-a-yield) neutron warheads for any length of time is the Soviet Union/Russia, which inherited the USSR&#x27;s neutron warhead equipped ABM-3 Gazelle missile program. This ABM system contains at least 68 neutron warheads with a 10-kiloton yield each and it has been in service since 1995, with inert missile testing approximately every other year since then (2014). The system is designed to destroy incoming endoatmospheric nuclear warheads aimed at Moscow and other targets and is the lower-tier/last umbrella of the A-135 anti-ballistic missile system (NATO reporting name: ABM-3).

By 1984, according to Mordechai Vanunu, Israel was mass-producing neutron bombs.

Considerable controversy arose in the US and Western Europe following a June 1977 &quot;Washington Post&quot; exposé describing US government plans to equip US Armed Forces with neutron bombs. The article focused on the fact that it was the first weapon specifically intended to kill humans with radiation. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory director Harold Brown and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev both described neutron bombs as a &quot;capitalist bomb&quot;, because it was designed to destroy people while preserving property.

==Use==
Neutron bombs are purposely designed with explosive yields lower than other nuclear weapons. Since neutrons are scattered and absorbed by air, neutron radiation effects drop off rapidly with distance in air. As such, there is a sharper distinction, relative to thermal effects, between areas of high lethality and areas with minimal radiation doses. No high yield (more than c. 10 kiloton) nuclear bombs, including the extreme example of the 50 megaton Tsar Bomba, are able to radiate sufficient neutrons beyond their lethal blast range when detonated as a surface burst or low altitude air burst and so are not classified as neutron bombs, thus limiting the yield of neutron bombs to a maximum of about 10 kilotons. The intense pulse of high-energy neutrons generated by a neutron bomb is the principal killing mechanism, not the fallout, heat or blast.

The inventor of the neutron bomb, Sam Cohen, criticized the description of the W70 as a neutron bomb since it could be configured to yield 100 kilotons:

Although neutron bombs are commonly believed to &quot;leave the infrastructure intact&quot;, with current designs that have explosive yields in the low kiloton range, detonation in (or above) a built-up area would still cause a sizable degree of building destruction, through blast and heat effects out to a moderate radius, albeit considerably less destruction, than when compared to a standard nuclear bomb of the &quot;exact&quot; same total energy release or &quot;yield&quot;.

The Warsaw Pact tank strength was over twice that of NATO, and Soviet deep battle doctrine was likely to be to use this numerical advantage to rapidly sweep across continental Europe if the Cold War ever turned hot. Any weapon that could break up their intended mass tank formation deployments and force them to deploy their tanks in a thinner, more easily dividable manner, would aid ground forces in the task of hunting down solitary tanks and using anti-tank missiles against them, such as the contemporary M47 Dragon and BGM-71 TOW missiles, of which NATO had hundreds of thousands.

Rather than making extensive preparations for battlefield nuclear combat in Central Europe, the Soviet military leadership believed that conventional superiority provided the Warsaw Pact with the means to approximate the effects of nuclear weapons and achieve victory in Europe without resort to those weapons.

Neutron bombs, or more precisely, enhanced [neutron] radiation weapons were also to find use as strategic anti-ballistic missile weapons, and in this role, they are believed to remain in active service within Russia&#x27;s Gazelle missile.

===Effects===
Upon detonation, a near-ground airburst of a 1-kiloton neutron bomb would produce a large blast wave and a powerful pulse of both thermal radiation and ionizing radiation in the form of fast (14.1MeV) neutrons. The thermal pulse would cause third degree burns to unprotected skin out to approximately 500 meters. The blast would create pressures of at least 4.6psi (32 kPa) out to a radius of 600 meters, which would severely damage all non-reinforced concrete structures. At the conventional effective combat range against modern main battle tanks and armored personnel carriers (&lt;690–900m), the blast from a 1kt neutron bomb would destroy or damage to the point of nonusability almost all un-reinforced civilian buildings.

Using neutron bombs to stop an enemy armored attack by rapidly incapacitating crews with a dose of 80+ Gy of radiation would require exploding large numbers of them to blanket the enemy forces, destroying all normal civilian buildings within c.600 meters of the immediate area. Neutron activation from the explosions could make many building materials in the city radioactive, such as galvanized steel (see area denial use below).

Because liquid-filled objects like the human body are resistant to gross overpressure, the 4–5psi (28-34 kPa) blast overpressure would cause very few direct casualties at a range of c.600m. The powerful winds produced by this overpressure, however, could throw bodies into objects or throw debris at high velocity, including window glass, both with potentially lethal results. Casualties would be highly variable depending on surroundings, including potential building collapses.

The pulse of neutron radiation would cause immediate and permanent incapacitation to unprotected outdoor humans in the open out to 900 meters, with death occurring in one or two days. The median lethal dose (LD50) of 6 Gray would extend to between 1350 and 1400 meters for those unprotected and outdoors, where approximately half of those exposed would die of radiation sickness after several weeks.

A human residing within, or simply shielded by, at least one concrete building with walls and ceilings thick, or alternatively of damp soil 24 inches (60 cm) thick, would receive a neutron radiation exposure reduced by a factor of 10. Even near ground zero, basement sheltering or buildings with similar radiation shielding characteristics would drastically reduce the radiation dose.

Furthermore, the neutron absorption spectrum of air is disputed by some authorities, and depends in part on absorption by hydrogen from water vapor. Thus, absorption might vary exponentially with humidity, making neutron bombs far more deadly in desert climates than in humid ones.

===Effectiveness in modern anti-tank role===

The questionable effectiveness of ER weapons against modern tanks is cited as one of the main reasons that these weapons are no longer fielded or stockpiled. With the increase in average tank armor thickness since the first ER weapons were fielded, it was argued in the March 13, 1986, &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine that tank armor protection was approaching the level where tank crews would be almost fully protected from radiation effects. Thus, for an ER weapon to incapacitate a modern tank crew through irradiation, the weapon must be detonated at such proximity to the tank that the nuclear explosion&#x27;s blast would now be equally effective at incapacitating it and its crew.

However, although the author did note that effective neutron absorbers and neutron poisons such as boron carbide can be incorporated into conventional armor and strap-on neutron moderating hydrogenous material (substances containing hydrogen atoms), such as explosive reactive armor, increasing the protection factor, the author holds that in practice, combined with neutron scattering, the actual average total tank area protection factor is rarely higher than 15.5 to 35. According to the Federation of American Scientists, the neutron protection factor of a &quot;tank&quot; can be as low as 2, without qualifying whether the statement implies a light tank, medium tank, or main battle tank.

A composite high-density concrete, or alternatively, a laminated graded-Z shield, 24 units thick of which 16 units are iron and 8 units are polyethylene containing boron (BPE), and additional mass behind it to attenuate neutron capture gamma rays, is more effective than just 24 units of pure iron or BPE alone, due to the advantages of both iron and BPE in combination. During neutron transport, iron is effective in slowing down/scattering high-energy neutrons in the 14-MeV energy range and attenuating gamma rays, while the hydrogen in polyethylene is effective in slowing down these now slower fast neutrons in the few MeV range, and boron 10 has a high absorption cross section for thermal neutrons and a low production yield of gamma rays when it absorbs a neutron. The Soviet T-72 tank, in response to the neutron bomb threat, is cited as having fitted a boronated polyethylene liner, which has had its neutron shielding properties simulated.
However, some tank armor material contains depleted uranium (DU), common in the US&#x27;s M1A1 Abrams tank, which incorporates steel-encased depleted uranium armor, a substance that will fast fission when it captures a fast, fusion-generated neutron, and thus on fissioning will produce fission neutrons and fission products embedded within the armor, products which emit, among other things, penetrating gamma rays. Although the neutrons emitted by the neutron bomb may not penetrate to the tank crew in lethal quantities, the fast fission of DU within the armor could still ensure a lethal environment for the crew and maintenance personnel by fission neutron and gamma ray exposure, largely depending on the exact thickness and elemental composition of the armor—information usually hard to attain. Despite this, Ducrete—which has an elemental composition similar (but not identical) to the ceramic second-generation heavy metal Chobham armor of the Abrams tank—is an effective radiation shield, to both &quot;fission&quot; neutrons and gamma rays due to it being a graded-Z material. Uranium, being about twice as dense as lead, is thus nearly twice as effective at shielding gamma ray radiation per unit thickness.

===Use against ballistic missiles===
As an anti-ballistic missile weapon, the first fielded ER warhead, the W66, was developed for the Sprint missile system as part of the Safeguard Program to protect United States cities and missile silos from incoming Soviet warheads.

A problem faced by Sprint and similar ABMs was that the blast effects of their warheads change greatly as they climb and the atmosphere thins out. At higher altitudes, starting around and above, the blast effects begin to drop off rapidly as the air density becomes very low. This can be countered by using a larger warhead, but then it becomes too powerful when used at lower altitudes. An ideal system would use a mechanism that was less sensitive to changes in air density.

Neutron-based attacks offer one solution to this problem. The burst of neutrons released by an ER weapon can induce fission in the fissile materials of primary in the target warhead. The energy released by these reactions may be enough to melt the warhead, but even at lower fission rates, the &quot;burning up&quot; of some of the fuel in the primary can cause it to fail to explode properly, or &quot;fizzle&quot;. Thus, a small ER warhead can be effective across a wide altitude band, using blast effects at lower altitudes and the increasingly long-ranged neutrons as the engagement rises.

The use of neutron-based attacks was discussed as early as the 1950s, with the US Atomic Energy Commission mentioning weapons with a &quot;clean, enhanced neutron output&quot; for use as &quot;antimissile defensive warheads.&quot; Studying, improving and defending against such attacks was a major area of research during the 1950s and &#x27;60s. A particular example of this is the US Polaris A-3 missile, which delivered three warheads travelling on roughly the same trajectory, and thus with a short distance between them. A single ABM could conceivably destroy all three through neutron flux. Developing warheads that were less sensitive to these attacks was also a major area of research in the US and UK during the 1960s.

Some sources claim that the neutron flux attack was also the main design goal of the various nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft weapons like the AIM-26 Falcon and CIM-10 Bomarc. One F-102 pilot noted:

It has also been suggested that neutron flux&#x27;s effects on the warhead electronics are another attack vector for ER warheads in the ABM role. Ionization greater than 50 Gray in silicon chips delivered over seconds to minutes will degrade the function of semiconductors for long periods. However, while such attacks might be useful against guidance systems, which used relatively advanced electronics, in the ABM role, these components have long ago separated from the warheads by the time they come within range of the interceptors. The electronics in the warheads themselves tend to be very simple, and hardening them was one of the many issues studied in the 1960s.

Lithium-6 hydride (Li6H) is cited as being used as a countermeasure to reduce the vulnerability and &quot;harden&quot; nuclear warheads from the effects of externally generated neutrons. Radiation hardening of the warhead&#x27;s electronic components as a countermeasure to high altitude neutron warheads somewhat reduces the range that a neutron warhead could successfully cause an unrecoverable glitch by the &quot;transient radiation effects on electronics&quot; (TREE) effects.

At very high altitudes, at the edge of the atmosphere and above it, another effect comes into play. At lower altitudes, the X-rays generated by the bomb are absorbed by the air and have mean free paths on the order of meters. But as the air thins out, the X-rays can travel further, eventually outpacing the area of effect of the neutrons. In exoatmospheric explosions, this can be on the order of in radius. In this sort of attack, it is the X-rays promptly delivering energy on the warhead surface that is the active mechanism; the rapid ablation (or &quot;blowoff&quot;) of the surface creates shock waves that can break up the warhead.

===Use as an area denial weapon===
In November 2012, British Labour peer Lord Gilbert suggested that multiple enhanced radiation reduced blast (ERRB) warheads could be detonated in the mountain region of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to prevent infiltration. He proposed to warn the inhabitants to evacuate, then irradiate the area, making it unusable and impassable. Used in this manner, the neutron bomb(s), regardless of burst height, would release neutron activated casing materials used in the bomb, and depending on burst height, create radioactive soil activation products.

In much the same fashion as the area denial effect resulting from fission product (the substances that make up most fallout) contamination in an area following a conventional surface-burst nuclear explosion, as considered in the Korean War by Douglas MacArthur, it would thus be a form of radiological warfare—with the difference that neutron bombs produce half, or less, of the quantity of fission products relative to the same-yield pure fission bomb. Radiological warfare with neutron bombs that rely on fission primaries would thus still produce fission fallout, albeit a comparatively &quot;cleaner&quot; and shorter-lasting version of it in the area than if air bursts were used, as little to no fission products would be deposited on the direct immediate area, instead becoming diluted global fallout.

A militarily useful use of a neutron bomb with respect to area denial would be to encase it in a thick shell of material that could be neutron activated, and use a surface burst. In this manner, the neutron bomb would be turned into a &quot;salted bomb&quot;; for example, zinc-64, produced as a byproduct of depleted zinc oxide enrichment, would when neutron activated become zinc-65, which is a gamma emitter with a half-life of 244 days.

== Hypothetical effects of a pure fusion bomb ==

With considerable overlap between the two devices, the prompt radiation effects of a pure fusion weapon would similarly be much higher than that of a pure-fission device: approximately twice the initial radiation output of current standard fission–fusion-based weapons. In common with all neutron bombs that must presently derive a small percentage of trigger energy from fission, in any given yield, a 100% pure fusion bomb would likewise generate a smaller atmospheric blast wave than a &quot;pure&quot;-fission bomb. The latter fission device has a higher kinetic energy-ratio per unit of reaction energy released, which is most notable in the comparison with the D-T fusion reaction. A larger percentage of the energy from a D-T fusion reaction is inherently put into uncharged neutron generation as opposed to charged particles, such as the alpha particle of the D-T reaction, the primary species, that is most responsible for the coulomb explosion/fireball.

<text>Fighting Fantasy is a series of single-player role-playing gamebooks created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone. The first volume in the series was published in paperback by Puffin in 1982.

The series distinguished itself by mixing Choose Your Own Adventure–style storytelling with a dice-based role-playing element included within the books themselves. The caption on many of the covers claimed each title was an adventure &quot;in which YOU are the hero!&quot; The majority of the titles followed a fantasy theme, although science fiction, post-apocalyptic, superhero, and modern horror gamebooks were also published. The popularity of the series led to the creation of merchandise such as action figures, board games, role-playing game systems, magazines, novels, and video games.

Puffin ended the series in 1995, but the rights to the series were eventually purchased by Wizard Books in 2002. Wizard published new editions of the original books and also commissioned six new books over two series, ending in 2012. The rights were then acquired by Scholastic in 2017, which has since published four new titles and reissued thirteen of the original books with new artwork.

==Overview==
The main text of each gamebook does not progress in a linear fashion, but rather is divided into a series of numbered sections (usually 400, though a few are shorter or longer). Beginning at the first section, the reader typically must pick one of a series of options provided by the text, each option being detailed at a separate non-sequential numbered section (e.g. the reader may be presented with a choice to turn from section 1 directly to either section 83 or section 180) which in turn provides an outcome for the option chosen. The book continues in this fashion until their character is killed in combat, is stopped by the story, or completes the story. &quot;&quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebooks empower the reader, who felt the anxiety or joy of being fantasy heroes themselves – they lived or died by their decisions. And if at first you don’t succeed, try and try again,&quot; said Ian Livingstone of the format.

The typical &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebook tasks players with completing a quest. A successful play usually ends with the player reaching the final numbered section of the book. In some cases this can only be achieved by obtaining various story items (e.g. gems in &quot;Deathtrap Dungeon&quot;); many of the titles only feature one path to the solution.

All &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebooks are illustrated, including full-page pieces and smaller, repeated images scattered throughout the book as breaks or space fillers between sections. Regular contributors (excluding Scholastic editions) included Les Edwards, Terry Oakes, Russ Nicholson, Leo Hartas, Ian Miller, John Blanche, Martin McKenna, and Iain McCaig.

=== System ===
Each &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebook requires the reader to create their character, randomly assigning scores to three statistics (skill, stamina, and luck). These, in conjunction with rolling six-sided dice, are used to resolve skill challenges and the combat sections. Some titles use additional statistics or conflict resolution mechanics; most also require the reader to keep an inventory of items.

=== Setting ===
Most early &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; titles were set in locations later revealed to be on the same continent called Allansia. Later a whole world named Titan was developed, with subsequent gamebooks set on three main continents—Allansia, Khul and the Old World. Other titles are set in unrelated fantasy, horror, modern day, and sci-fi environments.

==Publication history==
In 1980, Steve Jackson (not to be confused with the US-based game designer of the same name) and Ian Livingstone attended a Games Day, and after meeting with a Penguin Books editor Geraldine Cook decided to create a series of single-player gamebooks. Their first submission, &quot;The Magic Quest&quot;, was a short adventure intended to demonstrate the style of game. &quot;The Magic Quest&quot; was eventually accepted by Penguin, although the authors devoted a further six months to expanding and improving upon their original concept.

===Puffin Books (1982–1995)===
The result was &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; and, after several rewrites, the book was accepted and published in 1982 under Penguin&#x27;s children&#x27;s imprint, Puffin Books. Following the success of this title, Jackson and Livingstone began writing individually to create additional &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebooks.

This series was published under Puffin&#x27;s newly-created &quot;Adventure Gamebooks&quot; banner, which eventually would hold not only the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, but &quot;The Cretan Chronicles&quot; trilogy, the &quot;Starlight Adventures&quot; series, and the individual role-playing game &quot;Maelstrom&quot; as well.

In 1983, &quot;The Citadel of Chaos&quot; and &quot;The Forest of Doom&quot; were published, by Jackson and Livingstone respectively. Four more titles quickly followed: &quot;Starship Traveller&quot; (the first title with a science fiction setting), &quot;City of Thieves&quot;, &quot;Deathtrap Dungeon&quot;, and &quot;Island of the Lizard King&quot;; Jackson writing one and Livingstone writing three. In 1984, a decision was made to hire additional writers to expand the series more quickly: Steve Jackson (the U.S.-based founder and owner of Steve Jackson Games) was the first, followed by others such as Andrew Chapman, Carl Sargent (aka Keith Martin), Marc Gascoigne, and Peter Darvill-Evans. Jackson and Livingstone, however, continued to be involved and approved all cover and internal illustrations within the UK.

Jackson wrote a self-contained four-part series titled &quot;Steve Jackson&#x27;s Sorcery!&quot; (1983-1985), which combined the use of combat and sorcery, and introduced the continent later known as the Old World. These featured dice images at the bottom of each page, making it possible for the player to randomly flip through the pages for the equivalent of a dice roll (the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; titles published by Wizard Books used the same device).

Andrew Chapman and Martin Allen also wrote a two-book, two-player adventure titled &quot;Clash of the Princes&quot; (1986). There were also several supplemental books produced that provided more information about the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; universe, including a comprehensive bestiary of monsters and a sample adventure.

Although the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; titles had successful sales the increasing dominance of video games in the 1990s caused a gradual decline. The series was scheduled to conclude with &quot;Return to Firetop Mountain&quot; (book 50, Livingstone, 1992), but due to strong sales of that volume, ten more books were scheduled. Nine were published, the series ending with &quot;Curse of the Mummy&quot; (1995). &quot;Bloodbones&quot;, the tenth scheduled title (meant to have been book 60 in the series) was cancelled, but was eventually published by Wizard Books as part of their later reprinting efforts.

===Wizard Books===
====Series 1 (2002–2007)====
In 2002, Wizard Books acquired the rights to the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series and reprinted many of the original titles in a revised order (initially only the gamebooks actually written by Jackson and/or Livingstone were published), starting with &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;. They also incorporated the &quot;Sorcery!&quot; miniseries, as books 9, 11, 13, and 15. A new title, &quot;Eye of the Dragon&quot; (by Ian Livingstone) was released in 2005, followed by &quot;Bloodbones&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Howl of the Werewolf&quot; in 2007. This series used a new logo, the rationale being that the old covers did not suit the modern market.

2007 also marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot;, and to commemorate the event Wizard Books published a special hardcover edition of &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; that used the original 1982 cover image and contained extra material such as the dungeon solution and a commentary on &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; by Livingstone. This series concluded that same year, ending with 29 books.

====Series 2 (2009–2012)====
Wizard Books then began again with a new series of reprints in 2009, again featuring a different cover art style, and again starting with &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;. These books were physically larger than prior releases, being produced in B-format (like the original &quot;Advanced Fighting Fantasy&quot; volumes). Three other original titles were added during this run, including &quot;Blood of the Zombies&quot; by Ian Livingstone to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary in 2012. This series was 17 books long, although &quot;Blood of the Zombies&quot;, the last volume released, is unnumbered and packaged differently than the rest.

===Scholastic Books (2017–)===
A new &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; book by Livingstone, &quot;The Port of Peril&quot;, was published in August 2017 by Scholastic in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the series. Scholastic also released five of the original books. Instead of reusing the original artwork or its style, Scholastic commissioned new artwork. In April 2018, a further six titles were published, including a new adventure by author Charlie Higson, entitled &quot;The Gates of Death&quot;. Three more titles were published in September 2019, including Livingstone&#x27;s new adventure &quot;Assassins of Allansia&quot;. In October 2020, two new titles were published, including a new adventure entitled &quot;Crystal of Storms&quot;, the first in the series by a female author, Rhianna Pratchett. In September 2022, two more new titles were published, one by Steve Jackson (&quot;Secrets of Salamonis&quot;) and one by Ian Livingstone (&quot;Shadow of the Giants&quot;), in celebration of the series&#x27; 40th anniversary. In September 2024, a new title by Ian Livingstone, &quot;The Dungeon on Blood Island&quot;, was released.

=== United States ===
&quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; was published in the United States by Laurel Leaf, an imprint of Dell Publishing, beginning in November of 1983. These U.S. versions featured a new cover design, with the first eleven books using a white background for their covers and books 12 through 21 using a black background. Initially these editions had new cover illustrations by Richard Corben (books 1 through 7) and Richard Courtney (books 8 through 13), until 1986 when with &quot;Temple of Terror&quot; (book 14) the original Puffin Books cover illustration were used till the range ended with book 21, &quot;Trial of Champions&quot;. During this run, &quot;House of Hell&quot; was re-titled &quot;House of Hades&quot;.

In October 2003, iBooks of New York began republishing the books, beginning with the first two (&quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; and &quot;The Citadel of Chaos&quot;). iBooks filled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2006.

In October 2024, Steve Jackson Games announced that it had secured the U.S. rights to publish &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot;, with the first books scheduled to appear in &quot;early 2025&quot; in two waves of five books each.

==Other media==
=== Printed ===
&quot;Warlock&quot; magazine (first published by Puffin Books and later Games Workshop) provided additional information on the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; universe, and each issue featured a short gamebook adventure, new rules, monsters, reviews and comic strips. It was published from 1983 to 1986 and ran for 13 issues in the UK. It was also published in other countries, and continued in Japan until 1997.

In 1984, Jackson published a roleplaying game, &quot;Fighting Fantasy – The Introductory Role-playing Game&quot;. A second game was published in 1989: &quot;Advanced Fighting Fantasy&quot; (AFF). AFF was re-released as a new and further expanded edition by Arion Games in 2011.

In 1985, Jackson wrote a picture gamebook with the title &quot;Tasks of Tantalon&quot;, in which the player was required to solve a series of puzzles which were presented as large, full-colour pictures containing hidden clues to be located and assembled.

&quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; (1986) and &quot;Legend of Zagor&quot; (1993) were released as board games by Games Workshop and Parker Brothers respectively.

Between 1989 and 1994, seven novels were published based on &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot;, written by Steve Jackson, Marc Gascoigne, Ian Livingstone, and Carl Sargent.

In 1992, the &quot;Fighting Fantasy 10th Anniversary Yearbook&quot; (a diary with articles, trivia and a gamebook) was published.

In 2003, Jamie Wallis (not to be confused with James Wallis) adapted eight &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Sorcery!&quot; gamebooks to the D20 System. These adventures were published by Myriador (now defunct, though PDFs are still available for purchase from Greywood Publishing via third-party online retailers).

A comic series based on &quot;Freeway Fighter&quot; was published by Titan Comics in May 2017.

=== Audio ===
In September 2017, a series of audio dramas based on classic &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; titles was launched by FoxYason Productions at Fighting Fantasy Fest 2, starting with &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain: The Hero&#x27;s Quest&quot;. A boxset of four more titles was released in 2018.

=== Video games ===
Several &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; titles have been released as video games, including seven &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; titles (&quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;, &quot;The Citadel of Chaos&quot;, &quot;The Forest of Doom&quot;, &quot;Temple of Terror&quot;, &quot;Seas of Blood&quot;, &quot;Appointment with F.E.A.R.&quot; and &quot;Rebel Planet&quot;) for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, BBC, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum (1984) and &quot;Deathtrap Dungeon&quot; for the PC and PlayStation by Eidos Interactive (1998). On 18 August 2011 an adaption of &quot;Talisman of Death&quot; was released by UK developer Laughing Jackal for the &quot;PlayStation Minis&quot; platform (playable on the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3).
Cambridge-based studio Inkle released another interactive version of &quot;The Shamutanti Hills&quot; for iOS in May 2013, and has since gone on to release all four parts of Sorcery! on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.

The video game &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain: Goblin Scourge Edition&quot; was released by Tin Man Games for the Nintendo Switch on 13 September 2018.

Tin Man Games has also released the &quot;Fighting Fantasy Classics&quot; video game for Windows. &quot;Bloodbones&quot; is available for free and other titles are available as paid DLC.

Nomad Games released Deathtrap Dungeon Trilogy for the Nintendo Switch in 2019.

=== Mobile ===
On 5 December 2006, it was announced that Jackson and Livingstone were planning to release a new series of handheld games based on &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; for Nintendo DS and Sony&#x27;s PSP. The first of these, &quot;Fighting Fantasy: The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;, was released for the DS in the United States on 25 November 2009, and for the Apple iPhone and iPod in early January 2010.

On 10 February 2011 an Amazon Kindle edition of &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; was launched by UK developer Worldweaver Ltd, for the US market. &quot;Warlock&quot; and four other gamebooks were released on iOS by Big Blue Bubble, but were removed from the app store in 2012 when they lost the licence.

Australian game developers Tin Man Games have since published several iOS and Android versions of &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; books, including &quot;Blood of the Zombies&quot;, &quot;House of Hell&quot;, &quot;Forest of Doom&quot;, &quot;Island of the Lizard King&quot; and &quot;Starship Traveller&quot;, and an iOS version of the first part of the Sorcery! series was released by Bright Al Ltd in 2010.

&quot;Inkle&#x27;s Sorcery! series&quot; is available on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.

==Reception==
In March 1983, the top three entries of the Sunday &quot;Times&quot; bestseller list were occupied by &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; books. The series sold 20 million copies in the 80s and 90s.

&quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; was ranked 47th in the 1996 reader poll of &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. The UK magazine&#x27;s editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;To say that it is basic would be a huge understatement – &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; has just a couple of stats from which a character is created, and combat is a simple case of rolling six-sided dice, pitching one creature&#x27;s stats against another. It&#x27;s fun, quick and easy, which explains its popularity.&quot;

=== Moral panic ===
The books were published with illustrations from Games Workshop which, though something Puffin was resistant to accept, Ian Livingstone credits as part of the series&#x27; success. However, partially as a result of the covers, the game, along with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, became the subject of a moral panic. The Evangelical Alliance issued a warning that the books would lead to players interacting with the devil, while parents reported that after reading their children developed supernatural powers, including one mother who reported that her child started to fly. When asked about the controversy, Jackson replied that they were very grateful for it, as it helped their sales figures. Game historian Stu Horvath commented &quot;The moral panic didn&#x27;t dent sales. &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; and the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series proved to be a massive on-ramp for bringing new players into the RPG hobby, particularly in the British commonwealth ... &quot;Firetop Mountain&quot; alone was reprinted five times in 1982, ten times in 1983, and seven more in 1984, eventually selling well over two million copies and inspiring a popular board game to boot.&quot;

<text>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), also known as the National Academies, is a congressionally chartered organization that serves as the collective scientific national academy of the United States. The name is used interchangeably in two senses: (1) as an umbrella term or parent organization for its three sub-divisions that operate as quasi-independent honorific learned society member organizations known as the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM); and (2) as the brand for studies and reports issued by the unified operating arm of the three academies originally known as the National Research Council (NRC). The National Academies also serve as public policy advisors, research institutes, think tanks, and public administration consultants on issues of public importance or on request by the government.

The National Research Council, National Academy of Engineering, and National Academy of Medicine began as activities of the National Academy of Sciences until they were reorganized in 2015 into units of the current National Academies while maintaining the charter status and corporate successorship of the original National Academy of Sciences.

Now jointly governed by all three academies, the NRC produces some 200 publications annually which are published by the National Academies Press. The reports produced by the National Academies have been characterized as reflective of scientific consensus.

==History==
The US National Academy of Sciences was created by an Act of Incorporation dated March 3, 1863, which was signed by then President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. The Act stated that &quot;... the Academy shall, whenever called upon by any department of the Government, investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art. ... &quot; With the American civil war raging, the new academy was presented with few problems to solve, but it did address matters of &quot;... coinage, weights and measures, iron ship hulls, and the purity of whiskey ...&quot;
All subsequently affiliated organizations have been created under this same overall congressional charter, including the two younger academies, National Academy of Engineering (NAE) (created in 1964) and NAM (created as the Institute of Medicine in 1970 and rechartered as NAM in 2015).

Under this same charter, the National Research Council was created in 1916. On June 19 of that year, then US President Woodrow Wilson requested that the National Academy of Sciences organize a &quot;National Research Council&quot;. The purpose of the council (at first called the National Research Foundation) was in part to foster and encourage &quot;the increased use of scientific research in the development of American industries ... the employment of scientific methods in strengthening the national defense ... and such other applications of science as will promote the national security and welfare.&quot;

At the time, the academy&#x27;s effort to support national defense readiness, the Committee on Nitric Acid Supply, was approved by Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Nitric acid was the substance basic in the making of propellants such as cordite, high explosives, dyes, fertilizers, and other products but availability was limited due to World War I. The NRC, through its committee, recommended importing Chilean saltpeter and the construction of four new ordnance plants. These recommendations were accepted by the War Department in June 1917, although the plants were not completed prior to the end of the war. &lt;br&gt; 
In 1918, Wilson formalized the NRC&#x27;s existence under Executive Order 2859. Wilson&#x27;s order declared the function of the NRC to be in general:
:&quot;(T)o stimulate research in the mathematical. physical, and biological sciences. and in the application of these sciences to engineering, agriculture. medicine. and other useful arts. with the object of increasing knowledge, of strengthening the national defense, and of contributing in other ways to the public welfare.&quot;
During World War I, when the United States was at war, the NRC operated as the Department of Science and Research of the Council of National Defense as well as the Science and Research Division of the United States Army Signal Corps. When war was first declared, the council had organized committees on anti-submarine and gas warfare.

On June 1, 1917, the council convened a meeting of scientific representatives of the United Kingdom and France with interested parties from the U.S. on the subject of submarine detection. Another meeting with the British and French was held in Paris in October 1918, at which more details of their work were disclosed. As a result of these meetings, the NRC recommended that scientists be brought together to work on the problems associated with submarine detection. Due to the success of council-directed research in producing a sound-based method of detecting submarines, as well as other military innovations, the NRC was retained at the end of the war, though it was gradually decoupled from the military.

NRC&#x27;s Articles of Organization have been changed only three times: in 1956, January 1993, and July 2015.

==The Academies==
The National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and National Academy of Medicine are honorary membership organizations, each of which has its own governing Council, and each of which elects its own new members. The membership
of the three academies totals more than 6,300 scientists, engineers, and health professionals. New members for each organization are elected annually by existing members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research. By the terms of the original 1863 Congressional charter, the three academies serve &quot;pro bono&quot; as &quot;advisers to the nation on science, engineering, and medicine.&quot;
==Program units==
The program units, formerly known as the National Research Council, are collectively the operating arm of the three academies for the purpose of providing objective policy advice. Although separately chartered (see above), it falls legally under the overall charter of the National Academy of Sciences, whose ultimate fiduciary body is the NAS Council. In actual practice, the NAS Council delegates governing authority to a Governing Board of the National Research Council that is chaired jointly by the presidents of the three academies, with additional members chosen by them or specified in the charters of the academies.

Under this three-academy umbrella, the program units produce reports that shape policies, inform public opinion, and advance the pursuit of science, engineering, and medicine.

==Study process==
The National Academies attempt to obtain authoritative, objective, and scientifically balanced answers to difficult questions of national importance. Top scientists, engineers, health professionals, and other experts (not limited to those in academies membership) are enlisted to address the scientific and technical aspects of some of society&#x27;s problems. These experts are volunteers who serve on study committees that are convened to answer specific sets of questions. All committee members serve without pay.

NASEM does not perform original research; rather it provides independent advice. Federal agencies are the primary financial sponsors of the Academies&#x27; work; additional studies are funded by state agencies, foundations, other private sponsors, and the National Academies endowment. The external sponsors have no control over the conduct or results of a study, once the statement of task and budget are finalized. Study committees gather information from many sources in public meetings but deliberate in private in order to avoid political, special interest, and sponsor influence.

All reports go through an extensive external review facilitated by the internal Report Review Committee (also consisting of members from the NAS, NAE, and NAM).

Through this study process, the National Academies produce around 200 reports each year. Recent reports addressed the obesity epidemic, the use of forensics in the courtroom, invasive plants, pollinator collapse, underage drinking, the Hubble Space Telescope, vaccine safety, the hydrogen economy, transportation safety, climate change, and homeland security. Many reports influence policy decisions; some are instrumental in enabling new research programs; others provide independent program reviews. The National Academies Press is the publisher for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and makes its publications available for free online reading. The full book PDFs have been available for free download since 2011.

The National Academies also provide credentialed witnesses who speak before government bodies on important issues. For example, a committee chair may speak on rising mortality rates in working adults in the US to a Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

===Reports===
====Climate change====
In 2001, the NRC published the report &quot;Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions&quot;, which emphasized that national policy decisions made both in the near term and in the future will influence the extent of any damage suffered by vulnerable human populations and ecosystems later in this century. The report endorsed findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as representing the views of the scientific community:

The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability. Human-induced warming and associated sea level rise are expected to continue through the 21st century ... The IPCC&#x27;s conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current[2001] thinking of the scientific community on this issue.

In 2013, the NRC published the report &quot;Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change: Anticipating Surprises&quot;, which provided an updated look at the issue of abrupt climate change and its potential impacts. This study differed from previous treatments of abrupt changes by focusing on abrupt climate changes and also abrupt climate impacts that have the potential to severely affect the physical climate system, natural systems, or human systems, often affecting multiple interconnected areas of concern.

====Sexual assault====
In 2013, the NRC published the report &quot;Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault&quot;, which pointed out that approximately 80 percent of sexual assaults go unreported to law enforcement. The report recommends that the National Crime Victimization Survey adopt new approaches to interviews of rape victims, including changing the wording of questions.

In an article about the report, Amber Stevenson, clinical supervisor and therapist at the Nashville Sexual Assault Center, said that victim-blaming was the main issue preventing victims from coming forward: As long as we as a community continue to make victim-blaming statements, such as, &quot;She put herself in this situation,&quot;...&quot;She didn&#x27;t fight back, she must have wanted it,&quot; we will continue to see rapes go unreported ... We have to stop blaming the victim. The conversation needs to shift to the person who chose to rape.

====Integrity in research====
The 1992 report, &quot;Responsible Science: Ensuring the Integrity of the Research Process&quot; was updated in 2017 by the report, &quot;Fostering Integrity in Research:&quot;

 ... as experience has accumulated with various forms of research misconduct, detrimental research practices, and other forms of misconduct, as subsequent empirical research has revealed more about the nature of scientific misconduct, and because technological and social changes have altered the environment in which science is conducted, it is clear that the framework established more than two decades ago needs to be updated.

One of the report&#x27;s main concerns is that a growing percentage of recently published research turns out to be not reproducible due in part to inadequate support of standards of transparency in many fields as well as to various other detrimental research practices.

==Other programs==
The Christine Mirzayan Science and Technology Policy Fellowship is an annual program for recent graduate students to spend three months working in the National Academies. The Academies also administered the Marian Koshland Science Museum in downtown Washington until its closing in 2017; the Museum has since been replaced by LabX, a program of online resources and nationwide public events that aim to increase awareness of scientific and evidence-based solutions to community problems.

==Revenue==
The National Academies do not receive direct appropriations from the federal government; instead their revenue comes from grants and contracts of federal agencies and private sources. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2023, &quot;about 70 percent of the National Academies budget comes from federal funds, it also raised private donations from individuals, nonprofits and companies, including Chevron, Google, Merck, and Medtronic.&quot; At the time it was advising the government on opioid policy, it received $19 million from Purdue Pharma&#x27;s Sackler family between 2000 and 2021.

<doc id="37636" wikidata="Q199615" url="?curid=37636" title="Encephalitis">
<text>Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain. The severity can be variable with symptoms including reduction or alteration in consciousness, aphasia, headache, fever, confusion, a stiff neck, and vomiting. Complications may include seizures, hallucinations, trouble speaking, memory problems, and problems with hearing.

Causes of encephalitis include viruses such as herpes simplex virus and rabies virus as well as bacteria, fungi, or parasites. Other causes include autoimmune diseases and certain medications. In many cases the cause remains unknown. Risk factors include a weak immune system. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and supported by blood tests, medical imaging, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.

Certain types are preventable with vaccines. Treatment may include antiviral medications (such as acyclovir), anticonvulsants, and corticosteroids. Treatment generally takes place in hospital. Some people require artificial respiration. Once the immediate problem is under control, rehabilitation may be required. In 2015, encephalitis was estimated to have affected 4.3 million people and resulted in 150,000 deaths worldwide.

==Signs and symptoms==
Adults with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may present with irritability, poor appetite and fever. Neurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused person. Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis.

===Limbic encephalitis===
Limbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the brain. The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures, and behavioral anomalies. MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures. Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin.

===Encephalitis lethargica===
Encephalitis lethargica is identified by high fever, headache, delayed physical response, and lethargy. Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, and tremors, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known. From 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred worldwide.

==Cause==

In 30%-40% of encephalitis cases, the etiology remains unknown.
===Viral===

Viral infections are the usual cause of infectious encephalitis. Viral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the sequelae of a latent infection. The majority of viral cases of encephalitis have an unknown cause; however, the most common identifiable cause of viral encephalitis is from herpes simplex infection. Other causes of acute viral encephalitis are rabies virus, poliovirus, and measles virus.

Additional possible viral causes are arboviral flavivirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile virus), bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), reovirus (Colorado tick virus), and henipavirus infections. The Powassan virus is a rare cause of encephalitis.

===Bacterial===
It can be caused by a bacterial infection, such as bacterial meningitis, or may be a complication of a current infectious disease such as syphilis (secondary encephalitis).

Other bacterial pathogens, like &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and those causing rickettsial disease, cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis. Lyme disease or &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot; may also cause encephalitis.

===Other infectious causes===

Certain parasitic or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis and malaria can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems.

The rare but typically deadly forms of encephalitis, primary amoebic meningoencephalitis and Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, are caused by free-living amoeba.

===Autoimmune encephalitis===
Autoimmune encephalitis signs can include catatonia, psychosis, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation. Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and Rasmussen encephalitis are examples of autoimmune encephalitis.

Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is the most common autoimmune form, and is accompanied by ovarian teratoma in 58 percent of affected women 18–45 years of age.

Another autoimmune cause includes acute disseminated encephalitis, a demyelinating disease which primarily affects children.

==Diagnosis==

People should only be diagnosed with encephalitis if they have a decreased or altered level of consciousness, lethargy, or personality change for at least twenty-four hours without any other explainable cause. Diagnosing encephalitis is done via a variety of tests:
* Brain scan, done by MRI, can determine inflammation and differentiate from other possible causes.
* EEG, in monitoring brain activity, encephalitis will produce abnormal signal.
* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), this helps determine via a test using the cerebral-spinal fluid, obtained from the lumbar region.
* Blood test
* Urine analysis
* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the cerebrospinal fluid, to detect the presence of viral DNA which is a sign of viral encephalitis.

==Prevention==
Vaccination is available against tick-borne and Japanese encephalitis and should be considered for at-risk individuals. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating smallpox vaccination is avoidable, for all intents and purposes, as smallpox is nearly eradicated. Contraindication to Pertussis immunization should be observed in patients with encephalitis.

==Treatment==
An ideal drug to treat brain infection should be small, moderately lipophilic at pH of 7.4, low level of plasma protein binding, volume of distribution of litre per kg, does not have strong affinity towards binding with P-glycoprotein, or other efflux pumps on the surface of blood–brain barrier. Some drugs such as isoniazid, pyrazinamide, linezolid, metronidazole, fluconazole, and some fluoroquinolones have good penetration to blood brain barrier. Treatment (which is based on supportive care) is as follows:
Pyrimethamine-based maintenance therapy is often used to treat toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE), which is caused by &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; and can be life-threatening for people with weak immune systems. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in conjunction with the established pyrimethamine-based maintenance therapy, decreases the chance of relapse in patients with HIV and TE from approximately 18% to 11%. This is a significant difference as relapse may impact the severity and prognosis of disease and result in an increase in healthcare expenditure.

The effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin for the management of childhood encephalitis is unclear. Systematic reviews have been unable to draw firm conclusions because of a lack of randomised double-blind studies with sufficient numbers of patients and sufficient follow-up. There is the possibility of a benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin for some forms of childhood encephalitis on some indicators such as length of hospital stay, time to stop spasms, time to regain consciousness, and time to resolution of neuropathic symptoms and fever. Intravenous immunoglobulin for Japanese encephalitis appeared to have no benefit when compared with placebo (pretend) treatment.

==Prognosis==
Identification of poor prognostic factors include cerebral edema, status epilepticus, and thrombocytopenia. In contrast, a normal encephalogram at the early stages of diagnosis is associated with high rates of survival.

==Epidemiology==

The number of new cases a year of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 people per year. In tropical countries, the incidence is 6.34 per 100,000 people per year. The number of cases of encephalitis has not changed much over time, with about 250,000 cases a year from 2005 to 2015 in the US. Approximately seven per 100,000 people were hospitalized for encephalitis in the US during this time. In 2015, encephalitis was estimated to have affected 4.3 million people and resulted in 150,000 deaths worldwide. Herpes simplex encephalitis has an incidence of 2–4 per million of the population per year.

==Terminology==

Encephalitis with meningitis is known as meningoencephalitis, while encephalitis with involvement of the spinal cord is known as encephalomyelitis.

The word is from Ancient Greek , &#x27;brain&#x27;, composed of , , &#x27;in&#x27; and , , &#x27;head&#x27;, and the medical suffix &quot;-itis&quot; &#x27;inflammation&#x27;.

<doc id="37637" wikidata="Q745930" url="?curid=37637" title="Nucleophile">
<text>In chemistry, a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds by donating an electron pair. All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases. 

&quot;Nucleophilic&quot; describes the affinity of a nucleophile to bond with positively charged atomic nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance&#x27;s nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the affinity of atoms. Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are named solvolysis. Nucleophiles may take part in nucleophilic substitution, whereby a nucleophile becomes attracted to a full or partial positive charge, and nucleophilic addition. Nucleophilicity is closely related to basicity. The difference between the two is, that basicity is a thermodynamic property (i.e. relates to an equilibrium state), but nucleophilicity is a kinetic property, which relates to rates of certain chemical reactions.

== History and Etymology ==
The terms &quot;nucleophile&quot; and &quot;electrophile&quot; were introduced by Christopher Kelk Ingold in 1933, replacing the terms &quot;anionoid&quot; and &quot;cationoid&quot; proposed earlier by A. J. Lapworth in 1925. The word nucleophile is derived from nucleus and the Greek word φιλος, philos, meaning friend.

== Properties ==
In general, in a group across the periodic table, the more basic the ion (the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid) the more reactive it is as a nucleophile. Within a series of nucleophiles with the same attacking element (e.g. oxygen), the order of nucleophilicity will follow basicity. Sulfur is in general a better nucleophile than oxygen.

=== Nucleophilicity ===
Many schemes attempting to quantify relative nucleophilic strength have been devised. The following empirical data have been obtained by measuring reaction rates for many reactions involving many nucleophiles and electrophiles. Nucleophiles displaying the so-called alpha effect are usually omitted in this type of treatment.

==== Swain–Scott equation ====
The first such attempt is found in the Swain–Scott equation derived in 1953:
:formula_1

This free-energy relationship relates the pseudo first order reaction rate constant (in water at 25 °C), &quot;k&quot;, of a reaction, normalized to the reaction rate, &quot;k&quot;0, of a standard reaction with water as the nucleophile, to a nucleophilic constant &quot;n&quot; for a given nucleophile and a substrate constant &quot;s&quot; that depends on the sensitivity of a substrate to nucleophilic attack (defined as 1 for methyl bromide).

This treatment results in the following values for typical nucleophilic anions: acetate 2.7, chloride 3.0, azide 4.0, hydroxide 4.2, aniline 4.5, iodide 5.0, and thiosulfate 6.4. Typical substrate constants are 0.66 for ethyl tosylate, 0.77 for β-propiolactone, 1.00 for 2,3-epoxypropanol, 0.87 for benzyl chloride, and 1.43 for benzoyl chloride.

The equation predicts that, in a nucleophilic displacement on benzyl chloride, the azide anion reacts 3000 times faster than water.

==== Ritchie equation ====
The Ritchie equation, derived in 1972, is another free-energy relationship:
:formula_2

where &quot;N&quot;+ is the nucleophile dependent parameter and &quot;k&quot;0 the reaction rate constant for water. In this equation, a substrate-dependent parameter like &quot;s&quot; in the Swain–Scott equation is absent. The equation states that two nucleophiles react with the same relative reactivity regardless of the nature of the electrophile, which is in violation of the reactivity–selectivity principle. For this reason, this equation is also called the &quot;constant selectivity relationship&quot;.

In the original publication the data were obtained by reactions of selected nucleophiles with selected electrophilic carbocations such as tropylium or diazonium cations:

or (not displayed) ions based on malachite green. Many other reaction types have since been described.

Typical Ritchie N+ values (in methanol) are: 0.5 for methanol, 5.9 for the cyanide anion, 7.5 for the methoxide anion, 8.5 for the azide anion, and 10.7 for the thiophenol anion. The values for the relative cation reactivities are −0.4 for the malachite green cation, +2.6 for the benzenediazonium cation, and +4.5 for the tropylium cation.

==== Mayr–Patz equation ====
In the Mayr–Patz equation (1994):
:formula_3

The second order reaction rate constant &quot;k&quot; at 20 °C for a reaction is related to a nucleophilicity parameter &quot;N&quot;, an electrophilicity parameter &quot;E&quot;, and a nucleophile-dependent slope parameter &quot;s&quot;. The constant &quot;s&quot; is defined as 1 with 2-methyl-1-pentene as the nucleophile.

Many of the constants have been derived from reaction of so-called benzhydrylium ions as the electrophiles:

and a diverse collection of π-nucleophiles:

Typical E values are +6.2 for R = chlorine, +5.90 for R = hydrogen, 0 for R = methoxy and −7.02 for R = dimethylamine.

Typical N values with s in parentheses are −4.47 (1.32) for electrophilic aromatic substitution to toluene (1), −0.41 (1.12) for electrophilic addition to 1-phenyl-2-propene (2), and 0.96 (1) for addition to 2-methyl-1-pentene (3), −0.13 (1.21) for reaction with triphenylallylsilane (4), 3.61 (1.11) for reaction with 2-methylfuran (5), +7.48 (0.89) for reaction with isobutenyltributylstannane (6) and +13.36 (0.81) for reaction with the enamine 7.

The range of organic reactions also include SN2 reactions:

With E = −9.15 for the &quot;S-methyldibenzothiophenium ion&quot;, typical nucleophile values N (s) are 15.63 (0.64) for piperidine, 10.49 (0.68) for methoxide, and 5.20 (0.89) for water. In short, nucleophilicities towards sp2 or sp3 centers follow the same pattern.

==== Unified equation ====
In an effort to unify the above described equations the Mayr equation is rewritten as:
:&quot;formula_4&quot;

with sE the electrophile-dependent slope parameter and sN the nucleophile-dependent slope parameter. This equation can be rewritten in several ways:
* with sE = 1 for carbocations this equation is equal to the original Mayr–Patz equation of 1994,
* with sN = 0.6 for most n nucleophiles the equation becomes

:&quot;or the original Scott–Swain equation written as:&quot;
::formula_6
* with sE = 1 for carbocations and sN = 0.6 the equation becomes:

== Types ==
Examples of nucleophiles are anions such as Cl−, or a compound with a lone pair of electrons such as NH3 (ammonia) and PR3.

In the example below, the oxygen of the hydroxide ion donates an electron pair to form a new chemical bond with the carbon at the end of the bromopropane molecule. The bond between the carbon and the bromine then undergoes heterolytic fission, with the bromine atom taking the donated electron and becoming the bromide ion (Br−), because a SN2 reaction occurs by backside attack. This means that the hydroxide ion attacks the carbon atom from the other side, exactly opposite the bromine ion. Because of this backside attack, SN2 reactions result in a inversion of the configuration of the electrophile. If the electrophile is chiral, it typically maintains its chirality, though the SN2 product&#x27;s absolute configuration is flipped as compared to that of the original electrophile.

===Ambident Nucleophile===
An ambident nucleophile is one that can attack from two or more places, resulting in two or more products. For example, the thiocyanate ion (SCN−) may attack from either the sulfur or the nitrogen. For this reason, the SN2 reaction of an alkyl halide with SCN− often leads to a mixture of an alkyl thiocyanate (R-SCN) and an alkyl isothiocyanate (R-NCS). Similar considerations apply in the Kolbe nitrile synthesis.

=== Halogens ===
While the halogens are not nucleophilic in their diatomic form (e.g. I2 is not a nucleophile), their anions are good nucleophiles. In polar, protic solvents, F− is the weakest nucleophile, and I− the strongest; this order is reversed in polar, aprotic solvents.

=== Carbon ===

Carbon nucleophiles are often organometallic reagents such as those found in the Grignard reaction, Blaise reaction, Reformatsky reaction, and Barbier reaction or reactions involving organolithium reagents and acetylides. These reagents are often used to perform nucleophilic additions.

Enols are also carbon nucleophiles. The formation of an enol is catalyzed by acid or base. Enols are nucleophiles, but, in general, nucleophilic at the alpha carbon atom. Enols are commonly used in condensation reactions, including the Claisen condensation and the aldol condensation reactions.

=== Oxygen ===
Examples of oxygen nucleophiles are water (H2O), hydroxide anion, alcohols, alkoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and carboxylate anions.
Nucleophilic attack does not take place during intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

=== Sulfur ===
Of sulfur nucleophiles, hydrogen sulfide and its salts, thiols (RSH), thiolate anions (RS−), anions of thiolcarboxylic acids (RC(O)-S−), and anions of dithiocarbonates (RO-C(S)-S−) and dithiocarbamates (R2N-C(S)-S−) are used most often.

In general, &quot;sulfur is very nucleophilic because of its large size&quot;, which makes it readily polarizable, and its lone pairs of electrons are readily accessible.

=== Nitrogen ===
Nitrogen nucleophiles include ammonia, azide, amines, nitrites, hydroxylamine, hydrazine, carbazide, phenylhydrazine, semicarbazide, and amide.

=== Metal centers ===
Although metal centers (e.g., Li+, Zn2+, Sc3+, etc.) are most commonly cationic and electrophilic (Lewis acidic) in nature, certain metal centers (particularly ones in a low oxidation state and/or carrying a negative charge) are among the strongest recorded nucleophiles and are sometimes referred to as &quot;supernucleophiles.&quot; For instance, using methyl iodide as the reference electrophile, Ph3Sn– is about 10000 times more nucleophilic than I–, while the Co(I) form of vitamin B12 (vitamin B12s) is about 107 times more nucleophilic. Other supernucleophilic metal centers include low oxidation state carbonyl metalate anions (e.g., CpFe(CO)2–).

<text>Lumbar disc disease is the drying out of the spongy interior matrix of an intervertebral disc in the spine. Many physicians and patients use the term lumbar disc disease to encompass several different causes of back pain or sciatica. In this article, the term is used to describe a lumbar herniated disc. It is thought that lumbar disc disease causes about one-third of all back pain.

==Symptoms==
Pain, loss of muscle strength and loss of touch sensation may occur if this herniation causes the compression of the most proximal part of the nerve closely neighbouring the intervertebral disc material. Pain is in the distribution of the nerve compressed, usually down the back of the leg, side of the calf and inside of the foot (sciatica). Most commonly, the nerve root between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae or between the fifth lumbar vertebra and first sacral segment are impinged.

In symptomatic cases the diagnosis should be confirmed by an MRI scan. However, in cases with slight symptoms, a faster and cheaper CT scan (although it is inferior to MRI scan) may be recommended. While a CT scan can show the bony structures in more detail, an MRI scan can better portray soft tissue.

==Genetics==
An inheritable gene variation may cause increased susceptibility. People with a variation in a gene that encodes the cartilage intermediate-layer protein (CILP) were 1.6 times more likely to have the disease than persons without the variation. CILP is a normal component of disc tissue. The gene variant was hypothesized to disrupt normal building and maintenance of cartilage. However, this association was not replicated in a follow-up study of Finnish and Chinese individuals.
==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis can be made on clinical basis with MRI findings

==Treatment==
Initial treatment in lumbar disc disease is one or two days of bedrest (although growing number of studies shows that it makes little difference) and pain relieving medications. In cases with ongoing pain despite conservative treatments, a surgical operation that will remove the compressing disc material, a microdiscectomy or discectomy may be recommended to treat a lumbar disc herniation.

<text>A head injury is any injury that results in trauma to the skull or brain. The terms &quot;traumatic brain injury&quot; and &quot;head injury&quot; are often used interchangeably in the medical literature. Because head injuries cover such a broad scope of injuries, there are many causes—including accidents, falls, physical assault, or traffic accidents—that can cause head injuries.

The number of new cases is 1.7 million in the United States each year, with about 3% of these incidents leading to death. Adults have head injuries more frequently than any age group resulting from falls, motor vehicle crashes, colliding or being struck by an object, or assaults. Children, however, may experience head injuries from accidental falls or intentional causes (such as being struck or shaken) leading to hospitalization. Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a term used to differentiate brain injuries occurring after birth from injury, from a genetic disorder, or from a congenital disorder.

Unlike a broken bone where trauma to the body is obvious, head trauma can sometimes be conspicuous or inconspicuous. In the case of an open head injury, the skull is cracked and broken by an object that makes contact with the brain. This leads to bleeding. Other obvious symptoms can be neurological in nature. The person may become sleepy, behave abnormally, lose consciousness, vomit, develop a severe headache, have mismatched pupil sizes, and/or be unable to move certain parts of the body. While these symptoms happen immediately after a head injury occurs, many problems can develop later in life. Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, for example, is much more likely to develop in a person who has experienced a head injury.

Brain damage, which is the destruction or degeneration of brain cells, is a common occurrence in those who experience a head injury. Neurotoxicity is another cause of brain damage that typically refers to selective, chemically induced neuron/brain damage.

==Classification==
Head injuries include both injuries to the brain and those to other parts of the head, such as the scalp and skull. Head injuries can be closed or open. A closed (non-missile) head injury is where the dura mater remains intact. The skull can be fractured, but not necessarily. A penetrating head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater. Brain injuries may be diffuse, occurring over a wide area, or focal, located in a small, specific area. A head injury may cause skull fracture, which may or may not be associated with injury to the brain. Some patients may have linear or depressed skull fractures. If intracranial hemorrhage occurs, a hematoma within the skull can put pressure on the brain. Types of intracranial hemorrhage include subdural, subarachnoid, extradural, and intraparenchymal hematoma. Craniotomy surgeries are used in these cases to lessen the pressure by draining off the blood.

Brain injury can occur at the site of impact, but can also be at the opposite side of the skull due to a &quot;contrecoup&quot; effect (the impact to the head can cause the brain to move within the skull, causing the brain to impact the interior of the skull opposite the head-impact). While impact on the brain at the same site of injury to the skull is the coup effect. If the impact causes the head to move, the injury may be worsened, because the brain may ricochet inside the skull causing additional impacts, or the brain may stay relatively still (due to inertia) but be hit by the moving skull (both are contrecoup injuries).

Specific problems after head injury can include
===Concussion===


A concussion is a form of a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). This injury is a result due to a blow to the head that could make the person&#x27;s physical, cognitive, and emotional behaviors irregular. Symptoms may include clumsiness, fatigue, confusion, nausea, blurry vision, headaches, and others. Mild concussions are associated with sequelae. Severity is measured using various concussion grading systems.

A slightly greater injury is associated with both anterograde and retrograde amnesia (inability to remember events before or after the injury). The amount of time that the amnesia is present correlates with the severity of the injury. In all cases, the patients develop post concussion syndrome, which includes memory problems, dizziness, tiredness, sickness and depression. Cerebral concussion is the most common head injury seen in children.

===Intracranial bleeding===

Types of intracranial hemorrhage are roughly grouped into intra-axial and extra-axial. The hemorrhage is considered a focal brain injury; that is, it occurs in a localized spot rather than causing diffuse damage over a wider area.

====Intra-axial bleeding====

Intra-axial hemorrhage is bleeding within the brain itself, or cerebral hemorrhage. This category includes intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or bleeding within the brain tissue, and intraventricular hemorrhage, bleeding within the brain&#x27;s ventricles (particularly of premature infants). Intra-axial hemorrhages are more dangerous and harder to treat than extra-axial bleeds.

====Extra-axial bleeding====
Extra-axial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs within the skull but outside of the brain tissue, falls into three subtypes:
* Epidural hemorrhage (extradural hemorrhage) which occur between the dura mater (the outermost meninx) and the skull, is caused by trauma. It may result from laceration of an artery, most commonly the middle meningeal artery. This is a very dangerous type of injury because the bleed is from a high-pressure system and deadly increases in intracranial pressure can result rapidly. However, it is the least common type of meningeal bleeding and is seen in 1% to 3% cases of head injury.
** Patients have a loss of consciousness (LOC), then a lucid interval, then sudden deterioration (vomiting, restlessness, LOC)
** Head CT shows lenticular (convex) deformity.
* Subdural hemorrhage results from tearing of the bridging veins in the subdural space between the dura and arachnoid mater.
** Head CT shows crescent-shaped deformity
* Subarachnoid hemorrhage, which occur between the arachnoid and pia meningeal layers, like intraparenchymal hemorrhage, can result either from trauma or from ruptures of aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. Blood is seen layering into the brain along sulci and fissures, or filling cisterns (most often the suprasellar cistern because of the presence of the vessels of the circle of Willis and their branch points within that space). The classic presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage is the sudden onset of a severe headache (a thunderclap headache). This can be a very dangerous entity and requires emergent neurosurgical evaluation and sometimes urgent intervention.

==== Cerebral contusion ====

Cerebral contusion is bruising of the brain tissue. The piamater is not breached in contusion in contrary to lacerations. The majority of contusions occur in the frontal and temporal lobes. Complications may include cerebral edema and transtentorial herniation. The goal of treatment should be to treat the increased intracranial pressure. The prognosis is guarded.

==== Diffuse axonal injury ====

Diffuse axonal injury, or DAI, usually occurs as the result of an acceleration or deceleration motion, not necessarily an impact. Axons are stretched and damaged when parts of the brain of differing density slide over one another. Prognoses vary widely depending on the extent of the damage.

==== Compound head injury ====
Overlying scalp laceration and soft tissue disruption in continuity with a skull fracture constitutes &quot;compound head injury&quot;, and has higher rates of infection, unfavorable neurologic outcome, delayed seizures, mortality, and duration of hospital stay.

==Signs and symptoms==
Three categories used for classifying the severity of brain injuries are mild, moderate or severe.

=== Mild brain injuries ===
Symptoms of a mild brain injury include headaches, confusion, ringing ears, fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, mood or behavior. Other symptoms include trouble with memory, concentration, attention or thinking. Mental fatigue is a common debilitating experience and may not be linked by the patient to the original (minor) incident. Narcolepsy and sleep disorders are common misdiagnoses.

=== Moderate/severe brain injuries ===
Cognitive symptoms include confusion, aggression, abnormal behavior, slurred speech, and coma or other disorders of consciousness. Physical symptoms include headaches that do not go away or worsen, vomiting or nausea, convulsions or seizures, abnormal dilation of the eyes, inability to awaken from sleep, weakness in the extremities, and a loss of coordination. In cases of severe brain injuries, the likelihood of areas with permanent disability is great, including neurocognitive deficits, delusions (often, to be specific, monothematic delusions), speech or movement problems, and intellectual disability. There may also be personality changes. The most severe cases result in coma or even persistent vegetative state.

=== Symptoms in children ===
Symptoms observed in children include changes in eating habits, persistent irritability or sadness, changes in attention, disrupted sleeping habits, or loss of interest in toys.

Presentation varies according to the injury. Some patients with head trauma stabilize and other patients deteriorate. A patient may present with or without neurological deficit. Patients with concussion may have a history of seconds to minutes unconsciousness, then normal arousal. Disturbance of vision and equilibrium may also occur. Common symptoms of head injury include coma, confusion, drowsiness, personality change, seizures, nausea and vomiting, headache and a lucid interval, during which a patient appears conscious only to deteriorate later.

Symptoms of skull fracture can include:
* leaking cerebrospinal fluid (a clear fluid drainage from nose, mouth or ear) is strongly indicative of basilar skull fracture and the tearing of sheaths surrounding the brain, which can lead to secondary brain infection.
* visible deformity or depression in the head or face; for example a sunken eye can indicate a maxillar fracture
* an eye that cannot move or is deviated to one side can indicate that a broken facial bone is pinching a nerve that innervates eye muscles
* wounds or bruises on the scalp or face.
* Basilar skull fractures, those that occur at the base of the skull, are associated with Battle&#x27;s sign, a subcutaneous bleed over the mastoid, hemotympanum, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and otorrhea.

Because brain injuries can be life-threatening, even people with apparently slight injuries, with no noticeable signs or complaints, require close observation; They have a chance for severe symptoms later on. The caretakers of those patients with mild trauma who are released from the hospital are frequently advised to rouse the patient several times during the next 12 to 24 hours to assess for worsening symptoms.

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a tool for measuring the degree of unconsciousness and is thus a useful tool for determining the severity of the injury. The Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale is used in young children. The widely used PECARN Pediatric Head Injury/Trauma Algorithm helps physicians weigh risk-benefit of imaging in a clinical setting given multiple factors about the patient—including mechanism/location of the injury, age of the patient, and GCS score.

=== Location of brain damage predicts symptoms ===
Symptoms of brain injuries can also be influenced by the location of the injury and as a result, impairments are specific to the part of the brain affected. Lesion size is correlated with severity, recovery, and comprehension. Brain injuries often create impairment or disability that can vary greatly in severity.

Studies show there is a correlation between brain lesion and language, speech, and category-specific disorders. Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia is associated with anomia, unknowingly making up words (neologisms), and problems with comprehension. The symptoms of Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia are caused by damage to the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus.

Damage to the Broca&#x27;s area typically produces symptoms like omitting functional words (agrammatism), sound production changes, dyslexia, dysgraphia, and problems with comprehension and production. Broca&#x27;s aphasia is indicative of damage to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the brain.

An impairment following damage to a region of the brain does not necessarily imply that the damaged area is wholly responsible for the cognitive process which is impaired, however. For example, in pure alexia, the ability to read is destroyed by a lesion damaging both the left visual field and the connection between the right visual field and the language areas (Broca&#x27;s area and Wernicke&#x27;s area). However, this does not mean someone with pure alexia is incapable of comprehending speech—merely that there is no connection between their working visual cortex and language areas—as is demonstrated by the fact that pure alexics can still write, speak, and even transcribe letters without understanding their meaning. Lesions to the fusiform gyrus often result in prosopagnosia, the inability to distinguish faces and other complex objects from each other. Lesions in the amygdala would eliminate the enhanced activation seen in occipital and fusiform visual areas in response to fear with the area intact. Amygdala lesions change the functional pattern of activation to emotional stimuli in regions that are distant from the amygdala.

Other lesions to the visual cortex have different effects depending on the location of the damage. Lesions to V1, for example, can cause blindsight in different areas of the brain depending on the size of the lesion and location relative to the calcarine fissure. Lesions to V4 can cause color-blindness, and bilateral lesions to MT/V5 can cause the loss of the ability to perceive motion. Lesions to the parietal lobes may result in agnosia, an inability to recognize complex objects, smells, or shapes, or amorphosynthesis, a loss of perception on the opposite side of the body.

==Causes==
Head injuries can be caused by a large variety of reasons. All of these causes can be put into two categories used to classify head injuries; those that occur from impact (blows) and those that occur from shaking. Common causes of head injury due to impact are motor vehicle traffic collisions, home and occupational accidents, falls, assault, and sports related accidents. Head injuries from shaking are most common amongst infants and children.

According to the United States CDC, 32% of traumatic brain injuries (another, more specific, term for head injuries) are caused by falls, 10% by assaults, 16.5% by being struck by or against something, 17% by motor vehicle accidents, and 21% by other/unknown ways. In addition, the highest rate of injury is among children ages 0–14 and adults age 65 and older. Brain injuries that include brain damage can also be brought on by exposure to toxic chemicals, lack of oxygen, tumors, infections, and stroke. Possible causes of widespread brain damage include birth hypoxia, prolonged hypoxia (shortage of oxygen), poisoning by teratogens (including alcohol), infection, and neurological illness. Brain tumors can increase intracranial pressure, causing brain damage.

== Diagnosis ==

There are a few methods used to diagnose a head injury. A healthcare professional will ask the patient questions revolving around the injury as well as questions to help determine in what ways the injury is affecting function. In addition to this hearing, vision, balance, and reflexes may also be assessed as an indicator of the severity of the injury. A non-contrast CT of the head should be performed immediately in all those who have sustained a moderate or severe head injury. A CT is an imaging technique that allows physicians to see inside the head without surgery in order to determine if there is internal bleeding or swelling in the brain. Computed tomography (CT) has become the diagnostic modality of choice for head trauma due to its accuracy, reliability, safety, and wide availability. The changes in microcirculation, impaired auto-regulation, cerebral edema, and axonal injury start as soon as a head injury occurs and manifest as clinical, biochemical, and radiological changes. An MRI may also be conducted to determine if someone has abnormal growths or tumors in the brain or to determine if the patient has had a stroke.

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the most widely used scoring system used to assess the level of severity of a brain injury. This method is based on objective observations of specific traits to determine the severity of a brain injury. It is based on three traits: eye-opening, verbal response, and motor response, which are gauged as described below. 

Based on the Glasgow Coma Scale severity is classified as follows:
* severe brain injuries score 3–8,
* moderate brain injuries score 9-12, and
* mild brain injuries score 13–15.

There are several imaging techniques that can aid in diagnosing and assessing the extent of brain damage, including:
* computed tomography (CT) scan
* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
* diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
* positron emission tomography (PET)
* single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) 
CT scans and MRI are the two techniques widely used and are the most effective. CT scans can show brain bleeds, fractures of the skull, fluid build up in the brain that will lead to increased cranial pressure. MRI is able to better detect smaller injuries, detect damage within the brain, diffuse axonal injury, injuries to the brainstem, posterior fossa, and subtemporal and sub frontal regions. However, patients with pacemakers, metallic implants, or other metal within their bodies are unable to have an MRI done. Typically the other imaging techniques are not used in a clinical setting because of the cost, lack of availability.

==Management==
Most head injuries are of a benign nature and require no treatment beyond analgesics such as acetaminophen. Non-steroidal painkillers such as ibuprofen are avoided since they could make any potential bleeding worse. Due to the high risk of even minor brain injuries, close monitoring for potential complications such as intracranial bleeding. If the brain has been severely damaged by trauma, a neurosurgical evaluation may be useful. Treatments may involve controlling elevated intracranial pressure. This can include sedation, paralytics, cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Second-line alternatives include decompressive craniectomy (Jagannathan et al. found a net 65% favorable outcomes rate in pediatric patients), barbiturate coma, hypertonic saline, and hypothermia. Although all of these methods have potential benefits, there has been no randomized study that has shown unequivocal benefit.

Clinicians will often consult clinical decision support rules such as the Canadian CT Head Rule or the New Orleans/Charity Head injury/Trauma Rule to decide if the patient needs further imaging studies or observation only. Rules like these are usually studied in depth by multiple research groups with large patient cohorts to ensure accuracy given the risk of adverse events in this area.

There is a subspecialty certification available for brain injury medicine that signifies expertise in the treatment of brain injury.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis, or the likely progress of a disorder, depends on the nature, location, and cause of the brain damage (see Traumatic brain injury, Focal and diffuse brain injury, Primary and secondary brain injury).

In children with uncomplicated minor head injuries the risk of intracranial bleeding over the next year is rare at 2 cases per 1 million. In some cases transient neurological disturbances may occur, lasting minutes to hours. Malignant post traumatic cerebral swelling can develop unexpectedly in stable patients after an injury, as can post-traumatic seizures. Recovery in children with neurologic deficits will vary. Children with neurologic deficits who improve daily are more likely to recover, while those who are vegetative for months are less likely to improve. Most patients without deficits have full recovery. However, persons who sustain head trauma resulting in unconsciousness for an hour or more have twice the risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease later in life.

Head injury may be associated with a neck injury. Bruises on the back or neck, neck pain, or pain radiating to the arms are signs of cervical spine injury and merit spinal immobilization via application of a cervical collar and possibly a longboard. If the neurological exam is normal this is reassuring. Reassessment is needed if there is a worsening headache, seizure, one-sided weakness, or has persistent vomiting.

To combat overuse of head CT scans yielding negative intracranial hemorrhage results, which unnecessarily exposes patients to radiation and increase time in the hospital and cost of the visit, multiple clinical decision support rules have been developed to help clinicians weigh the option to scan a patient with a head injury. Among these are the Canadian Head CT rule, the PECARN Head Injury/Trauma Algorithm, and the New Orleans/Charity Head Injury/Trauma Rule all help clinicians make these decisions using easily obtained information and noninvasive practices.

Brain injuries are very hard to predict in the outcome. Many tests and specialists are needed to determine the likelihood of the prognosis. People with minor brain damage can have debilitating side effects; not just severe brain damage has debilitating effects. The side-effects of a brain injury depend on location and the body&#x27;s response to injury. Even a mild concussion can have long term effects that may not resolve.

== History ==
The foundation for understanding human behavior and brain injury can be attributed to the case of Phineas Gage and the famous case studies by Paul Broca. The first case study on Phineas Gage&#x27;s head injury is one of the most astonishing brain injuries in history. In 1848, Phineas Gage was paving way for a new railroad line when he encountered an accidental explosion of a tamping iron straight through his frontal lobe. Gage observed to be intellectually unaffected but exemplified post-injury behavioral deficits. These deficits include: becoming sporadic, disrespectful, extremely profane, and gave no regard for other workers. Gage started having seizures in February 1860, dying only four months later on May 21, 1860.

Ten years later, Paul Broca examined two patients exhibiting impaired speech due to frontal lobe injuries. Broca&#x27;s first patient lacked productive speech. He saw this as an opportunity to address language localization. It wasn&#x27;t until Leborgne, formally known as &quot;tan&quot;, died when Broca confirmed the frontal lobe lesion from an autopsy. The second patient had similar speech impairments, supporting his findings on language localization. The results of both cases became a vital verification of the relationship between speech and the left cerebral hemisphere. The affected areas are known today as Broca&#x27;s area and Broca&#x27;s Aphasia.

A few years later, a German neuroscientist, Carl Wernicke, consulted on a stroke patient. The patient experienced neither speech nor hearing impairments but had a few brain deficits. These deficits included: lacking the ability to comprehend what was spoken to him and the words written down. After his death, Wernicke examined his autopsy that found a lesion located in the left temporal region. This area became known as Wernicke&#x27;s area. Wernicke later hypothesized the relationship between Wernicke&#x27;s area and Broca&#x27;s area, which was proven fact.

== Epidemiology ==
Head injury is the leading cause of death in many countries.

<text>A tremor is an involuntary, somewhat rhythmic muscle contraction and relaxation involving oscillations or twitching movements of one or more body parts. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, vocal folds, trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, a tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder.

==Types==
Tremor is most commonly classified by clinical features and cause or origin. Some of the better-known forms of tremor, with their symptoms, include the following:
* Cerebellar tremor (also known as intention tremor) is a slow, broad tremor of the extremities that occurs at the end of a purposeful movement, such as trying to press a button or touching a finger to the tip of one&#x27;s nose. In classic cerebellar tremor, a lesion on one side of the brain produces a tremor in that same side of the body that worsens with directed movement. Cerebellar damage can also produce a &quot;wing-beating&quot; type of tremor called rubral or Holmes&#x27; tremor — a combination of rest, action, and postural tremors. The tremor is often most prominent when the affected person is active or is maintaining a particular posture. Cerebellar tremor may be accompanied by other manifestations of ataxia, including dysarthria (speech problems), nystagmus (rapid, involuntary rolling of the eyes), gait problems and postural tremor of the trunk and neck. Titubation is tremor of the head, hands, and torso and is of cerebellar origin.
* Dystonic tremor occurs in individuals of all ages who are affected by dystonia, a movement disorder in which sustained involuntary muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive motions or painful and abnormal postures or positions. Dystonic tremor may affect any muscle in the body and is seen most often when the patient is in a certain position or moves a certain way. The pattern of dystonic tremor may differ from essential tremor. Dystonic tremors occur irregularly and can often be relieved by complete rest. Touching the affected body part or muscle may reduce tremor severity (a &quot;geste antagoniste&quot;). The tremor may be the initial sign of dystonia localized to a particular part of the body. The dystonic tremor has usually a frequency of about 7 Hz.
* Essential tremor (sometimes inaccurately called benign essential tremor) is the most common of the more than 20 types of tremor. Although the tremor may be mild and nonprogressive in some people, in others, the tremor is slowly progressive, starting on one side of the body but affecting both sides within 3 years. The hands are most often affected but the head, voice, tongue, legs, and trunk may also be involved. Head tremor may be seen as a vertical or horizontal motion. Essential tremor may be accompanied by mild gait disturbance. Tremor frequency may decrease as the person ages, but the severity may increase, affecting the person&#x27;s ability to perform certain tasks or activities of daily living. Heightened emotion, stress, fever, physical exhaustion, or low blood sugar may trigger tremors or increase their severity. Onset is most common after age 40, although symptoms can appear at any age. It may occur in more than one family member. Children of a parent who has essential tremor have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the condition. Essential tremor is not associated with any known pathology. Its frequency is between 4 and 8 Hz.
* Orthostatic tremor is characterized by fast (&gt;12 Hz) rhythmic muscle contractions that occur in the legs and trunk immediately after standing up. Cramps are felt in the thighs and legs and the patient may shake uncontrollably when asked to stand in one spot. No other clinical signs or symptoms are present and the shaking ceases when the patient sits or is lifted off the ground. The high frequency of the tremor often makes the tremor look like rippling of leg muscles while standing. Orthostatic tremor may also occur in patients who have essential tremor, and there might be an overlap between these categories of tremor.
* Parkinsonian tremor is caused by damage to structures within the brain that control movement. This resting tremor, which can occur as an isolated symptom or be seen in other disorders, is often a precursor to Parkinson&#x27;s disease (more than 25 percent of patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease have an associated action tremor). A classic symptom is a characteristic fine tremor in the hands, which is traditionally described as a &quot;pill-rolling&quot; action of the hands, but Parkinsonian tremor may also affect the arms, chin, lips, legs, and trunk, and can be markedly increased by stress or emotion. Onset is generally after age 60. Movement starts in one limb or on one side of the body and usually progresses to include the other side. The tremor&#x27;s frequency is between 4 and 6 Hz.
* Physiological tremor occurs in every normal individual and has no clinical significance. It is rarely visible and may be heightened by strong emotion (such as anxiety or fear), physical exhaustion, hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, heavy metal poisoning, stimulants, alcohol withdrawal or fever. It can be seen in all voluntary muscle groups and can be detected by extending the arms and placing a piece of paper on top of the hands. Enhanced physiological tremor is a strengthening of physiological tremor to more visible levels. It is generally not caused by a neurological disease but by reaction to certain drugs, alcohol withdrawal, or medical conditions including an overactive thyroid and hypoglycemia. It is usually reversible once the cause is corrected. This tremor classically has a frequency of about 10 Hz.
* tremor (also called hysterical tremor and functional tremor) can occur at rest or during postural or kinetic movement. The characteristics of this kind of tremor may vary but generally include sudden onset and remission, increased incidence with stress, change in tremor direction or body part affected, and greatly decreased or disappearing tremor activity when the patient is distracted. Many patients with psychogenic tremor have a conversion disorder (see Post traumatic stress disorder) or another psychiatric disease.
* Rubral tremor is characterized by coarse slow tremor which is present at rest, at posture and with intention. This tremor is associated with conditions which affect the red nucleus in the midbrain, classically unusual strokes.
* Neuropathic tremor may occur in patients with peripheral neuropathies, when the nerves that supply the body&#x27;s muscles are traumatized by injury, disease, abnormality in the central nervous system, or as the result of systemic illnesses. It is most commonly observed in patients with an immunoglobulin M paraproteinaemic neuropathy (IgMNP), but also in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The tremor is predominantly exhibited as an action or postural tremor with a frequency of 3 to 10 Hz. Peripheral neuropathy can affect the whole body or certain areas, such as the hands, and may be progressive. Resulting sensory loss may be seen as a tremor or ataxia (inability to coordinate voluntary muscle movement) of the affected limbs and problems with gait and balance. Clinical characteristics may be similar to those seen in patients with essential tremor.
* Neurogenic tremor is a self-induced tremor that is activated in humans. The mechanism is activated passive supine position, bringing the knees up and splitting them apart. The tremor is akin to the natural shaking mechanism in mammals to discharge stress and trauma. The type of tremor is also known as &quot;self-induced therapeutic tremor&quot;. It is considered a kind of &quot;spontaneous movement&quot;.

Tremor can result from other conditions as well
* Alcoholism, excessive alcohol consumption, or alcohol withdrawal can kill certain nerve cells, resulting in a tremor known as asterixis. Conversely, small amounts of alcohol may help to decrease familial and essential tremor, but the mechanism behind it is unknown. Alcohol potentiates GABAergic transmission and might act at the level of the inferior olive.
* Tobacco withdrawal symptoms include tremor.
* Most of the symptoms can also occur randomly when panicked.

==Causes==
Tremor can be a symptom associated with disorders in those parts of the brain that control muscles throughout the body or in particular areas, such as the hands. Neurological disorders or conditions that can produce tremor include multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, chronic kidney disease and a number of neurodegenerative diseases that damage or destroy parts of the brainstem or the cerebellum, Parkinson&#x27;s disease being the one most often associated with tremor. Lesions of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (also called myoclonic triangle or dentato-rubro-olivary pathway) impair the predictions performed by the cerebellum, causing repetitive muscle discharges by triggering oscillatory activity in the central nervous system. Other causes include the use of drugs (such as amphetamines, cocaine, caffeine, corticosteroids, SSRIs) or alcohol, mercury poisoning, or the withdrawal of drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepine. Tremors can also be seen in infants with phenylketonuria (PKU), overactive thyroid or liver failure. Tremors can be an indication of hypoglycemia, along with palpitations, sweating and anxiety.
Tremor can also be caused by lack of sleep, lack of vitamins, or increased stress. Deficiencies of magnesium and thiamine have also been known to cause tremor or shaking, which resolves when the deficiency is corrected. Tremors in animals can also be caused by some spider bites, e.g. the redback spider of Australia.

==Diagnosis==
During a physical exam, a doctor can determine whether the tremor occurs primarily during action or at rest. The doctor will also check for tremor symmetry, any sensory loss, weakness or muscle atrophy, or decreased reflexes. A detailed family history may indicate if the tremor is inherited. Blood or urine tests can detect thyroid malfunction, other metabolic causes, and abnormal levels of certain chemicals that can cause tremor. These tests may also help to identify contributing causes, such as drug interaction, chronic alcoholism, or another condition or disease. Diagnostic imaging using CT or MRI imaging may help determine if the tremor is the result of a structural defect or degeneration of the brain.

The doctor will perform a neurological examination to assess nerve function and motor and sensory skills. The tests are designed to determine any functional limitations, such as difficulty with handwriting or the ability to hold a utensil or cup. The patient may be asked to place a finger on the tip of her or his nose, draw a spiral, or perform other tasks or exercises.

The doctor may order an electromyogram to diagnose muscle or nerve problems. This test measures involuntary muscle activity and muscle response to nerve stimulation. The selection of the sensors used is important. In addition to studies of muscle activity, tremor can be assessed with accuracy using accelerometers .

===Categories===
Tremors are assessed according to amplitude, frequency, affected body parts, and the position or activity in which the tremor manifests. The combination of these four factors indicates likely diagnoses. For example, early Parkinson&#x27;s first tends to manifest as a slow tremor in one hand while resting and disappears during intentional movements, but essential tremor appears symmetrically, during intentional movements and disappears while resting.

* Amplitude: A fine tremor is very small or barely noticeable movement; a coarse tremor is a large movement. Tremors in between these two may be described as medium amplitude.
* Frequency: A slow tremor makes a motion at a few times per second. A rapid or fast tremor is around 12 Hz or faster. Tremors in between these two speeds may be described as intermediate speed.
* Affected body parts: For example, the left hand, or both legs, or the voice.

The degree of tremor should be assessed in four positions. The tremor can then be classified by which position most accentuates the tremor:

==Treatment==
There is no cure for most tremors. The appropriate treatment depends on accurate diagnosis of the cause. Some tremors respond to treatment of the underlying condition. For example, in some cases of psychogenic tremor, treating the patient&#x27;s underlying psychological problem may cause the tremor to disappear. A few medications can help relieve symptoms temporarily.

===Medications===
Medications remain the basis of therapy in many cases. Symptomatic drug therapy is available for several forms of tremor:
* Parkinsonian tremor drug treatment involves L-DOPA or dopamine-like drugs such as pergolide, bromocriptine and ropinirole; They can be dangerous, however, as they may cause symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, clonus, and in rare instances tardive (late developing) psychosis. Other drugs used to lessen parkinsonian tremor include amantadine and anticholinergic drugs like benztropine
* Essential tremor may be treated with beta blockers (such as propranolol and nadolol) or primidone, an anticonvulsant
* Cerebellar tremor symptoms may decrease with the application of alcohol (ethanol) or benzodiazepine medications, both of which carry some risk of dependence or addiction
* Rubral tremor patients may receive some relief using L-DOPA or anticholinergic drugs. Surgery may be helpful
* Dystonic tremor may respond to diazepam, anticholinergic drugs, and intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin is also prescribed to treat voice and head tremors and several movement disorders
* Primary orthostatic tremor sometimes is treated with a combination of diazepam and primidone. Gabapentin provides relief in some cases
* Enhanced physiological tremor is usually reversible once the cause is corrected. If symptomatic treatment is needed, beta blockers can be used

===Lifestyle===
Eliminating tremor &quot;triggers,&quot; including stimulants such as caffeine, from the diet is often recommended.
Essential tremor may benefit from slight doses of ethanol, but the potential negative consequences of regular ethanol intake need to be taken into account. Due to the risks, alternatives such as &quot;GABAergic drugs like sodium oxybate and NASs, LVA Ca2+ channel blockers like zonisamide, glutamate receptor antagonists like perampanel, and long-chain alcohols like 1-octanol&quot; are preferred. Beta blockers have been used as an alternative to alcohol in sports such as competitive dart playing and carry less potential for addiction.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy may help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some patients. A physical therapist or occupational therapist will evaluate the patient for tremor positioning, muscle control, muscle strength, and functional skills. Teaching the patient to brace the affected limb during the tremor or to hold an affected arm close to the body is sometimes useful in gaining motion control. Coordination and balancing exercises may help some patients. Some occupational therapists recommend the use of weights, splints, other adaptive equipment, and special plates and utensils for eating.

===Surgery===
Surgical intervention such as thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation may ease certain tremors. These surgeries are usually performed only when the tremor is severe and does not respond to drugs, and further evidence is required to determine the best course of treatment for any individual patient. Response to surgeries can be excellent, reducing some symptoms such as &quot;tremors, stiffness, slowness, and dyskinesias&quot; for patients with Parkinson&#x27;s Disease. 

Thalamotomy, involving the creation of lesions in the brain region called the thalamus, is quite effective in treating patients with essential, cerebellar, or Parkinsonian tremor. This in-hospital procedure is performed under local anesthesia, with the patient awake. After the patient&#x27;s head is secured in a metal frame, the surgeon maps the patient&#x27;s brain to locate the thalamus. A small hole is drilled through the skull and a temperature-controlled electrode is inserted into the thalamus. A low-frequency current is passed through the electrode to activate the tremor and to confirm proper placement. Once the site has been confirmed, the electrode is heated to create a temporary lesion. Testing is done to examine speech, language, coordination, and tremor activation, if any. If no problems occur, the probe is again heated to create a 3-mm permanent lesion. The probe, when cooled to body temperature, is withdrawn and the skull hole is covered. The lesion causes the tremor to permanently disappear without disrupting sensory or motor control.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) uses implantable electrodes to send high-frequency electrical signals to the thalamus. The electrodes are implanted as described above. The patient uses a hand-held magnet to turn on and turn off a pulse generator that is surgically implanted under the skin. The electrical stimulation temporarily disables the tremor and can be &quot;reversed&quot;, if necessary, by turning off the implanted electrode. Batteries in the generator last about 5 years and can be replaced surgically. DBS is currently used to treat parkinsonian tremor and essential tremor. It is also applied successfully for other rare causes of tremor.

The most common side effects of tremor surgery include dysarthria (problems with motor control of speech), temporary or permanent cognitive impairment (including visual and learning difficulties), and problems with balance.

===Biomechanical loading===
As well as medication, rehabilitation programmes and surgical interventions, the application of biomechanical loading on tremor movement has been shown to be a technique that is able to suppress the effects of tremor on the human body. It has been established in the literature that most of the different types of tremor respond to biomechanical loading. In particular, it has been clinically tested that the increase of damping or inertia in the upper limb leads to a reduction of the tremorous motion. Biomechanical loading relies on an external device that either passively or actively acts mechanically in parallel to the upper limb to counteract tremor movement. This phenomenon gives rise to the possibility of an orthotic management of tremor.

Starting from this principle, the development of upper-limb non-invasive ambulatory robotic exoskeletons is presented as a promising solution for patients who cannot benefit from medication to suppress the tremor. In this area robotic exoskeletons have emerged, in the form of orthoses, to provide motor assistance and functional compensation to disabled people. An orthosis is a wearable device that acts in parallel to the affected limb. In the case of tremor management, the orthosis must apply a damping or inertial load to a selected set of limb articulations.

Recently, some studies demonstrated that exoskeletons could achieve a consistent 40% of tremor power reduction for all users, being able to attain a reduction ratio in the order of 80% tremor power in specific joints of users with severe tremor. In addition, the users reported that the exoskeleton did not affect their voluntary motion. These results indicate the feasibility of tremor suppression through biomechanical loading.

The main drawbacks of this mechanical management of tremor are (1) the resulting bulky solutions, (2) the inefficiency in transmitting loads from the exoskeleton to the human musculo-skeletal system and (3) technological limitations in terms of actuator technologies. In this regard, current trends in this field are focused on the evaluation of the concept of biomechanical loading of tremor through selective Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) based on a (Brain-to-Computer Interaction) BCI-driven detection of involuntary (tremor) motor activity.

<doc id="37649" wikidata="Q159190" url="?curid=37649" title="Amplitude">
<text>The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change in a single period (such as time or spatial period). The amplitude of a non-periodic signal is its magnitude compared with a reference value. There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the differences between the variable&#x27;s extreme values. In older texts, the phase of a periodic function is sometimes called the amplitude.

==Definitions==
===Peak amplitude and semi-amplitude===
For symmetric periodic waves, like sine waves or triangle waves, &quot;peak amplitude&quot; and &quot;semi amplitude&quot; are the same.

====Peak amplitude====
In audio system measurements, telecommunications and others where the is a signal that swings above and below a reference value but is not sinusoidal, peak amplitude is often used. If the reference is zero, this is the maximum absolute value of the signal; if the reference is a mean value (DC component), the peak amplitude is the maximum absolute value of the difference from that reference.

====Semi-amplitude====
Semi-amplitude means half of the peak-to-peak amplitude. 
The majority of scientific literature employs the term &quot;amplitude&quot; or &quot;peak amplitude&quot; to mean semi-amplitude.

It is the most widely used measure of orbital wobble in astronomy and the measurement of small radial velocity semi-amplitudes of nearby stars is important in the search for exoplanets (see Doppler spectroscopy).

====Ambiguity====
In general, the use of &quot;peak amplitude&quot; is simple and unambiguous only for symmetric periodic waves, like a sine wave, a square wave, or a triangle wave. For an asymmetric wave (periodic pulses in one direction, for example), the peak amplitude becomes ambiguous. This is because the value is different depending on whether the maximum positive signal is measured relative to the mean, the maximum negative signal is measured relative to the mean, or the maximum positive signal is measured relative to the maximum negative signal (the &quot;peak-to-peak amplitude&quot;) and then divided by two (the &quot;semi-amplitude&quot;). In electrical engineering, the usual solution to this ambiguity is to measure the amplitude from a defined reference potential (such as ground or 0 V). Strictly speaking, this is no longer amplitude since there is the possibility that a constant (DC component) is included in the measurement.

===Peak-to-peak amplitude=== 
Peak-to-peak amplitude (abbreviated p–p or PtP or PtoP) is the change between peak (highest amplitude value) and trough (lowest amplitude value, which can be negative). With appropriate circuitry, peak-to-peak amplitudes of electric oscillations can be measured by meters or by viewing the waveform on an oscilloscope. Peak-to-peak is a straightforward measurement on an oscilloscope, the peaks of the waveform being easily identified and measured against the graticule. This remains a common way of specifying amplitude, but sometimes other measures of amplitude are more appropriate.

===Root mean square amplitude===
Root mean square (RMS) amplitude is used especially in electrical engineering: the RMS is defined as the square root of the mean over time of the square of the vertical distance of the graph from the rest state;
i.e. the RMS of the AC waveform (with no DC component).

For complicated waveforms, especially non-repeating signals like noise, the RMS amplitude is usually used because it is both unambiguous and has physical significance. For example, the &quot;average&quot; power transmitted by an acoustic or electromagnetic wave or by an electrical signal is proportional to the square of the RMS amplitude (and not, in general, to the square of the peak amplitude).

For alternating current electric power, the universal practice is to specify RMS values of a sinusoidal waveform. One property of root mean square voltages and currents is that they produce the same heating effect as a direct current in a given resistance.

The peak-to-peak value is used, for example, when choosing rectifiers for power supplies, or when estimating the maximum voltage that insulation must withstand. Some common voltmeters are calibrated for RMS amplitude, but respond to the average value of a rectified waveform. Many digital voltmeters and all moving coil meters are in this category. The RMS calibration is only correct for a sine wave input since the ratio between peak, average and RMS values is dependent on waveform. If the wave shape being measured is greatly different from a sine wave, the relationship between RMS and average value changes. True RMS-responding meters were used in radio frequency measurements, where instruments measured the heating effect in a resistor to measure a current. The advent of microprocessor-controlled meters capable of calculating RMS by sampling the waveform has made true RMS measurement commonplace.

===Pulse amplitude===
In telecommunications, &quot;pulse amplitude&quot; is the magnitude of a pulse parameter, such as the voltage level, current level, field intensity, or power level.

Pulse amplitude is measured with respect to a specified reference and therefore should be modified by qualifiers, such as &quot;average&quot;, &quot;instantaneous&quot;, &quot;peak&quot;, or &quot;root-mean-square&quot;.

Pulse amplitude also applies to the amplitude of frequency- and phase-modulated waveform envelopes.

==Formal representation==
In this simple wave equation
:formula_1

*formula_2 is the amplitude (or peak amplitude),
*formula_3 is the oscillating variable,
*formula_4 is angular frequency,
*formula_5 is time,
*formula_6 and formula_7 are arbitrary constants representing time and displacement offsets respectively.

==Units==
The units of the amplitude depend on the type of wave, but are always in the same units as the oscillating variable. A more general representation of the wave equation is more complex, but the role of amplitude remains analogous to this simple case.

For waves on a string, or in a medium such as water, the amplitude is a displacement.

The amplitude of sound waves and audio signals (which relates to the volume) conventionally refers to the amplitude of the air pressure in the wave, but sometimes the amplitude of the displacement (movements of the air or the diaphragm of a speaker) is described. The logarithm of the amplitude squared is usually quoted in dB, so a null amplitude corresponds to −∞ dB. Loudness is related to amplitude and intensity and is one of the most salient qualities of a sound, although in general sounds it can be recognized independently of amplitude. The square of the amplitude is proportional to the intensity of the wave.

For electromagnetic radiation, the amplitude of a photon corresponds to the changes in the electric field of the wave. However, radio signals may be carried by electromagnetic radiation; the intensity of the radiation (amplitude modulation) or the frequency of the radiation (frequency modulation) is oscillated and then the individual oscillations are varied (modulated) to produce the signal.

==Amplitude envelopes==
Amplitude envelope refers to the changes in the amplitude of a sound over time, and is an influential property as it affects perception of timbre. A flat tone has a steady state amplitude that remains constant during time, which is represented by a scalar. Other sounds can have percussive amplitude envelopes featuring an abrupt onset followed by an immediate exponential decay.

Percussive amplitude envelopes are characteristic of various impact sounds: two wine glasses clinking together, hitting a drum, slamming a door, etc. where the amplitude is transient and must be represented as either a continuous function or a discrete vector. Percussive amplitude envelopes model many common sounds that have a transient loudness attack, decay, sustain, and release.

==Amplitude normalization==
With waveforms containing many overtones, complex transient timbres can be achieved by assigning each overtone to its own distinct transient amplitude envelope. Unfortunately, this has the effect of modulating the loudness of the sound as well. It makes more sense to separate loudness and harmonic quality to be parameters controlled independently of each other.

To do so, harmonic amplitude envelopes are frame-by-frame normalized to become amplitude &quot;proportion&quot; envelopes, where at each time frame all the harmonic amplitudes will add to 100% (or 1). This way, the main loudness-controlling envelope can be cleanly controlled.

In Sound Recognition, max amplitude normalization can be used to help align the key harmonic features of 2 alike sounds, allowing similar timbres to be recognized independent of loudness.

<doc id="37652" wikidata="Q34600" url="?curid=37652" title="Kyoto">
<text>Kyoto (; Japanese: , &quot;Kyōto&quot; ), officially , is the capital city of Kyoto Prefecture in the Kansai region of Japan&#x27;s largest and most populous island of Honshu. , the city had a population of 1.46 million, making it the ninth-most populous city in Japan. More than half (56.8%) of Kyoto Prefecture&#x27;s population resides in the city. The city is the cultural anchor of the substantially larger Greater Kyoto, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 3.8 million people. It is also part of the even larger Keihanshin metropolitan area, along with Osaka and Kobe.

Kyoto is one of the oldest municipalities in Japan, having been chosen in 794 as the new seat of Japan&#x27;s imperial court by Emperor Kanmu. The original city, named Heian-kyō, was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient Chinese capitals of Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang. The emperors of Japan ruled from Kyoto in the following eleven centuries until 1869. It was the scene of several key events of the Muromachi period, Sengoku period, and the Boshin War, such as the Ōnin War, the Honnō-ji Incident, the Kinmon incident, and the Battle of Toba–Fushimi. The capital was relocated from Kyoto to Tokyo after the Meiji Restoration. The modern municipality of Kyoto was established in 1889. The city was spared from large-scale destruction during World War II and, as a result, its prewar cultural heritage has mostly been preserved.

Kyoto is considered the cultural capital of Japan and is a major tourist destination. The agency for cultural affairs of the national government is headquartered in the city. It is home to numerous Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, palaces and gardens, some of which have been designated collectively as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Prominent landmarks include the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kiyomizu-dera, Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji, and Kyoto Tower. The internationally renowned video game company Nintendo is based in Kyoto. Kyoto is also a center of higher learning in the country, and its institutions include Kyoto University, the second-oldest university in Japan.

==Name==
In Japanese, Kyoto was previously called Kyō (), Miyako (), Kyō no Miyako (), and . After becoming the capital of Japan at the start of the Heian period (794–1185), the city was often referred to as Heian-kyō (, &quot;Heian capital&quot;), and late in the Heian period the city came to be widely referred to simply as &quot;Kyōto&quot; (, &quot;capital city&quot;). After the seat of the emperor was moved to the city of Edo and that city was renamed &quot;Tōkyō&quot; (, meaning &quot;eastern capital&quot;), Kyoto was briefly known as &quot;Saikyō&quot; (, meaning &quot;western capital&quot;). As the capital of Japan from 794 to 1868, Kyoto is sometimes called the thousand-year capital ().

Historically, foreign spellings for the city&#x27;s name have included Kioto and Miaco or Meaco.

==History==
===Origins===

Ample archeological evidence suggests human settlement in the area of Kyoto began as early as the Paleolithic period, although not much published material is retained about human activity in the region before the 6th century, around which time the Shimogamo Shrine is believed to have been established. Before Kyoto became the imperial capital, immigrants from mainland Asia contributed to the development of the area.

During the 8th century, when powerful Buddhist clergy became involved in the affairs of the imperial government, Emperor Kanmu chose to relocate the capital in order to distance it from the clerical establishment in Nara. His last choice for the site was the village of Uda, in the Kadono district of Yamashiro Province.

The new city, , modeled after Chinese Tang dynasty capital Chang&#x27;an, became the seat of Japan&#x27;s imperial court in 794, beginning the Heian period of Japanese history. Although military rulers established their governments either in Kyoto (Muromachi shogunate) or in other cities such as Kamakura (Kamakura shogunate) and Edo (Tokugawa shogunate), Kyoto remained Japan&#x27;s capital until the transfer of the imperial court to Tokyo in 1869 at the time of the Imperial Restoration.

===Feudal period===
In the Sengoku period, the city suffered extensive destruction in the Ōnin War of 1467–1477, and did not really recover until the mid-16th century. During the war, battles between samurai factions spilled into the streets, and came to involve court nobility (&quot;kuge&quot;) and religious factions as well. Nobles&#x27; mansions were transformed into fortresses, deep trenches dug throughout the city for defense and as firebreaks, and numerous buildings burned. The city has not seen such widespread destruction since.

In the late 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi reconstructed the city by building new streets to double the number of north–south streets in central Kyoto, creating rectangle blocks superseding ancient square blocks. Toyotomi also built earthwork walls called encircling the city. Teramachi Street in central Kyoto is a Buddhist temple quarter where Toyotomi gathered temples in the city.
===Early modern period===

In 1603, the Tokugawa Shogunate was established at Edo (present-day Tokyo), marking the beginning of the Edo period. Nevertheless, Kyoto flourished as one of three major cities in Japan, the others being Osaka and Edo. At the end of the period, the Hamaguri rebellion of 1864 burned down 28,000 houses in the city, which showed the rebels&#x27; dissatisfaction towards the Tokugawa Shogunate.
===Modern period===

At the start of the Meiji period, the emperor&#x27;s move from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869 weakened the economy of Kyoto. The modern city of Kyoto was formed on April 1, 1889. The construction of Lake Biwa Canal in 1890 was one measure taken to revive the city. The population of the city exceeded one million in 1932.
===Contemporary history===
There was some consideration by the United States of targeting Kyoto with an atomic bomb at the end of World War II because of the possibility that the city&#x27;s importance was great enough that its loss might persuade Japan to surrender. In the end, at the insistence of Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the city was removed from the list of targets and replaced by Nagasaki. The city was largely spared from conventional bombing as well, although small-scale air raids did result in casualties. During the occupation, the U.S. Sixth Army and I Corps were headquartered in Kyoto.

As a result, Kyoto is one of the few Japanese cities that still have an abundance of prewar buildings, such as the traditional townhouses known as &quot;machiya&quot;. However, modernization is continually breaking down traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the Kyōto Station complex.

Kyoto became a city designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956. In 1994, 17 historic monuments in Kyoto were inscribed on the list as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 1997, Kyoto hosted the conference that resulted in the protocol on greenhouse gas emissions (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).

==Geography==
===Terrain===
Kyoto is located in a valley, part of the Yamashiro (or Kyoto) Basin, in the eastern part of the mountainous region known as the Tamba highlands. The Yamashiro Basin is surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama (literally &quot;east mountain&quot;, &quot;north mountain&quot; and &quot;west mountain&quot; respectively), with a maximum height of approximately above sea level. This interior positioning results in hot summers and cold winters. There are three rivers in the basin, the Uji River to the south, the Katsura River to the west, and the Kamo River to the east. Kyoto City takes up 17.9% of the land in Kyoto Prefecture and has a total area of .

Kyoto sits atop a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Due to large-scale urbanization, the amount of rain draining into the table is dwindling and wells across the area are drying at an increasing rate.

===Climate===
Kyoto has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), featuring a marked seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation. Summers are hot and humid, but winters are relatively cold with occasional snowfall. Kyoto&#x27;s rainy season begins around the middle of June and lasts until the end of July, yielding to a hot and sunny latter half of the summer. Kyoto, like most of the Pacific coast and central areas of Japan, is prone to typhoons during the summer and autumn.
===Administrative divisions===
In the 1870s, the city was divided into a northern ward (Kamigyō-ku) and a southern ward (Shimogyō-ku), each working as individual administrative divisions of Kyoto Prefecture. The modern municipality was created by the unification of these wards into the city of Kyoto in 1889.

Due to the creation of new administrative districts and a number of municipal mergers that took place between the 1920s and the 1970s, the contemporary city of Kyoto is divided into eleven . The central wards, located to the west of the Kamo River, are small and densely populated. The city hall is located in Nakagyō-ku, and the Kyoto prefectural offices are located in present-day Kamigyō-ku.

===Cityscape===
Kyoto contains roughly 2,000 temples and shrines. The main business district is located to the south of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. In the center of the city, there are several covered shopping arcades only open to pedestrian traffic, such as Teramachi Street and Shinkyōgoku Street.

The original city was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient Chinese capital of Chang&#x27;an/Luoyang. The Imperial Palace faced south, resulting in Ukyō (the right sector of the capital) being on the west, while Sakyō (the left sector) is on the east. The streets in the modern-day wards of Kamigyō-ku, Nakagyō-ku, and Shimogyō-ku still follow a grid pattern. Areas outside of the city center do not follow the same grid pattern, though streets throughout Kyoto are referred to by name, a practice that is rare in most regions of Japan.
===Demographics===

Kyoto was the largest city in Japan until the late 16th century, when its population was surpassed by those of Osaka and Edo. Before World War II, Kyoto vied with Kobe and Nagoya to rank as the fourth- or fifth-largest city in Japan. Having avoided most wartime destruction, it was again the third-largest city in 1947. By 1960 it had fallen to fifth again, and by 1990 it had fallen to seventh. , it was the ninth-largest city in Japan by population and had led the country in population decrease for two consecutive years. However, the population of the city rises during standard working hours, and Kyoto ranks seventh in Japan in terms of daytime population.

Approximately 55% of the total population of Kyoto Prefecture is concentrated in the city of Kyoto, which is the highest ratio among the prefectures of Japan.

==Government==
The city of Kyoto is governed by the mayor of Kyoto and the Kyoto City Assembly, a municipal council.

===Kyoto City Assembly===

The legislative city assembly has 67 elected members, and terms are four years in length. As of 2024, the assembly is controlled by a coalition of members affiliated with the Liberal Democratic Party, Komeito, and the Democratic Civic Forum.
===List of mayors===
Between the founding of the modern city and 1898, the governor of Kyoto Prefecture also acted as the mayor of the city of Kyoto. From 1898 through the Second World War, mayors were nominated by the Kyoto City Assembly and appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs.

Since 1947, mayors of Kyoto have been chosen by direct election to four-year terms. As of 2024, there have been ten mayors elected using this system. While some mayors have resigned or died in office, no mayor has lost a reelection bid in the postwar period. In the 2024 Kyoto mayoral election, independent candidate Koji Matsui was elected for the first time, supported by the Liberal Democratic Party, Komeito, the Constitutional Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party for the People.

==Economy==

Information technology and electronics are key industries in Kyoto. The city is home to the headquarters of Nintendo, Intelligent Systems, SCREEN Holdings, Tose, Hatena, Omron, Kyocera, Shimadzu, Rohm, Horiba, Nidec Corporation, Nichicon, Nissin Electric, and GS Yuasa.

Domestic and international tourism contributes significantly to Kyoto&#x27;s economy. In 2014, the city government announced that a record number of tourists had visited Kyoto. As a result of a sharp decline in tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic, the mayor acknowledged in 2021 &quot;the possibility of bankruptcy in the next decade&quot; and announced job cuts in the administration and cuts in social assistance, including reductions in funding for home care.

Traditional Japanese crafts are also a major industry of Kyoto; Kyoto&#x27;s kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center of kimono manufacturing. Sake brewing is another prominent traditional industry in Kyoto, and the headquarters of major sake brewers Gekkeikan and Takara Holdings are found in Kyoto.

Other notable businesses headquartered in Kyoto include Aiful, Ishida, Nissen Holdings, Gyoza no Ohsho, Sagawa Express, Volks, and Wacoal.

==Education==
=== Primary and secondary education ===
As of 1 May 2023, there were 154 municipal public elementary schools in Kyoto, with a total of 55,736 pupils. At the secondary level, there were 66 municipal public junior high schools with 27,046 students and 11 municipal public senior high schools with 5,117 students.

===Tertiary education===
Home to 40 institutions of higher education, Kyoto is one of the academic centers in Japan. Kyoto University is ranked highly among all universities nationwide, with eight Nobel laureates and two Prime Ministers of Japan among its alumni. The Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences and the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, both part of the university, have been affiliated with influential mathematicians and physicists. Private universities such as Doshisha University and Ritsumeikan University are also located in the city.

The Consortium of Universities in Kyoto is a Kyoto-based higher education network consisting of three national universities, three public (prefectural and municipal) universities, 45 private universities, five other organizations, and representatives from the city government. The Consortium does not offer degrees, but allows students of member universities to take courses at other member universities.

In addition to Japanese universities and colleges, educational institutions from other countries operate programs in the city. The Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies (KCJS) is a group of 14 American universities that runs overseas academic programs in Japanese language and cultural studies for university students. Similarly, the Associated Kyoto Program runs a study-abroad academic program with a focus on cultural, language, and historical learning in and around the Kansai metropolitan area.

==Transportation==
===Railways===

Kyoto is served by rail transportation systems operated by several different companies and organizations. The city&#x27;s main gateway terminal, Kyōto Station, connects the Tokaido Shinkansen bullet train line with five JR West lines, a Kintetsu line, and a municipal subway line.

The Keihan Electric Railway, the Hankyu Railway, and other rail networks also offer frequent services within the city and to other cities and suburbs in the Kinki region. Although Kyoto does not have its own commercial airport, the limited express &quot;Haruka&quot; operated by JR West carries passengers from Kansai International Airport to Kyōto Station in 73 minutes.

The Kyoto Railway Museum in Shimogyō-ku, operated by JR West, displays many steam, diesel, and electric locomotives used in Japan from the 1880s to the present.

====High-speed rail====
The Tokaidō Shinkansen, operated by JR Central, provides high-speed rail service linking Kyoto with Nagoya, Yokohama, and Tokyo to the east and with nearby Osaka to the west. Beyond Osaka, many trains boarding at Kyoto continue on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen route managed by JR West, providing access to cities including Kobe, Okayama, Hiroshima, Kitakyushu, and Fukuoka. The trip from Tokyo to Kyoto takes around 2.5 hours, and the trip from Hakata Station in Fukuoka to Kyoto takes just over three hours by the fastest train service &quot;Nozomi&quot;. All Shinkansen trains stop at Kyōto Station, including &quot;Hikari&quot; and &quot;Kodama&quot; trains.

====Subways====
The Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau operates the Kyoto Municipal Subway consisting of two lines: the Karasuma Line and the Tōzai Line. The two lines are linked at Karasuma Oike Station near Kyoto&#x27;s central business district.

The Karasuma Line runs primarily north to south between the terminal of Kokusaikaikan Station and Takeda Station, and takes its name from the fact that trains run beneath Karasuma Street between Kitaōji Station in Kita-ku and Jūjō Station in Minami-ku. The Karasuma Line connects to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line at the intersection of Shijō Karasuma in Kyoto&#x27;s central business district and to JR lines and the Kyoto Kintetsu Line at Kyōto Station. In addition, the Transportation Bureau and Kintetsu jointly operate through services which continue to Kintetsu Nara Station in Nara, the capital city of Nara Prefecture.

The Tōzai Line runs from the southeastern area of the city towards the center, then east to west (&quot;tōzai&quot; in Japanese) through the Kyoto downtown area where trains run beneath the east–west streets of Sanjō Street, Oike Street, and . The Keihan Keishin Line has been integrated into this line, and thus Keihan provides through services to in the neighboring city of Ōtsu, the capital of Shiga Prefecture. Within the city of Kyoto, the Tōzai Line also connects to the Keihan lines at Yamashina Station, Misasagi Station, and Sanjō Keihan Station, and to the Keifuku Electric Railroad at the terminal of Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station.

===Buses===

Kyoto&#x27;s municipal bus network is extensive. Private carriers also operate within the city. Many tourists join commuters on the public buses, or take tour buses. Kyoto&#x27;s buses have announcements in English and electronic signs with stops written in the Latin alphabet. Buses operating on routes within the city, the region, and the nation stop at Kyōto Station. In addition to Kyōto Station, bus transfer is available at the intersection of Shijō Kawaramachi, Sanjō Keihan Station, and the intersection of Karasuma Kitaōji near Kitaōji Station.

===Roads and waterways===

Because many older streets in Kyoto are narrow, there are a significant number of one-way roads without sidewalks. Cycling is a common form of personal transportation in the city, although there are few areas set aside for bicycle parking and bicycles parked in restricted areas are impounded.

Kyoto has fewer toll-highways than other Japanese cities of comparable size. There are nine national highways in the city of Kyoto: Route 1, Route 8, Route 9, Route 24, Route 162, Route 171, Route 367, Route 477, and Route 478.

The city is connected with other parts of Japan by the Meishin Expressway, which has two interchanges in the city: Kyoto-higashi Interchange (Kyoto East) in Yamashina-ku and (Kyoto South) in Fushimi-ku. The Kyoto Jūkan Expressway connects the city to the northern regions of Kyoto Prefecture. The Second Keihan Highway is another bypass to Osaka.

Traditionally, trade and haulage took place by waterway, and there continue to be a number of navigable rivers and canals in Kyoto. In contemporary Kyoto, however, waterways are no longer commonly used for transportation of passengers or goods, other than for limited sightseeing purposes such as excursion boats on the Hozu River and cormorant fishing boats on the Ōi River.

==Culture==

Although ravaged by wars, fires, and earthquakes during its eleven centuries as the imperial capital, Kyoto suffered only minor damage in World War II. Kyoto remains Japan&#x27;s cultural center. About 20% of Japan&#x27;s National Treasures and 14% of Important Cultural Properties exist in the city proper. The government of Japan relocated the Agency for Cultural Affairs to Kyoto in 2023.
With its 2,000 religious places – 1,600 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrines, as well as palaces, gardens and architecture intact – it is one of the best preserved cities in Japan. Among the most famous temples in Japan are Kiyomizu-dera, a magnificent wooden temple supported by pillars off the slope of a mountain; Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion; Ginkaku-ji, the Temple of the Silver Pavilion; and Ryōan-ji, famous for its rock garden. The Heian Jingū is a Shinto shrine, built in 1895, celebrating the imperial family and commemorating the first and last emperors to reside in Kyoto. Three special sites have connections to the imperial family: the Kyoto Gyoen area including the Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sentō Imperial Palace, homes of the emperors of Japan for many centuries; Katsura Imperial Villa, one of the nation&#x27;s finest architectural treasures; and Shugakuin Imperial Villa, one of its best Japanese gardens. In addition, the temple of Sennyu-ji houses the tombs of the emperors from Shijō to Kōmei.

Other sites in Kyoto include Arashiyama, the Gion and Ponto-chō geisha quarters, the Philosopher&#x27;s Walk, and the canals that line some of the older streets.

The &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto&quot; are listed by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. These include the Kamo Shrines (Kami and Shimo), Kyō-ō-Gokokuji (Tō-ji), Kiyomizu-dera, Daigo-ji, Ninna-ji, Saihō-ji (Kokedera), Tenryū-ji, Rokuon-ji (Kinkaku-ji), Jishō-ji (Ginkaku-ji), Ryōan-ji, Hongan-ji, Kōzan-ji, and the Nijō Castle, primarily built by the Tokugawa shōguns. Other sites outside the city are also on the list.

Kyoto is renowned for its abundance of delicious Japanese foods and cuisine. The special circumstances of Kyoto as a city away from the sea and home to many Buddhist temples resulted in the development of a variety of vegetables peculiar to the . The oldest restaurant in Kyoto is Honke Owariya which was founded in 1465.

Japan&#x27;s television and film industry has its center in Kyoto. Many &quot;jidaigeki&quot;, action films featuring samurai, were shot at Toei Uzumasa Eigamura. A film set and theme park in one, Eigamura features replicas of traditional Japanese buildings, which are used for &quot;jidaigeki&quot;. Among the sets are a replica of the old Nihonbashi (the bridge at the entry to Edo), a traditional courthouse, a Meiji Period police box and part of the former Yoshiwara red-light district. Actual film shooting takes place occasionally, and visitors are welcome to observe the action.

The dialect spoken in Kyoto is known as &quot;Kyō-kotoba&quot; or &quot;Kyōto-ben&quot;, a constituent dialect of the Kansai dialect. Until the late Edo period, the Kyoto dialect was the &quot;de facto&quot; standard Japanese, although it has since been replaced by modern standard Japanese. Traditional Kyoto expressions include the polite copula &quot;dosu&quot;, the honorific verb ending &quot;-haru&quot;, and the greeting phrase &quot;okoshi-yasu&quot;.
===Festivals===
Kyoto is well known for its traditional festivals which have been held for over 1,000 years and are a major tourist attraction. The first is the Aoi Matsuri on May 15. Two months later (July) is the Gion Matsuri known as one of the 3 great festivals of Japan, culminating in a massive parade on July 17. Kyoto marks the Bon Festival with the Gozan no Okuribi, lighting fires on mountains to guide the spirits home (August 16). The October 22 Jidai Matsuri, Festival of the Ages, celebrates Kyoto&#x27;s illustrious past.

===UNESCO World Heritage Site===

The UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities) includes fourteen temples, shrines, and castles in Kyoto dating from between the sixth century (Shimogamo Shrine, though extant structures are more recent) and the seventeenth century (Nijō Castle). The sites were designated as World Heritage in 1994.

===Sports===

Kyoto has been the site of many annual sporting events, ranging from the 400-year-old Tōshiya archery exhibition held at the Sanjūsangen-dō Temple to the Kyoto Marathon and the Shimadzu All Japan Indoor Tennis Championships.

Several sports teams are based in Kyoto, including professional football and basketball teams. In football, Kyoto has been represented by Kyoto Sanga FC, a club which won the Emperor&#x27;s Cup in 2002 and rose to J. League&#x27;s Division 1 in 2005. Kyoto Sanga began as an amateur non-company club in the 1920s, making it the J. League team with the longest history, although it was only after professionalization in the 1990s that it was able to compete in the Japanese top division. Until 2019, Kyoto Sanga used Takebishi Stadium Kyoto in Ukyō-ku as its home stadium, but home matches were moved to the city of Kameoka, Kyoto in 2020. There are also several amateur football clubs based in Kyoto. The amateur clubs AS Laranja Kyoto, Ococias Kyoto AC, and Kyoto Shiko Soccer Club compete in the regional Kansai Soccer League.

Another professional team based in Kyoto is the Kyoto Hannaryz, a men&#x27;s basketball team in the First Division of the B.League that plays its home games at the Kyoto City Gymnasium in Ukyō-ku. Kyoto has also been the home of other professional teams that have subsequently moved or been disbanded. Between 1949 and 1952, the Central League professional baseball team Shochiku Robins played home games at Kinugasa Ballpark in Kita-ku and Nishi-Kyōgoku Baseball Park (now known as Wakasa Stadium) in Ukyō-ku. This team eventually became the Yokohama DeNA BayStars. Kyoto also hosted two teams in the Japan Women&#x27;s Baseball League before the league folded in 2021.

Company teams in Kyoto include two rugby squads, the Mitsubishi Motors Kyoto Red Evolutions and the Shimadzu Breakers, which compete in the Kansai regional rugby league Top West. In baseball, company teams have competed in the regional JABA Kyoto Tournament annually since 1947.

Kyoto Racecourse in Fushimi-ku is one of ten racecourses operated by the Japan Racing Association. It hosts notable horse races including the Kikuka-shō, Spring Tenno Sho, and Queen Elizabeth II Cup.

<text>CBS Broadcasting Inc., commonly shortened to CBS (an abbreviation of its original name, Columbia Broadcasting System), is an American commercial broadcast television and radio network serving as the flagship property of the CBS Entertainment Group division of Paramount Global and is one of the company&#x27;s three flagship subsidiaries, along with namesake Paramount Pictures and MTV.

Headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City and being part of the &quot;Big Three&quot; television networks, CBS has major production facilities and operations at the CBS Broadcast Center and the headquarters of owner Paramount at One Astor Plaza (both also in that city) and Television City and the CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles. It is sometimes referred to as the Eye Network, after the company&#x27;s trademark symbol of an eye (which has been in use since October 20, 1951), and also the Tiffany Network, which alludes to the perceived high quality of its programming during the tenure of William S. Paley (and can also refer to some of CBS&#x27;s first demonstrations of color television, which were held in the former Tiffany and Company Building in New York City in 1950).

== History ==

The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters, Inc., a radio network founded in Chicago by New York City talent agent Arthur Judson in January 1927. In April of that year, the Columbia Phonograph Company, parent of Columbia Records&#x27; record label, invested in the network, resulting in its rebranding as the Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System (CPBS). In early 1928, Judson and Columbia sold the network to Isaac and Leon Levy, two brothers who owned WCAU, the network&#x27;s Philadelphia affiliate, as well as their partner Jerome Louchheim. They installed William S. Paley, an in-law of the Levys, as president of the network. With the Columbia record label out of ownership, Paley rebranded the network as the Columbia Broadcasting System. By September 1928, Paley became the network&#x27;s majority owner with 51 percent of the business. Paramount Pictures then acquired the other 49 percent of CBS in 1929, but the Great Depression eventually forced the studio to sell its shares back to the network in 1932. CBS would then remain primarily an independent company throughout the next 63 years. Under Paley&#x27;s guidance, CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks. CBS ventured and expanded its horizons through television starting in the 1940s, spinning off its broadcast syndication division Viacom to a separate company in 1971. In 1974, CBS dropped its original full name and became known simply as CBS, Inc. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &quot;CBS&quot;. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1994, renaming its legal name to the current CBS Broadcasting Inc. two years later, and in 1997 adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation. In 1999, CBS came under the control of the original incarnation of Viacom, which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television, radio and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements, which also controlled the second incarnation of Viacom until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Global). Following the sale, CBS and its other broadcasting and entertainment assets were reorganized into a new division, CBS Entertainment Group.

CBS operated the CBS Radio network until 2017 when it sold its radio division to Entercom (now known as Audacy, Inc. since 2021). Before this, CBS Radio mainly provided news and feature content for its portfolio of owned-and-operated radio stations in large and mid-sized markets, as well as its affiliated radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation common shareholders (i.e. not the multiple-voting shares held by National Amusements) were given a 72% stake in the combined Entercom, CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly; however, it still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and the new owners of its former radio stations, and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has over 240 owned-and-operated and affiliated television stations throughout the United States, some also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in border areas over-the-air.

==Programming==

, CBS provides hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of primetime programming to affiliated stations Monday through Saturday from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. and Sunday from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time (7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on Sunday in Central/Mountain time).

The network also provides daytime programming from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific weekdays (subtract 1 hour for all other time zones), including a half-hour break for local news and features the game shows &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, soap operas &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, and the former talk show &quot;The Talk,&quot; which will be replaced by the new soap opera &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot; on February 24, 2025.

CBS News programming includes &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. weekdays and &quot;CBS Saturday Morning&quot; in the same period on Saturdays; nightly editions of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;; the Sunday political talk show &quot;Face the Nation&quot;; early morning news program &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;; and the newsmagazines &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, and &quot;48 Hours&quot;. On weeknights, CBS airs the talk show &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; and the comedic game show &quot;After Midnight&quot;.

CBS Sports programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS occasionally delays scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice most commonly seen with the NFL on CBS. In addition to rights to sports events from major sports organizations such as the NFL, PGA, and NCAA, CBS broadcasts the &quot;CBS Sports Spectacular&quot;, a sports anthology series that fills certain weekend afternoon time slots before (or in some cases, in place of) a major sporting event.

===Daytime===

CBS&#x27; daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at hours. It is the home of the long-running game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by Bob Barker for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor and comedian Drew Carey. The network is also home to the current incarnation of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, hosted by singer and comedian Wayne Brady.

CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows. Notable game shows that once aired as part of the network&#x27;s daytime lineup include &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Tattletales&quot;, &quot;The $10/25,000 Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Past game shows that have had both daytime and prime time runs on the network include &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Two long-running primetime-only games were the panel shows &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;.

The network was also home to &quot;The Talk&quot;, a panel talk show similar in format to ABC&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot;. It debuted in October 2010. The panel featured Sheryl Underwood, Amanda Kloots, Jerry O&#x27;Connell, Akbar Gbajabiamila, and Natalie Morales who served as moderator. &quot;The Talk&quot; officially ended its run on December 20, 2024.

CBS Daytime airs two daytime soap operas each weekday: the hour-long series &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, which debuted in 1973, and the half-hour series &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, which debuted in 1987. CBS has long aired the most soap operas out of the Big Three networks, carrying hours of soaps on its daytime lineup from 1977 to 2009, and still retains the longest daily schedule. Other than &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, notable daytime soap operas that once aired on CBS include &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, &quot;Love of Life&quot;, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, and &quot;Capitol&quot;.

===Children&#x27;s programming===

CBS broadcast the live-action series &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; on weekday mornings from 1955 to 1982, and on Saturdays until 1984. From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled &quot;In the News&quot;, which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, CBS&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming has mostly focused on animated series such as reruns of &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, and &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons, as well as &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppet Babies&quot;, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. In 1997, CBS premiered &quot;Wheel 2000&quot;, a children&#x27;s version of the syndicated game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; which aired simultaneously on the Game Show Network.

In September 1998, CBS began contracting the time out to other companies to provide programming and material for its Saturday morning schedule. The first of these outsourced blocks was the &quot;CBS Kidshow&quot;, which ran until 2000 and featured programming from Canadian studio Nelvana such as &quot;Anatole&quot;, &quot;Mythic Warriors&quot;, &quot;Rescue Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Flying Rhino Junior High&quot;.

After its agreement with Nelvana ended, the network then entered into a deal with Nickelodeon to air programming from its Nick Jr. block beginning in September 2000, under the banner Nick Jr. on CBS. By the time of the deal, Nickelodeon and CBS were corporate sisters through the latter&#x27;s then parent company Viacom as a result of its 2000 merger with CBS Corporation. From 2002 to 2005, live-action and animated Nickelodeon series aimed at older children also aired as part of the block under the name Nick on CBS.

Following the Viacom-CBS split, the network decided to discontinue the Nickelodeon content deal. In March 2006, CBS entered into a three-year agreement with DIC Entertainment, which was acquired later that year by the Cookie Jar Group, to program the Saturday morning time slot as part of a deal that included distribution of select tape-delayed Formula One auto races. The &quot;KOL Secret Slumber Party on CBS&quot; replaced &quot;Nick Jr. on CBS&quot; that September, with the inaugural lineup featuring two new first-run live-action programs, one animated series that originally aired in syndication in 2005, and three shows produced before 2006. In mid-2007, KOL, the children&#x27;s service of AOL, withdrew sponsorship from CBS&#x27; Saturday morning block, which was subsequently renamed KEWLopolis. Complementing CBS&#x27;s 2007 lineup were &quot;Care Bears&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot;, and &quot;Sushi Pack&quot;. On February 24, 2009, it was announced that CBS would renew its contract with Cookie Jar for another three seasons through 2012. On September 19, 2009, KEWLopolis was renamed Cookie Jar TV.

On July 24, 2013, CBS agreed with Litton Entertainment, which already programmed a syndicated Saturday morning block exclusive to ABC stations and later produced a block for CBS&#x27; sister network The CW that received its debut the following year, to launch a new Saturday morning block featuring live-action reality-based lifestyle, wildlife, and sports series. The Litton-produced CBS Dream Team block, aimed at teenagers 13 to 16 years old, began broadcasting on September 28, 2013, replacing Cookie Jar TV. The block was renamed CBS WKND in 2023.

===Specials===
====Animated primetime holiday specials====
CBS was the original broadcast network home of the animated primetime holiday specials based on the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, beginning with &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; in 1965. Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as Halloween) were broadcast on CBS until 2000 when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel), beginning with &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; in 1966, as well as several specials based on the &quot;Garfield&quot; comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his Saturday-morning cartoon on the network, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, which ran from 1988 to 1995). &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, produced in stop motion by Rankin/Bass, has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special first aired on NBC in 1964. , &quot;Rudolph&quot; and &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; are the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; specials are now held by Apple, &quot;The Grinch&quot; rights by NBC, and the rights to the &quot;Garfield&quot; specials by Boomerang.

All of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words &quot;A CBS Special Presentation&quot; were displayed in colorful lettering (the ITC Avant Garde typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word &quot;SPECIAL&quot;, in all caps and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, titled &quot;Call to Danger&quot; on the Capitol Records soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the Miss USA pageants and the annual presentation of the Kennedy Center Honors), in addition to animated specials.

====Classical music specials====
CBS was also responsible for airing the series of &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts&quot;, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to classical music through the eloquent commentaries of Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several Emmy Awards, including two wins in 1961 and later in 1966, and were among the first programs ever broadcast from the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.

Over the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; – two live telecasts of the George Balanchine New York City Ballet production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred Edward Villella, Patricia McBride and Melissa Hayden), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with Gelsey Kirkland – a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).

In April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of &quot;Horowitz in Moscow&quot;, a live piano recital by pianist Vladimir Horowitz, which marked his return to Russia after over 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; (televised at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00 p.m. in Russia). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by Charles Kuralt but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.

In 1986, CBS telecast &quot;Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening&quot; in primetime, in what was then a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and A&amp;E by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of Carnegie Hall after its complete renovation. A range of artists were featured, from classical conductor Leonard Bernstein to popular music singer Frank Sinatra.

====&quot;Cinderella&quot;====
To compete with NBC, which produced the televised version of the Mary Martin Broadway production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, CBS responded with a musical production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. Based upon the classic Charles Perrault fairy tale, it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957, as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100 million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, Ginger Rogers, and Walter Pidgeon among its stars; the remake also included the new song &quot;Loneliness of Evening&quot;, which was originally composed in 1949 for &quot;South Pacific&quot; but was not performed in that musical. This version was rebroadcast several times on CBS into the early 1970s, and is occasionally broadcast on various cable networks to this day; both versions are available on DVD.

====National Geographic====
CBS was also the original broadcast home for the primetime specials produced by the National Geographic Society. The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS – under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED – in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as Louis Leakey, Jacques Cousteau, and Jane Goodall, that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably Alexander Scourby during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the National Geographic Channel, a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and Fox Cable Networks. The specials&#x27; distinctive theme music, by Elmer Bernstein, was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.

====Other notable specials====
From 1949 to 2002, the Pillsbury Bake-Off, an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included Arthur Godfrey, Art Linkletter, Bob Barker, Gary Collins, Willard Scott (although under contract with CBS&#x27; rival NBC), and Alex Trebek.

The Miss USA beauty pageant aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002, during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of CBS&#x27;s game shows including Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an animal rights activist who eventually convinced producers of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; to cease offering fur coats as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), succeed by Alan Thicke in 1988, Dick Clark from 1989 to 1993, and Bob Goen from 1994 to 1996. The pageant&#x27;s highest viewership was recorded in the early 1980s when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings on the week of its broadcast. Viewership dropped sharply throughout the 1990s and 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20 million to an average of 7 million from 2000 to 2001. In 2002, Donald Trump (owner of the Miss USA pageant&#x27;s governing body, the Miss Universe Organization) brokered a new deal with NBC, giving it half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pageants and moving them to that network as part of an initial five-year contract, which began in 2003 and ended in 2015 after 12 years amid Trump&#x27;s controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants during the launch of his 2016 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

On June 1, 1977, it was announced that Elvis Presley had signed a deal with CBS to appear in a new television special. Under the agreement, CBS would videotape Presley&#x27;s concerts during the summer of 1977; the special was filmed during Presley&#x27;s final tour at stops in Omaha, Nebraska (on June 19) and Rapid City, South Dakota (on June 21 of that year). CBS aired the special, &quot;Elvis in Concert&quot;, on October 3, 1977, nearly two months after Presley died in his Graceland mansion on August 16.

Since its inception in 1978, CBS has been the sole broadcaster of The Kennedy Center Honors, a two-hour performing arts tribute typically taped and edited in December for later broadcast during the holiday season.

==Stations==

CBS has 15 owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 228 additional television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia, two U.S. possessions (Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Bermuda and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The network has a national reach of 95.96% of all households in the United States (or 299,861,665 Americans with at least one television set). Currently, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Delaware are the only U.S. states where CBS does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&amp;O WCBS-TV and Philadelphia O&amp;O KYW-TV; Delaware is served by KYW and Salisbury, Maryland, affiliate WBOC-TV; and New Hampshire is served by Boston O&amp;O WBZ-TV and Burlington, Vermont, affiliate WCAX-TV).

CBS maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Harrisonburg, Virginia (WSVF-CD), Palm Springs, California (KPSP-CD), and Parkersburg, West Virginia (WIYE-LD). In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. CBS also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets; the largest CBS subchannel affiliate by market size is KOGG in Wailuku, Hawaii, which serves as a repeater of Honolulu affiliate KGMB (the sister station of KOGG parent KHNL).

Nexstar Media Group is the largest operator of CBS stations by numerical total, owning 49 CBS affiliates (counting satellites); Tegna Media is the largest operator of CBS stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 CBS-affiliated stations (including affiliates in the larger markets in Houston, Tampa and Washington, D.C.) that reach 8.9% of the country.

===Video-on-demand services===
CBS provides video-on-demand access for delayed viewing of the network&#x27;s programming through various means, including via its website at CBS.com; the network&#x27;s apps for iOS, Android, and newer version Windows devices; a traditional VOD service called CBS on Demand available on most traditional cable and IPTV providers; and through content deals with Amazon Video (which holds exclusive streaming rights to the CBS drama series &quot;Extant&quot; and &quot;Under the Dome&quot;) and Netflix. Notably, however, CBS is the only major broadcast network that does not provide recent episodes of its programming on Hulu (sister network The CW does offer its programming on the streaming service, albeit on a one-week delay after becoming available on the network&#x27;s website on Hulu&#x27;s free service, with users of its subscription service being granted access to newer episodes of CW series eight hours after their initial broadcast), due to concerns over cannibalizing viewership of some of the network&#x27;s most prominent programs; however, episode back catalogs of certain past and present CBS series are available on the service through an agreement with CBS Television Distribution.

Upon the release of the app in March 2013, CBS restricted streaming of the most recent episode of any of the network&#x27;s programs on its streaming app for Apple iOS devices until eight days after their initial broadcast to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) viewing; programming selections on the app were limited until the release of its Google Play and Windows 8 apps in October 2013, expanded the selections to include full episodes of all CBS series to which the network does not license the streaming rights to other services.

====Paramount+ (formerly CBS All Access)====
On October 28, 2014, CBS launched CBS All Access, an over-the-top subscription streaming service – priced at $5.99 per month ($9.99 with the no commercials option) – which allows users to view past and present episodes of CBS shows. Announced on October 16, 2014 (one day after HBO announced the launch of its over-the-top service HBO Now) as the first OTT offering by a USA broadcast television network, the service initially encompassed the network&#x27;s existing streaming portal at CBS.com and its mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers; CBS All Access became available on Roku on April 7, 2015, and on Chromecast on May 14, 2015. In addition to providing full-length episodes of CBS programs, the service allows live programming streams of local CBS affiliates in 124 markets reaching 75% of the United States.

CBS All Access offered the most recent episodes of the network&#x27;s shows the day after their original broadcast, as well as complete back catalogs of most of its current series and a wide selection of episodes of classic series from the CBS Television Distribution and ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks program library to subscribers of the service. CBS All Access also carried behind-the-scenes features from CBS programs and special events.

Original programs aired on CBS All Access included &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, &quot;The Good Fight&quot;, and &quot;Big Brother: Over the Top&quot;.

In December 2018, the service was launched in Australia under the name 10 All Access, due to its affiliation with CBS-owned free-to-air broadcaster Network 10. Due to local programming rights, not all content is shared with its U.S. counterpart, whilst the Australian version also features numerous full seasons of local Network 10 shows, all commercial-free.

It was announced in September 2020 that the service would be rebranded as Paramount+ in early 2021, and would feature content from the wider ViacomCBS library following the re-merger between CBS and Viacom. The name was also extended to international markets and services such as 10 All Access. The rebrand to Paramount+ took place on March 4, 2021.

===CBS HD===
CBS&#x27; master feed is transmitted in 1080i high definition, the native resolution format for CBS Corporation&#x27;s television properties. However, seven of its affiliates transmit the network&#x27;s programming in 720p HD, while seven others carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry CBS programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed CBS affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD. A small number of CBS stations and affiliates are also currently broadcasting at 1080p via an ATSC 3.0 multiplex station to simulcast a station&#x27;s programming such as WNCN through WRDC in Durham, North Carolina, WTVF through WUXP-TV in Nashville, and KLAS-TV through KVCW in Las Vegas, Nevada.

CBS began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed CBS HD in September 1998, at the start of the 1998–99 season. That year, CBS aired the first NFL game broadcast in high-definition, with the telecast of the New York Jets–Buffalo Bills game on November 8. CBS gradually converted much of its existing programming from standard definition to high definition beginning with the 2000–01 season, with select shows among that season&#x27;s slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD starting with their debuts. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; became the first daytime soap opera to broadcast in HD on June 27, 2001.

CBS&#x27; 14-year conversion to an entirely high-definition schedule ended in 2014, with &quot;Big Brother&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; becoming the final two series to convert from 4:3 standard definition to HD (in contrast, NBC, Fox, and The CW were already airing their entire programming schedules – outside of Saturday mornings – in high definition by the 2010–11 season, while ABC was broadcasting its entire schedule in HD by the 2011–12 midseason). All of the network&#x27;s programming has been presented in full HD since then (except for certain holiday specials produced before 2005 – such as the Rankin-Bass specials – which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD, although some have been remastered for HD broadcast).

On September 1, 2016, when ABC converted to a 16:9 widescreen presentation, CBS and The CW were the only remaining networks that framed their promotions and on-screen graphical elements for a 4:3 presentation, though with CBS Sports&#x27; &quot;de facto&quot; 16:9 conversion with Super Bowl 50 and their new graphical presentation designed for 16:9 framing, in practice, most CBS affiliates ask pay-TV providers to pass down a 16:9 widescreen presentation by default over their standard definition channels. This continued for CBS until September 24, 2018, when the network converted its on-screen graphical elements to a 16:9 widescreen presentation for all non-news and sports programs. Litton Entertainment continues to frame the graphical elements in their programs for &quot;Dream Team&quot; within a 4:3 frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales, though all of its programming has been in high definition.

==Branding ==
===Logos===


The CBS television network&#x27;s initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters &quot;CBS&quot;. The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a Pennsylvania Dutch hex sign and a Shaker drawing. While the logo is commonly attributed to Golden, some design work may have been done by CBS staff designer Georg Olden, one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field. The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new &quot;ident&quot;, CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible. Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by Lou Dorfsman, one of his top assistants, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years.

The CBS eye has since become a widely recognized symbol. While the logo has been used in different ways, the Eye device itself has never been redesigned. As part of a then-new graphical identity created by Trollbäck + Company that was used by the network during the 2006–2007 network television season, the eye was placed in a &quot;trademark&quot; position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the &quot;Eyemark&quot;, a branding used for CBS&#x27; domestic television syndication division, under the Eyemark Entertainment name, in the mid-to-late 1990s after Westinghouse Electric bought CBS, but before the King World acquisition (which Eyemark was folded into), and subsequent merger with Viacom; Eyemark Entertainment was the result of the merger of MaXaM Entertainment (an independent television syndication firm which Westinghouse acquired shortly after its merger with CBS in 1996), Group W Productions (Westinghouse Broadcasting&#x27;s own syndication division), &amp; CBS Enterprises (CBS&#x27;s syndication arm from the late 1960s to the early 1970s).

The eye logo has served as inspiration for the logos of Associated Television (ATV) in the United Kingdom, Canal 4 in El Salvador, Televisa in Mexico, France 3, Latina Televisión in Peru, Fuji Television in Japan, Rede Bandeirantes and TV Globo in Brazil, and Canal 10 in Uruguay.

In October 2011, the network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo, featuring special IDs of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns being shown during the network&#x27;s primetime lineup.

CBS historically used a specially-commissioned variant of Didot, a close relative to Bodoni, as its corporate font until 2021.

===Image campaigns===
====1980s====
CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network&#x27;s most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot; campaign used during the 1981–82 season features a space theme to capitalize on both CBS&#x27;s stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle Columbia. 1982&#x27;s &quot;Great Moments&quot; juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; with scenes from the network&#x27;s then-current classics such as &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan &quot;We&#x27;ve Got the Touch&quot;. Vocals for the campaign&#x27;s jingle were contributed by Richie Havens (1983–84; one occasion in 1984–85) and Kenny Rogers (1985–86).

The 1986–87 season ushered in the &quot;Share the Spirit of CBS&quot; campaign, the network&#x27;s first to completely use computer graphics and digital video effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of &quot;Share the Spirit&quot; not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987–88 &quot;CBS Spirit&quot; (or &quot;CBSPIRIT&quot;) campaign. Like its predecessor, most &quot;CBSpirit&quot; promos utilized a procession of clips from the network&#x27;s programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or &quot;swishing&quot;) blue line that was used to represent &quot;the spirit&quot;. The full-length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.

For the 1988–89 season, CBS unveiled a new image campaign officially known as &quot;Television You Can Feel&quot;, but more commonly identified as &quot;You Can Feel It On CBS&quot;. The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images, and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS saw its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network&#x27;s history. CBS ended the decade with &quot;Get Ready for CBS&quot;, introduced with the 1989–90 season. The initial version was an ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign&#x27;s practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, Kmart) to encourage viewership, with the &quot;CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway&quot;.

====1990s====
For the 1990–91 season, the campaign featured a new jingle performed by the Temptations, which featured an altered version of their hit &quot;Get Ready&quot;. The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as &quot;This is CBS&quot; (1992) and &quot;You&#x27;re on CBS&quot; (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with &quot;Welcome Home to a CBS Night&quot; (1996–1997), simplified to &quot;Welcome Home&quot; (1997–1999), and succeeded by the spin-off campaign &quot;The Address is CBS&quot; (1999–2000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, &quot;The Stars&#x27; Address is CBS&quot;. During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a four-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network&#x27;s IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the &quot;Welcome Home&quot; era.

====2000s====
Throughout the 2000s, CBS&#x27; rating resurgence was backed by the network&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Here&quot; campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005 campaign introduced the slogan &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Watching&quot;, the network&#x27;s strategy led to the proclamation that it was &quot;America&#x27;s Most Watched Network&quot;. The network&#x27;s 2006 campaign introduced the slogan &quot;We Are CBS&quot;, with Don LaFontaine providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled &quot;Only CBS&quot;, in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The &quot;America&#x27;s Most Watched Network&quot; was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the &quot;Only CBS&quot; slogan.

====2020s====
In October 2020, CBS announced that it would begin to employ a more unified branding between the network and its divisions to strengthen brand awareness across platforms. The two main components of the rebranding are a &quot;deconstructed eye&quot; motif using the individual shapes of the eyemark (such as an animated station ID), and a five-note sound trademark developed by the audio design agency Antfood, phonetically resembling the &quot;This is CBS&quot; slogan.

Alongside the rebranding, CBS Television Studios was renamed CBS Studios, and CBS Television Distribution was renamed CBS Media Ventures. The network also dropped the &quot;America&#x27;s Most Watched Network&quot; and &quot;Only CBS&quot; taglines, with chief marketing officer Michael Benson explaining that they aimed to &quot;be something where people feel like they are part of the family. It&#x27;s tough to unify if you&#x27;re bragging about yourself.&quot;

As part of the rebranding, CBS News and CBS Sports also introduced new logos and imaging incorporating the deconstructed eye motif and sonic branding, with CBS News initially using it for coverage of the 2020 presidential election, and CBS Sports launching its rebrand ahead of Super Bowl LV in 2021. In December 2022, CBS News and Stations began to deploy the rebranding on the local news operations of CBS&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations, with most now being branded as &quot;CBS News (region)&quot; to align themselves with CBS News and its chain of local streaming news channels (with some exceptions in markets where a station&#x27;s call sign has had a strong heritage, such as KPIX) and adopting new graphics and music incorporating the eye motif and sound mark (replacing Frank Gari&#x27;s &quot;Enforcer&quot; music package, which was based on a theme historically used by WBBM-TV).

==International broadcasts==

CBS programs are shown outside the United States: through various Paramount Global international networks and/or content agreements, and in two North American countries, through U.S.-based CBS stations. Sky News broadcasts the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; on its channels serving the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Italy.

===Canada===
In Canada, CBS network programming is carried on cable, satellite, and IPTV providers through affiliates and owned-and-operated stations of the network that are located within proximity to the Canada–United States border (such as KIRO-TV in Seattle; KBJR-DT2 in Duluth, Minnesota: WWJ-TV in Detroit; WIVB-TV in Buffalo, New York; and WCAX-TV in Burlington, Vermont), some of which may also be receivable over-the-air in parts of southern Canada depending on the signal coverage of the station. Most programming is generally the same as it airs in the United States; however, some CBS programming on U.S.-based affiliates permitted for carriage by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission by Canadian cable and satellite providers are subject to simultaneous substitutions, a practice in which a pay television provider supplants an American station&#x27;s signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue.

===Bermuda===
In Bermuda, CBS maintains an affiliation with Hamilton-based ZBM-TV, locally owned by Bermuda Broadcasting Company.

===Mexico===
CBS programming is available in Mexico through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the Mexico–United States border (such as KYMA-DT/Yuma, Arizona; KVTV/Laredo, Texas; KDBC-TV/El Paso, Texas; KVEO-DT2/Brownsville/Harlingen/McAllen, Texas; and KFMB-TV/San Diego), whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico.

===Central America, the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean===
In Central America, the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean, many subscription providers carry either select U.S.-based CBS-affiliated stations or the main network feed from CBS O&amp;Os WCBS-TV in New York City or WFOR-TV in Miami. In addition, network&#x27;s programming has been available in the U.S. Virgin Islands since 2019 on WCVI-TV in Christiansted (owned by Lilly Broadcasting).

===Peru===
In Peru, many subscription providers carry either select U.S.-based CBS-affiliated stations or the main network feed from CBS O&amp;Os WCBS-TV in New York City or WFOR-TV in Miami.

===Colombia===
In Colombia, many subscription providers carry either select U.S.-based CBS-affiliated stations or the main network feed from CBS O&amp;Os WCBS-TV in New York City or WFOR-TV in Miami.

===Guam===
In the U.S. territory of Guam, the network is affiliated with low-power station KUAM-LP in Hagåtña. Entertainment and non-breaking news programming is shown day and date on a one-day broadcast delay, as Guam is located on the west side of the International Date Line (for example, &quot;NCIS&quot;, which airs on Tuesday nights, is carried on Wednesdays on KUAM-LP, and is advertised by the station as airing on the latter night in on-air promotions), with live programming and breaking news coverage airing as scheduled, meaning live sports coverage often airs early in the morning.

===Puerto Rico===
In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, CBS is carried through a special feed of Erie, Pennsylvania affiliate WSEE-TV, relayed via Mayagüez-based translator W22FA-D.

===United Kingdom===
On September 14, 2009, the international arm of CBS, CBS Studios International, reached a joint venture deal with Chellomedia to launch six CBS-branded channels in the United Kingdom – which would respectively replace Zone Romantica, Zone Thriller, Zone Horror, and Zone Reality, as well as timeshift services Zone Horror +1 and Zone Reality +1 – during the fourth quarter of that year. On October 1, 2009, it was announced that the first four channels, CBS Reality, CBS Reality +1, CBS Drama, and CBS Action (later CBS Justice), would launch on November 16 respectively replacing Zone Reality, Zone Reality +1, Zone Romantica and Zone Thriller. On April 5, 2010, Zone Horror and Zone Horror +1 were rebranded as Horror Channel and Horror Channel +1.

CBS News and BBC News have maintained a news-sharing agreement since 2017, replacing the BBC&#x27;s longtime agreement with ABC News and CBS&#x27; with Sky News (which would have ended in any event in 2018 due to that entity&#x27;s purchase by NBCUniversal).

As of the close of the Viacom merger on December 4, 2019, Channel 5 is now a sister operation to CBS, though no major changes to CBS&#x27; relationship with the BBC are expected shortly, as Channel 5 sub-contracts its news programming obligations to ITN.

===Australia===
Australian free-to-air broadcaster Ten Network Holdings has been owned by CBS Corporation since 2017 (and subsequently, Paramount Global). Network Ten&#x27;s channels, 10, 10 Peach, 10 Bold, and Nickelodeon, all carry CBS programming, with the latter drawing extensively from the wider Paramount Global library including MTV and Nickelodeon. Before the acquisition, CBS had long been a major supplier of international programs to the network. The cost of maintaining program supply agreements with CBS and 21st Century Fox was a major factor in the network&#x27;s unprofitability during the mid-2010s. Network Ten entered voluntary administration in June 2017. CBS Corporation was the network&#x27;s largest creditor. CBS Corporation chose to acquire the network, completing the transaction in November 2017.

===Asia===

====Hong Kong====
In Hong Kong, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; was broadcast live during the early morning hours on ATV; networks in that country maintain an agreement to rebroadcast portions of the program 12 hours after the initial broadcast to provide additional content in case their affiliates have insufficient news content to fill time during their local news programs.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; is broadcast on satellite network Q (a sister channel of GMA Network which is now GTV), while &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; is shown in that country on Lifestyle (now Metro Channel). Several CBS entertainment programs such as &quot;CSI&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;Survivor&quot; Series are broadcast by Studio 23 (now S+A) and Maxxx, which are both owned by ABS-CBN Corporation. 60 Minutes is currently broadcast on CNN Philippines as a part of their Stories block, which includes documentaries and is broadcast on Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. before CNN Philippines Nightly News with replays in a capacity as a stand-alone program on Saturdays at 8:00 a.m. &amp; 5:00 pm and Sundays at 6:00 a.m, all in local time (UTC + 8).

====India====
In India, CBS maintained a brand licensing agreement with Reliance Broadcast Network Ltd. for three CBS-branded channels: Big CBS Prime, Big CBS Spark, and Big CBS Love. These channels were shut down in late November 2013. Following the CBS-Viacom merger, the Hindi-language general entertainment channel Colors TV became a sister network to CBS through the Viacom18 joint venture with TV18.

====Israel====
In Israel, in 2012 the channels Zone Reality and Zone Romantica were rebranded as CBS Reality and CBS Drama, respectively. The channels were carried by Israeli television providers Yes and Hot, although they both only carry CBS Reality.

==Controversies==

===Brown &amp; Williamson interview===
In 1995, CBS refused to air a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment that featured an interview with a former president of research and development for Brown &amp; Williamson, the U.S.&#x27;s third largest tobacco company. The controversy raised questions about the legal roles in decision-making and whether journalistic standards should be compromised despite legal pressures and threats. The decision nevertheless sent shockwaves throughout the television industry, the journalism community, and the country. This incident was the basis for the 1999 Michael Mann-directed drama film, &quot;The Insider&quot;.

===Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy===

In 2004, the Federal Communications Commission imposed a record $550,000 fine, the largest fine ever for a violation of federal decency laws, against CBS for an incident during its broadcast of Super Bowl XXXVIII in which singer Janet Jackson&#x27;s right breast (which was partially covered by a piece of nipple jewelry) was briefly and accidentally exposed by guest performer Justin Timberlake at the end of a duet performance of Timberlake&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; during the halftime show (produced by then sister cable network MTV). Following the incident, CBS apologized to its viewers and denied foreknowledge of the incident, which was televised live. The incident resulted in a period of increased regulation of broadcast television and radio outlets (including self-imposed content regulation by networks and syndicators), which raised concerns surrounding censorship and freedom of speech, and resulted in the FCC voting to increase its maximum fine for indecency violations from US$27,500 to US$325,000. In 2008, a Philadelphia federal court annulled the fine imposed on CBS, labeling it &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot;.

===Killian documents controversy===

On September 8, 2004, less than two months before the Presidential election in which he defeated Democratic candidate John Kerry, CBS aired a controversial episode of &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;, which questioned then-President George W. Bush&#x27;s service in the Air National Guard in 1972 and 1973. Following allegations of forgery, CBS News admitted that four of the documents used in the story had not been properly authenticated and admitted that their source, Bill Burkett, had admitted to having &quot;deliberately misled&quot; a CBS News producer who worked on the report, about the documents&#x27; origins out of a confidentiality promise to the actual source. The following January, CBS fired four people connected to the preparation of the segment. Former CBS news anchor Dan Rather filed a $70 million lawsuit against CBS and former corporate parent Viacom in September 2007, contending the story, and his termination (he resigned as CBS News chief anchor in 2005), were mishandled. Parts of the suit were dismissed in 2008; subsequently in 2010, the entire suit was dismissed and Rather&#x27;s motion to appeal was denied.

===Hopper controversy===

In January 2013, CNET named Dish Network&#x27;s &quot;Hopper with Sling&quot; digital video recorder as a nominee for the CES &quot;Best in Show&quot; award (which is decided by CNET on behalf of its organizers, the Consumer Electronics Association), and named it the winner in a vote by the site&#x27;s staff. However, CBS division CBS Interactive disqualified the Hopper and vetoed the results as CBS was in active litigation with Dish Network over its AutoHop technology (which allows users to skip commercial advertisements during recorded programs). CNET announced that it would no longer review any product or service provided by companies that CBS Corporation was in litigation with. The &quot;Best in Show&quot; award was instead given to the Razer Edge tablet. On January 14, 2013, CNET editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine said in a statement that its staff was in an &quot;impossible&quot; situation due to the conflict of interest posed by the lawsuit, and promised to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The conflict also prompted the resignation of CNET senior writer Greg Sandoval. As a result of the controversy, the CEA announced on January 31, 2013, that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (with the position being offered to other technology publications), and the &quot;Best in Show&quot; award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.

=== Harassment allegations ===
In July 2018, an article by Ronan Farrow in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; claimed that thirty &quot;current and former CBS employees described harassment, gender discrimination, or retaliation&quot; at CBS and six women accused Les Moonves of harassment and intimidation. Following these allegations, it was reported on September 6, 2018, that CBS board members were negotiating Les Moonves&#x27;s departure from the company.

On September 9, 2018, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reported that six additional women (in addition to the six original women reported in July) had raised accusations against Moonves, going back to the 1980s. Following this, Moonves resigned the same day as chief executive of CBS.

<text>Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes (), which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.

Owls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, Strigidae, and the barn owl and bay owl family, Tytonidae. Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except the polar ice caps and some remote islands.

A group of owls is called a &quot;parliament&quot;.

== Anatomy ==

Owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye. The feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls&#x27; asymmetrically placed ear cavities. Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads, but the stereoscopic nature of the owl&#x27;s forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting. Owls have binocular vision, but they must rotate their entire heads to change the focus of their view because, like most birds, their eyes are fixed in their sockets. Owls are farsighted and cannot clearly see anything nearer than a few centimetres of their eyes. Caught prey can be felt by owls with the use of filoplumes—hairlike feathers on the beak and feet that act as &quot;feelers&quot;. Their far vision, particularly in low light, is exceptionally good.

Owls can rotate their heads and necks as much as 270°. Owls have 14 neck vertebrae — humans have only seven — and their vertebral circulatory systems are adapted to allow them to rotate their heads without cutting off blood to the brain. Specifically, the foramina in their vertebrae through which the vertebral arteries pass are about ten times the diameter of the artery, instead of about the same size as the artery, as is the case in humans; the vertebral arteries enter the cervical vertebrae higher than in other birds, giving the vessels some slack, and the carotid arteries unite in a very large anastomosis or junction, the largest of any bird&#x27;s, preventing blood supply from being cut off while they rotate their necks. Other anastomoses between the carotid and vertebral arteries support this effect.

The smallest owl—weighing as little as and measuring some —is the elf owl (&quot;Micrathene whitneyi&quot;). Around the same diminutive length, although slightly heavier, are the lesser known long-whiskered owlet (&quot;Xenoglaux loweryi&quot;) and Tamaulipas pygmy owl (&quot;Glaucidium sanchezi&quot;). The largest owls are two similarly sized eagle owls; the Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) and Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl (&quot;Bubo blakistoni&quot;). The largest females of these species are long, have a wing span, and weigh .

Different species of owls produce different sounds; this distribution of calls aids owls in finding mates or announcing their presence to potential competitors, and also aids ornithologists and birders in locating these birds and distinguishing species. As noted above, their facial discs help owls to funnel the sound of prey to their ears. In many species, these discs are placed asymmetrically, for better directional location.

Owl plumage is generally cryptic, although several species have facial and head markings, including face masks, ear tufts, and brightly colored irises. These markings are generally more common in species inhabiting open habitats, and are thought to be used in signaling with other owls in low-light conditions.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===

Sexual dimorphism is a physical difference between males and females of a species. Female owls are typically larger than the males. The degree of size dimorphism varies across multiple populations and species, and is measured through various traits, such as wing span and body mass.

One theory suggests that selection has led males to be smaller because it allows them to be efficient foragers. The ability to obtain more food is advantageous during breeding season. In some species, female owls stay at their nest with their eggs while it is the responsibility of the male to bring back food to the nest. If food is scarce, the male first feeds himself before feeding the female. Small birds, which are agile, are an important source of food for owls. Male burrowing owls have been observed to have longer wing chords than females, despite being smaller than females. Furthermore, owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey. This has also been observed in other predatory birds, which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.

Another popular theory suggests that females have not been selected to be smaller like male owls because of their sexual roles. In many species, female owls may not leave the nest. Therefore, females may have a larger mass to allow them to go for a longer period of time without starving. For example, one hypothesized sexual role is that larger females are more capable of dismembering prey and feeding it to their young, hence female owls are larger than their male counterparts.

A different theory suggests that the size difference between male and females is due to sexual selection: since large females can choose their mate and may violently reject a male&#x27;s sexual advances, smaller male owls that have the ability to escape unreceptive females are more likely to have been selected.

If the character is stable, there can be different optimums for both sexes. Selection operates on both sexes at the same time; therefore it is necessary to explain not only why one of the sexes is relatively bigger, but also why the other sex is smaller. If owls are still evolving toward smaller bodies and longer wing chords, according to V. Geodakyan&#x27;s Evolutionary Theory of Sex, males should be more advanced on these characters. Males are viewed as an evolutionary vanguard of a population, and sexual dimorphism on the character, as an evolutionary &quot;distance&quot; between the sexes. &quot;Phylogenetic rule of sexual dimorphism&quot; states that if there exists a sexual dimorphism on any character, then the evolution of this trait goes from the female form toward the male one.

=== Hunting adaptations ===
All owls are carnivorous birds of prey and live on diets of insects, small rodents and lagomorphs. Some owls are also specifically adapted to hunt fish. They are very adept in hunting in their respective environments. Since owls can be found in nearly all parts of the world and across a multitude of ecosystems, their hunting skills and characteristics vary slightly from species to species, though most characteristics are shared among all species.

==== Flight and feathers ====

Most owls share an innate ability to fly almost silently and also more slowly in comparison to other birds of prey. Most owls live a mainly nocturnal lifestyle and being able to fly without making any noise gives them a strong advantage over prey alert to the slightest sound in the night. A silent, slow flight is not as necessary for diurnal and crepuscular owls given that prey can usually see an owl approaching. Owls&#x27; feathers are generally larger than the average birds&#x27; feathers, have fewer radiates, longer pennulum, and achieve smooth edges with different rachis structures. Serrated edges along the owl&#x27;s remiges bring the flapping of the wing down to a nearly silent mechanism. The serrations are more likely reducing aerodynamic disturbances, rather than simply reducing noise. The surface of the flight feathers is covered with a velvety structure that absorbs the sound of the wing moving. These unique structures reduce noise frequencies above 2 kHz, making the sound level emitted drop below the typical hearing spectrum of the owl&#x27;s usual prey and also within the owl&#x27;s own best hearing range. This optimizes the owl&#x27;s ability to silently fly to capture prey without the prey hearing the owl first as it flies, and to hear any noise the prey makes. It also allows the owl to monitor the sound output from its flight pattern.
The disadvantage of such feather adaptations for barn owls is that their feathers are not waterproof. The adaptations mean that barn owls do not use the uropygial gland, informally the &quot;preen&quot; or &quot;oil&quot; gland, as most birds do, to spread oils across their plumage through preening. This makes them highly vulnerable to heavy rain when they are unable to hunt. Historically, they would switch to hunting indoors in wet weather, using barns and other agricultural buildings, but the decline in the numbers of these structures in the 20th and 21st centuries has reduced such opportunities. The lack of waterproofing means that barn owls are also susceptible to drowning, in drinking troughs and other structures with smooth sides. The Barn Owl Trust provides advice on how this can be mitigated, by the installation of floats.

==== Vision ====
Eyesight is a particular characteristic of the owl that aids in nocturnal prey capture. Owls are part of a small group of birds that live nocturnally, but do not use echolocation to guide them in flight in low-light situations. Owls are known for their disproportionally large eyes in comparison to their skulls. An apparent consequence of the evolution of an absolutely large eye in a relatively small skull is that the eye of the owl has become tubular in shape. This shape is found in other so-called nocturnal eyes, such as the eyes of strepsirrhine primates and bathypelagic fishes. Since the eyes are fixed into these sclerotic tubes, they are unable to move the eyes in any direction. Instead of moving their eyes, owls swivel their heads to view their surroundings. Owls&#x27; heads are capable of swiveling through an angle of roughly 270°, easily enabling them to see behind them without relocating the torso. This ability keeps bodily movement at a minimum, thus reduces the amount of sound the owl makes as it waits for its prey. Owls are regarded as having the most frontally placed eyes among all avian groups, which gives them some of the largest binocular fields of vision. Owls are farsighted and cannot focus on objects within a few centimetres of their eyes. These mechanisms are only able to function due to the large-sized retinal image. Thus, the primary nocturnal function in the vision of the owl is due to its large posterior nodal distance; retinal image brightness is only maximized to the owl within secondary neural functions. These attributes of the owl cause its nocturnal eyesight to be far superior to that of its average prey.

==== Hearing ====

Owls exhibit specialized hearing functions and ear shapes that also aid in hunting. They are noted for asymmetrical ear placements on the skull in some genera. Owls can have either internal or external ears, both of which are asymmetrical. Asymmetry has not been reported to extend to the middle or internal ear of the owl. Asymmetrical ear placement on the skull allows the owl to pinpoint the location of its prey. This is especially true for strictly nocturnal species such as the barn owls &quot;Tyto&quot; or Tengmalm&#x27;s owl. With ears set at different places on its skull, an owl is able to determine the direction from which the sound is coming by the minute difference in time that it takes for the sound waves to penetrate the left and right ears. The owl turns its head until the sound reaches both ears at the same time, at which point it is directly facing the source of the sound. This time difference between ears is about 30 microseconds. Behind the ear openings are modified, dense feathers, densely packed to form a facial ruff, which creates an anterior-facing, concave wall that cups the sound into the ear structure. This facial ruff is poorly defined in some species, and prominent, nearly encircling the face, in other species. The facial disk also acts to direct sound into the ears, and a downward-facing, sharply triangular beak minimizes sound reflection away from the face. The shape of the facial disk is adjustable at will to focus sounds more effectively.

The prominences above a great horned owl&#x27;s head are commonly mistaken as its ears. This is not the case; they are merely feather tufts. The ears are on the sides of the head in the usual location (in two different locations as described above).

==== Talons ====
While the auditory and visual capabilities of the owl allow it to locate and pursue its prey, the talons and beak of the owl do the final work. The owl kills its prey using these talons to crush the skull and knead the body. The crushing power of an owl&#x27;s talons varies according to prey size and type, and by the size of the owl. The burrowing owl (&quot;Athene cunicularia&quot;), a small, partly insectivorous owl, has a release force of only 5 N. The larger barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;) needs a force of 30 N to release its prey, and one of the largest owls, the great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), needs a force over 130 N to release prey in its talons. An owl&#x27;s talons, like those of most birds of prey, can seem massive in comparison to the body size outside of flight. The Tasmanian masked owl has some of the proportionally longest talons of any bird of prey; they appear enormous in comparison to the body when fully extended to grasp prey. An owl&#x27;s claws are sharp and curved. The family Tytonidae has inner and central toes of about equal length, while the family Strigidae has an inner toe that is distinctly shorter than the central one. These different morphologies allow efficiency in capturing prey specific to the different environments they inhabit.

==== Beak ====
The beak of the owl is short, curved, and downward-facing, and typically hooked at the tip for gripping and tearing its prey. Once prey is captured, the scissor motion of the top and lower bill is used to tear the tissue and kill. The sharp lower edge of the upper bill works in coordination with the sharp upper edge of the lower bill to deliver this motion. The downward-facing beak allows the owl&#x27;s field of vision to be clear, as well as directing sound into the ears without deflecting sound waves away from the face.

==== Camouflage ====
The coloration of the owl&#x27;s plumage plays a key role in its ability to sit still and blend into the environment, making it nearly invisible to prey. Owls tend to mimic the coloration and sometimes the texture patterns of their surroundings, the barn owl being an exception. The snowy owl (&quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;) appears nearly bleach-white in color with a few flecks of black, mimicking their snowy surroundings perfectly, while the speckled brown plumage of the tawny owl (&quot;Strix aluco&quot;) allows it to lie in wait among the deciduous woodland it prefers for its habitat. Likewise, the mottled wood owl (&quot;Strix ocellata&quot;) displays shades of brown, tan, and black, making the owl nearly invisible in the surrounding trees, especially from behind. Usually, the only tell-tale sign of a perched owl is its vocalizations or its vividly colored eyes.

== Behavior ==
 
Most owls are nocturnal, actively hunting their prey in darkness. Several types of owls are crepuscular—active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk; one example is the pygmy owl (&quot;Glaucidium&quot;). A few owls are active during the day, also; examples are the burrowing owl (&quot;Speotyto cunicularia&quot;) and the short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;).

Much of the owls&#x27; hunting strategy depends on stealth and surprise. Owls have at least two adaptations that aid them in achieving stealth. First, the dull coloration of their feathers can render them almost invisible under certain conditions. Secondly, serrated edges on the leading edge of owls&#x27; remiges muffle an owl&#x27;s wing beats, allowing an owl&#x27;s flight to be practically silent. Some fish-eating owls, for which silence has no evolutionary advantage, lack this adaptation.

An owl&#x27;s sharp beak and powerful talons allow it to kill its prey before swallowing it whole (if it is not too big). Scientists studying the diets of owls are helped by their habit of regurgitating the indigestible parts of their prey (such as bones, scales, and fur) in the form of pellets. These &quot;owl pellets&quot; are plentiful and easy to interpret, and are often sold by companies to schools for dissection by students as a lesson in biology and ecology.

=== Breeding and reproduction ===
Owl eggs typically have a white color and an almost spherical shape, and range in number from a few to a dozen, depending on species and the particular season; for most, three or four is the more common number. In at least one species, female owls do not mate with the same male for a lifetime. Female burrowing owls commonly travel and find other mates, while the male stays in his territory and mates with other females.

== Evolution and systematics ==

Recent phylogenetic studies place owls within the clade Telluraves, most closely related to the Accipitrimorphae and the Coraciimorphae, although the exact placement within Telluraves is disputed.

See below cladogram:

Cladogram of Telluraves relationships based on Braun &amp; Kimball (2021)

Some 220 to 225 extant species of owls are known, subdivided into two families: 1. true owls or typical owls family (Strigidae) and 2. barn-owls family (Tytonidae). Some entirely extinct families have also been erected based on fossil remains; these differ much from modern owls in being less specialized or specialized in a very different way (such as the terrestrial Sophiornithidae). The Paleocene genera &quot;Berruornis&quot; and &quot;Ogygoptynx&quot; show that owls were already present as a distinct lineage some 60–57 million years ago (Mya), hence, possibly also some 5 million years earlier, at the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. This makes them one of the oldest known groups of non-Galloanserae landbirds. The supposed &quot;Cretaceous owls&quot; &quot;Bradycneme&quot; and &quot;Heptasteornis&quot; are apparently non-avialan maniraptors.

During the Paleogene, the Strigiformes radiated into ecological niches now mostly filled by other groups of birds. The owls as known today, though, evolved their characteristic morphology and adaptations during that time, too. By the early Neogene, the other lineages had been displaced by other bird orders, leaving only barn owls and typical owls. The latter at that time was usually a fairly generic type of (probably earless) owl similar to today&#x27;s North American spotted owl or the European tawny owl; the diversity in size and ecology found in typical owls today developed only subsequently.

Around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary (some 25 Mya), barn owls were the dominant group of owls in southern Europe and adjacent Asia at least; the distribution of fossil and present-day owl lineages indicates that their decline is contemporary with the evolution of the different major lineages of true owls, which for the most part seems to have taken place in Eurasia. In the Americas, rather, an expansion of immigrant lineages of ancestral typical owls occurred.

The supposed fossil herons &quot;&quot;Ardea&quot; perplexa&quot; (Middle Miocene of Sansan, France) and &quot;&quot;Ardea&quot; lignitum&quot; (Late Pliocene of Germany) were more probably owls; the latter was apparently close to the modern genus &quot;Bubo&quot;. Judging from this, the Late Miocene remains from France described as &quot;&quot;Ardea&quot; aureliensis&quot; should also be restudied. The Messelasturidae, some of which were initially believed to be basal Strigiformes, are now generally accepted to be diurnal birds of prey showing some convergent evolution toward owls. The taxa often united under &quot;Strigogyps&quot; were formerly placed in part with the owls, specifically the Sophiornithidae; they appear to be Ameghinornithidae instead.

== Symbolism and mythology ==
Among the Kikuyu of Kenya, it was believed that owls were harbingers of death. If one saw an owl or heard its hoot, someone was going to die. In general, owls are viewed as harbingers of bad luck, ill health, or death. The belief is widespread even today.
In Hinduism, an owl is the &quot;vahana&quot; (mount) of the goddess Lakshmi, especially in the eastern region of India. Owls are considered a symbol of wealth, prosperity, wisdom, good luck, and fortune. This is the reason why Owls are seen with Lakshmi, who is also the goddess of fortune, wealth, and prosperity. At the same time, owls are also associated with evil times in Hinduism. At times, Chamunda (fearsome form of Chandi) is depicted seated on an owl, her vahana (mount or vehicle). Hindus believe that owls are messengers of death. In China, owls were traditionally considered to be omens of evil or misfortune. In Japan, owls are regarded as lucky, although in ancient times they were associated with death.

In Sumerian, Akkadian, and Babylonian culture, the owl was associated with Lilith.

The modern West generally associates owls with wisdom and vigilance. This link goes back at least as far as Ancient Greece, where Athens, noted for art and scholarship, and Athena, Athens&#x27; patron goddess and the goddess of wisdom, had the owl as a symbol. Marija Gimbutas traces veneration of the owl as a goddess, among other birds, to the culture of Old Europe, long pre-dating Indo-European cultures.

In medieval Europe, the owl was often used with more negative symbolism. The bird was associated with darkness, uncleanliness, and mourning. The bird was linked to the bubonic plague. Owls were even used as anti-Semetic caricatures of Jews.

T. F. Thiselton-Dyer, in his 1883 &quot;Folk-lore of Shakespeare&quot;, says that from the earliest period it has been considered a bird of ill-omen,&quot; and Pliny tells us how, on one occasion, even Rome itself underwent a lustration, because one of them strayed into the Capitol. He represents it also as a funereal bird, a monster of the night, the very abomination of humankind. Virgil describes its death howl from the top of the temple by night, a circumstance introduced as a precursor of Dido&#x27;s death. Ovid, too, constantly speaks of this bird&#x27;s presence as an evil omen; and indeed the same notions respecting it may be found among the writings of most of the ancient poets.
=== Native American cultures ===
People often allude to the reputation of owls as bearers of supernatural danger when they tell misbehaving children, &quot;the owls will get you&quot;, and in most Native American folklore, owls are a symbol of death.

According to the Apache and Seminole tribes, hearing owls hooting is considered the subject of numerous &quot;bogeyman&quot; stories told to warn children to remain indoors at night or not to cry too much, otherwise the owl may carry them away. In some tribal legends, owls are associated with spirits of the dead, and the bony circles around an owl&#x27;s eyes are said to comprise the fingernails of apparitional humans. Sometimes owls are said to carry messages from beyond the grave or deliver supernatural warnings to people who have broken tribal taboos.

The Aztecs and the Maya, along with other natives of Mesoamerica, considered the owl a symbol of death and destruction. In fact, the Aztec god of death, Mictlantecuhtli, was often depicted with owls. There is an old saying in Mexico that is still in use: &quot;Cuando el tecolote canta, el indio muere&quot; (&quot;When the owl cries/sings, the Indian dies&quot;). The &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, a Mayan religious text, describes owls as messengers of Xibalba (the Mayan &quot;Place of Fright&quot;).

The belief that owls are messengers and harbingers of the dark powers is also found among the Hočągara (Winnebago) of Wisconsin. When in earlier days the Hočągara committed the sin of killing enemies while they were within the sanctuary of the chief&#x27;s lodge, an owl appeared and spoke to them in the voice of a human, saying, &quot;From now on, the Hočągara will have no luck.&quot; This marked the beginning of the decline of their tribe. An owl appeared to Glory of the Morning, the only female chief of the Hočąk nation, and uttered her name. Soon after, she died.

According to the culture of the Hopi, a Uto-Aztec tribe, taboos surround owls, which are associated with sorcery and other evils.

The Ojibwe tribes, as well as their Aboriginal Canadian counterparts, used an owl as a symbol for both evil and death. In addition, they used owls as a symbol of very high status of spiritual leaders of their spirituality.

The Pawnee tribes viewed owls as the symbol of protection from any danger within their realms.

The Puebloan peoples associated owls with Skeleton Man, the god of death and the spirit of fertility.

The Yakama tribes use an owl as a totem, to guide where and how forests and natural resources are useful with management.

== Rodent control ==
Encouraging natural predators to control rodent population is a natural form of pest control, along with excluding food sources for rodents. Placing a nest box for owls on a property can help control rodent populations (one family of hungry barn owls can consume more than 3,000 rodents in a nesting season) while maintaining the naturally balanced food chain.

==Attacks on humans==
Although humans and owls frequently live together in harmony, there have been incidents when owls have attacked humans. For example, in January 2013, a man from Inverness, Scotland suffered heavy bleeding and went into shock after being attacked by an owl, which was likely a eagle-owl. The photographer Eric Hosking lost his left eye after attempting to photograph a tawny owl, which inspired the title of his 1970 autobiography, &quot;An Eye for a Bird&quot;.

== Conservation issues ==


Almost all owls are listed in Appendix II of the international CITES treaty (the Convention on Illegal Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) with four species listed in Appendix I. Although owls have long been hunted, a 2008 news story from Malaysia indicates that the magnitude of owl poaching may be on the rise. In November 2008, TRAFFIC reported the seizure of 900 plucked and &quot;oven-ready&quot; owls in Peninsular Malaysia. Said Chris Shepherd, Senior Programme Officer for TRAFFIC&#x27;s Southeast Asia office, &quot;This is the first time we know of where &#x27;ready-prepared&#x27; owls have been seized in Malaysia, and it may mark the start of a new trend in wild meat from the region. We will be monitoring developments closely.&quot; TRAFFIC commended the Department of Wildlife and National Parks in Malaysia for the raid that exposed the huge haul of owls. Included in the seizure were dead and plucked barn owls, spotted wood owls, crested serpent eagles, barred eagles, and brown wood owls, as well as 7,000 live lizards.

In addition to hunting, other threats to owl populations are habitat loss, pesticides, viruses, and vehicle collisions.

<text>Concurrent Versions System (CVS, or Concurrent Versioning System) is a version control system originally developed by Dick Grune in July 1986.

== Design ==

CVS operates as a front end to Revision Control System (RCS), an older version control system that manages individual files but not whole projects. It expands upon RCS by adding support for repository-level change tracking, and a client-server model. Files are tracked using the same history format as in RCS, with a hidden directory containing a corresponding history file for each file in the repository.

CVS uses delta compression for efficient storage of different versions of the same file. This works well with large text files with few changes from one version to the next. This is usually the case for source code files. On the other hand, when CVS is told to store a file as binary, it will keep each individual version on the server. This is typically used for non-text files such as executable images where it is difficult to create compact deltas between versions.

CVS excludes symbolic links because when they are stored in a version control system they can pose a security risk. For instance, a symbolic link to a sensitive file can be stored in the repository, making the sensitive file accessible even when it is not checked in. In place of symbolic links, scripts that require certain privileges and conscious intervention to execute may be checked into CVS.

== Operation ==

CVS labels a single project (set of related files) that it manages as a &quot;module&quot;. A CVS server stores the modules it manages in its &quot;repository&quot;. Programmers acquire copies of modules by &quot;checking out&quot;. The checked-out files serve as a &quot;working copy&quot;, &quot;sandbox&quot; or &quot;workspace&quot;. Changes to the working copy are reflected in the repository by &quot;committing&quot; them. To &quot;update&quot; is to acquire or &quot;merge&quot; the changes in the repository with the working copy.

CVS uses a client–server architecture: a server stores the current version(s) of a project and its history, and clients connect to the server in order to &quot;check out&quot; a complete copy of the project, work on this copy and then later &quot;check in&quot; their changes. CVS servers can allow &quot;anonymous read access&quot;, wherein clients may check out and compare versions with either a blank or simple published password (e.g., &quot;anoncvs&quot;); only the check-in of changes requires a personal account and password in these scenarios. Several developers may work on the same project concurrently, each one editing files within their own &quot;working copy&quot; of the project, and sending (or &quot;checking in&quot;) their modifications to the server. To avoid conflicts, the server only accepts changes made to the most recent version of a file. Developers are therefore expected to keep their working copy up-to-date by incorporating other people&#x27;s changes on a regular basis. This task is mostly handled automatically by the CVS client, requiring manual intervention only when an edit conflict arises between a checked-in modification and the yet-unchecked local version of a file. Clients can also use the &quot;update&quot; command to bring their local copies up-to-date with the newest version on the server. Clients can also compare versions, request a complete history of changes, or check out a historical snapshot of the project (e.g.: based on a given date). If the check-in operation succeeds, then the version numbers of all files involved automatically increment, and the server writes a user-supplied description line, the date and the author&#x27;s name to its log files. CVS can also run external, user-specified log processing scripts following each commit. These scripts are installed by an entry in CVS&#x27;s codice_1 file, which can trigger email notification or convert the log data into a Web-based format.

CVS can also maintain different &quot;branches&quot; of a project. For instance, a released version of the software project may form one branch, used for bug fixes, while a version under current development, with major changes and new features, can form a separate branch. CVS assumes that the majority of work takes place on the trunk, and that branches should generally be short-lived or historical. When used as designed, branches are easily managed and branch operations are efficient and fast.

== Portability ==

The server software normally runs on Unix (although at least the CVSNT server also supports various flavors of Microsoft Windows), while CVS clients may run on any major operating system platform.

== History ==
Grune recalled:
Grune publicly released the code on June 23, 1986.

The code that eventually evolved into the current version of CVS started with Brian Berliner in April 1989, with later input from Jeff Polk and many other contributors. Brian Berliner wrote a paper introducing his improvements to the CVS program—which describes how the tool was extended and used internally by Prisma, a third-party developer working on the SunOS kernel, and was released for the benefit of the community under the GPL. On November 19, 1990, CVS version 1.0 was submitted to the Free Software Foundation for development and distribution.

The latest version was released on 8 May 2008.

== Adoption and successors ==

Over time, developers have created new version control systems based on CVS in order to add features, alter the operational model, and improve developers&#x27; productivity. CVS replacement projects include CVSNT and Subversion.

<text>Alfred Charles Kinsey (; June 23, 1894 – August 25, 1956) was an American sexologist, biologist, and professor of entomology and zoology who, in 1947, founded the Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University, now known as the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. He is best known for writing &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; (1948) and &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; (1953), also known as the Kinsey Reports, as well as for the Kinsey scale. Kinsey&#x27;s research on human sexuality, foundational to the field of sexology, provoked controversy in the 1940s and 1950s, and has continued to provoke controversy decades after his death. His work has influenced social and cultural values in the United States as well as internationally.

==Early life and education==

Alfred Kinsey was born on June 23, 1894, in Hoboken, New Jersey, the son of Sarah Ann ( Charles) and Alfred Seguine Kinsey. He was the eldest of three children. His mother received little formal education; his father was a professor at Stevens Institute of Technology.

Kinsey&#x27;s parents were devout Christians. His father was known as one of the most devout members of the local Methodist church. Most of Kinsey&#x27;s social interactions were with other members of the church, often as a silent observer, while his parents discussed religion. Kinsey&#x27;s father imposed strict rules on the household, including mandating Sunday as a day of prayer and little else.

Kinsey&#x27;s parents were poor for most of his childhood, often unable to afford proper medical care. This may have led to a young Kinsey receiving inadequate treatment for a variety of diseases including rickets, rheumatic fever, and typhoid fever. His health records indicate that Kinsey received suboptimal exposure to sunlight (often the cause of rickets, before milk and other foods were fortified with vitamin D) and lived in unsanitary conditions for at least part of his childhood. Rickets led to a curvature of the spine, which resulted in a slight stoop that prevented Kinsey from being drafted in 1917 for World War I.

At age 10, Kinsey moved with his family to South Orange, New Jersey. Also at a young age, he showed great interest in nature and camping. He worked and camped with the local YMCA throughout his early years, and enjoyed these activities to such an extent that he intended to work for the YMCA after completing his education. Kinsey&#x27;s senior undergraduate thesis for psychology, a dissertation on the group dynamics of young boys, echoed this interest. He joined the Boy Scouts when a troop was formed in his community. His parents strongly supported this (and joined as well) because the Boy Scouts was an organization that was based on the principles of Christianity. Kinsey worked his way up through the Scouting ranks to earn Eagle Scout in 1913, making him one of the earliest Eagle Scouts. Despite earlier disease having weakened his heart, Kinsey followed an intense sequence of difficult hikes and camping expeditions throughout his early life.

In high school, Kinsey was a quiet but hard-working student. While attending Columbia High School, he devoted his energy to academic work and playing the piano. At one time, Kinsey had hoped to become a concert pianist, but decided to concentrate on his scientific pursuits instead. Kinsey&#x27;s ability to spend immense amounts of time deeply focused on study was a trait that would serve him well in college and during his professional career. He seems not to have formed strong social relationships during high school, but earned respect for his academic ability. While there, Kinsey became interested in biology, botany and zoology. Kinsey was later to claim that his high school biology teacher, Natalie Roeth, was the most important influence on his decision to become a scientist.

Kinsey approached his father with plans to study botany at college. His father demanded that he study engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology instead. At Stevens, he primarily took courses related to English and engineering, but was unable to satisfy his interest in biology. Kinsey was not successful there, and decided engineering was not a field at which he could excel. At the end of two years at Stevens, Kinsey gathered the courage to confront his father about his interest in biology and his intent to continue studying at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where he majored in biology.

==Initial research on entomology==
In the fall of 1914, Kinsey entered Bowdoin College, where he studied entomology under Manton Copeland, and was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity, in whose house he lived for much of his time at college. In 1916 Kinsey was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society and graduated magna cum laude, with degrees in biology and psychology. Alfred Seguine Kinsey did not attend his son&#x27;s graduation ceremony at Bowdoin, possibly as another sign of disapproval of his son&#x27;s choice of career and studies.

Kinsey continued his graduate studies at Harvard University&#x27;s Bussey Institute, which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States. It was there that Kinsey studied applied biology under William Morton Wheeler, a scientist who made outstanding contributions to entomology. Under Wheeler, Kinsey worked almost completely autonomously, which suited both men quite well.
Kinsey wrote his doctoral thesis on gall wasps, zealously collecting samples of the species. He traveled widely and took 26 detailed measurements of hundreds of thousands of gall wasps; his methodology was itself an important contribution to entomology as a science. In 1919, Kinsey was awarded a ScD degree by Harvard University, and he accepted an academic post in biology at Indiana University. In 1920 he published several papers under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, introducing the gall wasp to the scientific community and describing its phylogeny. Of the more than 18 million insects in the museum&#x27;s collection, some 5 million are gall wasps collected by Kinsey.

Kinsey wrote a widely used high-school textbook, &quot;An Introduction to Biology&quot;, which was published in October 1926. The book endorsed evolution and unified, at the introductory level, the previously separate fields of zoology and botany.
Kinsey co-authored &quot;Edible Wild Plants of Eastern North America&quot;, published in 1943, with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. The original draft of the book was written in 1919–1920, while Kinsey was still a doctoral student at the Bussey Institute, and Fernald was working at the Arnold Arboretum.

== Sexology ==

=== The Kinsey Reports ===

Kinsey is widely regarded as the first major figure in American sexology; his research helped pave the way for a deeper exploration into sexuality among sexologists and the general public, as well as liberating female sexuality. For example, Kinsey&#x27;s work disputed the notions that women generally are not sexual and that female orgasms experienced vaginally are superior to clitoral orgasms. He initially became interested in different forms of sexual practices in 1933, after discussing the topic extensively with a colleague, Robert Kroc. Kinsey had been studying the variations in mating practices among gall wasps. During this time, he developed a scale measuring sexual orientation, now known as the Kinsey scale, which ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 is exclusively heterosexual and 6 is exclusively homosexual; a rating of X for &quot;no socio-sexual contacts or reactions&quot; was later added.

In 1935, Kinsey delivered a lecture to a faculty discussion group at Indiana University, his first public discussion of the topic, wherein he attacked the &quot;widespread ignorance of sexual structure and physiology&quot; and promoted his view that &quot;delayed marriage&quot; (that is, delayed sexual experience) was psychologically harmful. Kinsey obtained research funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled him to further study human sexual behavior. He published &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; in 1948, followed in 1953 by &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot;, both of which reached the top of the bestseller lists and turned Kinsey into a celebrity. These publications later became known as the Kinsey Reports. Articles about him appeared in magazines such as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, and &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;. The Kinsey Reports, which led to a storm of controversy, are regarded by many as a precursor to the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.

=== Controversies ===
Kinsey&#x27;s research went beyond theory and interview to include observation of and participation in sexual activity, sometimes involving co-workers. Kinsey justified this sexual experimentation as being necessary to gain the confidence of his research subjects. He encouraged his staff to do likewise, and to engage in a wide range of sexual activity, to the extent that they felt comfortable; he argued that this would help his interviewers understand the participants&#x27; responses. Kinsey filmed sexual acts which included co-workers in the attic of his home as part of his research; Biographer Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy explains that this was done to ensure the films&#x27; secrecy, which would have caused a scandal had it become public knowledge. James H. Jones, author of &quot;Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life&quot;, and British psychiatrist Anthony Malcolm Daniels aka Theodore Dalrymple, among others, have speculated that Kinsey was driven by his own sexual needs.

Some of the data published in the two &quot;Kinsey Reports&quot; books is controversial in the scientific and psychiatric communities, owing to Kinsey&#x27;s decision to interview volunteers who may not have been representative of the general population. University of Chicago sociology professor Edward Laumann also argued that Kinsey&#x27;s work was focused on the biology of sex and lacked psychological and clinical information and analysis.

Kinsey collected sexual material from around the world, which brought him to the attention of the U.S. Customs Service when they seized some pornographic films in 1956; he died before this matter was resolved legally. Kinsey wrote about pre-adolescent orgasms using data in tables 30 to 34 of the male volume, which report observations of orgasms in over 300 children aged from two months up to fifteen years. This information was said to have come from adults&#x27; childhood memories, or from parent or teacher observation. Kinsey said he also interviewed nine men who had sexual experiences with children and who told him about the children&#x27;s responses and reactions. Little attention was paid to this part of Kinsey&#x27;s research at the time, but where Kinsey had gained this information began to be questioned nearly 40 years later. It was later revealed that Kinsey used data from a single pedophile and presented it as being from various sources. Kinsey had seen the need for participant confidentiality and anonymity as necessary to gain &quot;honest answers on such taboo subjects&quot;. Years later, the Kinsey Institute said that the data on children in tables 31–34 came from one man&#x27;s journal (started in 1917) and that the events concerned predated the Kinsey Reports.

These allegations have been revived by a political fight inside the Indiana State Senate, but the opposition complained that &quot;These are warmed over Internet memes that keep coming back.&quot; IndyStar remarked &quot;They cited long-held but largely debunked allegations about the work of Alfred Kinsey...&quot;.

Jones wrote that Kinsey&#x27;s sexual activity influenced his work, that he over-represented prisoners and prostitutes, classified some single people as &quot;married&quot;, and that he included a disproportionate number of homosexual men, which may have distorted his studies. While he has been criticized for omitting African-Americans from his research, his report on the human male includes numerous references to African-American participants. Historian Vern Bullough writes that the data was later reinterpreted, excluding prisoners and data derived from an exclusively gay sample, and the results indicate that it does not appear to have skewed the data. Kinsey may have over-represented homosexuals, but Bullough considers that this may have been because homosexual behavior was stigmatized and needed to be better understood. Paul Gebhard, who was Kinsey&#x27;s colleague from 1946 to 1956 and who also succeeded Kinsey as Director of the Kinsey Institute following his death, attempted to justify Kinsey&#x27;s work in the 1970s by removing some of the suspect data where Kinsey allegedly showed a bias towards homosexuality. After Gebhard recalculated the findings in Kinsey&#x27;s work, he found only slight differences between the original and updated figures.

Bailey et al., in their 2016 review of the sexual orientation literature, stated that Kinsey&#x27;s survey likely overestimated the frequencies of nonheterosexual attractions and expressions, because his statistics show a higher percentage of the American population as homosexual or bisexual than more modern studies do. However Kinsey biographer Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy states that Kinsey&#x27;s interview style was quite different from the methodologies of modern studies, something he attributes as a reason for difference of answers. Kinsey focused on in-depth interviews with subjects carried out by himself or highly trained members of his team, and emphasized creating rapport with the interviewee and making them feel comfortable and secure. Modern interviewers tend to be less thoroughly trained and emphasize scientific detachment, which may make respondents less likely to share sensitive personal details.

==Personal life==

Kinsey was raised as a Methodist, and for a time converted to a much less fundamentalist Congregationalism. During his studies at Harvard he apparently became agnostic or atheist, replacing religious fervor with fervor for science. He married Clara McMillen in 1921. Their marriage ceremony, like his college graduation, was avoided by Alfred Sr. The couple had four children. Their first son, Donald, born in 1922, died from the acute complications of juvenile diabetes in 1927, just before his fifth birthday. Their first daughter, Anne, was born in 1924, followed by Joan in 1925, and then by their second son Bruce in 1928.

Kinsey was bisexual, and one biographer believes that as a young man he would punish himself for having homoerotic feelings. He and his wife agreed that both could have sex with other people as well as with each other. Kinsey had sex with other men, including his student Clyde Martin.

Kinsey designed his own house, which was built in the Vinegar Hill neighborhood of Bloomington, Indiana, at 1320 First Street. There he practiced his deep interest in gardening.

Kinsey died on August 25, 1956, at the age of 62. The cause of his death was reported to be a heart ailment and pneumonia. The &quot;New York Times&quot; ran the following editorial on August 27, 1956:

Kinsey was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Bloomington, Indiana.

==Legacy==
The popularity of &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; prompted widespread media interest in 1948. &quot;Time&quot; magazine declared, &quot;Not since &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; had booksellers seen anything like it.&quot; The first pop culture references to Kinsey appeared not long after the book&#x27;s publication; &quot;Martha Raye [sold] a half-million copies of &#x27;Ooh, Dr. Kinsey!″&quot; Cole Porter&#x27;s song &quot;Too Darn Hot&quot;, from the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, devoted its bridge to &quot;the Kinsey report / Every average man you know / Much prefers to play his favorite sport&quot;. In 1949 Mae West, reminiscing on the days when the word &quot;sex&quot; was rarely uttered, said of Kinsey, &quot;That guy merely makes it easy for me. Now I don&#x27;t have to draw &#x27;em any blueprints ... We are both in the same business ... Except I saw it first.&quot;

The publication of &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; prompted even more intensive news coverage. Kinsey appeared on the cover of the August 24, 1953, issue of &quot;Time&quot;. The national news magazine featured two articles on the scientist, one focusing on his research, career and new book, the other on his background, personality, and lifestyle. In the magazine&#x27;s cover portrait, &quot;Flowers, birds, and a bee surround Kinsey; the mirror-of-Venus female symbol decorates his bow tie.&quot; The lead article concluded: Kinsey ... has done for sex what Columbus did for geography,&#x27; declared a pair of enthusiasts ... forgetting that Columbus did not know where he was when he got there. ... Kinsey&#x27;s work contains much that is valuable, but it must not be mistaken for the last word.&quot; A character called &quot;Dr. Kinsey&quot; appeared on the September 15, 1953, television episode of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; as a bow-tied man interviewing a young woman on board a cruise ship that has left Hawaii. When &quot;Dr. Kinsey&quot; identifies himself to Jack Benny, Benny steps away in embarrassment. The &quot;Dr. Kinsey&quot; character was also written into another sketch in the same episode, commenting on a fantasy Benny is having about Marilyn Monroe (a guest on the episode).

The early 2000s saw a renewed interest in Kinsey. In 2003 Theatre of NOTE produced the Steve Morgan Haskell play titled &quot;Fucking Wasps&quot; which followed Kinsey&#x27;s life from childhood until death. Matt Sesow&#x27;s paintings adorned the theater along with David Bickford playing piano live. Written and directed by Steve Morgan Haskell, &quot;Fucking Wasps&quot; received many accolades, including a Playwriting of the Year nomination from Backstage West. Premiering in 2003, the musical &quot;Dr. Sex&quot; focuses on the relationship between Kinsey, his wife, and their shared lover Wally Matthews (based on Clyde Martin). The play had a score by Larry Bortniker, a book by Bortniker and Sally Deering, and won seven Jeff Awards. It was produced off-Broadway in 2005. The 2004 biographical film &quot;Kinsey&quot;, written and directed by Bill Condon, stars Liam Neeson as the scientist and Laura Linney as his wife. In 2004 T. Coraghessan Boyle&#x27;s novel about Kinsey, &quot;The Inner Circle&quot;, was published. The following year, PBS produced the documentary &quot;Kinsey&quot; in cooperation with the Kinsey Institute, which allowed access to many of its files. &quot;Mr. Sex&quot;, a BBC radio play by Steve Coombes concerning Kinsey and his work, won the 2005 Imison Award.

In 2012, Kinsey was inducted into the Legacy Walk in Chicago, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people.

In June 2019, Kinsey was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

<text>Pope Leo II ( – 28 June 683) was the Bishop of Rome from 17 August 682 to his death. One of the popes of the Byzantine Papacy, he is described by a contemporary biographer as both just and learned. He is commemorated as a saint in the Roman Martyrology on 28 June (3 July in pre-1970 calendars).

==Early career==
Leo was a Sicilian by birth, the son of a man named Paul. He may have ended up being among the many Sicilian clergymen in Rome due to the attacks of the Caliphate on Sicily in the mid-7th century. Leo was known as an eloquent preacher who was interested in music, and noted for his charity to the poor.

==Papacy==
Pope Agatho died on 10 January 681, and although Leo was elected within days, he was not consecrated until 17 August 682. The reason may have been due to Agatho&#x27;s negotiations with Emperor Constantine IV regarding imperial control of papal elections. Constantine IV had already promised Agatho to abolish or reduce the tax that the Popes had been paying to the imperial treasury at the time of their consecration, an imperial policy that had been in force for about a century.

Leo&#x27;s short-lived pontificate did not allow him to accomplish much. Notably, he confirmed the acts of the Sixth Ecumenical Council (680–681) against Monothelitism. After Leo had notified the emperor that the decrees of the council had been confirmed, he made them known to the people of the West. In letters written to the Visigothic king, bishops, and nobles, he explained what the council had effected, and he called upon the bishops to subscribe to its decrees. During this council, Pope Honorius I was anathematized for tolerating Monothelism. Leo took great pains to make it clear that in condemning Honorius, he did so not because Honorius taught heresy, but because he was not active enough in opposing it. In accordance with the papal mandate, a synod was held at Toledo (684) in which the Third Council of Constantinople was accepted.

Leo put an end to the attempts of Archbishops of Ravenna to break from the control of the Bishop of Rome, but also abolished the tax it had been customary for them to pay when they received the pallium. In apparent response to Lombard raids, Leo transferred the relics of some martyrs from the catacombs to churches inside the city walls. He dedicated two churches, St. Paul&#x27;s and Sts. Sebastian and George. Leo also reformed Gregorian Chant and composed several sacred hymns for the Divine Office.

==Death==

Leo died on 28 June 683, and was succeeded by Benedict II. He was originally buried in his own monument; however, some years after his death, his remains were put into a tomb that contained the first four of his papal namesakes.

<text>Pope Leo IV (died 17 July 855) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 10 April 847 to his death in 855. He is remembered for repairing Roman churches that had been damaged during the Arab raid against Rome, and for building the Leonine Wall around Vatican Hill to protect the city. Pope Leo organized a league of Italian cities who fought and won the sea Battle of Ostia against the Saracens.

==Early career==
A Roman by birth, Leo received his early education at Rome in the monastery of St. Martin, near St. Peter&#x27;s. He attracted the notice of Pope Gregory IV, who made him a subdeacon; and was created cardinal-priest of Santi Quattro Coronati by Pope Sergius II.

In April 847, Leo was unanimously chosen to succeed Sergius II. As the attack of the Saracens on Rome in 846 caused the people to fear for the safety of the city, he was consecrated on 10 April, 847 without waiting for the consent of the emperor.

===Saracen defenses=== 
He immediately began to repair the damage done to various churches of the city during the Arab raid against Rome. He restored and embellished the damaged Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls and St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The latter&#x27;s altar again received its gold covering (after being stolen), which weighed 206 lb. and was studded with precious gems. Following the restoration of St. Peter&#x27;s, Leo appealed to the Christian kingdoms to confront the Arab raiders.

Leo also took precautions against further raids. He put the walls of the city into a thorough state of repair, entirely rebuilding fifteen of the great towers. He was the first to enclose the Vatican hill by a wall. Leo ordered a new line of walls encompassing the suburb on the right bank of the Tiber to be built, including St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, which had been undefended until this time. The district enclosed by the walls is still known as the Leonine City, and corresponds to the later rione of Borgo. To do this, he received money from the emperor, and help from all the cities and agricultural colonies (&quot;domus cultae&quot;) of the Duchy of Rome. The work took him four years to accomplish, and the newly fortified portion was called the Leonine City, after him.

===Battle of Ostia=== 
In 849, when a Saracen fleet from Sardinia approached Portus, Leo IV summoned the maritime republics – Naples, Gaeta and Amalfi – to form a league. The command of the unified fleet was given to Cesarius, son of Duke Sergius I of Naples. Aided by a fierce storm, the league destroyed the Saracen fleet off Ostia. The Battle of Ostia was one of the most famous in history of the Papacy of the Middle Ages and is celebrated in a famous fresco by Raphael and his pupils in his rooms of the Vatican Palace in the Vatican City. 

Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The Fire in the Borgo&quot; celebrates the incident in which, according to legend, Leo stopped a fire in the pilgrims&#x27; district by making the sign of the cross.

Leo IV held three synods, the one in 850 distinguished by the presence of Emperor Louis II, but the other two of little importance. In 853, he travelled to Ravenna to settle a dispute with the archbishop. As the archbishop was on good terms with Emperor Lothair I, the pope had little success. The history of the papal struggle with Hincmar of Reims, which began during Leo&#x27;s pontificate, belongs properly to that of Nicholas I. 

Before his death in 855 the Pope welcomed Aethelwulf King of Wessex and his sons, including the seven year old Alfred the Great, who at 5 had already met him in 853, as pilgrims to Rome.

==Death and burial==
Leo IV died on 17 July 855 and was succeeded by Benedict III, although a legend says he was succeeded by Pope Joan for two years. Nowadays, the story of Pope Joan is regarded by scholars as fictional.

Leo IV was originally buried in his own monument in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Some years after his death, his remains were put into a tomb that contained the first four popes named Leo. In the 18th century, the relics of Leo the Great were separated from his namesakes and given their own chapel.

==Iconography==
Leo IV had the figure of a rooster placed on the Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica or old Constantinian basilica which has served as a religious icon and reminder of Peter&#x27;s denial of Christ since that time, with some churches still having the cockerel on the steeple today. It is reputed that Pope Gregory I had previously said that the cock (rooster) &quot;was the most suitable emblem of Christianity&quot;, being &quot;the emblem of St Peter&quot;. After Leo IV, Pope Nicholas I, who had been made a deacon by Leo IV, decreed that the figure of the cock (rooster) should be placed on every church.

<text>Pope Leo V was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States in 903. He was pope immediately before the period known as the &quot;Saeculum obscurum&quot;, when popes wielded little temporal authority. His papacy occurred in the second half of 903, with exact months being difficult to discern.

Leo V was born at a place called Priapi, near Ardea. Although he was a priest when he was elected pope following the death of Pope Benedict IV (900–903), he was not a cardinal priest of Rome.

During his brief pontificate, Leo granted the canons of Bologna a special bull &quot;(epistola tuitionis)&quot; where he exempted them from the payment of taxes. However, after a reign of a little over two months, Leo was captured by Christopher, the cardinal-priest of San Lorenzo in Damaso, and thrown into prison. Christopher then had himself elected pope (903–904); until the 19th century he was often considered to have been a legitimate pope. Mann on the other hand argued in 1910 that Christopher was likely an antipope. 

Leo died shortly after being deposed. He was either murdered on the orders of Christopher in 903, who was in turn executed by Sergius III (904–911) in 904, or, possibly, both were ordered to be killed at the beginning of Sergius’ pontificate, either on the orders of Sergius himself, or by the direction of Sergius&#x27; patron, Theophylact I of Tusculum. According to Horace K. Mann, it is more likely that Leo died a natural death in prison or in a monastery.

<text>Pope Leo VI (880 – 12 February 929) was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States for just over seven months, from June 928 to his death. His pontificate occurred during the period known as the &quot;Saeculum obscurum&quot;.

==Family and early career==
Leo VI was born into a Roman family, and his father was Christophorus, who had been &quot;primicerius&quot; under Pope John VIII around the year 876. Tradition has it that he was a member of the Sanguini family. Before his pontificate, Leo served as the cardinal-priest of Santa Susanna.

==Pontificate==
Leo was elected pope around June 928, during a period of anarchy. He was chosen by the &quot;senatrix&quot; Marozia, who had gained control of Rome via the domination of her husband Guy, Margrave of Tuscany, and who had ordered the imprisonment and death of Leo’s predecessor, John X.

During his brief pontificate, Leo confirmed the decisions of the Synod of Spalato. He completed his predecessor’s investigations into the ecclesiastical situation in Dalmatia, and proceeded to give the pallium to Archbishop John of Salona, and ordered all the bishops of Dalmatia to obey him. He also ordered the bishop of Nona and others to limit themselves to the extent of their dioceses. Leo then banned castrati from marrying. He also issued an appeal for help against the Arab raiders who were threatening Rome, stating that:
”Whoever died faithful in this struggle will not see himself refused entry into the heavenly kingdom.”

The chronicler Flodoard said of him:
”Through the virtue of Peter, Leo the sixth was taken and received, he was preserved for seven months and five days, and like his predecessors, he joined the company of the prophets.” 

Leo died in February 929, and was succeeded by Stephen VII. He was buried at St. Peter’s Basilica.

<text>Pope Leo VII (died 13 July 939) was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States from 3 January 936 to his death.

== Election ==
Leo VII&#x27;s election to the papacy in 936, after the death of Pope John XI, was secured by Alberic II of Spoleto, the ruler of Rome at the time. Alberic wanted to choose the pope so that the papacy would continue to yield to his authority. Leo was the priest of the church of San Sisto Vecchio in Rome, thought to be a Benedictine monk. He had little ambition towards the papacy, but consented under pressure.

==Pontificate==
As pope, Leo VII reigned for only three years. Most of his bulls were grants of privilege to monasteries, especially including the Abbey of Cluny. Leo called for Odo of Cluny to mediate between Alberic and King Hugh of Italy. Odo was successful in negotiating a truce after arranging a marriage between Hugh&#x27;s daughter Alda and Alberic. Leo VII also appointed Archbishop Frederick of Mainz as a reformer in Germany. Leo allowed Frederick to drive out Jews that refused to be baptized, but he did not endorse the forced baptism of Jews.

Leo VII died on 13 July 939, and was interred at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He was succeeded by Stephen VIII.

<doc id="37669" wikidata="Q219639" url="?curid=37669" title="William Tyndale">
<text>William Tyndale (; sometimes spelled &quot;Tynsdale&quot;, &quot;Tindall&quot;, &quot;Tindill&quot;, &quot;Tyndall&quot;; – October 1536) was an English Biblical scholar and linguist who became a leading figure in the Protestant Reformation in the years leading up to his execution. He translated much of the Bible into English, and was influenced by the works of prominent Protestant Reformers such as Martin Luther.

Tyndale&#x27;s translations were the first English Scriptures to draw directly from Hebrew and Greek texts, the first English translation to take advantage of the printing press, the first of the new English Bibles of the Reformation, and the first English translation to use &quot;Jehovah&quot; (&quot;Iehouah&quot;) as God&#x27;s name. It was taken to be a direct challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church and of those laws of England maintaining the Church&#x27;s position. The work of Tyndale continued to play a key role in spreading Reformation ideas across the English-speaking world.

A copy of Tyndale&#x27;s &quot;The Obedience of a Christian Man&quot; (1528), which some view as arguing for Caesaropapism (the idea that the monarch rather than the Pope should control a country&#x27;s Church), came into the hands of King Henry VIII, providing a rationale for breaking the Church in England away from the Catholic Church in 1534. In 1530, Tyndale wrote &quot;The Practice of Prelates&quot;, opposing Henry&#x27;s plan to seek the annulment of his marriage on the grounds that it contravened Scripture. Fleeing England, Tyndale sought refuge in the Flemish territory of the Catholic Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1535 Tyndale was arrested, and jailed in the castle of Vilvoorde (Filford) outside Brussels for over a year. In 1536 he was convicted of heresy and executed by strangulation, after which his body was burnt at the stake.

Tyndale&#x27;s translations of biblical books were re-used by subsequent English editions (often without his sectarian prefaces or annotations), including the Great Bible and the Bishops&#x27; Bible, authorized by the Church of England. In 1611, after seven years of work, the 47 scholars who produced the King James Version of the Bible drew extensively from Tyndale&#x27;s original work and other translations that descended from his. One estimate suggests that the New Testament in the King James Version is 83% Tyndale&#x27;s words and the first half of the Old Testament 76%. In 2002, Tyndale was placed 26th in the BBC&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

== Background ==
Tyndale lived and worked during the era of Renaissance humanism and the revival of Biblical scholarship, which were both aided by both the Gutenberg Revolution and the ensuing democratisation of knowledge; for example, the publication of Johann Reuchlin&#x27;s Hebrew grammar in 1506. Notably, Erasmus compiled, edited, and published the Koine Greek scriptures of the New Testament in 1516. Luther&#x27;s translation of the Christian Bible into German appeared between 1517 and 1522.

Partial Old English translations had been made from the 7th century onwards, and by the 14th Century contemporary vernacular translations were available in most other major European languages. However the religious foment and violent rebellion of the Lollards resulted in heresy being treated as sedition under English law, which bore the death penalty. Lollardy was associated by authorities with the possession and public readings of Wycliffite Bibles in the newly emerged Middle English; manuscripts with Wycliffite material should be destroyed; the possession of Wycliffite material could be used as information in investigations and inquisitions though not used as a proof of heresy.

By the early 16th century, the Wycliffite translations were becoming less and less comprehensible as the English language changed from Middle English to Early Modern English. Classical and Koine Greek texts became widely available to the European scholarly community for the first time in centuries, as it welcomed Greek-speaking scholars, philosophers, intellectuals, and the manuscripts they carried to Catholic Europe as refugees following the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

The Tyndale family also went by the name Hychyns (Hitchins), and it was as William Hychyns that Tyndale was enrolled at Magdalen Hall, Oxford. Tyndale&#x27;s brother Edward was receiver to the lands of Lord Berkeley, as attested to in a letter by Bishop Stokesley of London. William Tyndale&#x27;s niece Margaret Tyndale was married to Protestant martyr Rowland Taylor, burnt during the Marian Persecutions.

===Theories about his origins===
Tyndale may have been born around 1494 in Melksham Court, Stinchcombe, a village near Dursley, Gloucestershire. A conjecture is that Tyndale&#x27;s family had moved to Gloucestershire at some point in the 15th century, probably as a result of the Wars of the Roses. The family may have originated from Northumberland via East Anglia. Tyndale is recorded in two Victorian genealogies which claim he was the brother of Sir William Tyndale of Deane, Northumberland, and Hockwold, Norfolk, who was knighted at the marriage of Arthur, Prince of Wales to Catherine of Aragon. If this is true then Tyndale&#x27;s family was thus descended from Baron Adam de Tyndale, a tenant-in-chief of Henry I.

===At Oxford===
Tyndale began a Bachelor of Arts degree at Magdalen Hall (later Hertford College) of Oxford University in 1506 and received his B.A. in 1512, the same year becoming a subdeacon. He was made Master of Arts in July 1515 and was held to be a man of virtuous disposition, leading an unblemished life. The M.A. allowed him to start studying theology, but the official course did not include the systematic study of scripture. As Tyndale later complained:

He was a gifted linguist and became fluent over the years in French, Greek, Hebrew, German, Italian, Latin, and Spanish, in addition to English. Between 1517 and 1521, he went to the University of Cambridge. Erasmus had been the leading teacher of Greek there from August 1511 to January 1512, but not during Tyndale&#x27;s time at the university.

Tyndale became chaplain at the home of Sir John Walsh at Little Sodbury in Gloucestershire and tutor to his children around 1521. His opinions proved controversial to fellow clergymen, and the next year he was summoned before John Bell, the Chancellor of the Diocese of Worcester, although no formal charges were laid at the time. After the meeting with Bell and other church leaders, Tyndale, according to John Foxe, had an argument with a &quot;learned but blasphemous clergyman&quot;, who allegedly asserted: &quot;We had better be without God&#x27;s laws than the Pope&#x27;s&quot;, to which Tyndale responded: &quot;I defy the Pope and all his laws; and if God spares my life, ere many years, I will cause the boy that driveth the plow to know more of the Scriptures than thou dost!&quot;

Tyndale left for London in 1523 to seek sponsorship and permission to translate the Bible into English. He asked to join the household of London Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall, a well-known classicist who had worked with Erasmus, his friend, on the second edition of his Latin/Greek New Testament. The bishop, however, declined to extend his patronage, telling Tyndale that his household was already full with scholars. Tyndale preached and studied &quot;at his book&quot; in London for some time, relying on the help of cloth merchant Humphrey Monmouth. During this time, he lectured widely, including at St Dunstan-in-the-West at Fleet Street in London.

===In Europe===
Tyndale left England for continental Europe, perhaps at Hamburg, in the spring of 1524, possibly traveling on to Wittenberg. There is an entry in the matriculation registers of the University of Wittenberg of the name &quot;Guillelmus Daltici ex Anglia&quot;, and this has been taken to be a Latinisation of &quot;William Tyndale from England&quot;. He began translating the New Testament at this time, possibly in Wittenberg, completing it in 1525 with assistance from Observant Friar William Roy.
In 1525 the publication of the work by Peter Quentell in Cologne was interrupted by the impact of anti-Lutheranism. A full edition of the New Testament was produced in 1526 by printer Peter Schöffer the Younger in Worms, a free imperial city then in the process of adopting Lutheranism. More copies were soon printed in Antwerp. It was smuggled from continental Europe into England and Scotland by putting pages in between other legal books. The translation was condemned in October 1526 by Bishop Tunstall, who issued warnings to booksellers, bought all the available copies, and had them burned in public. Marius notes that the &quot;spectacle of the scriptures being put to the torch... provoked controversy even amongst the faithful.&quot; Cardinal Wolsey condemned Tyndale as a heretic, first stated in open court in January 1529.

From an entry in George Spalatin&#x27;s diary for 11 August 1526, Tyndale remained at Worms for about a year. It is not clear exactly when he moved to Antwerp. Here he stayed at the house of Thomas Poyntz. The colophon to Tyndale&#x27;s translation of Genesis and the title pages of several pamphlets from this time purported to have been printed by Hans Lufft at Marburg, but this is a false address. Lufft, the printer of Luther&#x27;s books, never had a printing press at Marburg.

Henry asked Emperor Charles V to have the writer apprehended and returned to England under the terms of the Treaty of Cambrai; however, the emperor responded that formal evidence was required before extradition. In 1531 he asked Stephen Vaughan to persuade Tyndale to retract his heretical opinions and return to England. Vaughan tried to persuade Tyndale, and forwarded copies of his books, but this did not satisfy the king.

Tyndale developed his case in &quot;An Answer unto Sir Thomas More&#x27;s Dialogue&quot;.

====Opposition to Henry VIII&#x27;s annulment====

In 1530, from exile, he wrote &quot;The Practice of Prelates&quot;, opposing Henry VIII&#x27;s desire to secure the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in favour of Anne Boleyn, on the grounds that it was unscriptural and that it was a plot by Cardinal Wolsey to get Henry entangled in the papal courts of Pope Clement VII.

Historian Bruce Boehrer writes that for Tyndale the issue related to the perspicacity of literal scripture: &quot;I suspect he (Tyndale) undercut the arguments of both Church and King because he found both to be based upon an objectionable premise: that the word of God should be subject to the final arbitrament of a single man.&quot;

====Betrayal and death====
Eventually, Tyndale was betrayed by Henry Phillips to ducal authorities representing the Holy Roman Empire. He was seized in Antwerp in 1535, and held in the castle of Vilvoorde (Filford) near Brussels. 

Following the insurrections of the Albigensians, the Lollards, the Hussites, the German Peasants&#x27; War, the Münster Anabaptist rebellion, etc., heresy was connected by states with sedition and possible regicide; it carried, at worst, the terrible death penalty of burning at the stake. The Church could usually protect someone accused of heresy from being charged by the state, if that person satisfied the appointed theologian Inquisitor, in a formal process, that they did not (now) hold heretical views.

In Tyndale&#x27;s case, he was held in prison for a year and a half: his Roman Catholic inquisitor, Jacobus Latomus, gave him the opportunity to write a book stating his views; Latomus wrote a book in response to convince him of his errors; Tyndale wrote two in reply; Latomus wrote two further books in response to Tyndale. Latomus&#x27; three books were subsequently published as one volume: in these it can be seen that the discussion on heresy revolves around the contents of three other books Tyndale had written on topics like justification by faith, free will, the denial of the soul, and so on. Latomus makes no mention of Bible translation; indeed, it seems that in prison, Tyndale was allowed to continue making translations from the Hebrew. Thomas Cromwell was involved in some intercession or plans such as extradition.
When Tyndale could not be convinced to abjure, he was handed over to the Brabantine secular arm and tried on charges of Lutheran heresy in 1536. The charges did not mention Bible translation, which was not illegal in the Netherlands.

He was found guilty by his own admission and condemned to be executed. Tyndale &quot;was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned&quot;. His final words, spoken &quot;at the stake with a fervent zeal, and a loud voice&quot;, were reported later as &quot;Lord! Open the King of England&#x27;s eyes.&quot; The traditional date of commemoration is 6 October, but records of Tyndale&#x27;s imprisonment suggest that the actual date of his execution was some weeks earlier. Foxe gives 6 October as the date of commemoration (left-hand date column), but gives no date of death (right-hand date column). Biographer David Daniell states his date of death only as &quot;one of the first days of October 1536&quot;.

====Sequelae====
Within four years of Tyndale&#x27;s death, a sequence of four English translations of the Bible were published in England at the king&#x27;s behest, revising Tyndale&#x27;s versions of the New Testament and Pentateuch with various objectionable features removed: Miles Coverdale&#x27;s, Thomas Matthew&#x27;s, Richard Taverner&#x27;s, and the Great Bible.

==Theological views==
Tyndale was conjectured by Donald Smeeton to have come out of the Lollard tradition, which Smeeton argued was strong in Gloucestershire, but later scholars have cast doubt on these claims. Tyndale denounced the practice of prayer to saints. He also rejected the view that the scriptures could be interpreted only by approved clergy. While his views were influenced by Luther, Tyndale also deliberately distanced himself from the German reformer on several key theological points, adopting a more symbolical interpretation of the Lord&#x27;s Supper in opposition to Luther&#x27;s doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

==Printed works==

Although best known for his translation of the Bible, Tyndale was also an active writer and translator. As well as his focus on how religion should be lived, he had a focus on political issues.
==Legacy==
===Impact on English Bibles===

The translators of the Revised Standard Version in the 1940s noted that Tyndale&#x27;s translation, including the 1537 Matthew Bible, inspired the translations that followed: The Great Bible of 1539; the Geneva Bible of 1560; the Bishops&#x27; Bible of 1568; the Douay-Rheims Bible of 1582–1609; and the King James Version of 1611, of which the RSV translators noted: &quot;It [the KJV] kept felicitous phrases and apt expressions, from whatever source, which had stood the test of public usage. It owed most, especially in the New Testament, to Tyndale&quot;.

George Steiner in his book on translation &quot;After Babel&quot; refers to &quot;the influence of the genius of Tyndale, the greatest of English Bible translators.&quot;

===Memorials===
A memorial to Tyndale stands in Vilvoorde, Flanders, where he was executed. It was erected in 1913 by Friends of the Trinitarian Bible Society of London and the Belgian Bible Society. There is also a small William Tyndale Museum in the town, attached to the Protestant church. A bronze statue by Sir Joseph Boehm commemorating the life and work of Tyndale was erected in Victoria Embankment Gardens on the Thames Embankment, London, in 1884. It shows his right hand on an open Bible, which is itself resting on an early printing press. A life-sized bronze statue of a seated William Tyndale at work on his translation by Lawrence Holofcener (2000) was placed in the Millennium Square, Bristol, United Kingdom.

The Tyndale Monument was built in 1866 on a hill above his supposed birthplace, North Nibley, Gloucestershire. A stained-glass window commemorating Tyndale was made in 1911 for the British and Foreign Bible Society by James Powell and Sons. In 1994, after the Society had moved their offices from London to Swindon, the window was reinstalled in the chapel of Hertford College in Oxford. Tyndale was at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, which became Hertford College in 1874. The window depicts a full-length portrait of Tyndale, a cameo of a printing shop in action, some words of Tyndale, the opening words of Genesis in Hebrew, the opening words of St John&#x27;s Gospel in Greek, and the names of other pioneering Bible translators. The portrait is based on the oil painting that hangs in the college&#x27;s dining hall. A stained glass window by Arnold Robinson in Tyndale Baptist Church, Bristol, also commemorates the life of Tyndale.

Several colleges, schools and study centres have been named in his honour, including Tyndale House (Cambridge), Tyndale University (Toronto), the Tyndale-Carey Graduate School affiliated to the Bible College of New Zealand, William Tyndale College (Farmington Hills, Michigan), and Tyndale Theological Seminary (Shreveport, Louisiana, and Fort Worth, Texas), the independent Tyndale Theological Seminary in Badhoevedorp, near Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Tyndale Christian School in South Australia, Tyndale Park Christian School in New Zealand, and Tyndale Christian School, a Classical Christian school in Arlington, VA, USA. An American Christian publishing house, also called Tyndale House, was named after Tyndale.

There is an Anglican communion setting in memoriam William Tyndale, &quot;The Tyndale Service,&quot; by David Mitchell.

===Liturgical commemoration===
By tradition Tyndale&#x27;s death is commemorated on 6 October. There are commemorations on this date in the church calendars of members of the Anglican Communion, initially as one of the &quot;days of optional devotion&quot; in the American Book of Common Prayer (1979), and a &quot;black-letter day&quot; in the Church of England&#x27;s Alternative Service Book. The Common Worship that came into use in the Church of England in 2000 provides a collect proper to 6 October (Lesser Festival), beginning with the words:

Tyndale is honored in the Calendar of saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America as a translator and martyr the same day.

==Personality and character==
In his own words, Tyndale was &quot;evil-favoured in this world, and without grace in the sight of men, speechless and rude, dull and slow-witted&quot;.

Tyndale wrote it had been his duty to translate the New Testament and reveals a confrontational style, saying, &quot;In burning the New Testament they did none other thing than I looked for; no more shall they do, if they burn me also, if it be God&#x27;s will it shall be so. Nevertheless, in translating the New Testament I did my duty...&quot;

His contemporary theological opponent Thomas More, who never met Tyndale personally, charitably described Tyndale as &quot;a man of sober and honest living who was well educated, well liked, and a good preacher.&quot;

Tyndale fought with another reformer George Joye who wrote in 1535: &quot;Let every man be ware how he medle with Tin[dale],&quot; finding him disdainful, conceited, hypocritical and unwilling to have his Bible translations corrected.

John Foxe, writing in around 1562, considered Tyndale &quot;simple and inexpert&quot; in &quot;the wily subtleties of this world.&quot;

The view of Tyndale given by a recent biography has been summarized as a &quot;difficult, aggressive, unworldly and monomaniacal man.&quot;

Another modern biographer alludes to Tyndale&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;trouble-maker&quot;. The famous ploughboy story attributed to him takes place as a heated argument at a dinner party.

==Works about Tyndale==

The first biographical film about Tyndale, titled &quot;William Tindale&quot;, was released in 1937. Arnold Wathen Robinson depicted Tyndale&#x27;s life in stained glass windows for the Tyndale Baptist Church ca. 1955. The 1975 novel &quot;The Hawk that Dare Not Hunt by Day&quot; by Scott O&#x27;Dell fictionalizes Tyndale and the smuggling of his Bible into England. The film &quot;God&#x27;s Outlaw: The Story of William Tyndale&quot;, was released in 1986. The 1998 film &quot;Stephen&#x27;s Test of Faith&quot; includes a long scene with Tyndale, how he translated the Bible, and how he was put to death.

A cartoon film about his life, titled &quot;Torchlighters: The William Tyndale Story&quot;, was released ca. 2005. The documentary film, &quot;William Tyndale: Man with a Mission&quot;, was released ca. 2005. The movie included an interview with David Daniell. In 2007, the 2-hour Channel 4 documentary, &quot;The Bible Revolution&quot;, presented by Rod Liddle, details the roles of historically significant English Reformers John Wycliffe, William Tyndale, and Thomas Cranmer. The &quot;Battle for the Bible&quot; (2007) episode of the PBS &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; series, narrated by Liev Schreiber, features Tyndale&#x27;s story and legacy and includes historical context. This film is an abbreviated and revised version of the PBS/Channel 4 version.

He has also appeared as a character in two plays dealing with the King James Bible, Howard Brenton&#x27;s &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot; (2010) and David Edgar&#x27;s &quot;Written on the Heart&quot; (2011).

In 2011, BYUtv produced a documentary miniseries, &quot;Fires of Faith&quot;, on the creation of the King James Bible, which focused heavily on Tyndale&#x27;s life. In 2013, BBC Two aired a 60-minute documentary &quot;The Most Dangerous Man in Tudor England&quot;, written and presented by Melvyn Bragg.

Another known documentary is the film &quot;William Tyndale: His Life, His Legacy&quot;.

==Tyndale&#x27;s pronunciation==
Tyndale was writing at the beginning of the Early Modern English period. His pronunciation must have differed in its phonology from that of Shakespeare at the end of the period. In 2013 linguist David Crystal made a transcription and a sound recording of Tyndale&#x27;s translation of the whole of the Gospel of Matthew in what he believes to be the pronunciation of the day, using the term &quot;original pronunciation&quot;. The recording has been published by The British Library on two compact discs with an introductory essay by Crystal.

<doc id="37670" wikidata="Q165568" url="?curid=37670" title="Pope John XXII">
<text>Pope John XXII (; 1244 – 4 December 1334), born Jacques Duèze (or d&#x27;Euse), was head of the Catholic Church from 7 August 1316 to his death, in December 1334. He was the second and longest-reigning Avignon Pope, elected by the Conclave of Cardinals, which was assembled in Lyon. Like his predecessor, Clement V, Pope John centralized power and income in the Papacy and lived a princely life in Avignon.

John opposed the policies of Louis IV the Bavarian as Holy Roman Emperor, which prompted Louis to invade Italy and set up an antipope, Nicholas V. John also opposed the Franciscan understanding of the poverty of Christ and his apostles, promulgating multiple papal bulls to enforce his views. This led William of Ockham to write against unlimited papal power.

Following a three-year process, John canonized Thomas Aquinas on 18 July 1323. One of John&#x27;s sermons on the beatific vision caused controversy which lasted until he retracted his views just before his death. John died in Avignon on 4 December 1334.

== Early life and election ==
Born in 1244, Jacques was the son of Arnaud Duèze, who was probably a merchant or banker. He studied canon law at Montpellier and theology in Paris. Jacques taught civil law at Cahors and later canon law at Toulouse. By 1295, he was counselor to Bishop Louis of Toulouse. Following Louis&#x27;s death in 1297, Jacques was installed as the temporary chancellor of the University of Avignon and by 1299 was canon of Puy. On the recommendation of Charles II of Naples he was made Bishop of Fréjus in 1300. Jacques was still bishop of Fréjus when in 1307, a knight named William d&#x27;Arcis and a priest named Bertrand Recordus attempted to kill him. Both were imprisoned and in 1309 were sentenced to death.

In 1308, Jacques was appointed chancellor of Charles II, and it was due to his influence that the gladiatorial games in Naples were banned. On 18 March 1310, he was made Bishop of Avignon. He delivered legal opinions favorable to the suppression of the Templars, but he also defended Boniface VIII and the Bull &quot;Unam Sanctam&quot;. On 23 December 1312, Clement V made him Cardinal-Bishop of Porto-Santa Rufina.

The limits of papal power became a source of conflict between reigning pope Clement V and Emperor Henry VII, culminating with the sudden death of Pope Clement V in 1314. The period that followed was an interregnum of two years due to disagreements between the cardinals, who were split into three factions. After two years of inaction, Philip, Count of Poitiers summoned a papal conclave of 23 cardinals to Lyon in August 1316. Philip forbade the cardinals from leaving until they had chosen a new Pope. On 7 August 1316, this conclave elected Jacques, who took the name John XXII and was crowned in Lyon. He set up his residence in Avignon rather than Rome, continuing the Avignon Papacy of his predecessor.

== Papacy ==

Upon his election, John gave 35,000 florins, of the 70,000 left to him by Clement V, to the cardinals that had voted for him. He was an excellent administrator and efficient at reorganizing the Catholic Church. He favored a regulation-heavy form of governance. John was known to have a temper, and involved himself in the politics and religious movements of many European countries in order to advance the interests of the papacy. He would routinely write to non-Catholic leaders asserting his authority over them.

On 7 April 1317, John canonized Louis of Toulouse with the papal bull &quot;Sol oriens&quot;. In 1318, he sent a letter of thanks to the Muslim ruler Uzbeg Khan, who was tolerant of Christians and treated them kindly. John has traditionally been credited with having composed the prayer &quot;Anima Christi&quot;, which has become the English &quot;Soul of Christ, sanctify me ...&quot;. On 27 March 1329, John condemned many writings of Meister Eckhart as heretical in his papal bull &quot;In Agro Dominico&quot;. He allowed the consuls of Cahors to establish a small university in that city.

In June 1332, John declared his intention to move his residence to Bologna. In preparation of this, the cardinal legate, Bertrand du Pouget, had been working for years in Bologna to oversee the construction of a papal palace and to integrate the political climate for the papacy&#x27;s arrival. By August, however, John deemed the safety of the city insufficient. The Bishop of Embrun, Bertrand de Deaux, arrived to assist Pouget but simply exacerbated the situation. This led to a revolt in 1334, Pouget&#x27;s expulsion, and death threats for any member of the Curia. The papal palace was destroyed and it took John&#x27;s successor, Benedict XII, many years to find peace with Bologna. John died in Avignon on 4 December 1334 (aged 89/90). He was buried in Avignon, at the cathedral of Notre-Dame-des-Doms.

=== Edward II and Irish bishoprics ===
John received an embassy, in December 1316, from Edward II of England concerning the empty bishoprics of Dublin and Cashel. Edward presented his preferred appointees and was adamant that John not promote any native Irishman to bishop or archbishop. John promoted William FitzJohn, bishop of Ossory to the bishopric of Cashel, while Alexander Bicknor, a personal recommendation of Edward, was given Dublin.

In January 1318, John sent a congratulatory letter to Edward II on his victory over Edward Bruce. He had passed an excommunication of all enemies of Edward II and later singled out Robert and Edward Bruce. John had allowed Edward II to keep the crusade tax imposed by the Council of Vienne, while reminding him that England was a papal fief and that he owed John an oath of loyalty. A few months later, John heard from Irish princes petitioning for the replacement of Edward II as sovereign lord of Ireland, stating that successive kings of England had not respected the papal grant of Ireland to Henry II of England. John&#x27;s letter to Edward implied that a second papal evaluation of the lordship of Ireland was not out of the question.

=== Canonization of Thomas Aquinas ===

By November 1317, Guillelmo de Tocco, Prior of the Benevento Dominican monastery, was heading a preliminary investigation into Thomas Aquinas&#x27; sainthood. In the summer of 1318, John met with de Tocco, who presented letters from the regal heads of Sicily imploring for a papal inquiry into the sainthood of Aquinas. De Tocco also presented John with notarized records of Aquinas&#x27;s miracles and requests from princes and universities asking for Aquinas&#x27;s canonization. John chose three cardinals, none of whom was a Dominican, to scrutinize the presented records. Finding no errors, they gave their recommendation to John. John then issued two letters, nominating as papal commissioners: Umberto, Archbishop of Naples; Angelo, Bishop of Viterbo; and Pandulpho de Sabbello, who was unable to attend.

De Tocco gathered two of the three papal commissioners in the Archbishop&#x27;s palace in Naples and the inquiry lasted from 21 July to 18 September 1319. On the final day, the documentation of the inquiry was signed, sealed and sent to the Papal Curia at Avignon. Upon receiving the documents, John turned them over to a cardinal committee. On 23 June 1321, John created a new commission consisting of Peter Ferri, Bishop of Agnani, Andrew, Bishop of Terracina, and Pandulpho de Sabbello. This inquiry lasted fifteen days, during which the commission heard the testimony of 111 witnesses. The commission sent finalized documents to the Papal Curia and John XXII canonized Thomas Aquinas formally on 18 July 1323.

=== Conflict with Louis IV ===

Prior to John XXII&#x27;s election, a contest had begun for the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s crown between Louis IV the Bavarian and Frederick I of Austria. Initially, John was neutral and refrained from being an arbiter. On 25 November 1314, Louis, with the votes from five of the seven electors, was crowned king of the Germans at Aachen, by the archbishop of Mainz, while Frederick received only two votes the day before. In response, in April 1317, John imposed a new concept, &quot;vacante imperio&quot;, granting the power to administer the empire to the pope, which was contained within the papal bull &quot;Si fratrum&quot;.

By 1322, faced with a growing Ghibelline movement in northern Italy, John had instructed his papal legate, Bertrand du Poujet, to call for a crusade against Milan. Louis, acting with Imperial powers, sent an army to reinforce Milan in early 1323. In response, John detailed violations committed by Louis and upon receiving no response excommunicated him on 23 March 1324 and then deposed him on 11 July. Louis called a council of Italian Ghibellines to Trent, where Louis declared his support for the Spiritualist Franciscans and denounced John as an illegitimate and heretical pope. John retaliated by declaring any city to offer Louis welcome would be placed under interdict. He received an embassy from Rome which issued an ultimatum of either returning to Rome or suffering the Holy City&#x27;s submission to Louis IV. John sent his papal legate, Giovanni Orsini, to Rome, but Orsini was denied entry. In reprisal, Orsini placed Rome under interdict.

Louis entered Rome on 17 January 1328. In St. Peter&#x27;s cathedral, he was consecrated by two sympathetic cardinal bishops, and crowned by Rome&#x27;s representative, Sciarra della Colonna. Pietro Rainalducci was created Antipope Nicholas V in May 1328, by Louis. In response, John, using the death of archbishop Matthias von Buchegg to gain an ecclesiastical and political edge, appointed Heinrich von Virneburg as Archbishop of Mainz to assist in the struggle against the Emperor. Following Louis&#x27;s coronation of Nicholas V, Franciscan Minister General Michael Cesena, Bonagrazia Bergamo, and William of Ockham all fled Avignon. In 1330, Antipope Nicholas V submitted just before the Pope&#x27;s death.

=== Franciscan poverty ===
John XXII was determined to suppress what he considered to be the excesses of the Spirituals, who contended eagerly for the view that Christ and his apostles had possessed absolutely nothing, citing in support of their view Pope Nicholas III&#x27;s bull &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot;. On 7 October 1317, John XXII promulgated the bull &quot;Quorumdam exigit&quot;, clarifying the earlier bulls issued by Nicholas III and Clement V, &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot; and &quot;Exivi de paradiso&quot;, and stating unequivocally that obedience was a greater virtue than chastity or poverty. On 26 March 1322, with the bull &quot;Quia nonnunquam&quot;, he removed the ban on discussion of &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot;, and commissioned experts to examine the idea of poverty based on belief that Christ and the apostles owned nothing. The experts disagreed among themselves, but the majority condemned the idea on the grounds that it would deny the church&#x27;s right to have possessions. The Franciscan chapter held in Perugia in June 1322 responded with two encyclicals stating that all judgments made by the Roman Church were to be regarded as final and could not be revoked if they were not erroneous. By the bull &quot;Ad conditorem canonum&quot; of 8 December 1322, John XXII declared it ridiculous to pretend that every scrap of food given to the friars and eaten by them belonged to the pope, refused to accept ownership over the goods of the Franciscans in future and granted them exemption from the rule that absolutely forbade ownership of anything even in common, thus forcing them to accept ownership. On 12 November 1323, he issued the bull &quot;Quum inter nonnullos&quot;, which declared &quot;erroneous and heretical&quot; the doctrine that Christ and his apostles had no possessions whatsoever.
Influential members of the order protested, such as the minister general Michael of Cesena, the English provincial William of Ockham, and Bonagratia of Bergamo. In reply to the argument of his opponents that Nicholas III&#x27;s bull &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot; was fixed and irrevocable, John XXII issued the bull &quot;Quia quorundam&quot; on 10 November 1324, in which he declared that it cannot be inferred from the words of the 1279 bull that Christ and the apostles had nothing, adding: &quot;Indeed, it can be inferred rather that the Gospel life lived by Christ and the Apostles did not exclude some possessions in common, since living &#x27;without property&#x27; does not require that those living thus should have nothing in common.&quot; With the bull &quot;Quia vir reprobus&quot; of 16 November 1329, John replied to Michael of Cesena&#x27;s &quot;Appellatio&quot;.

=== Beatific vision controversy ===

Between November 1331 and March 1332, John XXII made four questionable sermons concerning the beatific vision. John argued that those who died in the faith did not see the presence of God until the Last Judgment. This caused a theological controversy concerning the beatific vision. He continued this argument for a time in sermons while he was pope, although he never taught it in official documents. In January 1334, in complete opposition to John XXII, the Faculty of Theology of the Sorbonne stated that after death the blessed souls are raised to the beatific vision. Louis, sensing an opportunity to remove him, conspired with cardinal Napoleone Orsini to depose John at an ecumenical council. John, considered by many to be theologically incompetent, backed down from his position on the day before his death, agreeing that those who die in grace do indeed immediately enjoy the beatific vision.

=== Role in witchcraft suppression ===
Pope John&#x27;s reign saw an important change in papal and inquisitorial attitudes towards witchcraft suppression compared to the reign of his predecessors, such as pope Alexander IV. Kors points to the fact that Pope John had been the victim of an assassination attempt via poisoning and sorcery as a personal factor behind this change. As such, Pope John&#x27;s involvement with witchcraft suppression can be officially traced to his 1326 papal bull &quot;Super illius specula&quot; in which he laid out a description of those who engage in witchcraft. Pope John also warned people against not only learning magic or teaching it but against the more &quot;execrable&quot; act of performing magic. Pope John stated that anyone who did not heed his &quot;most charitable&quot; warning would be excommunicated. Pope John officially declared witchcraft to be heresy, and thus it could be tried under the Inquisition. Although this was the official ruling for the church, Pope John&#x27;s first order dealing with magic being tried by the Inquisition was in a letter written in 1320 by Cardinal William of Santa Sabina. The letter was addressed to the Inquisitors of Carcassonne and Toulouse. In the letter Cardinal William states that with the authority of Pope John the Inquisitors there were to investigate witches by &quot;whatever means available&quot; as if witches were any other heretic. The letter went on to describe the actions of those who would be seen as witches and extended power to the Inquisition for the prosecution of any and all cases that fit any part of the description laid out in the letter.
