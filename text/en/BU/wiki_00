<text>Auguste-Jean-Marie Vermorel (21 June 184120 June 1871) was a French socialist writer, editor and journalist and a leader of the Paris Commune.

==Biography==
He was born at Denicé. A radical and socialist writer and activist, he founded the journal &quot;La Jeune France&quot; (Young France) in 1861; then became editor-in-chief of &quot;Du Courrier français&quot;. He was attached to the staff of the &quot;Presse&quot; (1864), the &quot;Liberté&quot; (1866) and worked also on the journal &quot;La Reforme&quot;; his attacks on the government in that organ led to his imprisonment. He also published &quot;Les Hommes de 1848&quot; (The Men of 1848) in 1868, &quot;Les Hommes de 1851&quot; (The men of 1851) and &quot;Les Vampires&quot; (The Vampires, an electoral pamphlet) in 1869 and &quot;Le Parti socialiste&quot; (the Socialist Party) in 1870. Previously he had published books on the works of the primary leaders of the French Revolution including Danton, Robespierre and Jean-Paul Marat as well as works on various other subjects.

Imprisoned by the Second Empire because of his political opinions, he was released by the Proclamation of the Republic on September 4, 1870. But he was again imprisoned for his participation in the uprising of October 31, 1870 against the policy of the Government of National Defense . After the end of the siege of Paris by the Germans (September 1870 - March 1871), he retired to the provinces, but returned to Paris after the establishment of the Paris Commune on March 18, 1871. On March 26, he was elected to the Council of the Commune by the 18th arrondissement; He served on the Justice Commission, then the Executive Commission and finally that of the Sûreté générale. He published two newspapers, &quot;L&#x27;Ordre&quot; (Order) and &quot;L&#x27;Ami du Peuple&quot; (The Friend of the People), each one suppressed after just four issues. He voted against the creation of the Committee of Public Safety, as part of the minority on the Council of the Municipality. During the &quot;Semaine sanglante&quot; (Bloody Week), he fought on the barricades where he was seriously injured on May 25, 1871. After the defeat and destruction of the Commune by the German and French armies, he was arrested and transferred as a prisoner of the French government to Versailles, where he was allowed to die slowly for lack of medical care at the age of 29. He is buried in the cemetery of Denicé.

<doc id="585571" wikidata="Q177724" url="?curid=585571" title="Minimalist program">
<text>In linguistics, the minimalist program is a major line of inquiry that has been developing inside generative grammar since the early 1990s, starting with a 1993 paper by Noam Chomsky.

Following Imre Lakatos&#x27;s distinction, Chomsky presents minimalism as a program, understood as a mode of inquiry that provides a conceptual framework which guides the development of linguistic theory. As such, it is characterized by a broad and diverse range of research directions. For Chomsky, there are two basic minimalist questions—What is language? and Why does it have the properties it has?—but the answers to these two questions can be framed in any theory.

== Conceptual framework ==
=== Goals and assumptions ===
Minimalism is an approach developed with the goal of understanding the nature of language. It models a speaker&#x27;s knowledge of language as a computational system with one basic operation, namely Merge. Merge combines expressions taken from the lexicon in a successive fashion to generate representations that characterize I-Language, understood to be the internalized intensional knowledge state as represented in individual speakers. By hypothesis, I-language—also called universal grammar—corresponds to the initial state of the human language faculty in individual human development.

Minimalism is reductive in that it aims to identify which aspects of human language—as well the computational system that underlies it—are conceptually necessary. This is sometimes framed as questions relating to perfect design (Is the design of human language perfect?) and optimal computation (Is the computational system for human language optimal?) According to Chomsky, a human natural language is not optimal when judged based on how it functions, since it often contains ambiguities, garden paths, etc. However, it may be optimal for interaction with the systems that are internal to the mind.

Such questions are informed by a set of background assumptions, some of which date back to the earliest stages of generative grammar:

# Language is a form of cognition. There is a language faculty (FL) that interacts with other cognitive systems; this accounts for why humans acquire language.
# Language is a computational system. The language faculty consists of a computational system (CHL) whose initial state (S0) contains invariant principles and parameters.
# Language acquisition consists of acquiring a lexicon and fixing the parameter values of the target language.
# Language generates an infinite set of expressions given as a sound-meaning pair (π, λ).
# Syntactic computation interfaces with phonology: π corresponds to phonetic form (PF), the interface with the articulatory-perceptual (A-P) performance system, which includes articulatory speech production and acoustic speech perception.
# Syntactic computation interfaces with semantics: λ corresponds to logical form (LF), the interface with the conceptual-intentional (C-I) performance system, which includes conceptual structure and intentionality.
# Syntactic computations are fully interpreted at the relevant interface: (π, λ) are interpreted at the PF and LF interfaces as instructions to the A-P and C-I performance systems.
# Some aspects of language are invariant. In particular, the computational system (i.e. syntax) and LF are invariant.
#Some aspects of language show variation. In particular, variation reduces to Saussurean arbitrariness, parameters and the mapping to PF.
#The theory of grammar meets the criterion of conceptual necessity; this is the Strong Minimalist Thesis introduced by Chomsky in (2001). Consequently, language is an optimal association of sound with meaning; the language faculty satisfies only the interface conditions imposed by the A-P and C-I performance systems; PF and LF are the only linguistic levels.

=== Strong minimalist thesis ===
Minimalism develops the idea that human language ability is optimal in its design and exquisite in its organization, and that its inner workings conform to a very simple computation. On this view, universal grammar instantiates a perfect design in the sense that it contains only what is necessary. Minimalism further develops the notion of economy, which came to the fore in the early 1990s, though still peripheral to transformational grammar. &quot;Economy of derivation&quot; requires that movements (i.e., transformations) occur only if necessary, and specifically to satisfy to feature-checking, whereby an &quot;interpretable feature&quot; is matched with a corresponding &quot;uninterpretable feature&quot;. (See discussion of feature-checking below.) &quot;Economy of representation&quot; requires that grammatical structures exist for a purpose. The structure of a sentence should be no larger or more complex than required to satisfy constraints on grammaticality.

Within minimalism, economy—recast in terms of the &quot;strong minimalist thesis&quot; (SMT)—has acquired increased importance. The 2016 book entitled &quot;Why Only Us&quot;—co-authored by Noam Chomsky and Robert Berwick—defines the strong minimalist thesis as follows:

Under the strong minimalist thesis, language is a product of inherited traits as developmentally enhanced through intersubjective communication and social exposure to individual languages (amongst other things). This reduces to a minimum the &quot;innate&quot; component (the genetically inherited component) of the language faculty, which has been criticized over many decades and is separate from the developmental psychology component.

Intrinsic to the syntactic model (e.g. the Y/T-model) is the fact that social and other factors play no role in the computation that takes place in narrow syntax; what Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch refer to as faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLN), as distinct from faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB). Thus, narrow syntax only concerns itself with interface requirements, also called legibility conditions. SMT can be restated as follows: syntax, narrowly defined, is a product of the requirements of the interfaces and nothing else. This is what is meant by &quot;Language is an optimal solution to legibility conditions&quot; (Chomsky 2001:96).

Interface requirements force deletion of features that are uninterpretable at a particular interface, a necessary consequence of Full Interpretation. A PF object must only consist of features that are interpretable at the articulatory-perceptual (A-P) interface; likewise a LF object must consist of features that are interpretable at the conceptual-intentional (C-I) interface. The presence of an uninterpretable feature at either interface will cause the derivation to crash.

Narrow syntax proceeds as a set of operations—Merge, Move and Agree—carried out upon a numeration (a selection of features, words etc., from the lexicon) with the sole aim of removing all uninterpretable features before being sent via Spell-Out to the A-P and C-I interfaces. The result of these operations is a hierarchical syntactic structure that captures the relationships between the component features.

=== Technical innovations ===
The exploration of minimalist questions has led to several radical changes in the technical apparatus of transformational generative grammatical theory. Some of the most important are:
*the elimination of the distinction between deep structure and surface structure in favour of a derivational approach
*the elimination of X-bar theory in favour of bare phrase structure (see below)
*the elimination of indexation in favour of Move or Agree
*the elimination of the notion of government in favour of feature-checking
*the idea that feature-checking—which matches interpretable and uninterpretable features, and subsequently deletes the latter—might be responsible for all structure-building operations, including Merge, Move, and Agree (see below)
*the idea that syntactic derivations proceed by clearly delineated stages called &quot;phases&quot; (see below)
*the specification that there are exactly two points where syntax interacts with other components: a &quot;spell-out&quot; point between syntax and the interface with phonetic form (PF), and an additional point of interaction with logical form (LF)

== Basic operations ==
Early versions of minimalism posits two basic operations: Merge and Move. Earlier theories of grammar—as well as early minimalist analyses—treat phrasal and movement dependencies differently than current minimalist analyses. In the latter, Merge and Move are different outputs of a single operation. Merge of two syntactic objects (SOs) is called &quot;external Merge&quot;. As for Move, it is defined as an instance of &quot;internal Merge&quot;, and involves the re-merge of an already merged SO with another SO. In regards to how Move should be formulated, there continues to be active debate about this, but the differences between current proposals are relatively minute.

More recent versions of minimalism recognize three operations: Merge (i.e. external Merge), Move (i.e. internal Merge), and Agree. The emergence of Agree as a basic operation is related to the mechanism which forces movement, which is mediated by feature-checking.

=== Merge ===

In its original formulation, Merge is a function that takes two objects (α and β) and merges them into an unordered set with a label, either α or β. In more recent treatments, the possibility of the derived syntactic object being un-labelled is also considered; this is called &quot;simple Merge&quot; (see Label section).

In the version of Merge which generates a label, the label identifies the properties of the phrase. Merge will always occur between two syntactic objects: a head and a non-head. For example, Merge can combine the two lexical items &quot;drink&quot; and &quot;water&quot; to generate &quot;drink water&quot;. In the Minimalist Program, the phrase is identified with a label. In the case of &quot;drink water&quot;, the label is &quot;drink&quot; since the phrase acts as a verb. This can be represented in a typical syntax tree as follows, with the name of the derived syntactic object (SO) determined either by the lexical item (LI) itself, or by the category label of the LI:

Merge can operate on already-built structures; in other words, it is a recursive operation. If Merge were not recursive, then this would predict that only two-word utterances are grammatical. (This is relevant for child language acquisition, where children are observed to go through a so-called &quot;two-word&quot; stage. This is discussed below in the implications section.) As illustrated in the accompanying tree structure, if a new head (here γ) is merged with a previously formed syntactic object (a phrase, here {α, {α, β} }), the function has the form Merge (γ, {α, {α, β}}) → {γ, {γ, {α, {α, β}}}}. Here, γ is the head, so the output label of the derived syntactic object is γ.

Chomsky&#x27;s earlier work defines each lexical item as a syntactic object that is associated with both categorical features and selectional features. Features—more precisely formal features—participate in feature-checking, which takes as input two expressions that share the same feature, and checks them off against each other in a certain domain. In some but not all versions of minimalism, projection of selectional features proceeds via feature-checking, as required by locality of selection:

Selection as projection: As illustrated in the bare phrase structure tree for the sentence The girl &quot;ate the food&quot;; a notable feature is the absence of distinct labels (see Labels below). Relative to Merge, the selectional features of a lexical item determine how it participates in Merge:
* eat The Lexical Item &quot;eat&quot; is a transitive verb, and so assigns two theta-roles (Agent, Theme). Theta-roles can be represented as D-features on V—VD,D—and these D features force the verb to merge with two DPs. As illustrated in the tree, the first application of Merge generates the Verb-Complement sequence (&quot;ate the food&quot;), with the DP &quot;the food&quot; in complement position. The second application of Merge generates the equivalent of a Specifier-VP sequence (&quot;the girl ate the food&quot;), with the DP &quot;the girl&quot; in specifier position.
* PAST The Lexical Item for &quot;past tense&quot; is represented as the feature. Tense requires the presence of a DP subject and a verb; this is notated as TD,V. (Or more precisely as TEPP:D.NOM,V. The &quot;EPP&quot; notation stands for &quot;extended projection principle&quot; feature, NOM stands for &quot;nominative case&quot;.) Tense first merges with a V-projection, and the output then combines the DP subject &quot;the girl&quot;, which, in some sense, merges twice: once within the V-projection, and once within the T-projection. (See discussion of Move below.)
*&quot;C&quot;∅ The Lexical Item for clause-typing is a phonologically null C∅. By hypothesis, all sentences are clauses (CPs), so the root clause &quot;The girl ate the food&quot; is analyzed as CP. Given the assumption that all phrases are headed (endocentric), CP must be headed by C. C selects TP, notated as CT.

Feature-checking: When a feature is &quot;checked&quot;, it is removed.

* Merge(V,DP) checks off one of the D features of V. We see this on the intermediate V projection, where the complement position is realized by the DP &quot;the food.&quot; This D-feature is then &quot;checked&quot; and we can see one of the D features is removed at the intermediate V-projection. Merge(V,DP) applies a second time, and the maximal V in the tree has no D features because at this stage of the derivation both D features have been &quot;checked&quot;. Specifically, the D feature of the intermediate V-projection is &quot;checked&quot; by the DP &quot;the girl&quot; in the specifier position of V.
* Merge(T,VP) checks off the V-feature of T; Merge(T,DP) checks off the D-feature of T.
* Merge(C,TP) checks off the T-feature of C.

Locality of selection (LOS) is a principle that forces selectional features to participate in feature checking. LOS states that a selected element must combine with the head that selects it either as complement or specifier. Selection is local in the sense that there is a maximum distance that can occur between a head and what it selects: selection must be satisfied with the projection of the head.

=== Move ===
Move arises via &quot;internal Merge&quot;.

Movement as feature-checking: The original formulation of the extended projection principle states that clauses must contain a subject in the specifier position of spec TP/IP. In the tree above, there is an EPP feature. This is a strong feature which forces re-Merge—which is also called internal merge—of the DP &quot;the girl&quot;. The EPP feature in the tree above is a subscript to the T head, which indicates that T needs a subject in its specifier position. This causes the movement of &lt;the girl&gt; to the specifier position of T.

== Beyond basic operations ==

=== Label ===
A substantial body of literature in the minimalist tradition focuses on how a phrase receives a proper label. The debate about labeling reflects the deeper aspirations of the minimalist program, which is to remove all redundant elements in favour of the simplest analysis possible. While earlier proposals focus on how to distinguish adjunction from substitution via labeling, more recent proposals attempt to eliminate labeling altogether, but they have not been universally accepted.

Adjunction and substitution: Chomsky&#x27;s 1995 monograph entitled &quot;The Minimalist Program&quot; outlines two methods of forming structure: adjunction and substitution. The standard properties of segments, categories, adjuncts, and specifiers are easily constructed. In the general form of a structured tree for adjunction and substitution, α is an adjunct to X, and α is substituted into SPEC, X position. α can raise to aim for the Xmax position, and it builds a new position that can either be adjoined to [Y-X] or is SPEC, X, in which it is termed the &#x27;target&#x27;. At the bottom of the tree, the minimal domain includes SPEC Y and Z along with a new position formed by the raising of α which is either contained within Z, or is Z.Adjunction: Before the introduction of bare phrase structure, adjuncts did not alter information about bar-level, category information, or the target&#x27;s (located in the adjoined structure) head. An example of adjunction using the X-bar theory notation is given below for the sentence Luna bought the purse yesterday. Observe that the adverbial modifier yesterday is sister to VP and dominated by VP. Thus, the addition of the modifier does not change information about the bar-level: in this case the maximal projection VP. In the minimalist program, adjuncts are argued to exhibit a different, perhaps more simplified, structure. Chomsky (1995) proposes that adjunction forms a two-segment object/category consisting of: (i) the head of a label; (ii) a different label from the head of the label. The label L is not considered a term in the structure that is formed because it is not identical to the head S, but it is derived from it in an irrelevant way. If α adjoins to S, and S projects, then the structure that results is L = {&lt;H(S), H(S)&gt;,{α,S}}, where the entire structure is replaced with the head S, as well as what the structure contains. The head is what projects, so it can itself be the label or can determine the label irrelevantly. In the new account developed in bare phrase structure, the properties of the head are no longer preserved in adjunction structures, as the attachment of an adjunct to a particular XP following adjunction is non-maximal, as shown in the figure below that illustrates adjunction in BPS. Such an account is applicable to XPs that are related to multiple adjunction.

:::AdjunctionDEFINITION: &lt;H(S), H (S)&gt;, where Label = {&lt;H(S), H(S)&gt;,{α,S}} (S = head)
Substitution forms a new category consisting of a head (H), which is the label, and an element being projected. Some ambiguities may arise if the features raising, in this case α, contain the entire head and the head is also XMAX.
:::SubstitutionDEFINITION: Label = {H(S), {α,S}).
Labeling algorithm (LA): Merge is a function that takes two objects (α and β) and merges them into an unordered set with a label (either α or β), where the label indicates the kind of phrase that is built via merge. But this labeling technique is too unrestricted since the input labels make incorrect predictions about which lexical categories can merge with each other. Consequently, a different mechanism is needed to generate the correct output label for each application of Merge in order to account for how lexical categories combine; this mechanism is referred to as the &quot;labeling algorithm&quot; (LA).

* Labeling via selection and agreement. In a series of articles, Chomsky has proposed that labels are determined by a labeling algorithm which operates after syntactic structures have been built. This mechanism departs from previous version of generative grammar in that the labels of a phrase are now determined endocentrically. There are a number of proposals that have been hypothesized to explain the exact nature of the labeling algorithm. In earlier discussions, Chomsky hypothesizes that determining the label of a set-theoretic object (α, β) depends on either semantic selection or agreement holding between α and β. Although this formulation of the LA is consistent with the basic principles of X-bar theory, reference to external relations like semantic selection and agreement are at odds with the goal of developing a parsimonious account.
:::Labeling Algorithm (version 1): The output of Merge (α, β) is labeled by α if:
:::(a) α selects β as its semantic argument, or
:::(b) α agrees with β, meaning, β is led to α because of Spec-head agreement (feature checking) (Chomsky 1995b;2000)

* Labeling via external and internal Merge. Proposed by Chomsky in 2008, in this version of LA, clause (a) means that the output of Merge(V, DP) would be labelled V because V is a lexical item. Clause (b) means that if a syntactic object is re-introduced into the derivation via internal Merge—as it is when a subject DP moves to Spec,TP—then the output of Merge(DP,T) would be labelled T. However, this version of LA uses a disjunctive definition of labelling, one for external Merge (clause a), and one for internal merge (clause b).
:::Labeling algorithm (version 2): The output of Merge (α, β) is labeled by α if
:::(a) α is a lexical item (LI), or
:::(b) β is internally merged to α (Chomsky 2008: 145)

* Labeling via prominence. Chomsky (2013) suggests an even simpler LA based on the notion of &quot;prominence&quot;. In this version of the LA, the label is independently determined by whichever properties of UG (universal grammar) allow us to identify a &quot;prominent Lexical Item. Due to this revision, it becomes questionable whether Merge plays any role at all in labelling/projection, since it is now redundant.
:::Labeling algorithm (version 3): The label/head of an SO (syntactic object) Σ is the most prominent Lexical Item within Σ. (Chomsky 2013)

* Labeling via set formation: Further simplification is given in Chomsky (2000), where Merge is simplified to an elementary set-formation operation, meaning that syntactic objects (SOs) are no longer associated with non-terminal nodes, like projections. Labels are now only the syntactically relevant &quot;head&quot; of a phrase that are determined independently by the LA. With this theory, labeling leaves bare phrase structure (BPS) completely projection-free.

:::Labeling algorithm (version 4): Merge(α, β) = {α, β}.

Recently, the suitability of a labeling algorithm has been questioned, as syntacticians have identified a number of limitations associated with what Chomsky has proposed. It has been argued that two kinds of phrases pose a problem. The labeling algorithm proposes that labelling occurs via minimal search, a process where a single lexical item within a phrasal structure acts as a head and provides the label for the phrase. It has been noted that minimal search cannot account for the following two possibilities:

# {H, H} where both constituents are lexical items.
# {XP, YP} where neither constituent is a lexical item.

In each of these cases, there is no lexical item acting as a prominent element (i.e. a head). Given this, it is not possible through minimal search to extract a label for the phrase. While Chomsky has proposed solutions for these cases, it has been argued that the fact that such cases are problematic suggests that the labeling algorithm violates the tenets of the minimalist program, as it departs from conceptual necessity.

Other linguistic phenomena that create instances where Chomsky&#x27;s labeling algorithm cannot assign labels include predicate fronting, embedded topicalization, scrambling (free movement of constituents), stacked structures (which involve multiple specifiers).

Given these criticisms of Chomsky&#x27;s labeling algorithm, it has been recently argued that the labeling algorithm theory should be eliminated altogether and replaced by another labeling mechanism. The symmetry principle has been identified as one such mechanism, as it provides an account of labeling that assigns the correct labels even when phrases are derived through complex linguistic phenomena.

=== Agree ===
Starting in the early 2000s, attention turned from feature-checking as a condition on movement to feature-checking as a condition on agreement. This line of inquiry was initiated in Chomsky (2000), and formulated as follows:

::Agree: α can agree with β if and only if:
:::(a) α carries at least one unvalued and uninterpretable feature and
::::β carries a matching interpretable and valued feature
:::(b) α c-commands β
:::(c) β is the closest goal to α
:::(d) β bears an unvalued uninterpretable feature (from Zeijlstra 2012)

Many recent analyses assume that Agree is a basic operation, on par with Merge and Move. This is currently a very active area of research, and there remain numerous open questions:

# Is Agree a primitive operation?
# What is the &quot;direction&quot; of the Agree relation: does it apply top-down, bottom-up, or both?
# Is Agree a syntactic operation, a post-syntactic operation that applies at PF, or both?
# Is the Agree relation restricted to certain feature types?
# Is the Agree relation subject to locality restrictions?
# Which phenomena are best modelled by the Agree relation?
# Is the Agree relation conditioned by other factors, or does it apply freely?
# How does Agree interact with other operations such as Merge and Label?

Co-indexation as feature checking: co-indexation markers such as {k, m, o, etc.}
== Derivation by phase ==

A phase is a syntactic domain first hypothesized by Noam Chomsky in 1998. It is a domain where all derivational processes operate and where all features are checked. A phase consists of a phase head and a phase domain. Once any derivation reaches a phase and all the features are checked, the phase domain is sent to transfer and becomes invisible to further computations. The literature shows three trends relative to what is generally considered to be a phase:

# All CPs and some vPs are phases: Chomsky originally proposed that CP and vP in transitive and unergative verbs constitute phases. This was proposed based on the phrases showing strong phase effects discussed above.
# A specified set of phrases are phases: CP, DP (based on parallels between DP and CP), all &quot;v&quot;Ps, TP (in some languages)
# Every phrase is a phase, with moved constituents cycling through all intermediate phrase edges.

=== Strong phases: CP and &quot;v&quot;P ===
A simple sentence can be decomposed into two phases, CP and &quot;v&quot;P. Chomsky considers CP and &quot;v&quot;P to be strong phases because of their propositional content, as well as their interaction with movement and reconstruction.

Propositional content: CP and vP are both propositional units, but for different reasons. CP is considered a propositional unit because it is a full clause that has tense and force: example (1) shows that the complementizer &quot;that&quot; in the CP phase conditions finiteness (here past tense) and force (here, affirmative) of the subordinate clause. &quot;v&quot;P is considered a propositional unit because all the theta roles are assigned in &quot;v&quot;P: in (2) the verb &quot;ate&quot; in the &quot;v&quot;P phase assigns the Theme theta role to the DP &quot;the cake&quot; and the Agent theta-role to the DP &quot;Mary&quot;.
 (1) &quot;John said&quot; [CP that Mary will eat the cake ].

 (2) [CP &quot;Mary&quot; [&quot;v&quot;P &lt;Mary&gt; &quot;ate the cake&quot; ].

Movement: CP and vP can be the focus of pseudo-cleft movement, showing that CP and &quot;v&quot;P form syntactic units: this is shown in (3) for the CP constituent &quot;that John is bringing&quot; &quot;the dessert&quot;, and in (4) for the &quot;v&quot;P constituent &quot;arrive tomorrow&quot;.
 (3) a. &quot;Mary said&quot; [CP that John is bringing the dessert].
 b. &quot;What Mary said was&quot; [CP that John is bringing the dessert].

 (4) a. &quot;Alice will&quot; [vP arrive tomorrow].
 b. &quot;What Alice will do is&quot; [vP arrive tomorrow].
Reconstruction. When a moved constituent is interpreted in its original position to satisfy binding principles, this is called reconstruction. Evidence from reconstruction is consistent with the claim that the moved phrase stops at the left edge of CP and &quot;v&quot;P phases.

* Reconstruction at left edge of CP phase: In (5), the reflexive &quot;himself&quot; can be understood as being co-referential with either &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Fred&quot;, where co-reference is indicated by co-indexation. However, the constituent that contains &quot;himself&quot;, namely the sentence-initial phrase [&quot;which picture of himself&quot;], is not c-commanded by either &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Fred&quot;, as is required by Principle A of the Binding Theory. The fact that co-indexation of &quot;himself&quot; with either one of &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Fred&quot; is possible is taken as evidence that the constituent containing the reflexive, namely [&quot;which picture of himself&quot;] has moved through a reconstruction site—here the left edge of the lower CP phrase—from where it can satisfy Principle A of the Binding Theory relative to the DP &quot;John&quot;.
*Reconstruction at left edge of vP phase: In (6), bound variable anaphora requires that the pronoun &quot;he&quot; must be c-commanded by &quot;every student&quot;, but Condition C of the Binding Theory requires that the R-expression &quot;Mary&quot; be free. However, these requirements cannot be satisfied by the sentence-initial constituent that contains both &quot;he&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot;, namely the phrase [&quot;which of the papers that he gave Mary&quot;]. The fact that the sentence is nevertheless well-formed is taken to indicate that this phrase must have moved through a reconstruction site first, from where it is interpreted. The left edge of the &quot;v&quot;P phase is the only position where these binding requirements could be satisfied: (i) &quot;every student&quot; c-commands the pronoun &quot;he&quot;; (ii) &quot;Mary&quot; is free from any c-commanding DP.
 (5) a. [Which picture of himselfk] did Johnk think ___ Fredj liked __?
 b. [Which picture of himselfj] did Johnk think ___ Fredj liked __?

 (6) [Which of the papers that hek gave Maryj] did every studentk __ ask herj to read __ carefully?

=== Phase edge ===
Chomsky theorized that syntactic operations must obey the phase impenetrability condition (PIC) which essentially requires that movement be from the left-edge of a phase. The PIC has been variously formulated in the literature. The extended projection principle feature that is on the heads of phases triggers the intermediate movement steps to phase edges.

====Phase impenetrability condition (PIC)====

Movement of a constituent out of a phase is (in the general case) only permitted if the constituent has first moved to the left edge of the phase (XP).

The edge of a head X is defined as the residue outside of X&#x27;, in either specifier of X and adjuncts to XP.

English successive cyclic wh-movement obeys the PIC. Sentence (7) has two phases: &quot;v&quot;P and CP. Relative to the application of movement, &quot;who&quot; moves from the (lower) &quot;v&quot;P phase to the (higher) CP phase in two steps:

*Step 1: who moves from the complement position of VP to the left edge of &quot;v&quot;P, and the EPP feature of the verb forces movement of who to the edge of vP.
* Step 2: who moves from the left edge of the lower &quot;v&quot;P phase to the specifier of the (higher) CP phase.

 (7) [CP &quot;Who did you&quot; [vP &quot;see&quot; who]]?

====Medumba wh-movement====
Another example of PIC can be observed when analyzing A&#x27;-agreement in Medumba. A&#x27;-agreement is a term used for the morphological reflex of A&#x27;-movement of an XP. In Medumba, when the moved phrase reaches a phase edge, a high low tonal melody is added to the head of the complement of the phase head. Since A&#x27;-agreement in Medumba requires movement, the presence of agreement on the complements of phase heads shows that the wh-word moves to the edges of phases and obeys PIC.

Example:

The sentence (2a) has a high low tone on the verb nɔ́ʔ and tense ʤʉ̀n, therefore is grammatical.

(2a) [CP á wʉ́ Wàtɛ̀t nɔ́ɔ̀ʔ [vP ⁿ-ʤʉ́ʉ̀n á?]]

&#x27;Who did Watat see?&#x27;

The sentence (2b) does not have a high low tone on the verb nɔ́ʔ and tense ʤʉ̀n, therefore is not grammatical.

(2b) *[CP á wʉ́ Wàtɛ̀t nɔ́ʔ [vP ⁿ-ʤʉ́n á?]]

*&#x27;Who did Watat see?&#x27;

To generate the grammatical sentence (2a), the &quot;wh&quot;-phrase &quot;á wʉ́&quot; moves from the vP phase to the CP phase. To obey PIC, this movement must take two steps since the wh-phrase needs to move to the edge of the vP phase in order to move out of the lower phase.

* Step 1: First, the &quot;wh&quot;-phrase moves from the complement of VP to the edge of the vP phase to avoid violating PIC. In this position, the agreement is expressed on the verb &quot;ʤʉ̀n&quot; and surfaces as a high low (HL) tone melody (&quot;ⁿ-ʤʉ́ʉ̀n&quot;). The agreement is expressed on the verb which is the head of the complement of the v phase head.

* Step 2: Now that it is at the edge of the vP phase, the &quot;wh&quot;-phrase is able to leave the vP phase and move to the Spec-C position of the CP phase. Agreement is expressed on the tense &quot;nɔ́ʔ&quot; as a high low tone melody (nɔ́ɔ̀ʔ). The tense which agreement is expressed on is the head of the complement of the C phase head
One can confirm that A&#x27; agreement only occurs with movement by examining sentences where the wh-phrase does not move. In sentence (2c) below, one can observe that there is no high low tone melody on the verb nɔ́ʔ and tense fá since the wh-word does not move to the edge of the vP and CP phase.

(2c) [m-ɛ́n nɔ́ʔ fá bɔ̀ á wʉ́ á]

&#x27;The child gave the bag to who?&#x27;

=== Cycle ===
The spell-out of a string is assumed to be cyclic, but there is no consensus about how to implement this. Some analyses adopt an iterative spell-out algorithm, with spell-out applying after each application of Merge. Other analyses adopt an opportunistic algorithm, where spell-out applies only if it must. And yet others adopt a wait-til-the-end algorithm, with spell-out occurring only at the end of the derivation.

There is no consensus about the cyclicality of the Agree relation: it is sometimes treated as cyclic, sometimes as a-cyclic, and sometimes as counter-cyclic.

== Implications ==

=== Connections to other models ===

==== Principles and parameters ====
From a theoretical standpoint, and in the context of generative grammar, the Minimalist Program is an outgrowth of the principles and parameters (P&amp;P) model, considered to be the ultimate standard theoretical model that generative linguistics developed from the early 1980s through to the early 1990s. The Principles and Parameters model posits a fixed set of principles (held to be valid for all human languages) that—when combined with settings for a finite set of parameters—could describe the properties that characterize the language competence that a child eventually attains. One aim of the Minimalist Program is to ascertain how much of the Principles and Parameters model can be taken to result from the hypothethesized optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty. In turn, some aspects of the Principles and Parameters model provide technical tools and foundational concepts that inform the broad outlines of the Minimalist Program.

==== X-bar theory ====
X-bar theory—first introduced in Chomsky (1970) and elaborated in Jackendoff (1977) among other works—was a major milestone in the history of the development of generative grammar. It contains the following postulates:
* Each phrase has a head (endocentric) and it projects to a larger phrase.
* Heads are feature complexes that consist of a primitive feature.
* The general X-bar schema in (1) is a property of universal grammar (UG):
:(1) X&#x27; → X...
::X″ → [Spec, X&#x27;] X&#x27;
In the chapter &quot;Phrase Structure&quot; of &quot;The Handbook of Contemporary Syntactic Theory&quot;, Naoki Fukui determined three kinds of syntactic relationships, (1) &quot;Dominance&quot;: the hierarchical categorization of the lexical items and constituents of the structure, (2) &quot;Labeling&quot;: the syntactic category of each constituent and (3) &quot;Linear order&quot; (or &quot;Precedence&quot;): the left-to-right order of the constituents (essentially the existence of the X-bar schemata). Whereas X-bar theory was composed of the three relationships, bare phrase structure only encodes the first two relationships. Claims 1 and 2 have almost completely withstood their original forms through grammatical theory development, unlike Claim 3, which has not. Claim 1 will be eliminated later on in favour of projection-less nodes.

In 1980, the principles and parameters (P&amp;P) approach took place which marked the emergence of different theories that stray from rule-based grammars/rules, and have instead been replaced with multiple segments of UG such as X-bar theory, case theory, etc. During this time, PS rules disappeared because they have proved to be redundant since they recap what is in the lexicon. Transformational rules have survived with a few amendments to how they are expressed. For complex traditional rules, they do not need to be defined and they can be dwindled to a general schema called Move-α—which means things can be moved anywhere. The only two sub-theories that withstood time within P&amp;P is Move-α. Of the fundamental properties mentioned above, X-bar theory accounts for hierarchical structure and endocentricity, while Move-α accounts for unboundedness and non-local dependencies. A few years later, an effort was made to merge X-bar theory with Move-a by suggesting that structures are built from the bottom going up (using adjunction or substitution depending on the target structure):
* Features are discharged as soon as a head projects. This follows from the idea that phrases are endocentric (headed): the head is the obligatory component of a phrasal constituent and projects its essential features.
*There is no X-bar schema, and no requirements for maximal projection to be specified as bar levels. This is a consequence of the claim that features discharged by projection of the head.
* At any given bar level, iteration is possible. This is based on the idea that phrase structure composition is infinite.
* Adjunction is responsible for movement and structure-building. This is based on the idea that transformational operations are fundamental.
* Projections are closed by agreement. This based on the idea that in some languages (Japanese), phrases do not close and elements can be added to keep expanding it. (This is not the case in English.)
X-bar theory had a number of weaknesses and was replaced by bare phrase structure, but some X-bar theory notions were borrowed by BPS. Labeling in bar phrase structure specifically was adapted from conventions of X-bar theory; however, in order to get the &quot;barest&quot; phrase structures there are some dissimilarities. BPS differs from X-bar theory in the following ways:
# BPS is explicitly derivational. That is, it is built from the bottom up, bit by bit. In contrast, X-bar theory is representational—a structure for a given construction is built in one fell swoop, and lexical items are inserted into the structure.
# BPS does not have a preconceived phrasal structure, while in X-bar theory every phrase has a specifier, a head, and a complement.
# BPS permits only binary branching, while X-bar theory permits both binary and unary branching.
# BPS does not distinguish between a &quot;head&quot; and a &quot;terminal&quot;, while some versions of X-bar theory require such a distinction.
# BPS incorporates features into their structure, such as Xmax and Xmin, while X-bar theory contains levels, such as XP, X&#x27;, X
#BPS accounts cross-linguistically as maximal projections can be perceived at an XP level or an X&#x27; level, whereas X-bar theory only perceives XP as the maximal projection.

The main reasoning behind the transition from X-bar theory to BPS is the following:
# Eliminating the notion of non-branching domination
# Eliminating the necessity of bar-level projections
The examples below show the progression of syntax structure from X-bar theory (the theory preceding BPS), to specifier-less structure. BPS satisfies the principles of UG using at minimum two interfaces such as &#x27;conceptual-intentional and sensorimotor systems&#x27; or a third condition not specific to language but still satisfying the conditions put forth by the interface.

==== Functionalism ====

In linguistics, there are differing approaches taken to explore the basis of language: two of these approaches are formalism and functionalism. It has been argued that the formalist approach can be characterized by the belief that rules governing syntax can be analyzed independently from things such as meaning and discourse. In other words, according to formalists, syntax is an independent system (referred to as the autonomy of syntax). By contrast, functionalists believe that syntax is determined largely by the communicative function that it serves. Therefore, syntax is not kept separate from things such as meaning and discourse.

Under functionalism, there is a belief that language evolved alongside other cognitive abilities, and that these cognitive abilities must be understood in order to understand language. In Chomsky&#x27;s theories prior to MP, he had been interested exclusively in formalism, and had believed that language could be isolated from other cognitive abilities. However, with the introduction of MP, Chomsky considers aspects of cognition (e.g. the conceptual-intentional (CI) system and the sensory motor (SM) system) to be linked to language. Rather than arguing that syntax is a specialized model which excludes other systems, under MP, Chomsky considers the roles of cognition, production, and articulation in formulating language. Given that these cognitive systems are considered in an account of language under MP, it has been argued that in contrast to Chomsky&#x27;s previous theories, MP is consistent with functionalism.

==== Dependency grammar ====
There is a trend in minimalism that shifts from constituency-based to dependency-based structures. Minimalism falls under the dependency grammar umbrella by virtue of adopting bare phrase structure, label-less trees, and specifier-less syntax.

* bare phrase structure: merge does away with non-branching nodes and bar levels, which are replaced by minimal projections (XMIN) and maximal projections (XMAX):
** a minimal projection does not dominate other lexical items or categories
** a maximal projection is unable to project any higher.
* label-less trees: to simplify phrase structures, Noam Chomsky argues that the labels of the category are unnecessary, and therefore do not need to be included, leading to what is now known as label-less trees. In lieu of a specific category in the projection, the lexical item that is classified as a head become its own label.
* specifier-less syntax: the generalization of Abney&#x27;s (1987) DP hypothesis gives rise to the development of specifier-less syntax. Lexical items that would have been analyzed as a specifier in earlier versions of X-bar theory—e.g. Determiners were introduced in [Spec,N]; Auxiliaries were introduced in [Spec,V]—become the heads of their own phrases. For example, D introduces NP as a complement; T introduces VP as a complement.

=== First language (L1) acquisition ===
As discussed by Helen Goodluck and Nina Kazanin in their 2020 paper, certain aspects of the minimalist program provide insightful accounts for first language (L1) acquisition by children.

* Two-word stage: Merge is the operation where two syntactic elements are brought together and combined to form a constituent. The head of the pair determines the constituent&#x27;s label, but the element that becomes the head depends on the language. English is a left-headed language, such that the element on the left is the head; Japanese is a right-headed language, such that the element on the right is the head. Merge (a critical operation in MP) can account for the patterns of word-combination, and more specifically word-order, observed in children&#x27;s first language acquisition. In first language acquisition, it has been observed that young children combine two words in ways that are consistent with either the head-initial or head-final pattern of the language they are learning. Children learning English produce &quot;pivot&quot; words (e.g. see) before &quot;open&quot; words (e.g. shoe), which is consistent with the head-initial pattern of English, whereas children learning Japanese produce &quot;open&quot; words before &quot;pivot&quot; words.
* Emergence of headed combinations: Within the minimalist program, bare phrase structure, described in detail above, accounts for children&#x27;s first language acquisition better than earlier theories of phrase structure building, such as X-bar theory. This is because, under bare phrase structure, children do not need to account for the intermediate layers of structure that appear in X-bar theory. The account of first language acquisition provided under bare phrase structure is simpler than that provided under X-bar theory. In particular, children typically progress from (unordered) conjunctions to headed combinations. This trajectory can be modelled as a progression from symmetric Merge (where the output label output of the derived syntactic object is indeterminate) to asymmetric Merge (where the output label of the derived syntactic object is determinate; i.e. endocentric/headed).

== Criticisms ==
In the late 1990s, David E. Johnson and Shalom Lappin published the first detailed critiques of Chomsky&#x27;s minimalist program. This technical work was followed by a lively debate with proponents of minimalism on the scientific status of the program. The original article provoked several replies and two further rounds of replies and counter-replies in subsequent issues of the same journal.

Lappin et al. argue that the minimalist program is a radical departure from earlier Chomskyan linguistic practice that is not motivated by any new empirical discoveries, but rather by a general appeal to &quot;perfection&quot;, which is both empirically unmotivated and so vague as to be unfalsifiable. They compare the adoption of this paradigm by linguistic researchers to other historical paradigm shifts in natural sciences and conclude that of the minimalist program has been an &quot;unscientific revolution&quot;, driven primarily by Chomsky&#x27;s authority in linguistics. The several replies to the article in &quot;Natural Language and Linguistic Theory&quot; Volume 18 number 4 (2000) make a number of different defenses of the minimalist program. Some claim that it is not in fact revolutionary or not in fact widely adopted, while others agree with Lappin and Johnson on these points, but defend the vagueness of its formulation as not problematic in light of its status as a research program rather than a theory (see above).

Prakash Mondal has published a book-length critique of the minimalist model of grammar, arguing that there are a number of contradictions, inconsistencies and paradoxes within the formal structure of the system. In particular, his critique examines the consequences of adopting some rather innocuous and widespread assumptions or axioms about the nature of language as adopted in the Minimalist model of the language faculty.

Developments in the minimalist program have also been critiqued by Hubert Haider, who has argued that minimalist studies routinely fail to follow scientific rigour. In particular, data compatible with hypotheses are filed under confirmation whereas crucial counter-evidence is largely ignored or shielded off by making ad hoc auxiliary assumptions. Moreover, the supporting data are biased towards SVO languages and are often based on the linguist&#x27;s introspection rather attempts to gather data in an unbiased manner by experimental means. Haider further refers to the appeal to an authority figure in the field, with dedicated followers taking the core premises of minimalism for granted as if they were established facts.

<doc id="585575" wikidata="Q532697" url="?curid=585575" title="Edge of Thorns">
<text>Edge of Thorns is the seventh studio album by the American heavy metal band Savatage, released on April 6, 1993, by Atlantic Records. It was the last Savatage album to feature guitarist Criss Oliva, who died six months after its release, and their first release with Zachary Stevens on lead vocals, following the departure of Jon Oliva from his role as singer in Savatage, although he did produce and write songs for the album.

The drums on this album sound different from other Savatage records, as Steve &quot;Doc&quot; Wacholz decided to use electronic drums. Although most of the drum kits sound authentic, a difference in the timbre of the toms can be heard.

&quot;All That I Bleed&quot; and &quot;Miles Away&quot; were the last songs Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva and the producer Paul O&#x27;Neill wrote together. For that, they are still Jon Oliva&#x27;s two favorites on the album.

The woman in the picture of the album art is Dawn Oliva, Criss Oliva&#x27;s wife. Gary Smith, who also did the front and back covers for &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot;, the front cover for &quot;Gutter Ballet&quot;, the back cover for &quot;&quot;, and all of Criss Oliva&#x27;s airbrushed guitars, painted the cover. The face in the trees is supposed to be Jon Oliva, though producer O&#x27;Neill disputes that despite its publication in a Criss Oliva interview from 1993. The cover is supposed to represent good (the woman) vs. evil (the face in the trees). According to Criss Oliva in a 1993 interview, &quot;The girl is surrounded by fear and innocence. But the face in the trees is evil. Everything around her is evil. It&#x27;s about good and evil. The songs on the CD reflect this, too.&quot;

The opening piano riff to the title track was used extensively in the MTV reality series &quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot; during scenes involving the hospitalization of Pedro Zamora.

==Reception==

In a contemporary review for &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine, where &quot;Edge of Thorns&quot; had been elected Album of the Month, Matthias Breusch wrote that Savatage had &quot;not lost a pinch of their compositional potential and energy&quot; and praised Criss Oliva&#x27;s guitar playing; he complimented new singer Zak Stevens&#x27; &quot;powerful, energetic voice&quot;, which was &quot;cleverly adapted to the melodic lines&quot; of the new songs, although he missed Jon Oliva&#x27;s &quot;crazy screams&quot;.

Modern reviews are generally positive. AllMusic Geoff Orens praised Savatage&#x27;s continuous experimentation of new sounds and wrote that &quot;Edge of Thorns&quot; moved away from the progressive metal of the two previous albums, being a &quot;leaner, more understated guitar-driven record&quot;, with the majority of the songs consisting &quot;of stripped-down metal anthems, recorded with less flashy guitar work and production&quot; than before. In his opinion, the new material fits well the &quot;less bombastic delivery&quot; of new singer Stevens, who does &quot;not have the emotional range that Oliva showed on &quot;Gutter Ballet&quot; and &quot;Streets&quot;&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff remarked how &quot;Edge of Thorns&quot; was &quot;a raucous return to old Savatage vein&quot;, with &quot;mountains of thirsty power riffs&quot; and &quot;an odd adherence to a goth past&quot;, mostly out of fashion in the alternative metal scene of the time. He was more critical of &quot;the band&#x27;s mellow tendencies&quot; and the murky long intros to the songs.

<text>B. Everett Jordan Lake is a reservoir in New Hope Valley, west of Cary and south of Durham in Chatham County, North Carolina, in the United States; the northernmost end of the lake extends into southwestern Durham County.

Part of the Jordan Lake State Recreation Area, the reservoir covers with a shoreline of at its standard water level of above sea level. Empounded in 1974, it was developed as part of a flood control project prompted by a particularly damaging tropical storm that hit the region downstream in September 1945. Constructed at an original cost of US$146,300,000, it is owned and operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which dammed and flooded the Haw River and New Hope River between 1973 and 1983.

==Construction==
The Jordan Lake Dam (also known as the B. Everett Jordan Project and the New Hope Dam) is located at upstream from the mouth of the Haw River in the upper Cape Fear River drainage basin. Completed in 1974 by the Nello L. Teer Company, it is in length and has a top elevation of above mean sea level.

During the construction of the reservoir, much of the area was permanently changed. The Durham and South Carolina Railroad was relocated from the New Hope basin to higher ground but its stations were not rebuilt, and the line itself was soon abandoned. Many farming families were relocated as the project was developed and several roads in eastern Chatham County were either rerouted or taken out of commission completely. Some of the roads were never demolished, but simply allowed to flood over. When the lake is at low water volume, many of these roads can still be seen and some have even been utilized for makeshift boat ramps.

Originally authorized in 1963 as the New Hope Lake Project, the reservoir was renamed in 1974 in memory of B. Everett Jordan, former US Senator from North Carolina.

==Water supply==
Jordan Lake serves as a major water supply for central North Carolina. Allocations made in Round 4 total 95.9% of the water supply pool. Governmental units allocated water from Jordan Lake in Round 4 (approved by the NC EMC on March 9, 2017) include the system jointly operated by Towns of Cary and Apex, which also serves Morrisville and the Wake County portion of Research Triangle Park (46.2%); Chatham County North (13%); City of Durham (16.5%); Town of Holly Springs (2%); Orange County (1.5%); Orange Water &amp; Sewer Authority (5%); City of Raleigh (4.7%); Town of Pittsboro (6%). However, in 2019, following the fourth round of allocations the City of Raleigh relinquished its 4.7% water supply pool allocation. As such it is expected that the remaining unallocated portion of the water supply pool is 8.8%.

Previously, allocations made in 2002 totalled 63 mgd (1% is often assumed to be equal to 1 mgd, but allocations are officially by percentage of the total water supply pool). Governmental units allocated water from Jordan Lake at that time were the Towns of Cary and Apex (32 mgd), Chatham County (6 mgd), City of Durham (10 mgd), Town of Holly Springs (2 mgd), Town of Morrisville (3.5 mgd), Orange County (1 mgd), Orange Water &amp; Sewer Authority (5 mgd), and Wake County - RTP South (3.5 mgd).
==Water quality==
Jordan Lake was declared as nutrient-sensitive waters (NSW) by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission from 1983, the year it was impounded. The lake is eutrophic or hyper-eutrophic owing to excessive nutrient levels.
Requirements of the federal Clean Water Act were triggered when the lake became impaired, including the need to set load reduction limits for point and nonpoint sources and enforce discharge limits.

The Jordan Lake Rules are designed to improve water quality in the lake. The rules were developed with extensive meetings, public hearings and negotiations between residents, environmental groups, local and state government agencies and other stakeholders. The rules mandate reducing pollution from wastewater discharges, stormwater runoff from new and existing development, agriculture and fertilizer application.

From July 2011 several NC laws have been passed delaying and weakening the rules, culminating in a plan to deploy floating arrays of in-lake circulators intended to reduce harmful algae and excessive chlorophyll. However, they proved ineffective in a testing program and were removed in 2016.

On December 21, 2017, researchers at Duke University have discovered elevated levels of several perfluorinated compounds an unregulated family of industrial chemicals including some that can raise cancer risks in Jordan Lake and drinking water treated by the town of Cary. Cary water treatment officials, who have independently confirmed the findings of Duke researchers, say the town&#x27;s water is safe to drink. They also point out that the compounds detected are still below health advisory levels set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Testing still continues as of March 8, 2018.

==Recreational use==

Swimming and boating are permitted in the lake.

==Shoreline trash cleanup==
Bald eagle habitat being endangered by trash submerged by the lake&#x27;s creation spurred volunteer efforts to clean up the shoreline and other sensitive areas.

In 2009 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers worked with local activists to establish Clean Jordan Lake, a nonprofit &quot;friends of the lake&quot; group. Volunteer cleanups aided by the Corps of Engineers began in 2010. Since then, Clean Jordan Lake has organized over 300 community service cleanups, formed the Adopt-A-Shoreline Program that comprises 19 groups that clean habitually littered areas three times per year, and formed the Adopt-A-Feeder Stream Program with semi-annual cleanups to prevent trash from reaching the lake. As of late 2017, 5,600 volunteers have removed 13,500 bags of trash (enough to fill 40 large dumpsters) and 4,300 tires. Clean Jordan Lake estimates that 80% of the trash is from stormwater runoff and 20% from recreational use of the lake.

<text>BESM-6 (, short for &quot;Большая электронно-счётная машина&quot;, i.e. &#x27;Large Electronic Calculating Machine&#x27;) was a Soviet electronic computer of the BESM series.

==Overview==
The BESM-6 was the most well-known and influential model of the series designed at the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering. The design was completed in 1965. Production started in 1968 and continued for the following 19 years.

Like its BESM-3 and BESM-4 predecessors, the original BESM-6 was transistor-based (however, the version used in the 1980s as a component of the Elbrus supercomputer was built with integrated circuits). The machine&#x27;s 48-bit processor ran at 10 MHz clock speed and featured two instruction pipelines, separate for the control and arithmetic units, and a data cache of sixteen 48-bit words. The system achieved a performance of 1 MIPS.
The CDC 6600, a common Western supercomputer when the BESM-6 was released, achieved about 2 MIPS.

The system memory was word-addressable using 15-bit addresses. The maximum addressable memory space was thus 32K words (192K bytes). A virtual memory system allowed to expand this up to 128K words (768K bytes).

The BESM-6 was widely used in USSR in the 1970s for various computation and control tasks. During the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project the processing of the space mission telemetry data was accomplished by a new computer complex which was based on a BESM-6. The Apollo-Soyuz mission&#x27;s data processing by Soviet scientists finished half an hour earlier than their American colleagues from NASA.

A total of 355 of these machines were built. Production ended in 1987.

As the first Soviet computer with an installed base that was large for the time, the BESM-6 gathered a dedicated developer community. Over the years several operating systems and compilers for programming languages such as Fortran, ALGOL and Pascal were developed.

A modification of the BESM-6 based on integrated circuits, with 2-3 times higher performance than the original machine, was produced in the 1980s under the name Elbrus-1K2 as a component of the Elbrus supercomputer.

In 1992, one of the last surviving BESM-6 machines was purchased by the Science Museum in London, England.

==Peripherals==
The BESM-6 could send output to an АЦПУ-128 (Алфавитно-Цифровое Печатающее Устройство) printer, and read input from punched cards in the GOST 10859 character set. A Consul-254 teletype, made by Zbrojovka Brno in Czechoslovakia, could be used for interactive sessions. When CRT terminals became available, the BESM-6 could be connected to Videoton 340 terminals.

<text>Gustav Heinrich Gans Edler Herr zu Putlitz (20 March 1821 – 5 September 1890) was a German author.

==Biography==
He was born at Retzin near Perleberg in West Prignitz, of the noble Gans zu Putlitz family. He studied law at Berlin and Heidelberg, and was attached to the provincial government at Magdeburg from 1846 to 1848. In 1853 he married Gräfin Elisabeth von Königsmark, and lived on his estate.

In 1863, he became director of the Court Theatre at Schwerin. This post he left in 1867, was for a short time chamberlain to the crown prince of Prussia, afterwards the Emperor Frederick III, and from 1873 to 1889 successfully directed the Court theatre at Karlsruhe. He died at Retzien.

==Works==
Putlitz made his debut as a writer with a volume of romantic fairy stories in verse, &quot;Was sich der Wald erzählt&quot; (Tales told among the woods; 1850), which attained great popularity (fifty editions) and found many imitators.

He was most successful in his comedies, notably &quot;Badekuren&quot; (Spa cures; 1859), much read in the schools of the United States; &quot;Das Herz vergessen&quot; (Forgetting the heart; 1853), also much read in U.S. schools; and &quot;Spielt nicht mit dem Feuer!&quot; (Don&#x27;t play with fire!; 1887). These portrayed life among the upper classes. Two notable dramas are &quot;Das Testament des Grossen Kurfürsten&quot; (1858) and &quot;Rolf Berndt&quot; (1881).

Of his novels, &quot;Die Alpenbraut&quot; (Bride of the Alps; 1870) and &quot;Walpurgis&quot; (1870) are distinguished by refined terseness of style and delicacy of portraiture. Also notable are &quot;Vergissmeinnicht&quot; (Forget me not; 1851), &quot;Brandenburgher Geschichten&quot; (Brandenburg Tales; 1862), &quot;Novellen&quot; (1863), and &quot;Funken unter der Asche&quot; (Sparks under the ashes; 1871).

===Editions===
A selection of his works, &quot;Ausgewählte Werke&quot;, was published in six volumes in Berlin (1872–1877), and a supplementary volume in 1888; his comedies, &quot;Lustspiele&quot;, appeared in two series of four volumes each (1851–1860 and 1869–1872).

<doc id="585583" wikidata="Q1158913" url="?curid=585583" title="Damrong Rajanubhab">
<text>Prince Tisavarakumara, the Prince Damrong Rajanubhab (; ) (21 June 1862 – 1 December 1943) was the founder of the modern Thai educational system as well as the modern provincial administration. He was an autodidact, a (self-taught) historian, and one of the most influential Thai intellectuals of his time.

Born as &quot;Phra Ong Chao Tisavarakumara&quot; (พระองค์เจ้าดิศวรกุมาร; &quot;Prince Tisavarakumarn&quot;), a son of King Mongkut with Consort Chum (เจ้าจอมมารดาชุ่ม; Chao Chom Manda Chum), a lesser royal wife; he initially learned Thai and Pali from private tutors, and English at the Royal School with Mr. Francis George Patterson. At the age of 14, he received his formal education in a special palace school created by his half-brother, King Chulalongkorn. He was given posts in the royal administration at an early age, becoming the commander of the Royal Guards Regiment in 1880 at age 18, and after several years, he worked at building army schools as well as modernizing the army in general. In 1887, he was appointed as grand-officer to the army (commander-in-chief). At the same time, he was chosen by the king to become the Minister of Education in his provisional cabinet. When King Chulalongkorn began his administrative reform program in 1892, Prince Damrong was chosen to lead the Ministry of the North (&quot;Mahatthai&quot;), which was converted into the Ministry of the Interior in 1894.

In his time as minister, he completely overhauled provincial administration. Many minor provinces were merged into larger ones, the provincial governors lost most of their autonomy when the post was converted into one appointed and salaried by the ministry, and a new administrative division—the &quot;monthon&quot; (circle) covering several provinces—was created. Formal education of administrative staff was introduced. Prince Damrong was among the most important advisors of the king, and considered second only to him in power.

== Political climate in Siam (1855–1893) ==

Legal traditions made little if any sense to foreigners. Nor did they have knowledge of the ancient political climate. Nor aware that the Bowring Treaty, which nearly all considered a significant advancement, had accomplished none of its objectives and had been set-back for the Siamese for the ensuing decades. Monthon reforms met with resistance, complicated by French interference in Siamese authority.

== Foreign advisers ==

Prince Damrong went to Europe in search of a European general advisor for the king by way of the Suez Canal. In December 1891, during a lunch hosted by the British ambassador to Egypt, Damrong met Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns, who had edited the first issue of &quot;Revue de Droit International et de Législation Comparée&quot; (&quot;Review of International Law and Comparative Legislation&quot;), which had appeared late-1868 with contributions from many noted scholars. Following a hasty correspondence with Bangkok, the prince was able to offer Rolin-Jaequemyns an annual salary of £3,000. Among his successors were Edward Strobel, the first American adviser in foreign affairs, followed by Jens Westengard, after whose tenure the position was downgraded to Adviser in Foreign Affairs, then Wolcott Pitkin, Eldon James, and Francis B. Sayre. After Damrong recruited Rolin-Jaequemyns, however, the advisers worked under Foreign Minister Devawongse Vaprokar and were recruited principally by their predecessors through Harvard connections. Strobel, Westengard, James, and Sayre were all Harvard law professors.

==Minister of the Interior==
The King had been impressed by the way Damrong organized the re-equipment of Thai artillery in his military capacity and how he successfully managed three schools and then the education ministry. Consequently, he promoted Damrong over the heads of the prince&#x27;s older half brothers. Prince Damrong was appointed Minister of the North in 1892 as part of a larger reform of the government. In 1894 the Southern and Western provinces were transferred to Damrong&#x27;s ministry, which became the Ministry of Interior. Damrong changed the character of the department by retiring older officials and replacing them with men loyal to him, more formally training hereditary provincial nobles for their administrative responsibilities, and taking a meritocratic approach to promotion, insisting that paths of promotion should be open to clerks. He also reorganized the ministry into a superintending Central Department, a Legal Department to deal with border incidents and extraterritoriality, and a Department of Provincial Administration. He attempted to prune the ministry of departments that were not relevant to provincial administration. However, the ministry soon took over functions normally assigned to other ministries because their operations required the cooperation of Interior staff and because of Damrong&#x27;s reputation for competence. Examples included Provincial Revenue, Irrigation, Forestry, Mines, and a provincial Gendarmerie.

Damrong&#x27;s most important reform, however, was the creation of the &quot;thesaphiban&quot; system by which the provincial administration was professionalized and made responsible to and dependent on the central government. The system was named after the &quot;thesaphiban&quot; or superintendent commissioners who exercised authority over in which groups of provinces called &quot;monthon&quot; or circles. An 1892 tour of northern provinces convinced Damrong that the provincial government was almost completely decoupled from the central government and in desperate need of reform. Through the 1890s, he created &quot;monthon&quot; and appointed &quot;thesaphiban&quot;. Administration was divided into judicial, financial, and administrative spheres and each &quot;thesaphiban&quot; had a commissioner for each of these divisions. Damrong and the &quot;thesaphiban&quot; also attacked the independence of provincial nobility by taking over their sources of revenue, such as judicial fees and transit duties, then using some of this money to pay them salaries. These provincial notables were then taken into the provincial administration and frequently transferred to other provinces, severing traditional local ties. Damrong and his ministry also sought to appoint Interior officials to run districts (the administrative division below provinces) and to have locally elected elders take responsibility for keeping the peace and collect taxes at the commune and village levels. These changes were formalized countrywide in the Ministry of Interior regulations of 1899, turning provincial governors from semi-independent nobles to officials of the central government. These reforms resulted in doubling of state revenue, the extension of some social services, and increased security in the provinces.

== Later years ==
After the death of King Chulalongkorn in 1910, the relationship with his successor King Vajiravudh was less productive. Prince Damrong finally resigned in 1915 from his post at the ministry, officially due to health problems, since otherwise the resignation would have looked like an affront to the monarch.

During the brief reign of King Prajadhipok, the prince proposed that the king found the Royal Institute, mainly to look after the National Library and the museums. He became the first president of the Royal Institute of Thailand. He was given the title &quot;Somdet Phra Chao Borommawong Thoe Krom Phraya Damrong Rajanubhab&quot; by King Prajadhipok in recognition to his work. This became the name by which he is generally known.

In the following years, Damrong worked as a self-educated historian, as well as writing books on Thai literature, culture and arts. Out of his works grew the National Library, as well as the National Museum. He is considered the father of Thai history. The &quot;Damrong school&quot; has been characterized by Thai historian Nithi Aeusrivongse as combining &quot;the legacy of the royal chronicle with history as written in the West during the nineteenth century, creating a royal/national history to serve the modern Thai state under the absolute monarchy.&quot; Although foundational to Thai history, his work is now often seen as overly nationalistic and exclusive of marginalized actors.

Being one of the main apologists for absolute monarchy, after the Siamese revolution of 1932 which introduced Constitutional monarchy in the kingdom, Damrong was exiled to Penang in British Malaysia. In 1942, after the old establishment had substantially regained power from the 1932 reformists, he was allowed to return to Bangkok, where he died one year later.

Prince Damrong is credited as the father of Thai history, the education system, the health system (the Ministry of Health was originally a department of the Ministry of the Interior) and the provincial administration. He also had a major role in crafting Bangkok&#x27;s anti-democratic state ideology of &quot;Thainess&quot;.

On the 1962 centenary of his birth, he became the first Thai to be included in the UNESCO list of the world&#x27;s most distinguished persons. On 28 November 2001, to honour the contributions the prince made to the country, the government declared that 1 December would thereafter be known as &quot;Damrong Rajanupab Day&quot;.

His many descendants use the royal surname &quot;Tisakula&quot; or &quot;Diskul&quot; ().

==Writings==
Prince Damrong wrote countless books and articles, of which only a few are available in English translation:

*&quot;Our Wars with the Burmese: Thai-Burmese Conflict 1539–1767&quot;, 
*&quot;Journey through Burma in 1936: A View of the Culture, History and Institutions&quot;, 
*&quot;Stories of Archeology: A Collection of True Stories, (Title in Thai:นิทานโบราณคดี)&quot;, 
* for which Prince Damrong offered advice and images

<text>Indian poetry and Indian literature in general, has a long history dating back to Vedic times. They were written in various Indian languages such as Vedic Sanskrit, Classical Sanskrit, Ancient Meitei, Modern Meitei, Telugu, Tamil, Odia, Maithili, Kannada, Bengali, Assamese, Hindi, Marathi and Urdu among other prominent languages. Poetry in foreign languages such as English also has a strong influence on Indian poetry. The poetry reflects diverse spiritual traditions within India. In particular, many Indian poets have been inspired by mystical experiences. Poetry is the oldest form of literature and has a rich written and oral tradition.

== Longest poems ==
== Indian poetry awards ==
There are very few literary awards in India for poetry alone. The prestigious awards like Jnanapeeth, Sahitya Akademi and Kalidas Samman etc. are given away to writers of both prose and poetry. Most of the awards have gone to novelists. Few poets have received these awards.

===Jnanpith Award===
Some of the poets who have won the Jnanpith award for their poetry include: Viswanatha Satyanarayana for his &quot;Sreemadraamaayana Kalpavrukshamu&quot; in Telugu (1970), Mahadevi Varma in Hindi for her collection of poems &quot;Yama&quot;, Firaq Gorakhpuri for his &quot;Gul-e-Naghma&quot; (1969), Amrita Pritam for her &quot;Kagaz te Kanvas&quot; (1981), Qurratulain Hyder for her &quot;Akhire Sab ke Humsafar,&quot; Singireddi Narayana Reddi for his &quot;Viswambhara&quot; in Telugu (1988), O.

===Ananda Puraskar and Rabindra Puraskar===
Ananda Bazar Patrika have instituted the annual Ananda Puraskar for Bengali literature. There is also Rabindra Puraskar. But these awards have usually gone to novelists. The rare poets to have won these awards include Premendra Mitra for &quot;Sagar Theke Phera&quot; (1957), Buddhadeb Basu for &quot;Swagato Biday&quot; (1974), Aruna Mitra for &quot;Suddhu Rater Shabda&quot; (1979), Joy Goswami for &quot;Ghumeichho&quot; (1990), Srijato for &quot;Uranto Sab Joker&quot; (2004) and Pinaki Thakur for &quot;Chumbaner Kshato&quot; (2012).

==Western thinkers and poets interested in Indian poetry==
In the 19th century, American Transcendentalist writers and many German Romantic writers became interested in Indian poetry, literature and thought. In the 20th century, few Western poets became interested in Indian thought and literature, and the interest of many of those was minor: T. S. Eliot studied Sanskrit at Harvard, but later lost interest. Buddhism brought Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder to India, but they became more interested in Tibetan and Japanese forms of the religion. Mexican poet and writer Octavio Paz developed a strong, lasting interest in Indian poetry after living in the country as part of the Mexican diplomatic mission (and as ambassador in the 1960s). Paz married an Indian woman, translated Sanskrit &quot;kavyas&quot;, and wrote extensively about India.

<doc id="585588" wikidata="Q6074640" url="?curid=585588" title="Irving Joshua Matrix">
<text>Irving Joshua Matrix — previously known as Irving Joshua Bush and commonly known as Dr. (I. J.) Matrix — is a fictitious polymath scientist, scholar, cowboy, and entrepreneur who made extraordinary contributions to perpetual motion engineering, Biblical cryptography and numerology, pyramid power, pentagonal meditation, extra-sensory perception, psychic metallurgy, and a number of other topics. He is an accomplished prestidigitator and a mathematician. Being a fictitious character he could perform tasks that were logically impossible; for example, he could &quot;clap one hand in the air&quot; when summoning a waiter or a minion.
Dr. Matrix was the satirical creation of &quot;Scientific American&quot; columnist Martin Gardner (1914–2010) who introduced him in his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in January 1960. The mythical doctor appeared frequently thereafter and the relevant columns were eventually collected into a book. The intent was partly to provide colorful context to mathematical puzzles and curiosities, partly to spoof various pseudo-scientific theories, and to provide a humorous introduction to the serious topic at hand.

==Fictitious biography==
Matrix was born in Japan, the eldest of seven children of the Reverend William Miller Bush, a Seventh-day Adventist missionary. He resided in Japan until the end of World War II, where he learned the secrets of the conjuring art and worked as assistant to the famous Japanese magician Tenkai.

Presumably it was in Japan that he met Ms. Eisei Toshiyori, and where their daughter Iva Matrix was born on December 31, 1939. Iva accompanied Dr. Matrix through most of his public life, acting as assistant and manager in most of his enterprises. The author of the fictitious narrative pretended to be romantically interested in Iva, thus explaining his continuing interest in Dr. Matrix&#x27;s activities.

He was a close friend and a student of Nicolas Bourbaki.

Martin Gardner tells of meeting the shady Dr. Matrix at Pyramid Lake, Nevada. He was accompanied by a Filipino assistant named Rhee, who was missing most of his teeth. They called him &quot;One-Tooth Rhee.&quot; Both were chased out of town for running a pyramid scheme.

Dr. Matrix was often persecuted by establishment authorities, and many times had to change abode and live under assumed names, with appropriate matching changed appearances. He was accused several times of fraud. He reportedly died in 1980, in a duel against a certain Ivan Skavinsky Skavar, a KGB agent, in circumstances as obscure and dubious as most of his career.

However, in 1987 Gardner encountered Matrix, alive and well, in Casablanca at &quot;Rick&#x27;s Café Américain&quot; of all places. It was explained that Ivan&#x27;s bullet merely grazed him, but in order to avoid retaliation by the KGB, witnesses were bribed to state that he died, and a fake funeral was arranged.

==Dr. Matrix columns==
Martin Gardner chronicled the story of Dr. Matrix in the following Mathematical Games columns.
==Legacy==
A web site, &quot;Ask Dr. Matrix&quot; exists which finds a numerological link between two user chosen numbers. Irish mathematical enthusiast and author Owen O’Shea has been dubbed by the New York Times as &quot;the heir apparent to Dr. I. J. Matrix in numerological acumen”.

==Bibliography==
Gardner&#x27;s Dr. Matrix book went through three editions. The complete list is:
* &quot;The Numerology of Dr. Matrix: The Fabulous Feats and Adventures in Number Theory, Sleight of Word, and Numerological Analysis (Literary, Biblical, Political, Philosophical and Psychonumeranalytical) of That Incredible Master Mind&quot; (1967), Simon &amp; Schuster.
* Reprinted/expanded as &quot;The Incredible Dr. Matrix: The World&#x27;s Greatest Numerologist&quot;&quot; (1976), Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons; .
* Reprinted/expanded as &quot;The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix&quot; (1985); Prometheus Books; Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 84-43183, (cloth), 0-87975-282-3 (paper). 
All of the Dr. Matrix columns from 1960 to 1980 are collected in the third, and final, edition. One final story about Dr. Matrix appears in Gardner&#x27;s book:
* &quot;Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers: –and the Return of Dr Matrix&quot;, Mathematical Association of America, Washington, DC, 1997

<doc id="585594" wikidata="Q1034421" url="?curid=585594" title="Cape Fear River">
<text>The Cape Fear River is a blackwater river in east-central North Carolina. It flows into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Fear, from which it takes its name. The river is formed at the confluence of the Haw River and the Deep River (North Carolina) in the town of Moncure, North Carolina. Its river basin is the largest in the state: 9,149 sq mi.

The river is the most industrialized river in North Carolina, lined with power plants, manufacturing plants, wastewater treatment plants, landfills, paper mills, and industrial agriculture. Relatedly, the river is polluted by various substances, including suspended solids and manmade chemicals. These chemicals include per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), GenX, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorooctanoic acid, byproducts of production of the fluoropolymer Nafion; and intermediates used to make other fluoropolymers (e.g. PPVE, PEVE and PMVE perfluoroether). Industrial chemicals such as 1,4-Dioxane and other pollutants have been found in its tributary, the Haw River.

In 2020, a national study of tap water found the highest concentration of PFAS in Brunswick County, which gets its drinking water from the Cape Fear River.

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Cape Fear River has also been known historically as:
*Cape Fair River
*Cape-Feare River
*Charle River
*Charles River
*Clarendon River
*North East Cape Fear River
*North West Branch
*Rio Jorda

==Course==

It is formed at Haywood, near the county line between Lee and Chatham Counties, by the confluence of the Deep and Haw Rivers just below Jordan Lake. It flows southeast past Lillington, Fayetteville, and Elizabethtown, then receives the Black River about northwest of Wilmington. At Wilmington, it receives the Northeast Cape Fear River and Brunswick River, turns south, widening as an estuary and entering the Atlantic about west of Cape Fear.

During the colonial era, the river provided a principal transportation route to the interior of North Carolina. Today the river is navigable as far as Fayetteville through a series of locks and dams. The estuary of the river furnishes a segment of the route of the Intracoastal Waterway.

The East Coast Greenway runs along the river.

==Bridges==
*Cape Fear Memorial Bridge (US 17/US 76/US 421)
*S. Thomas Rhodes Bridge (US 421/NC 133/US 74)
*Trooper Harry T. Long Bridge
*L. Bobby Brown Bridge (I-140)

== Pollution ==
The Cape Fear River is polluted by industry, cities, and farmland in its drainage basin. The pollution comes from both point source and nonpoint sources, including farms, city runoff, and erosion of the river&#x27;s banks, which contribute pollution such as harmful chemicals and fertilizers, and larger sediments like suspended solids. Pollutants include coal ash. As with any river, the water quality varies in different regions, depending on abiotic and biotic factors.

In 2020, a study found that striped bass in the river have the highest rates of PFAS documented in North American fish. A 2018 study found that bass from the river had 40 times the amount of PFAS in their blood than did bass raised in an aquaculture facility.

In 2020, studies by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality found &quot;staggering&quot; concentrations of forever chemicals begin dumped into the Deep River, a major tributary to the Cape Fear River. One sample contained PFOS at 1 part per billion, &quot;more than 14 times greater than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s health advisory of 70 parts per trillion for drinking water&quot;, &quot;North Carolina Heath News&quot; reported.

In 2020, a national study of tap water found the highest concentration of PFAS in Brunswick County, which gets its drinking water from the Cape Fear River.

In July 2023, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services issued a fish consumption advisory for certain freshwater fish species from the middle and lower Cape Fear River due to contamination with perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).

=== Suspended solids ===
Suspended solids refers to any particle (living or nonliving) discharged into an aquatic system that remains in suspension. These particles can find their way into rivers via nonpoint-source pollution or through larger point-source pollution events such as Hurricane Florence in 2018. The storm caused a dam to fail, which caused a mass leakage of coal ash into the Cape Fear River about 5 miles northwest of Wilmington, North Carolina.

=== GenX chemicals ===
GenX is a chemical in the group of manmade per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS used for nonstick, water- and stain-repellent items. GenX is a replacement PFAS, since older and more toxic PFAs are being phased out. GenX is made at the Chemours plant in Fayetteville, NC and has gotten into the Cape Fear River from the plant&#x27;s wastewater. Like other PFAS, GenX does not easily break down and can accumulate in the environment. Because of this quality, GenX can cause problems for both people and wildlife.

Chemours&#x27; wastewater put into the Cape Fear River poses a drinking-water issue for residents of the Fayetteville area and people further down the river. Several groundwater wells in Fayetteville had detections of GenX. At the mouth of the river, the city of Wilmington uses the Cape Fear as a drinking-water source. Blood samples of a group of Wilmington residents showed detections of GenX.

In several studies, GenX has been shown to affect wildlife. PFAS were detected in striped bass caught from the Cape Fear, and the chemical affected the liver and immune system. In plants, GenX reduced the biomass and bioaccumulated in the organism. This bioaccumulation did differ between species.

In a study done to test the ability of retention and how could the GenX chemical be transported in porous materials, results showed that for different forms of the GenX chemical the absorption rate was higher. This research is important to help future researchers understand the tendencies of this chemical. Contaminated sites should be inspected from the water to the soil due to the ability of GenX to travel/transport through porous material such as soil.

The lack of information on the GenX chemical in North Carolina has led to the gap of knowledge about ways in which people may be exposed to these chemicals other than drinking water. Information is also limited on the health effects caused by the GenX chemical, little experiments on animals show liver damage, pancreas damage, etc. There are no federal guidelines regarding the GenX chemical. However, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has set a “health goal”, a non-regulated, and non-enforceable low contamination level where no side effects, over time, would be expected.

Little is known about the effectiveness of GenX and PFEA removal from contaminated waters using methods such as ozonation and bio-filtration. Carbon in various forms can be used to treat water that has been contaminated. Experiments done with this technique showed that shorter PFAS did not absorb.

<text> (, &quot;Brazilian Popular Music&quot;) or MPB is a trend in post-bossa nova urban popular music in Brazil that revisits typical Brazilian styles such as samba, samba-canção and baião and other Brazilian regional music, combining them with foreign influences, such as jazz and rock.

This movement has produced and is represented by many Brazilian artists, such as Jorge Ben Jor, Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, Djavan, Novos Baianos, Tom Jobim, Chico Buarque, Belchior and Elis Regina, whose individual styles generated their own trends within the genre. The term often also describes any kind of music with Brazilian origins and &quot;voice and guitar style&quot; that arose in the late 1960s.

Variations within MPB were the short-lived but influential artistic movement known as tropicália, and the music of samba rock.

MPB songs are in part characterized by their harmonic complexity and their elaborate lyrics, which call back to a connection between Brazil&#x27;s popular music and poetry that has been culturally relevant since the 1920s. It also draws from themes from Brazil&#x27;s folk music as a part of an effort to create a musical style that reflected true Brazilian culture. During the 1970s, these qualities gave the style an intellectual prestige that made it more popular for listening as an art form rather than being used as music for dancing, further distinguishing it from other popular music of the time. However, this was not always the case, as demonstrated by music by artists such as Jorge Ben Jor, many of whose songs fall into the category of dance music.

Many of the albums on &quot;Rolling Stone Brazil&quot;″s list of the 100 greatest Brazilian albums fall under the MPB style.

==History==
MPB, loosely understood as a &quot;style&quot;, debuted in the mid-1960s, with the acronym being applied to types of non-electric music that emerged following the beginning, rise and evolution of bossa nova. MPB artists and audiences were largely connected to the intellectual and student population, causing later MPB to be known as &quot;university music.&quot; Over time, the definition of MPB expanded to include a wider variety of music that was popular in Brazil, including rock music, which was not initially under the umbrella due to its foreign origins.

=== Initial success ===
Like bossa nova, MPB was an attempt to produce a &quot;national&quot; Brazilian music that drew from traditional styles. MPB made a considerable impact in the 1960s, thanks largely to several televised music festivals. The beginning of MPB is often associated with Elis Regina&#x27;s interpretation of Vinícius de Moraes and Edu Lobo&#x27;s &quot;Arrastão.&quot; In 1965, one month after celebrating her 20th birthday, Elis appeared on the nationally broadcast &quot;Festival de Música Popular Brasileira&quot; and performed the song. Elis recorded &quot;Arrastão&quot; and released the song as a single, which became the biggest-selling single in Brazilian music history at that time and catapulted her to stardom. This brought MPB to a national Brazilian audience and many artists have since performed in the style over the years.

Thanks to an economic boom in Brazil through the 1960s and &#x27;70s, an expanding working and middle class had greater access to television, which became a substantial vehicle for the consumption and spread of MPB. Musical showcases such as &quot;Festival de Música Popular Brasileira&quot; turned out to be a massive success, and the stations &quot;TV-Record&quot; and &quot;FIC&quot; most notably competed in a ratings battle that resulted in greatly expanding the audience of Brazilian Popular Music. In particular, the shows &quot;O Fino da Bossa&quot; and &quot;Jovem Guarda&quot; achieved a great deal of media attention and praise, with the former being attributed to taking part in the creation of MPB. The successes of both prompted the live broadcasting of more vibrant music festivals. These events were more like competitions, and artists first had to go through a lengthy submission process before being given the chance to perform in front of a panel of judges as well as a live audience. The music festivals further expanded viewership while also increasing the competition between artists for airtime and stations for better ratings.

=== MPB in telenovelas ===
Brazilian telenovelas in the early 1970s featured MPB hits by big-name artists of the time such as Elis Regina, Gilberto Gil, and Caetano Veloso among others in the soundtracks of the shows. The telenovelas were huge commercial successes, with CDs of the soundtracks regularly topping sales charts. As time passed and MPB diversified, telenovela soundtracks followed suit, featuring MPB artists but also including newly popular songs considered outside the style, such as rock music and more mainstream pop. Despite concerns at the time about the telenovelas having too large of a role in shaping the Brazilian pop music that became mainstream, they have become one of the only public outlets that still continuously broadcast MPB up to the present day. Because the widespread success of Brazilian telenovelas enabled them to reach an international market, their soundtracks, many of which include MPB songs, have also been commercially successful abroad.

=== MPB after the 1960s ===
In the wake of increased government censorship on art forms such as music in the early 1970s, artists became much more limited in the music they could produce, and those who refused to conform to the standards set by the law risked exile. As a result, the number of innovative artists and songs that were broadcast dropped, and likewise, the program ratings. However, efforts by television stations as well as record companies for music that met the standard set by the music festivals of the &#x27;60s continued, with the television festival &quot;Abertura&quot; being one such example. While &quot;Abertura&quot; featured many up-and-coming artists, press commentary rarely considered them to be as good as MPB from the &#x27;60s. From this emerged a debate about the role of television in broadcasting song and performance. On one side, some television producers attached a duty to revitalizing the creativity within the Brazilian popular music scene. Critics of this argued that the best of the current creative pool had already been exhausted by the music festivals and that the continuous output of MPB served more as a detriment to the industry than a benefit. Despite this, attempts by television and record companies at recreating the music festivals of the &#x27;60s continued with various programs into the &#x27;80s, which was met with only modest success. In the early 2000s, the company IBM organized some Internet-based festivals with votes cast online by the audience rather than by a jury. This fared better than the television attempts two decades before but did not achieve the sweeping success of programs from the 1960s.

<doc id="585607" wikidata="Q3166061" url="?curid=585607" title="Jean-Guillaume, baron Hyde de Neuville">
<text>Jean-Guillaume, baron Hyde de Neuville (24 January 1776 – 28 May 1857) was a French nobleman, diplomat, physician and politician who served as the French ambassador to the United States from 1815 to 1821. 

==Early life==

Jean-Guillaume Hyde was born in La Charité-sur-Loire, Nièvre on 24 January 1776. He was the son of Guillaume Hyde, a Frenchman of English descent whose Jacobite ancestors fled from Great Britain to France with Charles Edward Stuart after the failure of the rising of 1745. Growing up, he studied at the Collège du Cardinal Lemoine in Paris before becoming involved in politics at the young age of 16. In 1793, after the outbreak of the French Revolution, Hyde successfully defended a man denounced by Joseph Fouché before the Revolutionary Tribunal of Nevers. From that year onwards, he worked as a secret agent of the French royal family, taking part in a failed 1796 royalist uprising against the Republican regime in Berry. After the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799, using the pseudonym &quot;Paul Xavier&quot;, he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Napoleon to allow the House of Bourbon to return to France.

==Exile and return==

During the periods of the French Consulate and the First French Empire, he practised medicine in Lyon using the pseudonym &quot;Roland&quot;, and was awarded a gold medal by the authorities for promoting vaccination efforts among the general public. After a failed assassination attempt against Napoleon, known as the plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise, occurred on 24 December 1800, Hyde was briefly accused of being involved with the plotters before the accusation was withdrawn. In 1806, Napoleon offered him monetary compensation for his estates which were confiscated during the French Revolution on the condition that he emigrate to the United States. Accepting the offer, Hyde settled down near New Brunswick, New Jersey, and his residence subsequently became a meeting point for French royalist exiles in the U.S. In 1813, he helped his friend Jean Victor Marie Moreau accept an offer to serve in the Imperial Russian Army in the ongoing Napoleonic Wars. After the War of the Sixth Coalition ended with a Bourbon Restoration in France in 1814, Hyde returned to his country of birth from the United States.

==Diplomatic career==
After arriving in France, Hyde was appointed as a diplomat by the newly restored King Louis XVIII and sent to London in order to persuade the Liverpool ministry to transfer the defeated Napoleon to a remoter place of exile than Elba, where he had been sent to. However, his negotiations with the British were cut short by Napoleon&#x27;s return from Elba to France on March 15. After Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, he was exiled to Saint Helena instead. In January 1816, Hyde was appointed to serve as the French ambassador to the United States, moving to Washington, D.C. where he negotiated a commercial treaty with the U.S. government as his first action in office. Hyde grew to have a hostile relationship with U.S. President James Monroe, who &quot;despised&quot; him, with Monroe referring to Hyde on one occasion as &quot;disagreeable and ill tempered&quot; and on another as &quot;overly delicate&quot; and &quot;obscene&quot;.

Hyde&#x27;s diplomatic career was also punctuated with other such mishaps, including offending Virginia senator James Barbour when he invited Barbour to dinner and proceeded to arrive drunk and several hours late. He also offended Ann Preston, wife of Governor James Patton Preston, when he allowed a door to slam into her face when Ann had expected Hyde to hold it open. On another occasion, while dining with South Carolina senators William Smith and John Gaillard in January 1817, Hyde grew verbally abusive and loudly belched after consuming large amounts of alcohol. After the dinner, both Smith and Gaillard refused to acknowledge Hyde ever again.

In 1820, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams suggested he be sent back to France, and in the following December, Hyde was relinquished of his posting after almost coming to blows with British ambassador to the United States Stratford Canning over a long-simmering dispute stemming from political and personal differences. After Hyde returned to France, he declined an offer to serve as the French ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, and in November 1822 was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, representing the constituency of Cosne. Louis XVIII created a barony for him in the French peerage and awarded him a Legion of Honour in 1821 as reward for his services and loyalty. In 1823, he was appointed as French ambassador to Portugal, where he helped release King John VI from imprisonment imposed by his son Miguel and was rewarded with the Portuguese peerage of Comte de Bemposta.

While in Portugal, his efforts to supplant British diplomatic influence there culminated (in connection with the April Revolt led by Miguel on 30 April 1824) in his suggestion to the Portuguese government that a request to be sent to Britain for a military intervention. Hyde planned for the Liverpool ministry to refuse this due to the British having proclaimed a principle of non-interventionism in European affairs, which would allow France to then be in a position to undertake an intervention that Britain had declined. However, Hyde&#x27;s plans came to naught when reactionary politicians in Paris, who disapproved of the Portuguese Constitution of 1822, refused to support a French intervention in Portugal. This led to a collapse of Hyde&#x27;s political influence in Portugal, and he soon returned to Paris and resumed serving in the Chamber of Deputies.

==Later life and death==

Though he had earlier been a fervent royalist, Hyde now gradually became a supporter of liberalism, opposing the conservative policies of the ministry of Joseph de Villèle. In 1828, he began serving as Minister of the Navy and the Colonies in the relatively liberal ministry of Jean-Baptiste de Martignac. While in office, he supported the Greek War of Independence, worked to improve the governance of the French colonial empire and implemented the abolition of France&#x27;s involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1829. During the ministry of Jules de Polignac from 1829 to 1830, he again became an opposition politician, advocating for continued observance of the Charter of 1814. However, after the 1830 July Revolution, he resigned from his position in the Chamber of Deputies in protest against the exclusion of the legitimate Bourbon family line from the French throne. 

During the reign of King Louis Philippe I, Hyde settled down to a quiet life on his estate near Sancerre with his wife Anne Marguerite Hyde de Neuville. In 1837, he took part in the discussion over the possibility of the French government signing a new commercial treaty with the United States, writing and publishing several pamphlets, including one titled &quot;Observations on the commerce of France with the United States&quot;, on the issue. On 28 May 1857, he died in Paris. His memoirs, titled &quot;Memoirs and souvenirs&quot;, were compiled from his notes by his nieces and published in 1888 in three volumes.

<doc id="585610" wikidata="Q1199340" url="?curid=585610" title="Coat of arms of Warsaw">
<text>The coat of arms of Warsaw (The Warsaw Mermaid) consists of a &quot;syrenka&quot; in a red field. This imagery has been in use since at least the mid-14th century. The syrenka has traditionally held a silver sword although this does not appear on more recent versions.

==History==
The first coat of arms of Warsaw depicted a dragon with a male human head, carrying a sword and a shield. The first known usage was on a seal from 1390. This is the oldest existing armed seal of Warsaw, consisting of a round seal bordered with the Latin inscription &quot;Sigilium Civitatis Varsoviensis&quot; (Seal of the city of Warsaw). Gradually the male head and body was replaced with that of a female, and by the end of 16th century the tail was also changed from that of a dragon to that of a fish. The only remaining parts of the original coat of arms are the sword and shield.

Beginning in the early 17th century Warsaw records associate a sword-wielding mermaid with the city. Since 1622, the Warsaw arms have been rendered as a mermaid with sword and shield in hand, representing Melusina from the River Vistula (Wisła), who in legend led Duke Bolesław II of Masovia (1262–1313) to the appropriate site (a fishing village) and ordered him to found the city, in about 1294. The origin of the legendary figure is not fully known. The city&#x27;s motto is, appropriately, &quot;Contemnit procellas&quot; (&quot;It defies the storms&quot;).

==Modern usage==
The current official design of the symbol was introduced in 1938 but it was only used in this form until the beginning of World War II. After 1945, Communist authorities changed the emblem by removing the crown. The insignia was restored to the pre-war form on August 15, 1990.

In addition there is a &quot;Great Emblem of the Capital City of Warsaw&quot; (&quot;Herb Wielki Miasta Stołecznego Warszawy&quot;) used only for ceremonial occasions. It includes a depiction of the Virtuti Militari medal, which was awarded to the City to honor the bravery of its citizens during World War II. It also adds the second motto to the emblem — &quot;Semper invicta&quot; (Always invincible).

Every member of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars of the United Kingdom light cavalry wears the &quot;Maid of Warsaw&quot;, the crest of the City of Warsaw, on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress. Members of 651 Squadron Army Air Corps of the United Kingdom also wear the &quot;Maid of Warsaw&quot; on the left sleeve of their No. 2 (Service) Dress.

<text>The College of Charleston (CofC or Charleston) is a public university in Charleston, South Carolina, United States. Founded in 1770 and chartered in 1785, it is the oldest university in South Carolina, the 13th-oldest institution of higher learning in the US, and the oldest municipal college in the nation. 

The founders of the College of Charleston included six Founding Fathers of the United States, including three who signed the Declaration of Independence: Thomas Heyward Jr., Arthur Middleton, and Edward Rutledge; and three who signed the Constitution of the United States: Charles Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and John Rutledge.

==History==
The College of Charleston was founded in 1770, making it the 13th-oldest institution of higher education and oldest municipal college in the nation. The college&#x27;s original structure, located at the site of what is now Randolph Hall, was designed similar to a barracks. In March 1785, the South Carolina General Assembly issued a charter to the college, which officially opened in 1790 and hosted its first commencement in 1794. The first president of the college was Robert Smith, who served in the position from 1790 to 1797. 

A second charter was issued by the general assembly in 1791 stipulating that the college would not discriminate on the basis of religion. During the Antebellum era, further development efforts in the college resulted in the construction of Randolph Hall and the President&#x27;s House, both of which were built using slave labor. 

In 1837, the Charleston municipal government assumed control over the college. During the mid-20th century, several African Americans attempted to apply to the racially segregated college as part of the Double V campaign against racism in the United States, but they were all rejected. Though the college became a private institution to avoid being racially integrated during the civil rights movement, black students were admitted starting in 1967 as a result of external pressure.

==Campus==

The College of Charleston&#x27;s main campus in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, includes 156 buildings, a mix of modern and historic buildings built between 1770 and 2009. The average building is over 100 years old, and 20 buildings are under historic, protective easements. The College of Charleston downtown campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is William Blacklock House.

Outside of downtown Charleston, the campus includes the Grice Marine Lab on James Island, the J. Stewart Walker Sailing Center and the Patriots Point Athletic Complex in Mount Pleasant and the Stono Preserve.

In 2017, &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; magazine named it &quot;America&#x27;s Most Beautiful College Campus.&quot;

The Mace Brown Museum of Natural History is a public natural history museum located on the campus. The collection&#x27;s focus is on the paleontology of North American mammals, and specifically the South Carolina Lowcountry. The museum has more than 30,000 vertebrate and invertebrate fossils.

==Academics==

The College of Charleston consists of eight academic schools, as well as the Honors College and the Graduate School.

*School of the Arts
*School of Business
*School of Education
*School of Health Sciences 
*School of Humanities and Social Sciences
*School of Languages, Cultures, and World Affairs
*School of Natural and Environmental Sciences
*School of Sciences, Mathematics, and Engineering
*Honors College
*Graduate School

===Bully Pulpit Series===
The Bully Pulpit Series is hosted jointly by the College of Charleston&#x27;s Departments of Political Science and Communication. The series welcomes U.S. presidential candidates from the two major political parties to the campus. 

In the 2020 presidential campaign, the series hosted Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O&#x27;Rourke, and Bernie Sanders.

==Athletics==
The institution&#x27;s 19 varsity sports teams participate in the NCAA Division I Coastal Athletic Association and are known as the Cougars. The Cougars compete at a variety of athletics facilities in the Charleston area, including the TD Arena, the J. Stewart Walker Sailing Complex, Johnson Center Squash Courts, Patriots Point Athletic Complex, and the Links at Stono Ferry. 

College of Charleston athletics are supported by the College of Charleston Athletic Club, which was established in 1974. During the 1970–71 school year, College of Charleston students voted to change the nickname from the Maroons to the Cougars, in honor of a cougar that had recently arrived at the Charles Towne Landing zoo. Clyde the Cougar is the current mascot. 

The men&#x27;s basketball team is ranked No. 6 for the highest winning percentage in NCAA Division I men&#x27;s college basketball.

Oliver Marmol, the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, is a former College of Charleston baseball player.

==Greek life==
Greek life has been active on campus for 120 years. Currently, the College has 8 Panhellenic, 11 IFC and 8 NPHC fraternities and sororities.

<text>An optical system with astigmatism is one where rays that propagate in two perpendicular planes have different foci. If an optical system with astigmatism is used to form an image of a cross, the vertical and horizontal lines will be in sharp focus at two different distances. The term comes from the Greek α- (&quot;a-&quot;) meaning &quot;without&quot; and στίγμα (&quot;stigma&quot;), &quot;a mark, spot, puncture&quot;.

== Forms of astigmatism ==
There are two distinct forms of astigmatism. The first is a third-order aberration, which occurs for objects (or parts of objects) away from the optical axis. This form of aberration occurs even when the optical system is perfectly symmetrical. This is often referred to as a &quot;monochromatic aberration&quot;, because it occurs even for light of a single wavelength. This terminology may be misleading, however, as the &quot;amount&quot; of aberration can vary strongly with wavelength in an optical system.

The second form of astigmatism occurs when the optical system is not symmetric about the optical axis. This may be by design (as in the case of a cylindrical lens), or due to manufacturing error in the surfaces of the components or misalignment of the components. In this case, astigmatism is observed even for rays from on-axis object points. This form of astigmatism is extremely important in vision science and eye care, since the human eye often exhibits this aberration due to imperfections in the shape of the cornea or the lens.

===Third-order astigmatism===

In the analysis of this form of astigmatism that occurs only in off-axis object point imaging, it is most common to consider rays from a given point on the object, which propagate in two particular planes. The first plane is the &quot;tangential plane&quot;. This is the plane including both the object point under consideration and the axis of symmetry (optical axis). Rays that propagate in this plane are called tangential rays. Planes that include the optical axis are &quot;meridional&quot; planes. It is common to simplify problems in radially-symmetric optical systems by choosing object points in the vertical (&quot;y&quot;) plane only. This plane is then sometimes referred to as the meridional plane.

The second plane used in the analysis is the &quot;sagittal plane&quot;, defined as the plane orthogonal to the tangential plane and containing the chief ray before refraction (so along the original chief ray direction). This plane intersects the optical axis at the entrance pupil of the optical system. This plane is not a tangential plane so is a &quot;skew&quot; plane, in other words not a meridional plane. Rays propagating in this plane are called sagittal rays.

In third-order astigmatism, the tangential rays (in the tangential plane) and sagittal rays (in the sagittal plane) form foci at different distances along the optic axis. These foci are called the &quot;tangent focus&quot; and &quot;sagittal focus&quot;, respectively. In the presence of astigmatism, an off-axis point on the object is not sharply imaged by the optical system. Instead, sharp &quot;lines&quot; are formed at the tangential and sagittal foci. The image at the tangent focus is a short line, oriented in the direction of the &quot;sagittal&quot; plane; images of circles centered on the optic axis, or small lines tangential to such circles, will be sharp in this focal plane. The image at the sagittal focus is a short line, oriented in the direction of the &quot;tangential&quot; plane; images of spokes radiating from the center are sharp at this focus. In between these two foci, a round but &quot;blurry&quot; image is formed. This is called the &quot;medial focus&quot; or &quot;circle of least confusion&quot;. This plane often represents the best compromise image location in a system with astigmatism.

The amount of aberration due to astigmatism is proportional to the square of the angle between the rays from the object and the optical axis of the system. With care, an optical system can be designed to reduce or eliminate astigmatism. Such systems are called anastigmats.

===Astigmatism in systems that are not rotationally symmetric===
If an optical system is not axisymmetric, either due to an error in the shape of the optical surfaces or due to misalignment of the components, astigmatism can occur even for on-axis object points. This effect is often used deliberately in complex optical systems, especially certain types of telescope. Some telescopes deliberately use non-spherical optics to overcome this phenomenon.

In the analysis of these systems, it is common to consider tangential rays (a plane including an object point being considered and the optical axis), and rays in a meridional plane (a plane containing the optical axis) perpendicular to the tangential plane. This plane is called either the &quot;sagittal meridional plane&quot; or, confusingly, just the &quot;sagittal plane&quot;.

====Ophthalmic astigmatism====

In optometry and ophthalmology, the vertical and horizontal planes are identified as &quot;tangential&quot; and &quot;sagittal&quot; meridians, respectively. Ophthalmic astigmatism is a refraction error of the eye in which there is a difference in degree of refraction in different meridians. It is typically characterized by an aspherical, non-figure of revolution cornea in which the corneal profile slope and refractive power in one meridian is less than that of the perpendicular axis.

Astigmatism causes difficulties in seeing fine detail. Astigmatism can be often corrected by glasses with a lens that has different radii of curvature in different planes (a &quot;cylindrical&quot; lens), contact lenses, or refractive surgery.

Astigmatism is quite common. Studies have shown that about one in three people suffers from it. The prevalence of astigmatism increases with age. Although a person may not notice mild astigmatism, higher amounts of astigmatism may cause blurry vision, , asthenopia, fatigue, or headaches.

There are a number of tests that are used by ophthalmologists and optometrists during eye examinations to determine the presence of astigmatism and to quantify the amount and axis of the astigmatism. A Snellen chart or other eye chart may initially reveal reduced visual acuity. A keratometer may be used to measure the curvature of the steepest and flattest meridians in the cornea&#x27;s front surface. Corneal topography may also be used to obtain a more accurate representation of the cornea&#x27;s shape. An autorefractor or retinoscopy may provide an objective estimate of the eye&#x27;s refractive error and the use of Jackson cross cylinders in a phoropter may be used to subjectively refine those measurements. An alternative technique with the phoropter requires the use of a &quot;clock dial&quot; or &quot;sunburst&quot; chart to determine the astigmatic axis and power.

Astigmatism may be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. Various considerations involving ocular health, refractive status, and lifestyle frequently determine whether one option may be better than another. In those with keratoconus, toric contact lenses often enable patients to achieve better visual acuities than eyeglasses. If the astigmatism is caused by a problem such as deformation of the eyeball due to a chalazion, treating the underlying cause will resolve the astigmatism.

====Misaligned or malformed lenses and mirrors====
Grinding and polishing of precision optical parts, either by hand or machine, typically employs significant downward pressure, which in turn creates significant frictional side pressures during polishing strokes that can combine to locally flex and distort the parts. These distortions generally do not possess figure-of-revolution symmetry and are thus astigmatic, and slowly become permanently polished into the surface if the problems causing the distortion are not corrected. Astigmatic, distorted surfaces potentially introduce serious degradations in optical system performance.

Surface distortion due to grinding or polishing increases with the aspect ratio of the part (diameter to thickness ratio). To a first order, glass strength increases as the cube of the thickness. Thick lenses at 4:1 to 6:1 aspect ratios will flex much less than high aspect ratio parts, such as optical windows, which can have aspect ratios of 15:1 or higher. The combination of surface or wavefront error precision requirements and part aspect ratio drives the degree of back support uniformity required, especially during the higher down pressures and side forces during polishing. Optical working typically involves a degree of randomness that helps greatly in preserving figure-of-revolution surfaces, provided the part is not flexing during the grind/polish process.

====Deliberate astigmatism in optical systems====
Compact disc players use an astigmatic lens for focusing. When one axis is more in focus than the other, dot-like features on the disc project to oval shapes. The orientation of the oval indicates which axis is more in focus, and thus which direction the lens needs to move. A square arrangement of only four sensors can observe this bias and use it to bring the read lens to best focus, without being fooled by oblong pits or other features on the disc surface.

In 3D PALM/STORM, a type of optical super-resolution microscopy, a cylindrical lens can be introduced into the imaging system to create astigmatism, which allows measurement of the Z position of a diffraction-limited light source.

Laser line levels use a cylindrical lens to spread a laser beam from a point into a line.

<text>Windmills of the Gods is a 1987 thriller novel by American writer Sidney Sheldon.

==Plot summary==

Mary Ashley, a professor at Kansas State University, is offered an ambassadorship by Paul Ellison, the US president. She rejects the offer because her husband, Dr. Edward Ashley, does not want to leave his medical practice, and she is not willing to be separated from him. She also feels that it is harder to find a good physician for a small Kansas town than an ambassador to a foreign country. When her husband suddenly dies in a traffic accident, Ashley accepts the President&#x27;s offer in order to fill the void in her life. She is sent to Romania, behind the Iron Curtain, and adapts to the role of ambassador. 

She takes an instant distaste to her second in command, Mike Slade, but is unable to remove him due to his appointment being a presidential order. Her success as an ambassador turns her into a public face for understanding between the United States and Romania. She begins a relationship with Louis Desforges, a widowed French physician that saves her from attempts to kidnap and poison her, until he gets killed by Slade.

Interspersed with that narration, the novel shows gatherings of members of the Patriots for Freedom, a secret society of powerful men that orchestrate political events trying to divide the Eastern and Western Blocs. They hire an international assassin nicknamed Angel to kill her, but the information is leaked and the attempt foiled. 

In the climax of the novel, it is revealed that Mike Slade is an agent who infiltrated the Patriots for Freedom and foiled their plans, while Desforges was an agent of the Patriots who saved her only so she could be publicly killed by Angel. The members of the Patriots are arrested and their chairman (revealed to be the Vice President of the United States) is killed by Angel after refusing to pay for the failed assassination.

Once this threat is neutralized, Mary attempts to resign her post, believing that her success was created to be used as a political tool, but the president convinces her to remain in the position under the protection of Slade. In the final scene, another cell of the Patriots for Freedom composed only of women (presumably led by the dead Veep&#x27;s widow) is shown deliberating about their next course of action.

==TV version==

A TV miniseries, starring Jaclyn Smith, was released in 1988.

<text>Kyiv (also Kiev) is the capital and most populous city of Ukraine. It is in north-central Ukraine along the Dnieper River. As of 1 January 2022, its population was 2,952,301, making Kyiv the seventh-most populous city in Europe. Kyiv is an important industrial, scientific, educational, and cultural center in Eastern Europe. It is home to many high-tech industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks. The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the Kyiv Metro.

The city&#x27;s name is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of its four legendary founders. During its history, Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople, Kyiv was a tributary of the Khazars, until its capture by the Varangians (Vikings) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of Kievan Rus&#x27;, the first East Slavic state. Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasions in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. Coming under Lithuania, then Poland and then Russia, the city would grow from a frontier market into an important centre of Orthodox learning in the sixteenth century, and later of industry, commerce, and administration by the nineteenth.

The city prospered again during the Russian Empire&#x27;s Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century. In 1918, when the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic declared independence from the Russian Republic after the October Revolution there, Kyiv became its capital. From the end of the Ukrainian-Soviet and Polish-Soviet wars in 1921, Kyiv was a city of the Ukrainian SSR, and made its capital in 1934. The city suffered significant destruction during World War II but quickly recovered in the postwar years, remaining the Soviet Union&#x27;s third-largest city.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence in 1991, Kyiv remained Ukraine&#x27;s capital and experienced a steady influx of ethnic Ukrainian migrants from other regions of the country. During the country&#x27;s transformation to a market economy and electoral democracy, Kyiv has continued to be Ukraine&#x27;s largest and wealthiest city. Its armament-dependent industrial output fell after the Soviet collapse, adversely affecting science and technology, but new sectors of the economy such as services and finance facilitated Kyiv&#x27;s growth in salaries and investment, as well as providing continuous funding for the development of housing and urban infrastructure. Kyiv emerged as the most pro-Western region of Ukraine; parties advocating tighter integration with the European Union dominate during elections.

==Name==
* ( , ) or Kiev ( )
*, 

The traditional etymology, stemming from the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, is that the name is a derivation of Kyi (, , &quot;Ky&quot; or &quot;Kiy&quot;), the legendary eponymous founder of the city. According to Oleg Trubachyov&#x27;s etymological dictionary from the Old East Slavic name &quot;*Kyjevŭ gordŭ&quot; (literally, &quot;Kyi&#x27;s castle&quot;, &quot;Kyi&#x27;s gord&quot;), from Proto-Slavic &quot;*kyjevъ&quot;, This etymology has been questioned, for instance by Mykhailo Hrushevsky who called it an &quot;etymological myth&quot;, and meant that the names of the legendary founders are in turn based on place names. According to the Canadian Ukrainian linguist Jaroslav Rudnyckyj, the name can be connected to the Proto-Slavic root , but should be interpreted as meaning &#x27;stick, pole&#x27; as in its modern Ukrainian equivalent . The name should in that case be interpreted as &#x27;palisaded settlement&#x27;. 

&quot;Kyiv&quot; is the romanized official Ukrainian name for the city, and it is used for legislative and official acts. &quot;Kiev&quot; is the traditional English name for the city, but because of its historical derivation from the Russian name, &quot;Kiev&quot; lost favor with many Western media outlets after the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014 in conjunction with the KyivNotKiev campaign launched by Ukraine to change the way that international media were spelling the city&#x27;s name.

==History==

The first known humans in the region of Kyiv lived there in the late paleolithic period (Stone Age). The population around Kyiv during the Bronze Age formed part of the so-called Trypillian culture, as evidenced by artifacts from that culture found in the area. During the early Iron Age certain tribes settled around Kyiv that practiced land cultivation, husbandry and trading with the Scythians and ancient states of the northern Black Sea coast. Findings of Roman coins of the 2nd to the 4th centuries suggest trade relations with the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Notable archaeologists of the area around Kyiv include Vikentiy Khvoyka.

===Founding===
Scholars continue to debate when the city was founded: The traditional founding date is 482 CE, so the city celebrated its 1,500th anniversary in 1982. Archaeological data indicates a founding in the sixth or seventh centuries, with some researchers dating the founding as late as the late 9th century.
There are several legendary accounts of the origin of the city. One tells of members of a Slavic tribe (Eastern Polans), brothers Kyi (the eldest, after whom the city was named), Shchek, Khoryv, and their sister Lybid, who founded the city (See the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;). Another legend states that Saint Andrew passed through the area in the 1st century. Where the city is now he erected a cross, where a church later was built. Since the Middle Ages an image of Saint Michael has represented the city as well as the duchy.

There is little historical evidence pertaining to the period when the city was founded. Scattered Slavic settlements existed in the area from the 6th century, but it is unclear whether any of them later developed into the city. On the Ptolemy world map there are several settlements indicated along the mid-stream of Borysthenes, among which is Azagarium, which some historians believe to be the predecessor to Kyiv.

However, according to the 1773 &quot;Dictionary of Ancient Geography&quot; of Alexander Macbean, that settlement corresponds to the modern city of Chernobyl. Just south of Azagarium, there is another settlement, Amadoca, believed to be the capital of the Amadoci people living in an area between the marshes of Amadoca in the west and the Amadoca mountains in the east.

Another name for Kyiv mentioned in history, the origin of which is not completely clear, is Sambat, which apparently has something to do with the Khazar Empire. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; says the residents of Kyiv told Askold &quot;there were three brothers Kyi, Shchek, and Khoriv. They founded this town and died, and now we are staying and paying taxes to their relatives the Khazars&quot;. In &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentions a caravan of small cargo boats which assembled annually, and writes, &quot;They come down the river Dnieper and assemble at the strong-point of Kyiv (Kioava), also called Sambatas&quot;.

At least three Arabic-speaking 10th century geographers who traveled the area mention the city of Zānbat as the chief city of the Russes. Among them are ibn Rustah, Abu Sa&#x27;id Gardezi, and an author of the Hudud al-&#x27;Alam. The texts of those authors were discovered by Russian orientalist Alexander Tumansky. The etymology of Sambat has been argued by many historians, including Grigoriy Ilyinsky, Nikolay Karamzin, Jan Potocki, Nikolay Lambin, Joachim Lelewel, and Guðbrandur Vigfússon.

The Primary Chronicle states that at some point during the late 9th or early 10th century Askold and Dir, who may have been of Viking or Varangian descent, ruled in Kyiv. They were murdered by Oleg of Novgorod in 882, but some historians, such as Omeljan Pritsak and Constantine Zuckerman, dispute that, arguing that Khazar rule continued as late as the 920s, leaving historical documents such as the Kievan Letter and Schechter Letter.

Other historians suggest that Magyar tribes ruled the city between 840 and 878, before migrating with some Khazar tribes to the Carpathian Basin. The Primary Chronicle mentions Hungarians passing near Kyiv. Askold&#x27;s Grave was previously known as &quot;Uhorske urochyshche&quot; (Hungarian place).

According to the aforementioned scholars the building of the fortress of Kyiv was finished in 840 under the leadership of Keő (Keve), Csák, and Geréb, three brothers, possibly members of the Tarján tribe. The three names appear in the Kyiv Chronicle as Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv and may be not of Slavic origin, as Russian historians have always struggled to account for their meanings and origins. According to Hungarian historian Viktor Padányi, their names were inserted into the Kyiv Chronicle in the 12th century, and they were identified as old-Russian mythological heroes.
The city of Kyiv stood on the trade route between the Varangians and the Greeks. In 968 the nomadic Pechenegs attacked and then besieged the city. By 1000 CE the city had a population of 45,000.

In March 1169, Grand Prince Andrey Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked Kyiv, leaving the old town and the prince&#x27;s hall in ruins. He took many pieces of religious artwork - including the &quot;Theotokos of Vladimir&quot; icon - from Vyshhorod. In 1203, Prince Rurik Rostislavich and his Kipchak allies captured and burned Kyiv. In the 1230s, the city was besieged and ravaged several times by different Rus princes. The city had not recovered from these attacks when, in 1240, the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27;, led by Batu Khan, completed the destruction of Kyiv.

These events had a profound effect on the future of the city and on the East Slavic civilization. Before Bogolyubsky&#x27;s pillaging, Kyiv had had a reputation as one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding 100,000 at the beginning of the 12th century.

In the early 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by Grand Duke Gediminas defeated a Slavic army led by Stanislav of Kyiv at the Battle on the Irpen&#x27; River and conquered the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kyiv, retaliated in 1324–1325, so while Kyiv was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay tribute to the Golden Horde. Finally, as a result of the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362, Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, incorporated Kyiv and surrounding areas into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1482, Crimean Tatars sacked and burned much of Kyiv. At the time of the Lithuanian rule, the core of the city was located in Podil and there was a Lithuanian with 18 towers on the Zamkova Hora which served as a residence of Vladimir Olgerdovich, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and subsequently of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania (e.g. Vytautas).
With the 1569 Union of Lublin, when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established, the Lithuanian-controlled lands of the Kyiv region (Podolia, Volhynia, and Podlachia) were transferred from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and Kyiv became the capital of Kyiv Voivodeship. The 1658 Treaty of Hadiach envisaged Kyiv becoming the capital of the Grand Duchy of Rus&#x27; within the Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth, but this provision of the treaty never went into operation.

===Russian suzerainty===
Occupied by Russian troops since the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav, Kyiv became a part of the Tsardom of Russia from 1667 on the Truce of Andrusovo and enjoyed a degree of autonomy. None of the Polish-Russian treaties concerning Kyiv have ever been ratified. In the Russian Empire, Kyiv was a primary Christian centre, attracting pilgrims, and the cradle of many of the empire&#x27;s most important religious figures, but until the 19th century, the city&#x27;s commercial importance remained marginal.

In 1834, the Russian government established Saint Vladimir University, now called the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv after the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko (1814–1861). (Shevchenko worked as a field researcher and editor for the geography department). The medical faculty of Saint Vladimir University, separated into an independent institution in 1919–1921 during the Soviet period, became the Bogomolets National Medical University in 1995.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Imperial Russian Army and ecclesiastical authorities dominated city life; the Russian Orthodox Church had involvement in a significant part of Kyiv&#x27;s infrastructure and commercial activity. In the late 1840s the historian, Mykola Kostomarov (Russian: ), founded a secret political society, the Brotherhood of Saint Cyril and Methodius, whose members put forward the idea of a federation of free Slavic peoples with Ukrainians as a distinct and separate group rather than a subordinate part of the Russian nation; the Russian authorities quickly suppressed the society.

Following the gradual loss of Ukraine&#x27;s autonomy, Kyiv experienced growing Russification in the 19th century, by means of Russian migration, administrative actions, and social modernization. At the beginning of the 20th century the Russian-speaking part of the population dominated the city centre, while the lower classes living on the outskirts retained Ukrainian folk culture to a significant extent. However, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian aristocrats, soldiers, and merchants made attempts to preserve the native culture in Kyiv, by clandestine book-printing, amateur theatre, folk studies, etc.
During the Russian industrial revolution in the late 19th century, Kyiv became an important trade and transportation centre of the Russian Empire, specialising in sugar and grain export by railway and on the Dnieper river. By 1900, the city had also become a significant industrial centre, with a population of 250,000. Landmarks of that period include the railway infrastructure, the foundation of numerous educational and cultural facilities, and notable architectural monuments (mostly merchant-oriented). In 1892, the first electric tram line of the Russian Empire started running in Kyiv (the third in the world). Kyiv prospered during the late 19th century Industrial Revolution in the Russian Empire, when it became the third most important city of the Empire and the major centre of commerce in its southwest.

===Soviet era===
In the turbulent period following the 1917 Russian Revolution, Kyiv became the capital of several successive Ukrainian states and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: World War I, during which German soldiers occupied it from 2 March 1918 to November 1918, the Russian Civil War of 1917 to 1922, and the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. During the last three months of 1919, Kyiv was intermittently controlled by the White Army. Kyiv changed hands sixteen times from the end of 1918 to August 1920.

From 1921 to 1991, the city formed part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a founding republic of the Soviet Union in 1922. The major events that took place in Soviet Ukraine during the interwar period all affected Kyiv: the 1920s Ukrainization as well as the migration of the rural Ukrainophone population made the Russophone city Ukrainian-speaking and bolstered the development of Ukrainian cultural life in the city; the Soviet industrialization that started in the late 1920s turned the city, a former centre of commerce and religion, into a major industrial, technological and scientific centre; the 1932–1933 Great Famine devastated the part of the migrant population not registered for ration cards; and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge of 1937–1938 almost eliminated the city&#x27;s intelligentsia

In 1934, Kyiv became the capital of Soviet Ukraine. The city boomed again during the years of Soviet industrialization as its population grew rapidly and many industrial giants were established, some of which exist today.

In World War II, the city again suffered significant damage, and Nazi Germany occupied it from 19 September 1941 to 6 November 1943. Axis forces killed or captured more than 600,000 Soviet soldiers in the great encircling Battle of Kyiv in 1941. Most of those captured never returned alive. Shortly after the Wehrmacht occupied the city, a team of NKVD officers who had remained hidden dynamited most of the buildings on the Khreshchatyk, the main street of the city, where German military and civil authorities had occupied most of the buildings; the buildings burned for days and 25,000 people were left homeless.

Allegedly in response to the actions of the NKVD, the Germans rounded up all the local Jews they could find, nearly 34,000, and massacred them at Babi Yar in Kyiv on 29 and 30 September 1941. In the months that followed, thousands more were taken to Babi Yar where they were shot. It is estimated that the Germans murdered more than 100,000 people of various ethnic groups, mostly civilians, at Babi Yar during World War II.

Kyiv recovered economically in the post-war years, becoming once again the third-most important city of the Soviet Union. The catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 occurred only north of the city. However, the prevailing south wind blew most of the radioactive debris away from Kyiv.

===Independence===
In the course of the collapse of the Soviet Union the Ukrainian parliament proclaimed the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine in the city on 24 August 1991. In 2004–2005, the city played host to the largest post-Soviet public demonstrations up to that time, in support of the Orange Revolution. From November 2013 until February 2014, central Kyiv became the primary location of Euromaidan. During the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian forces attempted to seize Kyiv but were repelled by Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of the city; Kyiv itself escaped major damage. Following the Russian retreat from the region in April 2022, Kyiv has been subject to frequent air strikes.

==Environment==
===Geography===

Geographically, Kyiv is on the border of the Polesia woodland ecological zone, a part of the European mixed woods area, and the East European forest steppe biome. However, the city&#x27;s unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region. Kyiv is completely surrounded by Kyiv Oblast.

Originally on the west bank, today Kyiv is on both sides of the Dnieper, which flows southwards through the city towards the Black Sea. The older and higher western part of the city sits on numerous wooded hills (Kyiv Hills), with ravines and small rivers. Kyiv&#x27;s geographical relief contributed to its toponyms, such as &quot;Podil&quot; (&quot;lower&quot;), &quot;Pechersk&quot; (&quot;caves&quot;), and &quot;uzviz&quot; (a steep street, &quot;descent&quot;). Kyiv is a part of the larger Dnieper Upland adjoining the western bank of the Dnieper in its mid-flow, and which contributes to the city&#x27;s elevation change.

The northern outskirts of the city border the Polesian Lowland. Kyiv expanded into the Dnieper Lowland on the left bank (&quot;to the east&quot;) as late as the 20th century. The whole portion of Kyiv on the left bank of the Dnieper is generally referred to as the &quot;Left Bank&quot; (, &quot;Livyi bereh&quot;). Significant areas of the left bank Dnieper valley were artificially sand-deposited, and are protected by dams.

Within the city the Dnieper River forms a branching system of tributaries, isles, and harbors within the city limits. The city is close to the mouth of the Desna River and the Kyiv Reservoir in the north, and the Kaniv Reservoir in the south. Both the Dnieper and Desna rivers are navigable at Kyiv, although regulated by the reservoir shipping locks and limited by winter freeze-over.

In total, there are 448 bodies of open water within the boundaries of Kyiv, which include the Dnieper itself, its reservoirs, and several small rivers, dozens of lakes and artificially created ponds. They occupy 7949 hectares. Additionally, the city has 16 developed beaches (totalling 140 hectares) and 35 near-water recreational areas (covering more than 1,000 hectares). Many are used for pleasure and recreation, although some of the bodies of water are not suitable for swimming.

According to the UN 2011 evaluation, there were no risks of natural disasters in Kyiv and its metropolitan area.

===Climate===

Kyiv has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). The warmest months are June, July, and August, with mean temperatures of . The coldest are December, January, and February, with mean temperatures of . The highest ever temperature recorded in the city was on 30 July 1936.

The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was on 11 January 1951. Snow cover usually lies from mid-November to the end of March, with the frost-free period lasting 180 days on average, but surpassing 200 days in some years.

==Legal status, local government and politics==

=== Legal status and local government ===
The municipality of the city of Kyiv has a special legal status within Ukraine compared to the other administrative subdivisions of the country. The most significant difference is that the city is considered as a region of Ukraine (see Regions of Ukraine). It is the only city that has double jurisdiction. The Head of City State Administration – the city&#x27;s governor – is appointed by the president of Ukraine, while the Head of the City Council – the mayor of Kyiv – is elected by local popular vote.

The mayor of Kyiv is Vitali Klitschko, who was sworn in on 5 June 2014, after he had won the 25 May 2014 Kyiv mayoral elections with almost 57% of the votes. Since 25 June 2014, Klitschko is also Head of Kyiv City Administration. Klitschko was last reelected in the 2020 Kyiv local election with 50.52% of the votes, in the first round of the election.

Most key buildings of the national government are along Hrushevskoho Street (&quot;vulytsia Mykhaila Hrushevskoho&quot;) and Institute Street (&quot;vulytsia Instytutska&quot;). Hrushevskoho Street is named after the Ukrainian academician, politician, historian, and statesman Mykhailo Hrushevsky, who wrote an academic book titled: &quot;Bar Starostvo: Historical Notes: XV–XVIII&quot; about the history of Bar, Ukraine. That portion of the city is also unofficially known as the government quarter ().

The city state administration and council is in the Kyiv City council building on Khreshchatyk Street. The oblast state administration and council is in the oblast council building on &quot;ploshcha Lesi Ukrainky&quot; (&quot;Lesya Ukrainka Square&quot;).
===Politics===
The growing political and economic role of the city, combined with its international relations, as well as extensive internet and social network penetration, have made Kyiv the most pro-Western and pro-democracy region of Ukraine; (so called) National Democratic parties advocating tighter integration with the European Union receive most votes during elections in Kyiv. In a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in the first half of February 2014, 5.3% of those polled in Kyiv believed &quot;Ukraine and Russia must unite into a single state&quot;, nationwide this percentage was 12.5.

===Subdivisions===


====Traditional subdivision====

The Dnieper River naturally divides Kyiv into the Right Bank and the Left Bank areas. Historically on the western right bank of the river, the city expanded into the left bank only in the 20th century. Most of Kyiv&#x27;s attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are on the right bank. The eastern &quot;Left Bank&quot; is predominantly residential. There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.

Kyiv is further informally divided into historical or territorial neighbourhoods, each housing from about 5,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.

====Formal subdivision====
The first known formal subdivision of Kyiv dates to 1810 when the city was subdivided into 4 parts: Pechersk, Starokyiv, and the first and the second parts of Podil. In 1833–1834 according to Tsar Nicholas I&#x27;s decree, Kyiv was subdivided into 6 police raions (districts); later being increased to 10. In 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (&quot;Duma&quot;), which were reorganised by bolsheviks into 6 Party-Territory Raions.

During the Soviet era, as the city was expanding, the number of raions also gradually increased. These newer districts of the city, along with some older areas were then named in honour of prominent communists and socialist-revolutionary figures; however, due to the way in which many communist party members eventually, after a certain period of time, fell out of favour and so were replaced with new, fresher minds, so too did the names of Kyiv&#x27;s districts change accordingly.

The last district reform took place in 2001 when the number of districts was decreased from 14 to 10.

Under Oleksandr Omelchenko (mayor from 1999 to 2006), there were further plans for the merger of some districts and revision of their boundaries, and the total number of districts had been planned to be decreased from 10 to 7. With the election of the new mayor-elect (Leonid Chernovetskyi) in 2006, these plans were shelved.

Each district has its own locally elected council with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs.

==Demographics==

According to the official registration statistics, there were 2,847,200 residents within the city limits of Kyiv in July 2013.

===Historical population===
According to the All-Ukrainian Census, the population of Kyiv in 2001 was 2,611,327. The historic changes in population are shown in the side table. According to the census, some 1,393,000 (53.3%) were female and 1,219,000 (46.7%) were male. Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of population ageing which, while prevalent throughout the country, is partly offset in Kyiv by the inflow of working age migrants. Some 1,069,700 people had higher or completed secondary education, a significant increase of 21.7% since 1989.

The June 2007 unofficial population estimate based on amount of bakery products sold in the city (thus including temporary visitors and commuters) gave a number of at least 3.5 million people.

===Ethnic composition===
Kyiv&#x27;s ethnic composition has shifted greatly over the last centuries. According to the , conducted by the local branch of the Russian Geographical Society, there were 127,205 people living in Kyiv. Of these, 80% spoke &quot;Russian,&quot; 11% spoke &quot;Jewish,&quot; 6% spoke Polish and 2% spoke German. Of the &quot;Russian&quot; speakers, 39% were recorded as speaking Little Russian (Ukrainian), which meant that Ukrainian speakers accounted for 30% of the city as a whole. Of the remaining &quot;Russian&quot; speakers, however, there were only 10% who spoke Greater Russian (Russian) and 2% who spoke Belarusian. The remaining 49% spoke in &quot;generally Russian speech.&quot; According to the official census of 1897, the number of Great Russian speakers rose to 54%; speakers of Little Russian accounted for 22%. Jewish speakers accounted for 12%, Polish 6.7%.

By the September 1917 city-census of Kyiv, conducted by the authorities of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, the Ukrainian share of the population had been reduced to only 16%, while Russians now made up a majority at 50%. The March 1919 Kyiv city census, conducted by the Bolshevik authorities, showed an increase in the percentage of the population identifying as Ukrainian to 25%. From then on, the city&#x27;s Ukrainian population once again began to expand in terms of their share of the population, slowly returning to its former level. By the 1926 Soviet census, Ukrainians, at 41.6%, had once again begun to outnumber Russians, who made up 25.5%. By the 1959 Soviet census, Kyiv was once more a Ukrainian majority city, with 60% of the population identifying as such, the same percentage as in 1874.

According to the 2001 census data, more than 130 nationalities and ethnic groups reside within the territory of Kyiv. Ukrainians constitute the largest ethnic group in Kyiv, accounting for 2,110,800 people, or 82.2% of the population. Russians comprise 337,300 (13.1%), Jews 17,900 (0.7%), Belarusians 16,500 (0.6%), Poles 6,900 (0.3%), Armenians 4,900 (0.2%), Azerbaijanis 2,600 (0.1%), Tatars 2,500 (0.1%), Georgians 2,400 (0.1%), Moldovans 1,900 (0.1%).

A 2015 study by the International Republican Institute found that 94% of Kyiv was ethnic Ukrainian, and 5% ethnic Russian. Most of the city&#x27;s non-Slav population comprises Tatars, South Caucasians, and other peoples from the former Soviet Union.

=== Language statistics ===
Both Ukrainian and Russian are commonly spoken in the city; approximately 75% of Kyiv&#x27;s population responded &quot;Ukrainian&quot; to the 2001 census question on their native language, roughly 25% responded &quot;Russian&quot;. According to a 2006 survey, Ukrainian is used at home by 23% of Kyivans, 52% use Russian, and 24% switch between both. In the 2003 sociological survey, when the question &quot;What language do you use in everyday life?&quot; was asked, 52% said &quot;mostly Russian&quot;, 32% &quot;both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure&quot;, 14% &quot;mostly Ukrainian&quot;, and 4.3% &quot;exclusively Ukrainian&quot;.

According to the census of 1897, of Kyiv&#x27;s approximately 240,000 people approximately 56% of the population spoke the Russian language, 23% spoke the Ukrainian language, 13% spoke Yiddish, 7% spoke Polish and 1% spoke the Belarusian language.

A 2015 study by the International Republican Institute found that the languages spoken at home in Kyiv were Ukrainian (27%), Russian (32%), and an equal combination of Ukrainian and Russian (40%).

===Jews===
The Jews of Kyiv are first mentioned in a 10th-century letter. The Jewish population remained relatively small until the nineteenth century. A series of pogroms was carried out in 1882, and another in 1905. On the eve of World War I, the city&#x27;s Jewish population was over 81,000. In 1939 there were approximately 224,000 Jews in Kyiv, some of whom fled the city ahead of the German invasion of the Soviet Union that began in June 1941. On 29 and 30 September 1941, nearly 34,000 Kyivan Jews were massacred at Babi Yar by the Wehrmacht, SS, Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, and local collaborators.

Jews began returning to Kyiv at the end of the war, but experienced another pogrom in September 1945. In the 21st century, Kyiv&#x27;s Jewish community numbers about 20,000. There are two major synagogues in the city: the Great Choral Synagogue and the Brodsky Choral Synagogue.

==Cityscape==


Modern Kyiv is a mix of the old (Kyiv preserved about 70 percent of more than 1,000 buildings built during 1907–1914) and the new, seen in everything from the architecture to the stores and to the people themselves. When the capital of the Ukrainian SSR was moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv many new buildings were commissioned to give the city &quot;the gloss and polish of a capital&quot;. In the discussions that centered on how to create a showcase city center, the current city center of Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) were not the obvious choices. Some of the early, ultimately not materialised, ideas included a part of Pechersk, Lypky, European Square, and Mykhailivska Square.

The plans of building massive monuments (of Vladimir Lenin and Stalin) were also abandoned, due to lack of money (in the 1930s–1950s) and because of Kyiv&#x27;s hilly landscape. Experiencing rapid population growth between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, the city has continued its consistent growth after the turn of the millennium. As a result, Kyiv&#x27;s central districts provide a dotted contrast of new, modern buildings among the pale yellows, blues, and greys of older apartments. Urban sprawl has gradually reduced, while population densities of suburbs has increased. The most expensive properties are in the Pechersk and Khreshchatyk areas. It is also prestigious to own a property in newly constructed buildings in the Kharkivskyi neighborhood or Obolon along the Dnieper.

Ukrainian independence at the turn of the millennium has heralded other changes. Western-style residential complexes, modern nightclubs, classy restaurants and prestigious hotels opened in the centre. And most importantly, with the easing of the visa rules in 2005, Ukraine is positioning itself as a prime tourist attraction, with Kyiv, among the other large cities, looking to profit from new opportunities. The centre of Kyiv has been cleaned up and buildings have been restored and redecorated, especially Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Many historic areas of Kyiv, such as Andriivskyi Descent, have become popular street vendor locations, where one can find traditional Ukrainian art, religious items, books, game sets (most commonly chess) as well as jewellery for sale.

At the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009, Kyiv was the only Commonwealth of Independent States city to have been inscribed into the TOP30 European Green City Index (placed 30th).

Kyiv&#x27;s most famous historical architecture complexes are the St. Sophia Cathedral and the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves), which are recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Noteworthy historical architectural landmarks also include the Mariinskyi Palace (designed and constructed from 1745 to 1752, then reconstructed in 1870), several Eastern Orthodox churches such as St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral, St. Andrew&#x27;s, St. Volodymyr&#x27;s, St. Cyril&#x27;s, the reconstructed Golden Gate and others.

One of Kyiv&#x27;s widely recognized modern landmarks is the highly visible giant Mother Ukraine statue made of titanium standing at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War on the Right bank of the Dnieper. Other notable sites is the cylindrical Salut hotel, across from Glory Square and the eternal flame at the World War Two memorial Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and the House with Chimaeras.

Among Kyiv&#x27;s best-known monuments are Mikhail Mikeshin&#x27;s statue of Bohdan Khmelnytsky astride his horse near St. Sophia Cathedral, the venerated Vladimir the Great (St. Vladimir), the baptizer of Rus&#x27;, overlooking the river above Podil from Saint Volodymyr Hill, the monument to Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv and Lybid, the legendary founders of the city at the Dnieper embankment. On Independence Square in the city centre, two monuments elevate two of the city protectors; the historic protector of Kyiv Michael Archangel atop a reconstruction of one of the old city&#x27;s gates and a modern invention, the goddess-protector Berehynia atop a tall column.

==Culture==

Kyiv was the historic cultural centre of the East Slavic civilization and a major cradle for the Christianization of Kievan Rus. Kyiv retained through centuries its cultural importance and even at times of relative decay, it remained the centre of primary importance of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Its sacred sites of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (the Monastery of the Caves) and the Saint Sophia Cathedral are attracting pilgrims for centuries and recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, remaining the primary religious centres as well as major tourist attractions. The above-mentioned sites are also part of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine collection.

In September 2023, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee placed the Saint Sophia Cathedral and Kyiv Pechersk Lavra on the List of World Heritage in Danger. According to the committee, although the Ukrainian government has taken action to protect the sites, &quot;optimal conditions are no longer met to fully guarantee the protection of the Outstanding Universal Value of the property and that it is threatened by potential danger due to the war”. The list is protected by the 1972 UNESCO Convention, ratified by both Russia and Ukraine. Inclusion on the list is intended to mobilize urgent international support.

Kyiv&#x27;s theatres include the Kyiv Opera House, Ivan Franko National Academic Drama Theater, Lesya Ukrainka National Academic Theater, the Kyiv Puppet Theater, October Palace, National Philharmonic of Ukraine and others. In 1946 Kyiv had four theatres, one opera house and one concert hall, but most tickets then were allocated to &quot;privileged groups&quot;.

Other significant cultural centres include the Dovzhenko Film Studios, and the Kyiv Circus. The most important of the city&#x27;s many museums are the National Museum of the History of Ukraine, the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, the National Art Museum, the Museum of Western and Oriental Art, the Pinchuk Art Centre, the Kyiv Picture Gallery National Museum, and the Ivan Honchar Museum.

In 2005, Kyiv hosted the 50th annual Eurovision Song Contest and in 2017 the 62nd annual Eurovision Song Contest.

Numerous songs and paintings were dedicated to the city. Some songs became part of Russian, Ukrainian and Jewish folklore. The most popular songs are &quot;How not to love you, Kyiv of mine?&quot; and &quot;Kyiv Waltz&quot;. Renowned Ukrainian composer Oleksandr Bilash wrote an operetta called &quot;Legend of Kyiv&quot;.

===Attractions===

It is said that one can walk from one end of Kyiv to the other in the summertime without leaving the shade of its many trees. Most characteristic are the horse-chestnuts (, ).

Kyiv is known as a green city with two botanical gardens and numerous large and small parks. The National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War is here, which offers both indoor and outdoor displays of military history and equipment surrounded by verdant hills overlooking the Dnieper river.

Among the numerous islands, Venetsiiskyi (or Hydropark) is the most developed. It is accessible by metro or by car, and includes an amusement park, swimming beaches, boat rentals, and night clubs. Other major islands include Trukhaniv, Muromets, and Dolobetskyi. The Victory Park (&quot;Park Peremohy&quot;) near Darnytsia subway station is a popular destination for strollers, joggers, and cyclists. Boating, fishing, and water sports are popular pastimes in Kyiv. The area lakes and rivers freeze over in the winter and ice fishermen are a frequent sight, as are children with their ice skates. However, the peak of summer draws out a greater mass of people to the shores for swimming or sunbathing, with daytime high temperatures sometimes reaching .
The centre of Kyiv (Maidan Nezalezhnosti and Khreshchatyk Street) becomes a large outdoor party place at night during summer months, with thousands of people having a good time in nearby restaurants, clubs and outdoor cafes. The central streets are closed for auto traffic on weekends and holidays. Andriivskyi Descent is one of the best known historic streets and a major tourist attraction in Kyiv. The hill is the site of the Castle of Richard the Lionheart; the baroque-style St Andrew&#x27;s Church; the home of the Kyiv-born writer Mikhail Bulgakov; the monument to Yaroslav the Wise, the Grand Prince of Kyiv and Novgorod; and numerous other monuments.

A wide variety of farm produce is available in many of Kyiv&#x27;s farmer markets with the Bessarabskyi Market in the very centre of the city being most famous. Each residential region has its own market, or &quot;rynok&quot;. Here one will find table after table of individuals hawking everything imaginable: vegetables, fresh and smoked meats, fish, cheese, honey, dairy products such as milk and home-made &quot;smetana&quot; (sour cream), caviar, cut flowers, housewares, tools and hardware, and clothing. Each of the markets has its own unique mix of products with some markets devoted solely to specific wares such as automobiles, car parts, pets, clothing, flowers, and other things.

At the city&#x27;s southern outskirts, near the historic Pyrohiv village, there is an outdoor museum officially called the Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine. It has an area of . This territory houses several &quot;mini-villages&quot; that represent by region the traditional rural architecture of Ukraine.

Kyiv also has numerous recreational attractions like bowling alleys, go-cart tracks, paintball venues, billiard halls and even shooting ranges. The 100-year-old Kyiv Zoo is on 40 hectares and according to CBC &quot;the zoo has 2,600 animals from 328 species&quot;.

===Museums and galleries===
Kyiv is home to some 40 different museums. In 2009 they recorded a total of 4.3 million visits.

The National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War is a memorial complex commemorating the Eastern Front of World War II in the hills on the right-bank of the Dnieper in Pechersk. Kyiv Fortress is the 19th-century fortification buildings situated in Ukrainian capital Kyiv, that once belonged to western Russian fortresses. These structures (once a united complex) were built in the Pechersk and neighbourhoods by the Russian army. Some of the buildings are restored and turned into a museum, while others are in use in various military and commercial installations. 

The National Art Museum of Ukraine is a museum dedicated to Ukrainian art. The Golden Gate is a historic gateway in the ancient city&#x27;s walls. The name &quot;Zoloti Vorota&quot; (Golden Gate) is also used for a nearby theatre and a station of the Kyiv Metro. The small Ukrainian National Chernobyl Museum acts as both a memorial and historical center devoted to the events surrounding the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and its effect on the Ukrainian people, the environment, and subsequent attitudes toward the safety of nuclear power as a whole.

===Sports===

Kyiv has many professional and amateur football clubs, including Dynamo Kyiv, Arsenal Kyiv and FC Obolon Kyiv but only Dynamo Kyiv play in the Ukrainian Premier League. Of these three, Dynamo Kyiv has had the most success over the course of its history. For example, up until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the club won 13 USSR Championships, 9 USSR Cups, and 3 USSR Super Cups, thus making Dynamo the most successful club in the history of the Soviet Top League.

Other prominent non-football sport clubs in the city include: the Sokil Kyiv ice hockey club and BC Budivelnyk basketball club. Both of these teams play in the highest Ukrainian leagues for their respective sports. Budivelnyk was founded in 1945, Sokil was founded in 1963, during the existence of the Soviet Union. Both these teams play their home games at the Kyiv Palace of Sports.

During the 1980 Summer Olympics held in the Soviet Union, Kyiv held the preliminary matches and the quarter-finals of the football tournament at its Olympic Stadium, which was reconstructed specially for the event. From 1 December 2008, the stadium underwent a full-scale reconstruction in order to satisfy standards put in place by UEFA for hosting the Euro 2012 football tournament; the opening ceremony took place in the presence of president Viktor Yanukovych on 8 October 2011, with the first major event being a Shakira concert which was specially planned to coincide with the stadium&#x27;s re-opening during Euro 2012. Other notable sport stadiums/sport complexes in Kyiv include the Valeriy Lobanovskyi Dynamo Stadium, the Palace of Sports, among many others.

Most Ukrainian national teams play their home international matches in Kyiv. The Ukraine national football team, for example, will play matches at the re-constructed Olympic Stadium from 2011.

===Tourism===

Since introducing a visa-free regime for EU-member states and Switzerland in 2005, Ukraine has seen a steady increase in the number of foreign tourists visiting the country. Before the 2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis, the average annual growth in the number of foreign visits in Kyiv was 23% over a three-year period. In 2009, a total of 1.6 million tourists stayed in Kyiv hotels, of whom almost 259,000 ( 16%) were foreigners.

After UEFA Euro 2012, the city became the most popular destination for European tourists. A record number of 1.8 million foreign tourists was registered then along with about 2.5 million domestic tourists. More than 850,000 foreign tourists visited Kyiv in the first half of 2018, as compared to 660,000 tourists over the same period in 2013. As of 2018, the hotel occupancy rate from May to September averages 45–50%. Hostels and three-star hotels are approximately 90% full, four-star hotels 65–70%. Six five-star hotels average 50–55% occupancy. Ordinary tourists generally come from May to October, and business tourists from September to May.

===City anthem===
In 2014, the Kyiv city&#x27;s council established the city&#x27;s anthem. It became a 1962 song, &quot;Yak tebe ne liubyty, Kyieve mii!&quot; (, roughly &quot;How can I not love you, Kyiv of mine!&quot;).

===City symbols===
The horse chestnut tree is one of the symbols of Kyiv. It was heavily present on the city&#x27;s coat of arms used from 1969 to 1995.

==Economy==
As with most capital cities, Kyiv is a major administrative, cultural, and scientific centre of the country. It is the largest city in Ukraine in terms of both population and area and enjoys the highest levels of business activity. On 1 January 2010, there were around 238,000 business entities registered in Kyiv.

Official figures show that between 2004 and 2008 Kyiv&#x27;s economy outstripped the rest of the country&#x27;s, growing by an annual average of 11.5%. Following the Great Recession, Kyiv&#x27;s economy suffered a severe setback in 2009 with gross regional product contracting by 13.5% in real terms. Although a record high, the decline in activity was 1.6 percentage points smaller than that for the country as a whole. The economy in Kyiv, as in the rest of Ukraine, recovered somewhat in 2010 and 2011. Kyiv is a middle-income city, with prices comparable to many mid-size American cities (i.e., considerably lower than Western Europe).

Because the city has a large and diverse economic base and is not dependent on any single industry or company, its unemployment rate has historically been relatively low – only 3.75% over 2005–2008. Indeed, even as the rate of joblessness jumped to 7.1% in 2009, it remained far below the national average of 9.6%.

As of January 2022, the average monthly salary in Kyiv reached 21,347 UAH (€540) gross and 17,184 UAH (€430) net.

Kyiv is the undisputed center of business and commerce of Ukraine and home to the country&#x27;s largest companies, such as Naftogaz Ukrainy, Energorynok and Kyivstar. In 2010, the city accounted for 18% of national retail sales and 24% of all construction activity. Real estate is one of the major forces in Kyiv&#x27;s economy. Average prices of apartments are the highest in the country and among the highest in eastern Europe. Kyiv also ranks high in terms of commercial real estate and has Ukraine&#x27;s tallest office buildings (such as Gulliver and Parus) and some of Ukraine&#x27;s biggest shopping malls (such as Dream Town and Ocean Plaza).

In May 2011, Kyiv authorities presented a 15-year development strategy which calls for attracting as much as EUR82 billion of foreign investment by 2025 to modernize the city&#x27;s transport and utilities infrastructure and make it more attractive for tourists.


===Industry===

Primary industries in Kyiv include utilities – i.e., electricity, gas and water supply (26% of total industrial output), manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco products (22%), chemical (17%), mechanical engineering (13%) and manufacture of paper and paper products, including publishing, printing and reproduction of recorded media (11%). The Institute of Oil Transportation is headquartered here.

==Education and science==
===Scientific research===
Scientific research is conducted in many institutes of higher education and, additionally, in many research institutes affiliated with the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. Kyiv is home to Ukraine&#x27;s ministry of education and science, and is also noted for its contributions to medical and computer science research.

In 2016, UNIT Factory (Ukrainian National IT Factory) opened. It offers a completely new format of IT education. The education is completely free for all trainees subject to compliance with the terms of the program. Within this project are the Technology Companies&#x27; Development Center (TCDC), BIONIC University open inter-corporate IT-university, as well as two hi-tech laboratories—VR Lab (Crytek) and Smart City lab.

===University education===

Kyiv hosts many universities, the major ones being Kyiv National Taras Shevchenko University, the National Technical University &quot;Kyiv Polytechnic Institute&quot;, Kyiv-Mohyla Academy and the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics. Of these, the Mohyla Academy is the oldest, founded as a theological school in 1632, but Shevchenko University, founded in 1834, is the oldest in continuous operation. The total number of institutions of higher education in Kyiv approaches 200, allowing young people to pursue almost any line of study. While education traditionally remains largely in the hands of the state there are several accredited private institutions in the city.

===Secondary education===
There are about 530 general secondary schools and about 680 nursery schools and kindergartens in Kyiv. Additionally, there are evening schools for adults, specialist technical schools, and the Evangel Theological Seminary.

===Public libraries===
There are many libraries in the city, with the Vernadsky National Library, which is Ukraine&#x27;s main academic library and scientific information centre, as well as one of the world&#x27;s largest national libraries, being the largest and most important one. The National Library is affiliated with the Academy of Sciences in so far as it is a deposit library and thus serves as the academy&#x27;s archives&#x27; store. The national library is the world&#x27;s foremost repository of Jewish folk music recorded on Edison wax cylinders. Their Collection of Jewish Musical Folklore (1912–1947) was inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register in 2005.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Local public transport====

Local public transportation in Kyiv includes the Metro, buses and minibuses, trolleybuses, trams, taxi and funicular. There is also an intra-city ring railway service.

The publicly owned and operated Kyiv Metro is the fastest, the most convenient and affordable network that covers most, but not all, of the city. The Metro is expanding towards the city limits to meet growing demand, having three lines with a total length of and 51 stations (some of which are renowned architectural landmarks). The Metro carries around 1.422 million passengers daily accounting for 38% of the Kyiv&#x27;s public transport load. In 2011, the total number of trips exceeded 519 million.

The historic tram system was the first electric tramway in the former Russian Empire and the third one in Europe after the Berlin Straßembahn and the Budapest tramway. The tram system consists of of track, including two Rapid Tram lines, served by 21 routes with the use of 523 tram cars. Once a well maintained and widely used method of transport, the system is now gradually being phased out in favor of buses and trolleybuses.

The Kyiv Funicular was constructed during 1902–1905. It connects the historic Uppertown, and the lower commercial neighborhood of Podil through the steep Saint Volodymyr Hill overseeing the Dnieper River. The line consists of two stations.

All public road transport (except for some minibuses) is operated by the united Kyivpastrans municipal company. It is heavily subsidized by the city.

The Kyiv public transport system, except for taxi, uses a simple flat rate tariff system regardless of distance traveled: tickets or tokens must be purchased each time a vehicle is boarded. Digital ticket system is already established in Kyiv Metro, with plans for other transport modes. The cost of one ride is far lower than in Western Europe.

The taxi market in Kyiv is expansive but not regulated. In particular, the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated. There is a fierce competition between private taxi companies.

====Roads and bridges====
Kyiv represents the focal point of Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;national roads&quot; system, thus linked by road to all cities of the country. European routes , and intersect in Kyiv.

There are eight Dnieper bridges and dozens of grade-separated intersections in the city. Several new intersections are under construction. There are plans to build a full-size, fully grade-separated ring road around Kyiv.

In 2009, Kyiv&#x27;s roads were in poor technical condition and maintained inadequately.

Traffic jams and lack of parking space are growing problems for all road transport services in Kyiv.
====Air transport====

Kyiv is served by two international passenger airports: the Boryspil Airport away, and the smaller, municipally owned Zhuliany Airport on the southern outskirts of the city. There are also the Hostomel cargo airport and additional three operating airfields facilitating the Antonov aircraft manufacturing company and general aviation.

====Railways====

Railways are Kyiv&#x27;s main mode of intracity- and suburban transportation. The city has a developed railroad infrastructure including a long-distance passenger station, 6 cargo stations, depots, and repairing facilities. However, this system still fails to meet the demand for passenger service. Particularly, the Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi railway station is the city&#x27;s only long-distance passenger terminal (&quot;vokzal&quot;).

Construction is underway for turning the large Darnytsia railway station on the left-bank part of Kyiv into a long-distance passenger hub, which may ease traffic at the central station. Bridges over the Dnieper River are another problem restricting the development of city&#x27;s railway system. Presently, only one rail bridge out of two is available for intense train traffic. A new combined rail-auto bridge is under construction, as a part of Darnytsia project.

In 2011, the Kyiv city administration established the new Urban Train for Kyiv. This service runs at standard 4- to 10-minute intervals throughout the day and follows a circular route around the city centre, which allows it to serve many of Kyiv&#x27;s inner suburbs. Interchanges between the Kyiv Metro and Fast Tram exist at many of the urban train&#x27;s station stops.

Suburban &#x27;Kyiv City Express&#x27; trains (colloquially known as &quot;elektrychka&quot;) are serviced by the publicly owned Ukrainian Railways. The suburban train service is fast, and unbeatably safe in terms of traffic accidents. But the trains are not reliable, as they may fall significantly behind schedule, may not be safe in terms of crime, and the &quot;elektrychka&quot; cars are poorly maintained and overcrowded in rush hours.

There are nine &quot;elektrychka&quot; directions from Kyiv:
* Bila Tserkva – Uzyn
* Fastiv
* Klavdiievo
* Myronivka – Bohuslav
* Nizhyn
* Ukrainka
* Vasylkiv
* Vyshhorod
* Yahotyn

More than a dozen of &quot;elektrychka&quot; stops are within the city allowing residents of different neighborhoods to use the suburban trains.

===Energy===
 (formerly Kyivenergo) is the electric power distribution network operator for Kyiv, owned by oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. it had:
* 12,038 km of power transmission lines with a voltage of 0.4–110 kV
* 64 substations with a voltage of 35–110 kV
* 243 switchgears and 3728 transformer substations at 10 kV

 operates a centralized heating system, which provides heating and hot water to customers through a network of pipes that distribute hot water from centralized heating plants to buildings throughout the city. It operates a 2700 km network, two of the largest combined heat and power plants in Ukraine CHP-5 and CHP-6, as well as the only waste incineration plant operating in Ukraine.

In line with the EU Third Energy Package, since 2019 state energy policy abandoned the Rotterdam plus system and has required transmission system operator (TSO) and regional utilities unbundling in order to separate electricity distribution and retail electricity supply.

===Water and sanitation===
The national government has delegated responsibility for water and sanitation services to local authorities. is a private joint-stock company that provides such services to Kyiv. The length of water supply networks is 4231 km, of which 1798 km are dilapidated. The length of sewage networks is 2662 km, of which 830 km are dilapidated.

<text>Great British Nuclear (GBN), formerly British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL), is a nuclear energy and fuels company owned by the UK Government. It is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

From its creation in 1971 to 2010, it functioned as a manufacturer of nuclear fuel (notably MOX), ran reactors, generated and sold electricity, reprocessed and managed spent fuel (mainly at Sellafield), and decommissioned nuclear plants and other similar facilities. 

It was resurrected in July 2023 under the trading name Great British Nuclear, to coordinate the UK nuclear industry to help achieve government net-zero targets. The company formally changed its name to Great British Nuclear on 20 March 2024. 

==History==
British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) was set up in February 1971 from the demerger of the production division of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). In 1984, BNFL became a public limited company as British Nuclear Fuels plc, wholly owned by the UK government.

Its US subsidiary BNFL, Inc. was established in 1990 and specialised in decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear sites.

In 1996, seven advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR) and one pressurised water reactor (PWR) were privatised as British Energy, raising £2.1 billion. The oldest reactors, the Magnox sites, were not attractive for commercial operations and remained in public ownership as Magnox Electric. On 30 January 1998, Magnox Electric was merged into BNFL as BNFL Magnox Generation.

===Quality data falsification crisis===

In 1999, it was discovered that BNFL staff had been falsifying some MOX fuel quality assurance data since 1996. A Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) investigation concluded that &quot;the level of control and supervision ... had been virtually non-existent.&quot; BNFL had to pay compensation to the Japanese customer, Kansai Electric, and take back a flawed shipment of MOX fuel from Japan. BNFL&#x27;s Chief Executive John Taylor resigned, after initially resisting resignation when the NII&#x27;s damning report was published.

As a consequence of this crisis, a possible partial privatisation of BNFL was delayed by two years.

===Expansion===
In 1999, BNFL acquired Westinghouse Electric Company, the commercial nuclear power businesses of CBS (Westinghouse acquired CBS in 1995 and reoriented itself as a broadcaster), for $1.1 billion. Westinghouse&#x27;s businesses are fuel manufacture, decommissioning of nuclear sites and reactor design, construction and servicing. Westinghouse was acquired as a possible core for the privatisation of a portion of BNFL.

In 2000, BNFL also purchased the nuclear businesses of ABB for £300 million. This company, which was merged into Westinghouse, had nuclear interests in the United States, Europe and Asia. In June 2000, BNFL took a 22.5% stake in Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (Pty) Ltd in South Africa.

In January 2003, the research and development arm of BNFL was relaunched as Nuclear Sciences and Technology Services (NSTS).

However, BNFL&#x27;s financial difficulties increased, and the prospect of partial privatisation diminished.

===Reorganisation===
On 1 April 2005, the company was reorganised as part of the restructuring of the wider nuclear industry. BNFL became British Nuclear Group (BNG) and a new holding company was established and adopted the British Nuclear Fuels name. This new BNFL operated largely through its major subsidiaries of Westinghouse and BNG as well as Nexia Solutions, its commercial nuclear technology business formed out of NSTS.

The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) was established on 1 April 2005 and took ownership of all of BNFL&#x27;s nuclear sites, including the Sellafield site. The NDA then opened up the decommissioning of the different sites to tender to drive down costs. BNFL became one of a number of decommissioning contractors through BNG. BNFL&#x27;s nuclear waste transfer companies, Direct Rail Services and International Nuclear Services, were also both transferred to the NDA.

On 19 April 2005, BNFL, Inc. was renamed BNG America and made a subsidiary of BNG.

====Sale of Westinghouse====
In July 2005, BNFL confirmed it planned to sell Westinghouse, then estimated to be worth $1.8bn (£1bn). However the bid attracted interest from several companies, including Toshiba, General Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and when the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported on 23 January 2006 that Toshiba had won the bid, it valued the company&#x27;s offer at $5bn (£2.8bn). On 6 February 2006, Toshiba confirmed it was buying Westinghouse Electric Company for $5.4bn and announced it would sell a minority stake to investors.

====Break up of British Nuclear Group====
On 3 February 2006, BNFL announced it had agreed to sell BNG America to Envirocare to form EnergySolutions.

In March 2006, BNFL announced its intention to sell BNG. With the sale of Westinghouse, BNG America and BNG this was to effectively bring BNFL to an end. Mike Parker, CEO of BNFL, said: &quot;By the end of 2007... there will be little need for the BNFL corporate centre from this time&quot;. On 22 August 2006, BNFL announced that instead of selling BNG as a going concern it would instead sell it off piece by piece.

In January 2007, BNFL announced that it would sell BNG&#x27;s Magnox reactor sites operating business, Reactor Sites Management Company Ltd. It was later sold in June 2007, along with its subsidiary that held the operating contracts with the NDA, Magnox Electric, to EnergySolutions. All UK Magnox power stations were due to cease operation by the end of 2015.

BNG Project Services, BNG&#x27;s specialist nuclear consulting business, was sold in January 2008 to VT Group, which was itself later acquired in 2010 by Babcock International Group.

BNG was renamed Sellafield Ltd and became the NDA&#x27;s Site Licence Company (SLC) for the decommissioning contract at Sellafield. In November 2008, the NDA contracted the management of Sellafield Ltd to Nuclear Management Partners Ltd, a consortium of URS, AMEC and Areva.

====Formation of the National Nuclear Laboratory====
In July 2006, the UK Government stated its intention to preserve and develop key research and development capabilities potentially as part of a National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL). In October 2006, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Alistair Darling confirmed the NNL would be formed out of Nexia Solutions and the British Technology Centre at Sellafield. The NNL was launched in July 2008 as a Government-owned company, and initially was managed under contract by a consortium of Serco, Battelle and the University of Manchester; this is known as a GOCO (Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated) arrangement.

====Final disposals====
Control of BNFL&#x27;s one third stake in Urenco was transferred to the Shareholder Executive in April 2008 through Enrichment Holdings Ltd while the government explored the possibility of selling the stake.

BNFL&#x27;s one third stake of AWE Management Ltd was sold to Jacobs Engineering Group in December 2008. AWE is responsible for the support and manufacturing of the UK&#x27;s nuclear deterrent.

As BNFL was wound down it was converted back to a private limited company on 31 December 2008 and regained its original name, British Nuclear Fuels Limited. The final sale transactions for BNFL&#x27;s former businesses were completed in May 2009. 

Despite this, the company itself was not wound up and continued as a legal entity.

=== Resurrection as Great British Nuclear ===
In February 2023, plans to wind up the company within two years were still active. By this point the company had not traded in 13 years.

However, on 18 July 2023, BNFL was resurrected as Great British Nuclear, with the aim of delivering the government&#x27;s long-term nuclear programme and supporting its ambition to deliver up to 24 GW of nuclear power in the UK by 2050. Great British Nuclear is running a small modular reactor (SMR) competition which will place between one and four co-funding contracts in late 2024, supporting the development and regulatory approval process, to prepare bids for a SMR final investment decision in 2029.

It is a unique example of a private company limited by shares in the UK that does not include the mandatory &quot;Limited&quot; (Ltd) suffix placed in the company&#x27;s legal name; hence &quot;Great British Nuclear&quot; is the company&#x27;s exact legal name.

In March 2024, Great British Nuclear bought the Oldbury and Wylfa sites from Horizon in a deal worth £160m.

== Leadership ==
GBN is led by Gwen Parry-Jones as interim chief executive officer, who was formerly the CEO of Magnox Ltd.

Its chair is Simon Bowen.

<doc id="585648" wikidata="Q912009" url="?curid=585648" title="Modularity">
<text>Modularity is the degree to which a system&#x27;s components may be separated and recombined, often with the benefit of flexibility and variety in use. The concept of modularity is used primarily to reduce complexity by breaking a system into varying degrees of interdependence and independence across and &quot;hide the complexity of each part behind an abstraction and interface&quot;. However, the concept of modularity can be extended to multiple disciplines, each with their own nuances. Despite these nuances, consistent themes concerning modular systems can be identified.

Composability is one of the tenets of functional programming. This makes functional programs modular. 

==Contextual nuances==
The meaning of the word &quot;modularity&quot; can vary somewhat based on context. The following are contextual examples of modularity across several fields of science, technology, industry, and culture:

===Science===
*In biology, modularity recognizes that organisms or metabolic pathways are composed of modules.
*In ecology, modularity is considered a key factor—along with diversity and feedback—in supporting resilience.
*In nature, modularity may refer to the construction of a cellular organism by joining together standardized units to form larger compositions, as for example, the hexagonal cells in a honeycomb.
*In cognitive science, the idea of modularity of mind holds that the mind is composed of independent, closed, domain-specific processing modules.
**Visual modularity, the various putative visual modules.
**Language module, the putative language module.
*In the study of complex networks, modularity is a benefit function that measures the quality of a division of a network into groups or communities.

===Technology===
*In modular programming, modularity refers to the compartmentalization and interrelation of the parts of a software package.
*In software design, modularity refers to a logical partitioning of the &quot;software design&quot; that allows complex software to be manageable for the purpose of implementation and maintenance. The logic of partitioning may be based on related functions, implementation considerations, data links, or other criteria.
*In self-reconfiguring modular robotics, modularity refers to the ability of the robotic system to automatically achieve different morphologies to execute the task at hand.

===Industry===
*In modular construction, modules are a bundle of redundant project components that are produced en masse prior to installation.Building components are often arranged into modules in the industrialization of construction.
*In industrial design, modularity refers to an engineering technique that builds larger systems by combining smaller subsystems.
*In manufacturing, modularity typically refers to modular design, either as the use of exchangeable parts or options in the fabrication of an object or the design and manufacture of modular components.
*In organizational design, Richard L. Daft and Arie Y. Lewin (1993) identified a paradigm called &quot;modular organization&quot; that had as its ground the need for flexible learning organizations in constant change and the need to solve their problems through coordinated self-organizing processes. This modular organization is characterized by decentralized decision-making, flatter hierarchies, self-organization of units.

===Culture===
*In &quot;The Language of New Media&quot;, author Lev Manovich discusses the principle that new media is composed of modules or self-sufficient parts of the overall media object.
*In contemporary art and architecture, modularity can refer to the construction of an object by joining together standardized units to form larger compositions, and/or to the use of a module as a standardized unit of measurement and proportion.
*In modular art, modularity refers to the ability to alter the work by reconfiguring, adding to, and/or removing its parts.

==Modularity in different research areas==
===Modularity in technology and management===

The term is widely used in studies of technological and organizational systems. Product systems are deemed &quot;modular&quot;, for example, when they can be decomposed into a number of components that may be mixed and matched in a variety of configurations. The components are able to connect, interact, or exchange resources (such as energy or data) in some way, by adhering to a standardized interface. Unlike a tightly integrated product whereby each component is designed to work specifically (and often exclusively) with other particular components in a tightly coupled system, modular products are systems of components that are &quot;loosely coupled.&quot;

In &quot;The Language of New Media&quot;, Lev Manovich proposes five &quot;principles of new media&quot;—to be understood &quot;not as absolute laws but rather as general tendencies of a culture undergoing computerization.&quot; The five principles are numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability, and transcoding. Modularity within new media represents new media as being composed of several separate self-sufficient modules that can act independently or together in synchronisation to complete the new media object. In Photoshop, modularity is most evident in layers; a single image can be composed of many layers, each of which can be treated as an entirely independent and separate entity. Websites can be defined as being modular, their structure is formed in a format that allows their contents to be changed, removed or edited whilst still retaining the structure of the website. This is because the website&#x27;s content operates separately to the website and does not define the structure of the site. The entire Web, Manovich notes, has a modular structure, composed of independent sites and pages, and each webpage itself is composed of elements and code that can be independently modified.

Organizational systems are said to become increasingly modular when they begin to substitute loosely coupled forms for tightly integrated, hierarchical structures. For instance, when the firm utilizes contract manufacturing rather than in-house manufacturing, it is using an organizational component that is more independent than building such capabilities in-house: the firm can switch between contract manufacturers that perform different functions, and the contract manufacturer can similarly work for different firms. As firms in a given industry begin to substitute loose coupling with organizational components that lie outside of firm boundaries for activities that were once conducted in-house, the entire production system (which may encompass many firms) becomes increasingly modular. The firms themselves become more specialized components. Using loosely coupled structures enables firms to achieve greater flexibility in both scope and scale. This is in line with modularity in the processes of production, which relates to the way that technological artifacts are produced. This consists of the artifact&#x27;s entire value chain, from the designing of the artifact to the manufacturing and distribution stages. In production, modularity is often due to increased design modularity. The firm can switch easily between different providers of these activities (e.g., between different contract manufacturers or alliance partners) compared to building the capabilities for all activities in house, thus responding to different market needs more quickly. However, these flexibility gains come with a price. Therefore, the organization must assess the flexibility gains achievable, and any accompanying loss of performance, with each of these forms.

Modularization within firms leads to the disaggregation of the traditional form of hierarchical governance. The firm is decomposed into relatively small autonomous organizational units (modules) to reduce complexity. Modularization leads to a structure, in which the modules integrate strongly interdependent tasks, while the interdependencies between the modules are weak. In this connection the dissemination of modular organizational forms has been facilitated by the widespread efforts of the majority of large firms to re-engineer, refocus and restructure. These efforts usually involve a strong process-orientation: the complete service-provision process of the business is split up into partial processes, which can then be handled autonomously by cross-functional teams within organizational units (modules). The co-ordination of the modules is often carried out by using internal market mechanisms, in particular by the implementation of profit centers. Overall, modularization enables more flexible and quicker reaction to changing general or market conditions. Building on the above principles, many alternative forms of modularization of organizations (for-profit or non-profit) are possible. However, modularization is not an independent and self-contained organizational concept, but rather consists of several basic ideas, which are integral parts of other organizational concepts. These central ideas can be found in every firm. Accordingly, it is not sensible to characterize a firm as &quot;modular&quot; or as &quot;not modular&quot;, because firms are always modular to a some degree.

Input systems, or &quot;domain specific computational mechanisms&quot; (such as the ability to perceive spoken language) are termed vertical faculties, and according to Jerry Fodor they are modular in that they possess a number of characteristics Fodor argues constitute modularity. Fodor&#x27;s list of features characterizing modules includes the following:
# Domain specific (modules only respond to inputs of a specific class, and thus a &quot;species of vertical faculty&quot; (Fodor, 1996 [1983]:37)
# Innately specified (the structure is inherent and is not formed by a learning process)
# Not assembled (modules are not put together from a stock of more elementary subprocesses but rather their virtual architecture maps directly onto their neural implementation)
# Neurologically hardwired (modules are associated with specific, localized, and elaborately structured neural systems rather than fungible neural mechanisms)
# Autonomous (modules independent of other modules)

Fodor does not argue that this is formal definition or an all-inclusive list of features necessary for modularity. He argues only that cognitive systems characterized by some of the features above are likely to be characterized by them all, and that such systems can be considered modular. He also notes that the characteristics are not an all-or-nothing proposition, but rather each of the characteristics may be manifest in some degree, and that modularity itself is also not a dichotomous construct—something may be more or less modular: &quot;One would thus expect—what anyhow seems to be desirable—that the notion of modularity ought to admit of degrees&quot; (Fodor, 1996 [1983]:37).

Notably, Fodor&#x27;s &quot;not assembled&quot; feature contrasts sharply with the use of modularity in other fields in which modular systems are seen to be hierarchically nested (that is, modules are themselves composed of modules, which in turn are composed of modules, etc.) However, Max Coltheart notes that Fodor&#x27;s commitment to the non-assembled feature appears weak, and other scholars (e.g., Block) have proposed that Fodor&#x27;s modules could be decomposed into finer modules. For instance, while Fodor distinguishes between separate modules for spoken and written language, Block might further decompose the spoken language module into modules for phonetic analysis and lexical forms: &quot;Decomposition stops when all the components are primitive processors—because the operation of a primitive processor cannot be further decomposed into suboperations&quot;

Though Fodor&#x27;s work on modularity is one of the most extensive, there is other work in psychology on modularity worth noting for its symmetry with modularity in other disciplines. For instance, while Fodor focused on cognitive input systems as modules, Coltheart proposes that there may be many different kinds of cognitive modules, and distinguishes between, for example, knowledge modules and processing modules. The former is a body of knowledge that is independent of other bodies of knowledge, while the latter is a mental information-processing system independent from other such systems.

However, the data neuroscientists have accumulated have not pointed to an organization system as neat and precise as the modularity theory originally proposed originally by Jerry Fodor. It has been shown to be much messier and different from person to person, even though general patterns exist; through a mixture of neuroimaging and lesion studies, it has been shown that there are certain regions that perform certain functions and other regions that do not perform those functions.

===Modularity in biology===
As in some of the other disciplines, the term modularity may be used in multiple ways in biology. For example, it may refer to organisms that have an indeterminate structure wherein modules of various complexity (e.g., leaves, twigs) may be assembled without strict limits on their number or placement. Many plants and sessile (immobile) invertebrates of the benthic zones demonstrate this type of modularity (by contrast, many other organisms have a determinate structure that is predefined in embryogenesis). The term has also been used in a broader sense in biology to refer to the reuse of homologous structures across individuals and species. Even within this latter category, there may be differences in how a module is perceived. For instance, evolutionary biologists may focus on the module as a morphological component (subunit) of a whole organism, while developmental biologists may use the term module to refer to some combination of lower-level components (e.g., genes) that are able to act in a unified way to perform a function. In the former, the module is perceived a basic component, while in the latter the emphasis is on the module as a collective.

Biology scholars have provided a list of features that should characterize a module (much as Fodor did in &quot;The Modularity of Mind&quot;). For instance, Rudy Raff provides the following list of characteristics that developmental modules should possess:
# discrete genetic specification
# hierarchical organization
# interactions with other modules
# a particular physical location within a developing organism
# the ability to undergo transformations on both developmental and evolutionary time scales

To Raff&#x27;s mind, developmental modules are &quot;dynamic entities representing localized processes (as in morphogenetic fields) rather than simply incipient structures ... (... such as organ rudiments)&quot;. Bolker, however, attempts to construct a definitional list of characteristics that is more abstract, and thus more suited to multiple levels of study in biology. She argues that:
# A module is a biological entity (a structure, a process, or a pathway) characterized by more internal than external integration
# Modules are biological individuals that can be delineated from their surroundings or context, and whose behavior or function reflects the integration of their parts, not simply the arithmetical sum. That is, as a whole, the module can perform tasks that its constituent parts could not perform if dissociated.
# In addition to their internal integration, modules have external connectivity, yet they can also be delineated from the other entities with which they interact in some way.

Another stream of research on modularity in biology that should be of particular interest to scholars in other disciplines is that of Günter Wagner and Lee Altenberg. Altenberg&#x27;s work, Wagner&#x27;s work, and their joint writing explores how natural selection may have resulted in modular organisms, and the roles modularity plays in evolution. Altenberg&#x27;s and Wagner&#x27;s work suggests that modularity is both the result of evolution, and facilitates evolution—an idea that shares a marked resemblance to work on modularity in technological and organizational domains.

===Modularity in the arts===
The use of modules in the fine arts has a long pedigree among diverse cultures. In the classical architecture of Greco-Roman antiquity, the module was utilized as a standardized unit of measurement for proportioning the elements of a building. Typically the module was established as one-half the diameter of the lower shaft of a classical column; all the other components in the syntax of the classical system were expressed as a fraction or multiple of that module. In traditional Japanese construction, room sizes were often determined by combinations of standard rice mats called tatami; the standard dimension of a mat was around 3 feet by 6 feet, which approximate the overall proportions of a reclining human figure. The module thus becomes not only a proportional device for use with three-dimensional vertical elements but a two-dimensional planning tool as well.

Modularity as a means of measurement is intrinsic to certain types of building; for example, brick construction is by its nature modular insofar as the fixed dimensions of a brick necessarily yield dimensions that are multiples of the original unit. Attaching bricks to one another to form walls and surfaces also reflects a second definition of modularity: namely, the use of standardized units that physically connect to each other to form larger compositions.

With the advent of modernism and advanced construction techniques in the 20th century this latter definition transforms modularity from a compositional attribute to a thematic concern in its own right. A school of modular constructivism develops in the 1950s among a circle of sculptors who create sculpture and architectural features out of repetitive units cast in concrete. A decade later modularity becomes an autonomous artistic concern of its own, as several important Minimalist artists adopt it as their central theme. Modular building as both an industrial production model and an object of advanced architectural investigation develops from this same period.

Modularity has found renewed interest among proponents of ModulArt, a form of modular art in which the constituent parts can be physically reconfigured, removed and/or added to. After a few isolated experiments in ModulArt starting in the 1950s, several artists since the 1990s have explored this flexible, customizable and co-creative form of art.

=== Modularity in fashion ===
Modularity in fashion is the ability to customise garments through adding and removing elements or altering the silhouette, usually via zips, hook and eye closures or other fastenings. Throughout history it has been used to tailor garments, existing even in the 17th century. In recent years, an increasing number of fashion designers – especially those focused on slow or sustainable fashion – are experimenting with this concept. Within the realm of Haute Couture, Yohji Yamamoto and Hussein Chalayan are notable examples, the latter especially for his use of technology to create modular garments.

Studies carried out in Finland and the US show favourable attitudes of consumers to modular fashion, despite this the concept has not yet made it into mainstream fashion. The current emphasis within modular fashion is on the co-designing and customisation factors for consumers, with a goal to combat the swift changes to customers needs and wants, while also tackling sustainability by increasing the life-cycle of garments.

=== Modularity in product design ===
Modularity is a concept that has been thoroughly used in architecture and industry. In interior design modularity is used in order to achieve customizable products that are economically viable. Examples include some of the customizable creations of IKEA and mostly high-end high-cost concepts. Modularity in interior design, or &quot;modularity in use&quot;, refers to the opportunities of combinations and reconfigurations of the modules in order to create an artefact that suits the specific needs of the user and simultaneously grows with them. The evolution of 3D printing technology has enabled customizable furniture to become feasible. Objects can be prototyped, changed depending on the space and customized dependent on the users needs. Designers can prototype showcase their modules over the internet just by using 3D printing technology. Sofas are a common piece that have modular utilities ranging from ottoman to a bed, as well as fabrics and textiles that are swappable. This originated in the 1940s after being invented by Harvey Probber, was refined in the 1970s, and reaching mass scale consumerism in the 2010s and 2020s.

===Modularity in American studies===
In John Blair&#x27;s &quot;Modular America&quot;, he argues that as Americans began to replace social structures inherited from Europe (predominantly England and France), they evolved a uniquely American tendency towards modularity in fields as diverse as education, music, and architecture.

Blair observes that when the word &quot;module&quot; first emerged in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it meant something very close to &quot;model&quot;. It implied a small-scale representation or example. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the word had come to imply a standard measure of fixed ratios and proportions. For example, in architecture, the proportions of a column could be stated in modules (i.e., &quot;a height of fourteen modules equaled seven times the diameter measured at the base&quot;) and thus multiplied to any size while still retaining the desired proportions.

However, in America, the meaning and usage of the word shifted considerably: &quot;Starting with architectural terminology in the 1930s, the new emphasis was on any entity or system designed in terms of modules as subcomponents. As applications broadened after World War II to furniture, hi-fi equipment, computer programs and beyond, modular construction came to refer to any whole made up of self-contained units designed to be equivalent parts of a system, hence, we might say, &quot;systemically equivalent.&quot; Modular parts are implicitly interchangeable and/or recombinable in one or another of several senses&quot;.

Blair defines a modular system as &quot;one that gives more importance to parts than to wholes. Parts are conceived as equivalent and hence, in one or more senses, interchangeable and/or cumulative and/or recombinable&quot; (p. 125). Blair describes the emergence of modular structures in education (the college curriculum), industry (modular product assembly), architecture (skyscrapers), music (blues and jazz), and more. In his concluding chapter, Blair does not commit to a firm view of what causes Americans to pursue more modular structures in the diverse domains in which it has appeared; but he does suggest that it may in some way be related to the American ideology of liberal individualism and a preference for anti-hierarchical organization.

==Consistent themes==
Comparing the use of modularity across disciplines reveals several themes:

One theme that shows up in psychology and biology study is innately specified. &quot;Innately specified&quot; (as used here) implies that the purpose or structure of the module is predetermined by some biological mandate.

&quot;Domain specificity&quot;, that modules respond only to inputs of a specific class (or perform functions only of a specific class) is a theme that clearly spans psychology and biology, and it can be argued that it also spans technological and organizational systems. Domain specificity would be seen in the latter disciplines as specialization of function.

&quot;Hierarchically nested&quot; is a theme that recurs in most disciplines. Though originally disavowed by Jerry Fodor, other psychologists have embraced it, and it is readily apparent in the use of modularity in biology (e.g., each module of an organism can be decomposed into finer modules), social processes and artifacts (e.g., we can think of a skyscraper in terms of blocks of floors, a single floor, elements of a floor, etc.), mathematics (e.g., the modulus 6 may be further divided into the moduli 1, 2 and 3), and technological and organizational systems (e.g., an organization may be composed of divisions, which are composed of teams, which are composed of individuals).

&quot;Greater internal than external integration&quot; is a theme that showed up in every discipline but mathematics. Often referred to as autonomy, this theme acknowledged that there may be interaction or integration between modules, but the greater interaction and integration occurs within the module. This theme is very closely related to &quot;information encapsulation&quot;, which shows up explicitly in both the psychology and technology research.

&quot;Near decomposability&quot; (as termed by Simon, 1962) shows up in all of the disciplines, but is manifest in a matter of degrees. For instance, in psychology and biology it may refer merely to the ability to delineate one module from another (recognizing the boundaries of the module). In several of the social artifacts, mathematics, and technological or organizational systems, however, it refers to the ability to actually separate components from one another. In several of the disciplines this decomposability also enables the complexity of a system (or process) to be reduced. This is aptly captured in a quote from David Marr about psychological processes where he notes that, &quot;any large computation should be split up into a collection of small, nearly independent, specialized subprocesses.&quot; Reducing complexity is also the express purpose of casting out nines in mathematics.

&quot;Substitutability&quot; and &quot;recombinability&quot; are closely related constructs. The former refers to the ability to substitute one component for another as in John Blair&#x27;s &quot;systemic equivalence&quot; while the latter may refer both to the indeterminate form of the system and the indeterminate use of the component. In US college curricula, for example, each course is designed with a credit system that ensures a uniform number of contact hours, and approximately uniform educational content, yielding substitutability. By virtue of their substitutability, each student may create their own curricula (recombinability of the curriculum as a system) and each course may be said to be recombinable with a variety of students&#x27; curricula (recombinability of the component within multiple systems). Both substitutability and recombinability are immediately recognizable in Blair&#x27;s social processes and artifacts, and are also well captured in Garud and Kumaraswamy&#x27;s discussion of economies of substitution in technological systems.

Blair&#x27;s systemic equivalence also demonstrates the relationship between substitutability and the &quot;module as a homologue&quot;. Blair&#x27;s systemic equivalence refers to the ability for multiple modules to perform approximately the same function within a system, while in biology a module as a homologue refers to different modules sharing approximately the same form or function in different organisms. The extreme of the module as homologue is found in mathematics, where (in the simplest case) the modules refer to the reuse of a particular number and thus each module is exactly alike.

In all but mathematics, there has been an emphasis that modules may be different in kind. In Fodor&#x27;s discussion of modular cognitive system, each module performs a unique task. In biology, even modules that are considered homologous may be somewhat different in form and function (e.g., a whale&#x27;s fin versus a human&#x27;s hand). In Blair&#x27;s book, he points out that while jazz music may be composed of structural units that conform to the same underlying rules, those components vary significantly. Similarly in studies of technology and organization, modular systems may be composed of modules that are very similar (as in shelving units that may be piled one atop the other) or very different (as in a stereo system where each component performs unique functions) or any combination in between.

<text>Hans Dulfer (born 28 May 1940) is a Dutch jazz musician who plays tenor saxophone.

== Life and music ==

Hans Dulfer was born on 28 May 1940 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He began at age 17 and has been referred to as &quot;Big boy&quot; because of his album of the same name. At the end of the sixties he and Herbert Noord (Hammond organ) founded a quartet that played saxophone/organ funk. He has performed a considerable amount of crossover jazz and jazz fusion and has also worked with Punk rockers. He has recorded an album with saxophonist Frank Wright titled &quot;El Saxofón&quot;. He has comparatively high popularity in Japan where &quot;Hyperbeat&quot; was a top-selling CD by instrumental standards. Furthermore, Japanese film maker Masaaki Yuasa stated that he listened to Hans Dulfer&#x27;s music while working on Mind Game.

Hans Dulfer is the father of saxophonist Candy Dulfer and the two worked together on the album &quot;Dulfer &amp; Dulfer&quot;.

<doc id="585650" wikidata="Q152355" url="?curid=585650" title="Cordwainer">
<text>A cordwainer () is a shoemaker who makes new shoes from new leather. The cordwainer&#x27;s trade can be contrasted with the cobbler&#x27;s trade, according to a tradition in Britain that restricted cobblers to repairing shoes. This usage distinction is not universally observed, as the word &quot;cobbler&quot; is widely used for tradespersons who make or repair shoes. 

The Oxford English Dictionary says that the word &quot;cordwainer&quot; is archaic, &quot;still used in the names of guilds, for example, &quot;the Cordwainers&#x27; Company&quot;&quot;; but its definition of &quot;cobbler&quot; mentions only mending, reflecting the older distinction. Play 14 of the Chester Mystery Plays was presented by the guild of &quot;corvisors&quot;, known to mean shoemakers.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;cordwainer&quot; entered English as &quot;cordewaner(e)&quot;, from the Anglo-Norman &quot;cordewaner&quot; (from Old French , &#x27;, &#x27;, etc.), and initially denoted a worker in cordwain or cordovan, the leather historically produced in Moorish Córdoba, Spain in the Middle Ages, as well as, more narrowly, a shoemaker. The earliest attestation in English is a reference to &quot;Randolf se cordewan[ere]&quot;, &quot;ca.&quot; 1100.

According to the &quot;OED&quot;, the term is now considered obsolete except where it persists in the name of a trade-guild or company, or where otherwise employed by trade unions.

==History==
British tradition distinguishes the terms &quot;cordwainer&quot; and &quot;cobbler&quot;, restricting cobblers to repairing shoes. In this usage, a &quot;cordwainer&quot; is someone who makes new shoes using new leather, whereas a &quot;cobbler&quot; is someone who repairs shoes. Medieval cordwainers used cordovan leather for the highest-quality shoes, but cordwainers also used domestically produced leathers and were not solely producers of luxury footwear.

===British Isles===
In the historic London guild system, the cobblers and cordwainers formed separate guilds, and the cobblers were forbidden by the Mayor of London in 1395 from working in new leather, and cordwainers similarly forbidden to meddle with old shoes. Historically, cobblers also made shoes, but only using old leather recovered from discarded or repaired shoes. Today, many makers of bespoke shoes will also repair their own work, but shoe repairers are not normally in a position to manufacture new footwear.
In London, the guild of the Worshipful Company of Cordwainers historically controlled the occupation of cordwainer. Granted a royal charter of incorporation in 1439, the Guild had received its first ordinance in 1272. Historically, most of London&#x27;s cordwainers lived and worked in the ward of the City of London named Cordwainer.

Until 2000 a Cordwainers&#x27; Technical College existed in London. For over a hundred years, the college had been recognised as one of the world&#x27;s leading establishments for training shoemakers and leather workers. It produced some of the leading fashion designers, including Jimmy Choo (born 1948) and Patrick Cox (born 1963). In 2000 Cordwainers&#x27; College was absorbed into the London College of Fashion, the shoe-design and accessories departments of which have become &quot;Cordwainers at London College of Fashion&quot;.

In Scotland, in 1722, the cordwainers petitioned &quot;to be incorporated and separated from the shoe-makers or those who make single-soled shoes&quot;.

===United States===
Settlers who sailed to Virginia in 1607 to settle in Jamestown included cordwainers. By 1616 the secretary of Virginia reported that the leather- and shoe-trades were flourishing. Christopher Nelme, of England, was the earliest recorded named shoemaker in the American colonies; he sailed to Virginia from Bristol in 1619.

In 1620 the Pilgrims landed in Massachusetts near the site of modern Provincetown. Nine years later, in 1629, the first shoemakers arrived, bringing their skills with them.

In 1984 a group of shoemakers and historians founded the Honourable Cordwainers&#x27; Company as a modern guild; they drew up its charter in the following year. In 1987 the Company &quot;incorporated as a non-profit, tax-exempt educational organization in the state of Virginia, the home of America&#x27;s first shoemakers&quot;, and was granted official status through recognition by The Master of The Worshipful Company of Cordwainers, London, England.

===Canada===
The early settlers of Canada also included cordwainers. On 14 June 1749, the newly appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Edward Cornwallis, arrived off Chebucto Head, Nova Scotia in the sloop-of-war HMS &quot;Sphinx&quot; with the objective of establishing the settlement now called Halifax. By 27 June, thirteen transport-ships following the &quot;Sphinx&quot; reached the harbour with the initial 2,576 British settlers – among them nineteen cordwainers.

<text>Onuphrius (also Onoufrios; ) lived as a hermit in the desert of Upper Egypt in the 4th or 5th centuries. He is venerated as Saint Onuphrius in both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Catholic churches, as Venerable Onuphrius in Eastern Orthodoxy, and as Saint Nofer the Anchorite in Oriental Orthodoxy.

==Life and legends==

Onuphrius was one of the Desert Fathers who made a great impression on Eastern spirituality in the third and fourth centuries, around the time that Christianity was emerging as the dominant faith of the Roman Empire. At this time many Christians were inspired to go out into the desert and live in prayer in the harsh environment of extreme heat and cold, with little to eat and drink, surrounded by all sorts of dangerous animals and robbers.

It is uncertain in which century Onuphrius lived; the account of Paphnutius the Ascetic, who encountered him in the Egyptian desert, forms the sole source for our knowledge of the life of Saint Onuphrius. Even the authorship is uncertain; &quot;Paphnutius&quot;, a common name of Egyptian origin in the Upper Thebaid, may refer to Paphnutius of Scetis, a 4th-century abbot of Lower Egypt, rather than Paphnutius the Ascetic. &quot;But Paphnutius the Great [i.e. Paphnutius the Ascetic],&quot; Alban Butler writes, &quot;also had a number of stories to tell of visions and miraculous happenings in the desert, some of them in much the same vein as the story of Onuphrius.&quot;

The name Onuphrius is thought to be a Hellenized form of a Coptic name &quot;Unnufer&quot;, ultimately from the Egyptian &quot;wnn-nfr&quot; meaning &quot;perfect one&quot;, or &quot;he who is continually good&quot;, an epithet of the god Osiris.

A tradition, not found in Paphnutius&#x27; account, states that Onuphrius had studied jurisprudence and philosophy before becoming a monk near Thebes and then a hermit.

According to Paphnutius&#x27;s account, Paphnutius undertook a pilgrimage to study the hermits&#x27; way of life and to determine whether it was for him. Wandering in the desert for 16 days, on the 17th day Paphnutius came across a wild figure covered in hair, wearing a loincloth of leaves. Frightened, Paphnutius ran away, up a mountain, but the figure called him back, shouting, &quot;Come down to me, man of God, for I am a man also, dwelling in the desert for the love of God.&quot;

Turning back, Paphnutius talked to the wild figure, who introduced himself as Onuphrius and explained that he had once been a monk at a large monastery in the Thebaid but who had now lived as a hermit for 70 years, enduring extreme thirst, hunger, and discomforts. He said that it was his guardian angel who had brought him to this desolate place. Onuphrius took Paphnutius to his cell, and they spoke until sunset, when bread and water miraculously appeared outside of the hermit&#x27;s cell.

They spent the night in the prayer, and in the morning Paphnutius discovered that Onuphrius was near death. Paphnutius, distressed, asked the hermit if he should occupy Onuphrius&#x27; cell after the hermit&#x27;s death, but Onuphrius told him, &quot;That may not be, thy work is in Egypt with thy brethren.&quot; Onuphrius asked Paphnutius for there to be a memorial with incense in Egypt in remembrance of the hermit. He then blessed the traveler and died.

Due to the hard and rocky ground, Paphnutius could not dig a hole for a grave, and therefore covered Onuphrius&#x27; body in a cloak, leaving the hermit&#x27;s body in a cleft of the rocks. After the burial, Onuphrius&#x27; cell crumbled, which Paphnutius took to be a sign that he should not stay.

One scholar has written that Onuphrius&#x27; life &quot;fits the mold of countless desert hermits or anchorites. ...[However] despite its predictability, Paphnutius&#x27; &quot;Life of Onuphrius&quot; is marked by several unique details. ...The years of Onuphrius&#x27; youth were passed in a monastery that observed the rule of strict silence; a hind instructed him in Christian rites and liturgy. During his sixty years in the desert, Onuphrius&#x27; only visitor was an angel who delivered a Host every Sunday.&quot;

==Veneration==
Both the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches traditionally mark his feast day on 12 June. A &quot;Life&quot; of Onuphrius of later Greek origin states that the saint died on June 11; however, his feast day was celebrated on June 12 in the Eastern Orthodox calendars from an early date.

The legend of Saint Onuphrius was depicted in Pisa&#x27;s camposanto (monumental cemetery), and in Rome the church Sant&#x27;Onofrio was built in his honor on the Janiculan Hill in the fifteenth century.

Antony, the archbishop of Novgorod, writing around 1200 AD, stated that Onuphrius&#x27; head was conserved in the church of Saint Acindinus (Akindinos), Constantinople.

For several decades Orthodox seminarians in Poland have begun their spiritual training in the monastery of St. Onuphrius in Jablechna. It is said that the saint himself chose the place for it, appearing nearly four hundred years ago to fishermen and leaving them an icon of himself on the banks of the river Bug.

The St. Onuphrius Monastery in Jerusalem is located at the far end of Gai Ben Hinnom, the Gehenna valley of hell, situated within the site of a Jewish cemetery from the Second Temple period. The structure is built among and includes many typical burial niches common to that period. The monastery also marks the location of Hakeldama, the purported place where Judas Iscariot hanged himself.

Saint Onuphrius was venerated in Munich, Basel, and southern Germany, and the Basel humanist Sebastian Brant (who named his own son Onuphrius) published a broadside named &quot;In Praise of the Divine Onuphrius and Other Desert Hermit Saints&quot;. Onuphrius was depicted in a 1520 painting by Hans Schäufelein.

===Art===
Images of Saint Onuphrius were conflated with those of the medieval &quot;wild man&quot;. In art, he is depicted as a wild man completely covered with hair, wearing a girdle of leaves.

He is depicted at Snake Church (&quot;Yilanlı Kilise&quot;) in the Göreme valley open-air museum in Cappadocia, Turkey.

He became the patron saint of weavers due to the fact that he was depicted &quot;dressed only in his own abundant hair, and a loin-cloth of leaves&quot;.

He (S. Onofrio) was named co-patron of the city of Palermo in 1650.
===Name variants===
His name appears very variously as Onuphrius, Onouphrius, Onofrius and in different languages as Onofre (Portuguese, Spanish), Onofrei (Romanian), Onofrio (Italian), etc. In Arabic, the saint was known as &quot;Abū Nufir&quot; () or as &quot;Nofer&quot; (), which, besides being a variant of the name Onuphrius, also means &quot;herbivore&quot;. Onuphrius and Onofrio are sometimes Anglicized as , an unrelated name that is usually given a Germanic etymology.

===Folklore===
Sicilians pray to Saint Onuphrius when they have lost something. The prayer has many variants but it generally mentions the miraculous properties of Saint Onuphrius&#x27; hair. It is widely accepted that repeating the prayer whilst looking for something like keys, a misplaced ring, or anything else, will greatly help in finding it sooner.

St Onophrius&#x27; remains (Reliquary) are held in a sanctuary at Sutera (Sicily) where a feast is held in his honor every 1st Sunday of August and the saint&#x27;s remains are carried around the town with a priest, marching band and pilgrims.

<doc id="585661" wikidata="Q71453" url="?curid=585661" title="Albert von Le Coq">
<text>Albert von Le Coq (; 8 September 1860 in Berlin, Prussia – 21 April 1930 in Berlin, Weimar Republic) was a Prussian/German brewery owner and wine merchant, who at the age of 40 began to study archaeology.

==Background==
He was born at Berlin, of a family of French Huguenot origin, as evidenced in his family name.&lt;br&gt;
Von Le Coq was heir to a sizable fortune derived from breweries and wineries scattered throughout Central and Eastern Europe, thus allowing him the luxury of travel and study at his leisure. The business he owned survives today as the A. Le Coq brewery in Tartu, Estonia.

==Career as archaeologist==
Aided by his wealth, von Le Coq became a famous archaeologist and explorer of Central Asia.

Von Le Coq was convinced that the influence of Ancient Greece could be found as far in the east as China. However, organising expeditions to Central Asia and China was beyond his means. The German archaeologist Hermann Parzinger has found a letter in the Prussian State Archive which reveals that the financial backing to von Le Coq&#x27;s expedition came from no one else than the last German emperor Wilhelm II. Wilhelm was obsessed with Greek culture and supported one of the expeditions with 32,000 German gold marks.

Von Le Coq was associated with the &quot;Museum für Völkerkunde&quot; (now called the Ethnological Museum of Berlin) in Berlin. Serving as assistant to the head of the museum, Professor Albert Grünwedel, Le Coq helped plan and organize expeditions into the regions of western Asia, specifically areas near the Silk Road such as Gaochang. When Grünwedel fell ill before the departure of the second expedition, Le Coq was assigned to lead it. His account of the second and third German Turpan expeditions was published in English in 1928 as &quot;Buried Treasures of Chinese Turkestan&quot;.

The expeditions found extensive networks of Buddhist and Manichaean cave temples in the Xinjiang region of Northwest China. Although many of the manuscripts found in the cave were destroyed during the excavation, von Le Coq speculated that he had discovered a major Manichaean library. Some of the paintings also led him to believe that he had found evidence of an Aryan culture, related to the Franks.

Le Coq said that the depictions of figures with apparently blue eyes, red hair and cruciform swords resembled Frankish art: &quot;Such more striking are representations of red-haired, blue-eyed men with faces of a pronounced European type. We connect these people with the Aryan language found in these parts in so many manuscripts.. These red haired people wear suspenders from their belts.. a remarkable ethnological peculiarity!&quot;

With the help of Theodor Bartus and his other assistants, Le Coq carved and sawed away over 360 kilograms (or 305 cases) of artifacts, wall-carvings, and precious icons, which were subsequently shipped to the museum. In &quot;Buried Treasures ...&quot;, Le Coq defends these &quot;borrowings&quot; as a matter of necessity, citing the turbulent nature of Chinese Turkestan at the time of the expeditions. Chinese consider this seizure a &quot;colonial rapacity&quot; comparable to the taking of the Elgin Marbles or the Koh-i-Noor diamond. The collections from the German expeditions were initially kept at the Indian Department of the Ethnological Museum of Berlin (&quot;Ethnologisches Museum Berlin&quot;). The artifacts were put on display at the museum and were open to the public until 1944 when the relics were destroyed in British bombing raids during World War II. The Ethnological Museum was bombed seven times in Allied bombing raids, destroying the larger wall murals which had been cemented into place and could not be moved; 28 of the finest paintings were totally destroyed. Smaller pieces were hidden in bunkers and coal mines at the outbreak of war and survived the bombings. When the Russians arrived in 1945 they looted at least 10 crates of treasures that they discovered in a bunker under the Berlin Zoo which have not been seen since. The remaining items have been collected together and are housed in a new museum in Dahlem, a suburb of Berlin, the Museum of Indian Art (&quot;Museum für Indische Kunst&quot;) from 1963 and finally combined into a single location at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (&quot;Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot;, BBAW), since 1992.

Most of the manuscripts collection survived stored in salt mines. After the war the major part of the collection was given in 1946 to the newly founded Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften. A smaller portion found its way to the Mainzer Akademie der Wissenschaften und Literatur.

<text>Count Ōtani Kōzui (大谷 光瑞, 27 December 1876 – 5 October 1948) was a Japanese Buddhist leader and explorer who was the 22nd Abbot of Nishi Hongan-ji and the head of the Honganji-ha sect of Buddhism. He is known for expeditions to Buddhist sites in Central Asia, such as Subashi. His Buddhist name was Kyōnyo (鏡如).

==Career==
Between 1902 and 1910, he financed three expeditions to Central Asia although his participation was stopped for his succession (see below). Ōtani was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and played host to several of his fellow Central Asian explorers, such as Sven Hedin and Albert von Le Coq. His collection, often called &quot;Ōtani collection&quot; is still considered important in Central Asian studies, although it is today scattered in Tokyo, Kyoto, China and Korea. In addition to his spiritual responsibilities and his Central Asian activities, Ōtani wrote about China, Manchuria and Chinese porcelain. While playing the Great Game, British and Russian intelligence both suspected that his archaeological expeditions were little more than covers for espionage activities. Japan says they were solely investigations of the route along which Buddhism came to Japan, and had no political connections.

After his father Myonyo&#x27;s death, he succeeded as Abbot of the Nishi Honganji in 1903. While he continued to sponsor the expeditions, he devoted himself to the modernization of the Jōdo Shinshū sect. His sponsorship, however, brought huge amounts of debt to his sect. A financial scandal forced him to abdicate in 1914. His nephew Shonyo became 23rd Abbot.

<text>George Darko (12 January 1951 – 20 March 2024) was a Ghanaian burger-highlife musician, guitarist, vocalist, composer and songwriter, who was on the music scene from the late 1960s. A native of Akropong, Ghana, Darko was popular in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and his songs are some of the most timeless and enduring highlife tracks in Ghana&#x27;s music circles. Some of his contemporaries include Ben Brako, C.K. Mann, Daddy Lumba, Ernest Nana Acheampong, Nana Kwame Ampadu and Pat Thomas, among others. He was widely considered to be one of the pioneers of burger-highlife with his first hit &quot;Ako Te Brofo&quot; (&quot;The Parrots Speak/Understand English&quot;) which was released in 1983. The song remains popular among Ghanaians both at home and abroad, and is still played at funerals and parties.

Son of a paramount chief, George Darko was educated at the Presbyterian School at Akropong. After playing for an army band entertaining troops in the Middle East, Darko returned to Ghana and formed the Golden Stool Band. In the late 1970s the band moved to Germany, where Darko went solo and formed the Bus Stop band in 1982. Returning to Akropong in 1988, he was made Tufuhene of Akropong-Akuapim in 1991 with the stool (throne) name of Nana Yaw Ampem Darko. In January 2010, he demanded and received apologies from a newspaper which had reported sex allegations in connection with him. He was the biological Father of the German Rapper and Singer Manuellsen.

== Death ==
George Darko died on 20 March 2024, at the age of 73. He had been in palliative care at Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital in Akuapim-Mampong for three months before his death.

<doc id="585681" wikidata="Q557185" url="?curid=585681" title="B. K. S. Iyengar">
<text>Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja Iyengar (14 December 1918 – 20 August 2014) was an Indian teacher of yoga and author. He is the founder of the style of yoga as exercise, known as &quot;Iyengar Yoga&quot;, and was considered one of the foremost yoga gurus in the world. He was the author of many books on yoga practice and philosophy including &quot;Light on Yoga&quot;, &quot;Light on Pranayama&quot;, &quot;Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot;, and &quot;Light on Life&quot;. Iyengar was one of the earliest students of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, who is often referred to as &quot;the father of modern yoga&quot;. He has been credited with popularizing yoga, first in India and then around the world.

The Indian government awarded Iyengar the Padma Shri in 1991, the Padma Bhushan in 2002, and the Padma Vibhushan in 2014. In 2004, Iyengar was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Early years==

B.K.S. Iyengar was born into a poor Sri Vaishnava Iyengar family in Bellur, Kolar district, Karnataka, India. He was the 11th of 13 children (10 of whom survived) born to Sri Krishnamachar, a school teacher, and Sheshamma. When Iyengar was five years old, his family moved to Bangalore. Four years later, the 9-year-old boy lost his father to appendicitis.

Iyengar&#x27;s home town, Bellur, was in the grip of the influenza pandemic at the time of his birth, and an attack of that disease left the young boy sickly and weak for many years. Throughout his childhood, he struggled with malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and general malnutrition. &quot;My arms were thin, my legs were spindly, and my stomach protruded in an ungainly manner&quot; he wrote. &quot;My head used to hang down, and I had to lift it with great effort.&quot;

==Education in yoga==
In 1934, B. K. S. Iyengar&#x27;s brother-in-law, the yogi Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, asked him to come to Mysore, so as to improve his health through the practice of yoga asanas. Krishnamacharya had Iyengar and other students give asana demonstrations in the Maharaja&#x27;s court at Mysore, which had a positive influence on Iyengar. Iyengar considers his association with his brother-in-law a turning point in his life saying that over a two-year period &quot;he (Krishnamacharya) only taught me for about ten or fifteen days, but those few days determined what I have become today!&quot; K. Pattabhi Jois has claimed that he, and not Krishnamacharya, was Iyengar&#x27;s guru. In 1937, Krishnamacharya sent Iyengar to Pune at the age of eighteen to spread the teaching of yoga.

Though Iyengar had very high regard for Krishnamacharya, and occasionally turned to him for advice, he had a troubled relationship with his guru during his tutelage. In the beginning, Krishnamacharya predicted that the stiff, sickly teenager would not be successful at yoga. He was neglected and tasked with household chores. Only when Krishnamacharya&#x27;s favorite pupil at the time, Keshavamurthy, left one day did serious training start. Krishnamacharya began teaching a series of difficult postures, sometimes telling him to not eat until he mastered a certain posture. These experiences would later inform the way he taught his students.

Iyengar reported in interviews that, at age 90, he continued to practice asanas for three hours and pranayamas for an hour daily. Besides this, he mentioned that he found himself performing non-deliberate pranayamas at other times.

==International recognition==
In 1952, Iyengar befriended the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. Menuhin gave him the opportunity that transformed Iyengar from a comparatively obscure Indian yoga teacher into an international guru. Because Iyengar had taught the famous philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, he was asked to go to Bombay to meet Menuhin, who was known to be interested in yoga. Menuhin said he was very tired and could spare only five minutes. Iyengar told him to lie down in Savasana (on his back), and he fell asleep. After one hour, Menuhin awoke refreshed and spent another two hours with Iyengar. Menuhin came to believe that practising yoga improved his playing, and in 1954 invited Iyengar to Switzerland. At the end of that visit, he presented his yoga teacher with a watch on the back of which was inscribed, &quot;To my best violin teacher, BKS Iyengar&quot;. From then on Iyengar visited the west regularly. In Switzerland he also taught Vanda Scaravelli, who went on to develop her own style of yoga.

He taught yoga to several celebrities including Krishnamurti and Jayaprakash Narayan. He taught sirsasana (head stand) to Elisabeth, Queen of Belgium when she was 80.
Among his other devotees were the novelist Aldous Huxley, the actress Annette Bening, the film maker Mira Nair and the designer Donna Karan, as well as prominent Indian figures, including the cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and the Bollywood actress Kareena Kapoor.

Iyengar made his first visit to the United States in 1956, when he taught in Ann Arbor, Michigan and gave several lecture-demonstrations; he came back to Ann Arbor in 1973, 1974, and 1976.

In 1966, Iyengar published his first book, &quot;Light on Yoga&quot;. It became an international best-seller. , it had been translated into 17 languages and sold three million copies. It was followed by 13 other books, covering pranayama and aspects of yoga philosophy.

In 1967, the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) called for classes in &quot;Hatha Yoga&quot;, free of yoga philosophy, but including asanas and &quot;pranayamas (sic)&quot; suitable especially for people aged over 40. The ILEA&#x27;s Peter McIntosh watched some of Iyengar&#x27;s classes, was impressed by &quot;Light on Yoga&quot;, and from 1970 ILEA-approved yoga teacher training in London was run by one of Iyengar&#x27;s pupils, Silva Mehta. Iyengar was careful to comply with the proscription of yoga philosophy, and encouraged students to follow their own religious traditions, rather than trying to follow his own family&#x27;s Visistadvaita, a qualified non-dualism within Hinduism.

In 1975, Iyengar opened the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute in Pune, in memory of his late wife. He officially retired from teaching in 1984, but continued to be active in the world of Iyengar Yoga, teaching special classes, giving lectures, and writing books. Iyengar&#x27;s daughter, Geeta, and son, Prashant, have gained international acclaim as teachers.

Iyengar attracted his students by offering them just what they sought – which tended to be physical stamina and flexibility. He conducted demonstrations and later, when a scooter accident dislocated his spine, began exploring the use of props to help disabled people practice Yoga. He drew inspiration from Hindu deities such as Yoga Narasimha and stories of yogis using trees to support their asanas. He was however thought by his students to be somewhat rough with his adjustments when setting people into alignment; the historian of yoga Elliott Goldberg records that, as well as being known for barking orders and yelling at students, he was nicknamed, based on his initials B. K. S., &quot;Bang, Kick, Slap&quot;. In Goldberg&#x27;s view, Iyengar &quot;rationalized his humiliation of his followers as a necessary consequence of his demand for high standards&quot;, but this was consistent with his childhood response to the rough and abusive treatment he received from Krishnamacharya, taking offence quickly, being suspicious of other people&#x27;s intentions, and belittling others: &quot;In other words, he sometimes behaved like Krishnamacharya&quot;. Goldberg concludes, however, that Iyengar hid &quot;a compassion of which Krishnamacharya was never capable&quot;, and his students remembered his playfulness as well as his unpredictable temper.

==Philanthropy and activism==

Iyengar supported nature conservation, stating that it is important to conserve all animals and birds. He donated Rs. 2 million to Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, Mysore, thought to be the largest donation by an individual to any zoo in India. He also adopted a tiger and a cub in memory of his wife, who died in 1973.

Iyengar helped promote awareness of multiple sclerosis with the Pune unit of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of India.

Iyengar&#x27;s most important charitable project involved donations to his ancestral village of Bellur, in the Kolar district of Karnataka. Through the Bellur Trust fund which he established, he led a transformation of the village, supporting a number of charitable activities there. He built a hospital, India&#x27;s first temple dedicated to Patanjali, a free school that supplies uniforms, books, and a hot lunch to the children of Bellur and the surrounding villages, a secondary school, and a college.

==Family==

In 1943, Iyengar married 16-year-old Ramamani in a marriage that was arranged by their parents. He said of their marriage: &quot;We lived without conflict as if our two souls were one.&quot; Together, they raised five daughters and a son. Ramamani died in 1973 aged 46; Iyengar named his yoga institute in Pune, the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute, after her.

Both Iyengar&#x27;s eldest daughter Geeta (1944–2018) and his son Prashant have become internationally known teachers in their own right. His other children are Vanita, Sunita, Suchita, and Savita. Geeta, having worked extensively on yoga for women, published &quot;Yoga: A Gem for Women&quot; (2002); Prashant is the author of several books, including &quot;A Class after a Class: Yoga, an Integrated Science (1998)&quot;, and &quot;Yoga and the New Millennium&quot; (2008). Since Geeta&#x27;s death, Prashant has served as the director of the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute (RIMYI) in Pune. Iyengar&#x27;s granddaughter, Abhijata Sridhar Iyengar, trained for a number of years under his tutelage, and is now a teacher both at the Institute in Pune and internationally.

Iyengar died on 20 August 2014 in Pune, aged 95.

==Legacy==

3 October 2005 was declared as &quot;B.K.S. Iyengar Day&quot; by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Anthropologist Joseph S. Alter of the University of Pittsburgh stated that Iyengar &quot;has by far had the most profound impact on the global spread of yoga.&quot; In June 2011, he was presented with a commemorative stamp issued in his honour by the Beijing branch of China Post. At that time there were over thirty thousand Iyengar yoga students in 57 cities in China.

The noun &quot;Iyengar&quot;, short for &quot;Iyengar Yoga&quot;, is defined by Oxford Dictionaries as &quot;a type of Hatha yoga focusing on the correct alignment of the body, making use of straps, wooden blocks, and other objects as aids in achieving the correct postures.&quot;

On 14 December 2015, what would have been Iyengar&#x27;s 97th birthday, he was honoured with a Google Doodle. It was shown in India, North America, much of Europe, Russia, and Indonesia. &quot;Yogacharya B.K.S. Iyengar: Uniting Through Yoga&quot;, a documentary film by Vishaal Desai, was released on his birth centenary in 2018. &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; (2008), another documentary film by Aditi Makim and Valentina Trivedi, covered his life from childhood to adulthood and the hurdles he faced in his career.

Currently, thousands of yoga instructors are CIYTs (Certified Iyengar Yoga Teachers), accounting for over 1100 in just the United States.

<text>Scops owls are typical owls in family Strigidae belonging to the genus Otus and are restricted to the Old World. &quot;Otus&quot; is the largest genus of owls with 59 species. Scops owls are colored in various brownish hues, sometimes with a lighter underside and/or face, which helps to camouflage them against the bark of trees. Some are polymorphic, occurring in a greyish- and a reddish-brown morph. They are small and agile, with both sexes being compact in size and shape. Female scops owls are usually larger than males.

For most of the 20th century, this genus included the American screech owls, which are now again separated in &quot;Megascops&quot; based on a range of behavioral, biogeographical, morphological and DNA sequence data.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Otus&quot; was introduced in 1769 by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant for the Indian scops owl (&quot;O. bakkamoena&quot;). The name is derived from the Latin word &quot;&quot; and the Greek word &quot;ōtos&quot; meaning horned or eared owl (cf. , ὠτός, &quot;ear&quot;). The generic name &quot;Scops&quot; that was proposed by Marie Jules César Savigny in 1809 is a junior synonym and is derived from the Greek (&quot;skōps&quot;) meaning small kind of owl, &quot;Otus scops&quot;.

By the mid-19th century, it was becoming clear that &quot;Otus&quot; encompassed more than one genus. First, in 1848, the screech owls were split off as &quot;Megascops&quot;. The white-faced owls of Africa, with their huge eyes and striking facial coloration, were separated in &quot;Ptilopsis&quot; in 1851. In 1854, the highly apomorphic white-throated screech owl of the Andes was placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Macabra&quot;. &quot;Gymnasio&quot; was established in the same year for the Puerto Rican owl, and the bare-legged owl (or &quot;Cuban screech owl&quot;) was separated in &quot;Gymnoglaux&quot; the following year; the latter genus was sometimes merged with &quot;Gymnasio&quot; by subsequent authors. The Palau scops owl, described only in 1872 and little-known to this day, was eventually separated in &quot;Pyrroglaux&quot; by Yoshimaro Yamashina in 1938.

In the early 20th century, the lumping-together of taxa had come to be preferred. The 3rd edition of the AOU checklist in 1910 placed the screech owls back in &quot;Otus&quot;. Although this move was never unequivocally accepted, it was the dominant treatment throughout most of the 20th century. In 1988 it was attempted to resolve this by re-establishing all those genera split some 140 years earlier at subgenus rank inside &quot;Otus&quot;. Still, the diversity and distinctness of the group failed to come together in a good evolutionary and phylogenetic picture, and it was not until the availability of DNA sequence data that this could be resolved. In 1999, a preliminary study of mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; across a wide range of owls found that even the treatment as subgenera was probably unsustainable and suggested that most of the genera proposed around 1850 should be accepted. Though there was some debate about the reliability of these findings at first, they have been confirmed by subsequent studies. In 2003, the AOU formally re-accepted the genus &quot;Megascops&quot; again.

An apparent &quot;Otus&quot; owl was heard calling at about 1,000 meters ASL south of the summit of Camiguin in the Philippines on May 14, 1994. No scops owls had previously known from this island, and given that new species of &quot;Otus&quot; are occasionally discovered, it may have been an undescribed taxon.

In July 2016, an unknown &quot;Otus&quot; species was photographed on Príncipe. The image was published on Ornithomedia. Dubbed &quot;Otus bikegila&quot;, it was formally described in 2022.

===Formerly placed here===

As noted above, the fossil record of scops owls gives an incomplete picture of their evolution at present. While older sources cite many species of supposed extinct &quot;Otus&quot; (or &quot;Scops&quot;), these are now placed in entirely different genera:
* &quot;&quot;Otus&quot; henrici&quot; was a barn owl of the genus &quot;Selenornis&quot;
* &quot;&quot;Otus&quot; providentiae&quot; was a burrowing owl, probably a paleosubspecies
* &quot;&quot;Otus&quot; wintershofensis&quot; may be close to extant genus &quot;Ninox&quot; and some material assigned to it belongs into &quot;Intutula&quot;
* &quot;&quot;Scops&quot; commersoni&quot; is a junior synonym of the recently extinct Mauritius owl, referring to pictures and descriptions which mention ear tufts; the subfossil material of this species had been erroneously assigned to tuftless owls.

==Evolution==
The evolutionary relationships of the scops and screech owls are not entirely clear. What is certain is that they are very closely related; they may be considered sister lineages which fill essentially the same ecological niche in their allopatric ranges. A screech-owl fossil from the Late Pliocene of Kansas – which is almost identical to eastern and western screech owls – indicate a long-standing presence of these birds in the Americas, while scops owl fossils very similar to the Eurasian scops-owl have been found at S&#x27;Onix on the Spanish island Majorca. The scops and screech owl lineage probably evolved at some time during the Miocene (like most other genera of typical owls), and the three (see below) modern lineages separated perhaps roughly 5 million years ago. Note that there is no reliable estimate of divergence time, as &quot;Otus&quot; and &quot;Megascops&quot; are osteologically very similar, as is to be expected from a group that has apparently conserved its ecomorphology since before its evolutionary radiation. As almost all scops and screech owls today, their common ancestor was in all probability already a small owl, with ear tufts and at least the upper tarsus (&quot;leg&quot;) feathered.

However that may be, the hypothesis that the group evolved from Old World stock is tentatively supported by cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data.

==Ecology and behaviour==


While late 19th-century ornithologists knew little of the variation of these cryptic birds which often live in far-off places, with every new taxon being described a few differences between the Old and New World &quot;scops&quot; owls became more and more prominent. Namely, the scops owls give a whistling call or a row of high-pitched hoots with less than four individual hoots per second. This call is given in social interaction or when the owl tries to scare away other animals. The screech owls on the other hand are named for their piercing trills of more than four individual notes per second. They also have a kind of song, which is a short sequence of varying calls given by the males when they try to attract females to their nests, or between members of a pair. There are a few other differences such as the screech owls almost never being brown below which is common in scops owls, but the difference in vocalizations is most striking.

Scops owls hunt from perches in semi-open landscapes. They prefer areas which contain old trees with hollows; these are home to their prey which includes insects, reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice and other small birds. The owls will also eat earthworms, amphibians and aquatic invertebrates. Scops owls have a good sense of hearing which helps them locate their prey in any habitat. They also possess well-developed raptorial claws and a curved bill, both of which are used for tearing their prey into pieces small enough to swallow easily.

Scops owls are primarily solitary birds. Most species lay and incubate their eggs in a cavity nest that was originally made by another animal. During the incubation period, the male will feed the female. These birds are monogamous, with biparental care, and only fledge one young per year. The young of most scops owls are altricial to semialtricial.

As opposed to screech owls, scops owls have only a single type of call. This consists of a series of whistles or high-pitched hoots, given with a frequency of 4 calls per second or less, or of a single, drawn-out whistle. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and in the field are often the first indication of these birds&#x27; presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. Some, like the recently described Serendib scops owl (&quot;Otus thilohoffmanni&quot;), were discovered because their vocalizations were unfamiliar to experts in birdcalls.

<doc id="585695" wikidata="Q1558324" url="?curid=585695" title="Scanner Access Now Easy">
<text>Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE) is an open-source application programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, handheld scanner, video- and still-cameras, frame grabbers, etc.). The SANE API is public domain. It is commonly used on Linux.

==Architecture==
SANE differs from TWAIN in that it is cleanly separated into &quot;front ends&quot; (user programs) and &quot;back ends&quot; (scanner drivers). Whereas a TWAIN driver handles the user interface as well as communications with the scanner hardware, a SANE driver only provides an interface with the hardware and describes a number of &quot;options&quot; which drive each scan. These &quot;options&quot; specify parameters such as the resolution of the scan, the scan area, colour model, etc. Each &quot;option&quot; has a name, and information about its type, units, and range or possible values (e.g., enumerated list). By convention there are several &quot;well known&quot; &quot;options&quot; that front ends can supply using convenient GUI interaction e.g., the scan area &quot;options&quot; can be set by dragging a rectangular outline over a preview image. Other options can be presented using GUI elements appropriate to their type e.g., sliders, drop-down lists, etc.

One consequence of this separation is that network scanning is easily implemented with no special handling in either the front ends or back ends. On a host with a scanner, the saned daemon runs and handles network requests. On client machines a &quot;net&quot; back end (driver) connects to the remote host to fetch the scanner options, and perform previews and scans. The saned daemon acts as a front end locally, but simply passes requests and data between the network connections and the local scanner. Similarly, the &quot;net&quot; back end passes requests and data between the local front end and the remote host.

Various types of unsupervised batch scanning are also possible with a minimum of support needed in the back end (driver). Many scanners support the attachment of document feeders which allow a large number of sheets of paper to be automatically scanned in succession. Using the SANE API, the front end simply has to &quot;play back&quot; the same set of options for each scan, driving the document feed in between scans to load the next sheet of paper. The front end only has to obtain the set of options from the user once.

==Graphical user interfaces==
Several user interfaces have been written to combine SANE with an easy user method of controlling it.

===gscan2pdf===
gscan2pdf is an interface for scanning documents to PDF on the GNOME desktop that uses SANE to communicate with the scanner. It is available under the GPL. It includes common editing tools, e.g., for rotating or cropping pages. It is also able to perform OCR using several optional OCR tools and save a searchable PDF. PDF files can be further downsampled upon saving.

===Simple Scan===

Simple Scan is a simplified GUI using SANE that is intended to be easier to use and better integrate into the GNOME desktop than XSane. It was initially written for Ubuntu and is maintained by Robert Ancell of Canonical Ltd. for Linux. Simple Scan was first fielded as part of Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx and is also used in Lubuntu (until Lubuntu 18.04 LTS) and Xubuntu. It is now part of the GNOME project.

===Skanlite===

Skanlite is a simple image scanning application, based on the KSane backend. Kåre Särs is the lead developer. In KDE 4 Skanlite replaced Kooka of KDE 3 as default KDE scanning application.

Skanlite is based on libksane, an interface provided by KDE for SANE libraries to control flatbed scanners. It also works with networked scanners.

===SwingSane===
SwingSane is a cross-platform, Java front end for SANE, written and maintained by Roland Quast. It is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. The source code for the project can also be adapted for use with an existing Swing application.

===XSane===
XSane is a graphical front end for SANE written by Oliver Rauch. It is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, UNIX, and OS/2 and is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The Windows version only allows a Windows computer to access a scanner that is attached to a Unix, OS/2 or Mac OS X network computer, but not generally to the local Windows computer. Only the &quot;complete&quot; sane-back-ends versions will possibly work with some scanner models connected locally.

<doc id="585704" wikidata="Q550452" url="?curid=585704" title="Nuclear arms race">
<text>The nuclear arms race was an arms race competition for supremacy in nuclear warfare between the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies during the Cold War. During this same period, in addition to the American and Soviet nuclear stockpiles, other countries developed nuclear weapons, though no other country engaged in warhead production on nearly the same scale as the two superpowers.

==World War II==
The first nuclear weapon was created by the United States of America during the Second World War and was developed to be used against the Axis powers. Scientists of the Soviet Union were aware of the potential of nuclear weapons and had also been conducting research in the field.

The Soviet Union was not informed officially of the Manhattan Project until Stalin was briefed at the Potsdam Conference on July 24, 1945, by U.S. President Harry S. Truman, eight days after the first successful test of a nuclear weapon. Despite their wartime military alliance, the United States and Britain had not trusted the Soviets enough to keep knowledge of the Manhattan Project safe from German spies; there were also concerns that, as an ally, the Soviet Union would request and expect to receive technical details of the new weapon.

When President Truman informed Stalin of the weapons, he was surprised at how calmly Stalin reacted to the news and thought that Stalin had not understood what he had been told. Other members of the United States and British delegations who closely observed the exchange formed the same conclusion.

In fact, Stalin had long been aware of the program, despite the Manhattan Project&#x27;s having a secret classification so high that, even as vice president, Truman did not know about it or the development of the weapons (Truman was not informed until shortly after he became president). A ring of spies operating within the Manhattan Project, (including Klaus Fuchs and Theodore Hall) had kept Stalin well informed of American progress. They provided the Soviets with detailed designs of the implosion bomb and the hydrogen bomb. Fuchs&#x27; arrest in 1950 led to the arrests of many other suspected Russian spies, including Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg; the latter two were tried and executed for espionage in 1951.

In August 1945, on Truman&#x27;s orders, two atomic bombs were dropped on Japanese cities. The first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and the second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki by the B-29 bombers named &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bockscar&quot; respectively.

Shortly after the end of the Second World War in 1945, the United Nations was founded. During the United Nation&#x27;s first General Assembly in London in January 1946, they discussed the future of nuclear weapons and created the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. The goal of this assembly was to eliminate the use of all Nuclear weapons. The United States presented their solution, which was called the Baruch Plan. This plan proposed that there should be an international authority that controls all dangerous atomic activities. The Soviet Union disagreed with this proposal and rejected it. The Soviets&#x27; proposal involved universal nuclear disarmament. Both the American and Soviet proposals were refused by the UN.

==Early Cold War==
===Warhead development===
In the years immediately after the Second World War, the United States had a monopoly on specific knowledge of and raw materials for nuclear weaponry. American leaders hoped that their exclusive ownership of nuclear weapons would be enough to draw from the Soviet Union, but this proved ineffective.

Just six months after the UN General Assembly, the United States conducted its first post-war nuclear tests — Operation Crossroads. The purpose of this operation was to test the effect of nuclear explosions on ships. These tests were performed at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific on 95 ships, including German and Japanese ships that were captured during World War II. One plutonium implosion-type bomb was detonated over the fleet, while the other one was detonated underwater.

In secrecy, the Soviet government was working on building its own atomic weapons. During the war, Soviet efforts had been limited by a lack of uranium, but new supplies discovered in Eastern Europe provided a steady supply while the Soviets developed a domestic source. While American experts had predicted that the Soviet Union would not have nuclear weapons until the mid-1950s, the first Soviet bomb was detonated on August 29, 1949. The bomb, named &quot;First Lightning&quot; by the West, was more or less a copy of &quot;Fat Man&quot;, one of the bombs the United States had dropped on Japan in 1945.

Both governments spent massive amounts to increase the quality and quantity of their nuclear arsenals. Both nations quickly began the development of thermonuclear weapons, which can achieve vastly greater explosive yields. The United States detonated the first hydrogen bomb on November 1, 1952, on Enewetak, an atoll in the Pacific Ocean. Code-named &quot;Ivy Mike&quot;, the project was led by Edward Teller, a Hungarian-American nuclear physicist. It created a cloud wide and high, killing all life on the surrounding islands. Again, the Soviets surprised the world by exploding a deployable thermonuclear device in August 1953, although it was not a true multi-stage hydrogen bomb. However, it was small enough to be dropped from an airplane, making it ready for use. The development of these two Soviet bombs was greatly aided by the Russian spies Harry Gold and Klaus Fuchs.

On March 1, 1954, the U.S. conducted the Castle Bravo test, which tested another hydrogen bomb on Bikini Atoll. Scientists significantly underestimated the size of the bomb, thinking it would yield 5 megatons. However, it yielded 14.8 megatons, the highest yield ever achieved by an American nuclear device. The explosion was so large the nuclear fallout exposed residents up to away to significant amounts of radiation. They were eventually evacuated, but most experienced radiation poisoning; one person was killed, a crew member on a Japanese fishing boat which was from the bomb test site when the explosion occurred.

The Soviet Union detonated its first &quot;true&quot; hydrogen bomb on November 22, 1955, which had a yield of 1.6 megatons. On October 30, 1961, the Soviets detonated a hydrogen bomb with a yield of approximately 58 megatons.

With both sides in the Cold War having nuclear capability, an arms race developed, with the Soviet Union attempting first to catch up and then to surpass the Americans.

===Delivery vehicles===

Strategic bombers were the primary delivery method at the beginning of the Cold War.

Missiles had long been regarded the ideal platform for nuclear weapons and were potentially a more effective delivery system than bombers. Starting in the 1950s, medium-range ballistic missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (&quot;IRBM&quot;s) were developed for delivery of tactical nuclear weapons, and the technology developed to the progressively longer ranges, eventually becoming intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into an orbit around the Earth, demonstrating that Soviet ICBMs were capable of reaching any point on the planet. The United States launched its first satellite, Explorer 1, on January 31, 1958.

Meanwhile, submarine-launched ballistic missiles were also developed. By the mid-1960s, the &quot;triad&quot; of nuclear weapon delivery was established, with each side deploying bombers, ICBMs, and SLBMs, in order to ensure that even if a defense was found against one delivery method, the other methods would still be available.

Some in the United States during the early 1960s pointed out that although all of the individual components of nuclear missiles had been tested separately (warheads, navigation systems, rockets), it was infeasible to test them all combined. Critics charged that it was not really known how a warhead would react to the gravity forces and temperature differences encountered in the upper atmosphere and outer space, and Kennedy was unwilling to run a test of an ICBM with a live warhead. The closest event to an actual test was 1962&#x27;s Operation Frigate Bird, in which the submarine launched a Polaris A2 missile over to the nuclear test site at Christmas Island. It was challenged by, among others, Curtis LeMay, who put missile accuracy into doubt to encourage the development of new bombers. Other critics pointed out that it was a single test which could be an anomaly; that it was a lower-altitude SLBM and therefore was subject to different conditions than an ICBM; and that significant modifications had been made to its warhead before testing.

===Mutual assured destruction (MAD)===

By the mid-1960s both the United States and the Soviet Union had enough nuclear power to obliterate their opponent. Both sides developed a capability to launch a devastating attack even after sustaining a full assault from the other side (especially by means of submarines), called a second strike. This policy became known as Mutual Assured Destruction: both sides knew that any attack upon the other would be devastating to themselves, thus in theory restraining them from attacking the other.

Both Soviet and American experts hoped to use nuclear weapons for extracting concessions from the other, or from other powers such as China, but the risk connected with using these weapons was so grave that they refrained from what John Foster Dulles referred to as brinkmanship. While some, like General Douglas MacArthur, argued nuclear weapons should be used during the Korean War, both Truman and Eisenhower opposed the idea.

Both sides were unaware of the details of the capacity of the enemy&#x27;s arsenal of nuclear weapons. The Americans suffered from a lack of confidence, and in the 1950s they believed in a non-existing bomber gap. Aerial photography later revealed that the Soviets had been playing a sort of Potemkin village game with their bombers in their military parades, flying them in large circles, making it appear they had far more than they truly did. The 1960 American presidential election saw accusations of a wholly spurious missile gap between the Soviets and the Americans. On the other side, the Soviet government exaggerated the power of Soviet weapons to the leadership and Soviet first secretary Nikita Khrushchev.

==Initial nuclear proliferation==

In addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, three other nations, the United Kingdom, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and France developed nuclear weapons during the early cold war years.

In 1952, the United Kingdom became the third nation to test a nuclear weapon when it detonated an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane on October 3, 1952, which had a yield of 25 kilotons. Despite major contributions to the Manhattan Project by both Canadian and British governments, the U.S. Congress passed the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which prohibited multi-national cooperation on nuclear projects. The Atomic Energy Act fueled resentment from British scientists and Winston Churchill, as they believed that there were agreements regarding post-war sharing of nuclear technology and led to Britain&#x27;s developing its nuclear weapons. Britain did not begin planning the development of its nuclear weapon until January 1947. Because of Britain&#x27;s small size, they decided to test their bomb on the Montebello Islands, off the coast of Australia. Following this successful test, under the leadership of Churchill, Britain decided to develop and test a hydrogen bomb. The first successful hydrogen bomb test occurred on November 8, 1957, which had a yield of 1.8 megatons. An amendment to the Atomic Energy Act in 1958 allowed nuclear cooperation once again, and British-U.S. nuclear programs resumed. During the Cold War, British nuclear deterrence came from submarines and nuclear-armed aircraft. The &quot;Resolution&quot;-class ballistic missile submarines armed with the American-built Polaris missile provided the sea deterrent, while aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan, SEPECAT Jaguar, Panavia Tornado and several other Royal Air Force strike aircraft carrying the WE.177 gravity bomb provided the air deterrent.

France became the fourth nation to possess nuclear weapons on February 13, 1960, when the atomic bomb &quot;Gerboise Bleue&quot; was detonated in Algeria, then still a French colony (formally a part of Metropolitan France). France began making plans for a nuclear-weapons program shortly after the Second World War, but the program did not begin until the late 1950s. Eight years later, France conducted its first thermonuclear test above Fangatuafa Atoll. It had a yield of 2.6 megatons. This bomb significantly contaminated the atoll with radiation for six years, making it off-limits to humans. During the Cold War, the French nuclear deterrent was centered around the Force de frappe, a nuclear triad consisting of Dassault Mirage IV bombers carrying such nuclear weapons as the AN-22 gravity bomb and the ASMP stand-off attack missile, Pluton and Hades ballistic missiles, and the &quot; Redoutable&quot;-class submarine armed with strategic nuclear missiles.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China became the fifth nuclear power on October 16, 1964, when it detonated a 25 kiloton uranium-235 bomb in a test codenamed 596 at Lop Nur. In the late 1950s, China began developing nuclear weapons with substantial Soviet assistance in exchange for uranium ore. However, the Sino-Soviet ideological split in the late 1950s developed problems between China and the Soviet Union. This caused the Soviets to cease helping China develop nuclear weapons. However, China continued developing nuclear weapons without Soviet support and made remarkable progress in the 1960s. Owing to Soviet/Chinese tensions, the Chinese might have used nuclear weapons against either the United States or the Soviet Union in the event of a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the Chinese nuclear deterrent consisted of gravity bombs carried aboard H-6 bomber aircraft, missile systems such as the DF-2, DF-3, and DF-4, and in the later stages of the Cold War, the Type 092 ballistic missile submarine. On June 14, 1967, China detonated its first hydrogen bomb.

==Cuban Missile Crisis==
On January 1, 1959, the Cuban government fell to communist revolutionaries, propelling Fidel Castro into power. The communist Soviet Union supported and praised Castro and his resistance, and the revolutionary government was recognized by the Soviet Union on January 10. When the United States began boycotting Cuban sugar, the Soviet Union began purchasing large quantities to support the Cuban economy in return for fuel and eventually placing nuclear ballistic missiles on Cuban soil. These missiles would be capable of reaching the United States very quickly. On October 14, 1962, an American spy plane discovered these nuclear missile sites under construction in Cuba.

President Kennedy immediately called a series of meetings for a small group of senior officials to debate the crisis. The group was split between a militaristic solution and a diplomatic one. President Kennedy ordered a naval blockade around Cuba and all military forces to DEFCON 3. As tensions increased, Kennedy eventually ordered U.S. military forces to DEFCON 2. This is considered the closest the world has been to a nuclear war. While the U.S. military had been ordered to DEFCON 2, the theory of mutually assured destruction suggests that entry into nuclear war is an unlikely possibility. While the public perceived the Cuban Missile Crisis as a time of near mass destruction, the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union were working confidentially in order to allow the crisis to come to a peaceful conclusion. Soviet First Secretary Khrushchev wrote to President Kennedy in a telegram on October 26, 1962, saying that, &quot;Consequently, if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby to doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that knot.&quot;

Eventually, on October 28, through much discussion between U.S and Soviet officials, Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union would withdraw all missiles from Cuba. Shortly afterwards, the U.S. withdrew all their nuclear missiles from Turkey in secret – the presence of the missiles having threatened the Soviets. Information that the U.S. had withdrawn their Jupiter Missiles from Turkey remained confidential for decades, causing the result of the negotiations between the two nations to appear to the world as a major U.S. victory. This ultimately led to the downfall of Soviet leader Khrushchev.

==Détente==
By the 1970s, with the Cold War&#x27;s entering its 30th year with no direct conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, the superpowers entered a period of reduced conflict, in which the two powers engaged in trade and exchanges with each other. This period was known as détente.

This period included negotiation of a number of arms control agreements, building with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the 1950s, but with significant new treaties negotiated in the 1970s. These treaties were only partially successful. Although both states continued to hold massive numbers of nuclear weapons and research more effective technology, the growth in number of warheads was first limited, and later, with the START I, reversed.

===Treaties===

In 1958, both the U.S. and Soviet Union informally agreed to suspend nuclear testing. However, this agreement was ended when the Soviets resumed testing in 1961, followed by a series of nuclear tests conducted by the U.S. These events led to much political fallout, as well as the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. It was felt by American and Soviet leaders that something had to be done to ease the significant tensions between these two countries, so on October 10, 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) was signed. This was an agreement between the U.S., the Soviet Union, and the U.K., which significantly restricted nuclear testing. All atmospheric, underwater, and outer space nuclear testing were agreed to be halted, but testing was still allowed underground. An additional 113 countries have signed this treaty since 1963.

SALT I and SALT II limited the size of the U.S. arsenal. Bans on nuclear testing, anti-ballistic missile systems, and weapons in space all attempted to limit the expansion of the arms race through the Partial Test Ban Treaty.

In November 1969, Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) begun. This was primarily due to the economic impact that nuclear testing and production had on both U.S. and Soviet economies. The SALT I Treaty, which was signed in May 1972, produced an agreement on two significant documents. These were the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty) and the Interim Agreement on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. The ABM treaty limited each country to two ABM sites, while the Interim Agreement froze each country&#x27;s number of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) at current levels for five years. This treaty significantly reduced nuclear-related costs as well as the risk of nuclear war. However, SALT I failed to address how many nuclear warheads could be placed on a single missile. A new technology, known as multiple-independently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV), allowed single missiles to hold and launch multiple nuclear missiles at targets while in mid-air. Over the next 10 years, the Soviet Union and U.S. added 12,000 nuclear warheads to their already built arsenals.

Throughout the 1970s, both the Soviet Union and United States replaced older warheads and missiles with newer, more powerful and effective ones. On June 18, 1979, the SALT II treaty was signed in Vienna. This treaty limited both sides&#x27; nuclear arsenals and technology. However, in light of the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, the United States Senate never ratified the SALT II treaty. This ended the treaty negotiations as well as the era of détente.

In 1991, the START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) was negotiated between the U. S. and the Soviet Union, to reduce the number and limit the capabilities of limitation of strategic offensive arms. This was eventually succeeded by the START II, START III, and New START treaties.

==Reagan and the Strategic Defense Initiative==
Despite détente, both sides continued to develop and introduce not only more accurate weapons, but weapons with more warheads (&quot;MIRVs&quot;). The presidency of Ronald Reagan proposed a missile defense programme tagged the Strategic Defense Initiative, a space-based anti-ballistic missile system derided as &quot;Star Wars&quot; by its critics; simultaneously, missile defense was also being researched in the Soviet Union. However, the SDI would require technology that had not yet been developed, or even researched. This system proposed both space- and earth-based laser battle stations. It would also need sensors on the ground, in the air, and in space with radar, optical, and infrared technology to detect incoming missiles. Simultaneously, however, Reagan initiated negotiations with Mikhail Gorbachev, ultimately resulting in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty on reducing nuclear stockpiles.

Owing to high costs and complex technology for its time, the scope of the SDI project was reduced from defense against a massive attack to a system for defending against limited attacks, transitioning into the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.

==The end of the Cold War==
During the mid-1980s, the U.S-Soviet relations significantly improved, Mikhail Gorbachev assumed control of the Soviet Union after the deaths of several former Soviet leaders and announced a new era of &quot;perestroika&quot; and &quot;glasnost,&quot; meaning restructuring and openness respectively. Gorbachev proposed a 50% reduction of nuclear weapons for both the U.S and Soviet Union at the meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland in October 1986. However, the proposal was refused due to disagreements over Reagan&#x27;s SDI. Instead, the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty was signed on December 8, 1987, in Washington, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.

Owing to the dramatic economic and social changes occurring within the Soviet Union, many of its constituent republics began to declare their independence. With the wave of revolutions sweeping across Eastern-Europe, the Soviet Union was unable to impose its will on its satellite states and so its sphere of influence slowly diminished. By December 16, 1991, all of the republics had declared independence from the Union. The Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as the country&#x27;s president on December 25 and the Soviet Union was declared non-existent the following day.

==Post–Cold War==


With the end of the Cold War, the United States and Russia cut down on nuclear weapons spending. Fewer new systems were developed, and both arsenals were reduced, although both countries maintain significant stocks of nuclear missiles. In the United States, stockpile stewardship programs have taken over the role of maintaining the aging arsenal.

After the Cold War ended, large inventories of nuclear weapons and facilities remained. Some are being recycled, dismantled, or recovered as valuable substances. Large amounts of money and resources – which would have been spent on developing nuclear weapons in the Soviet Union, had the arms race continued – were instead used for repairing the environmental damage produced by the nuclear arms race, and almost all former production sites are now major cleanup sites. In the United States, the plutonium production facility at Hanford, Washington, and the plutonium pit fabrication facility at Rocky Flats, Colorado, are among the most polluted sites.

Military policies and strategies have been modified to reflect the increasing intervals without major confrontation. In 1995, United States policy and strategy regarding nuclear proliferation was outlined in the document &quot;Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence&quot;, produced by the Policy Subcommittee of the Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) of the United States Strategic Command.

=== 21st century nuclear arms race ===

On 13 December 2001, George W. Bush gave Russia notice of the United States&#x27; withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. This led to the eventual creation of the American Missile Defense Agency. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the withdrawal by ordering a build-up of Russia&#x27;s nuclear capabilities, designed to counterbalance U.S. capabilities.

On April 8, 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the New START Treaty, which called for a fifty percent reduction of strategic nuclear missile launchers and a curtailment of deployed nuclear warheads. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in December 2010 by a three-quarter majority.
On December 22, 2016, U.S. President Donald Trump proclaimed in a tweet that &quot;the United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,&quot; effectively challenging the world to re-engage in a race for nuclear dominance. The next day, Trump reiterated his position to &quot;Morning Joe&quot; host Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC, stating: &quot;Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.&quot;

In October 2018, the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev commented that U.S. withdrawal from the INF nuclear treaty is &quot;not the work of a great mind&quot; and that &quot;a new arms race has been announced&quot;.

In 2019, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned about the risk of nuclear war, as negative dynamics had been noticeable over the previous year. He urged the nuclear states to build channels on forestalling potential incidents in order to lower the risks.

According to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal &quot;Nature Food&quot; in August 2022, a full-scale nuclear war between the United States and Russia, which together hold more than 90% of the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons, would kill 360 million people directly and more than 5 billion (80% of humanity) indirectly by starvation during a nuclear winter. Roughly 99% of the people in the US, Europe, Russia and China would starve to death if they did not die of something else sooner with 95% of the fatalities being in countries not initially involved.

On February 21, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended Russia&#x27;s participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States, saying that Russia would not allow the US and NATO to inspect its nuclear facilities.

In July 2024, the Biden administration announced its intention to deploy long-range missiles in Germany starting in 2026 that could hit Russian territory within 10 minutes. In response, Russian President Putin warned of a Cold War-style missile crisis and threatened to deploy long-range missiles within striking distance of the West. US weapons in Germany would include SM-6 and Tomahawk cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons. The United States&#x27; decision to deploy long-range missiles in Germany has been compared to the deployment of Pershing II launchers in Western Europe in 1979. Critics say the move would trigger a new arms race. According to Russian military analysts, it would be extremely difficult to distinguish between a conventionally armed missile and a missile carrying a nuclear warhead, and Russia could respond by deploying longer-range nuclear systems targeting Germany.

In August 2024, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that &quot;a new nuclear arms race draws closer&quot;, as the U.S. is considering increasing its nuclear forces in response to escalating threats and rapid nuclear expansions by China and Russia, as well as North Korea&#x27;s advancements in missile technology and Iran&#x27;s advancement as a &quot;threshold&quot; nuclear state.

==India and Pakistan==
In South Asia, India and Pakistan have also engaged in a technological nuclear arms race since the 1970s. The nuclear competition started in 1974 with India detonating a device, codenamed Smiling Buddha, at the Pokhran region of the Rajasthan state. The Indian government called this test a &quot;peaceful nuclear explosion&quot;, but according to independent sources, it was actually part of an accelerated covert nuclear program of India.

This test generated great concern and doubts in Pakistan, with fear it would be at the mercy of its long-time arch-rival. Pakistan had its own covert atomic bomb projects in 1972 which ran for many years since the first Indian weapon was detonated. After the 1974 test, the pace of Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb program significantly accelerated, culminating in successfully building its own atomic weapons. In the last few decades of the 20th century, India and Pakistan began to develop nuclear-capable rockets and nuclear military technologies. Finally, in 1998, India – under Atal Bihari Vajpayee&#x27;s government – test detonated five more nuclear weapons. Domestic pressure within Pakistan began to build and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered a test, detonating six nuclear weapons (Chagai-I and Chagai-II) in retaliation and to act as a deterrent.

According to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal &quot;Nature Food&quot; in August 2022, a nuclear war between India and Pakistan could kill more than 2 billion indirectly by starvation during a nuclear winter.

==Defense against nuclear attacks==

From the beginning of the Cold War, The United States, Russia, and other nations have all attempted to develop anti-ballistic missiles. The United States developed the LIM-49 Nike Zeus in the 1950s in order to destroy incoming ICBMs.

Russia has also developed ABM missiles, in the form of the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system and the later A-135 anti-ballistic missile system. Chinese state media has also announced that China has tested anti-ballistic missiles, though specific information is not public.

In November 2006, India – with an initiative called the Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme – successfully tested its Prithvi Air Defense (PAD) anti-ballistic missile, followed by testing of the Advanced Air Defense (AAD) anti-ballistic missile in December 2007.

== Nuclear disarmament ==
Nuclear disarmament is one of four different norms in the aid of getting rid of nuclear weapons. This norm can include arms control, arms reduction to elimination, prohibition, and stigmatization.

This has been a hard norm to implement. Most of the conditions, the weight, strategy, timing, conditionality, and compliance have been contested.

First the United States announced on September 27, 1991, that they would be destroying the ground-launched short-range nuclear weapons. Mikhail Gorbachev, who was the President of the Soviet Union at that time, removed nuclear warheads from air defense missiles and nuclear artillery munitions.

In 2017, the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Treaty gives the representation of self-empowerment. This treaty did not involve the states or their allies that had nuclear weapons.

A lot of debate has occurred about nuclear disarmament. Debates over treaties in reducing and getting rid of nuclear weapons all together have been ongoing since the Cold War ended.

In 2010, there was a debate over the New Strategic Arms Reduction (START) treaty. This treaty was negotiated between the United States and Russia.

Since this has been an ongoing endeavor, a lot of the non-nuclear states are fighting to get the states that do have nuclear weapons to abide by what they believe to be the most recent obligations.

Both the United States and Russian Presidents agreed to destroy nuclear weapons they contained.

<text>Walter Reginald Hammond (19 June 1903 – 1 July 1965) was an English first-class cricketer who played for Gloucestershire in a career that lasted from 1920 to 1951. Beginning as a professional, he later became an amateur and was appointed captain of England. Primarily a middle-order batsman, &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; described him in his obituary as one of the four best batsmen in the history of cricket. He was considered to be the best English batsman of the 1930s by commentators and those with whom he played; they also said that he was one of the best slip fielders ever. Hammond was an effective fast-medium pace bowler and contemporaries believed that if he had been less reluctant to bowl, he could have achieved even more with the ball than he did.

In a Test career spanning 85 matches, he scored 7,249 runs and took 83 wickets. Hammond captained England in 20 of those Tests, winning four, losing three, and drawing 13. His career aggregate of runs was the highest in Test cricket until surpassed by Colin Cowdrey in 1970; his total of 22 Test centuries remained an English record until Alastair Cook surpassed it in December 2012. In 1933, he set a record for the highest individual Test innings of 336 not out, surpassed by Len Hutton in 1938. In all first-class cricket, he scored 50,551 runs and 167 centuries, respectively the seventh and third highest totals by a first-class cricketer.

Although Hammond began his career in 1920, he was required to wait until 1923 before he could play full-time, after his qualification to play for Gloucestershire was challenged. His potential was spotted immediately and after three full seasons, he was chosen to visit the West Indies in 1925–26 as a member of a Marylebone Cricket Club touring party, but contracted a serious illness on the tour. He began to score heavily after his recovery in 1927 and was selected for England. In the 1928–29 series against Australia he scored 905 runs, then a record aggregate for a Test series. He dominated county cricket in the 1930s and, despite a mid-decade slump in Test form, was made captain of England in 1938. He continued as captain after the Second World War, but his health had deteriorated and he retired from first-class cricket after an unsuccessful tour of Australia in 1946–47. He appeared in two more first-class matches in the early 1950s.

Hammond was married twice, divorcing his first wife in acrimonious circumstances, and had a reputation for infidelity. His relationships with other players were difficult; teammates and opponents alike found him hard to get along with. He was unsuccessful in business dealings and failed to establish a successful career once he retired from cricket. He moved to South Africa in the 1950s in an attempt to start a business, but this came to nothing. As a result, he and his family struggled financially. Shortly after beginning a career as a sports administrator, he was involved in a serious car crash in 1960 which left him frail. He died of a heart attack in 1965.

==Early life and career==

===Childhood and school life===
Hammond was born on 19 June 1903 in Dover in Kent. His parents, William—a bombardier in the Royal Garrison Artillery—and Marion Hammond (née Crisp), lived in the married quarters at Dover Castle where Walter was born. They had wed the previous December. Hammond spent his early years in Dover, often playing cricket. When he was five years old, his father was posted to Hong Kong to serve on the China Station and promoted to sergeant. The family remained there until 1911, followed by a posting to Malta until 1914. Hammond later recalled playing cricket in Malta using improvised equipment, including a soldier&#x27;s old bat which he believed taught him to strike the ball powerfully.

When the First World War broke out, the Hammonds returned to England with the rest of the 46th Company of the Royal Garrison Artillery. William was subsequently posted to France where, promoted to major, he was killed near Amiens in 1918. Marion settled in Southsea and sent Walter to The Portsmouth Grammar School, before moving him in 1918 to board at Cirencester Grammar School, believing that he would benefit from living away from home and hoping to encourage a career in farming. He did not enjoy an easy relationship with his mother, often staying with friends during holidays in preference to returning home.

At both Portsmouth and Cirencester, Hammond excelled at sports including cricket (playing for the Portsmouth Grammar School second eleven), football and fives. At Cirencester, he played football for the school first eleven in his first term. He quickly reached the school cricket first eleven, where he outperformed the other players and became captain in his second season; his headmaster, quickly spotting his potential, encouraged him. His first century was scored in a match against a parents&#x27; team from the school. In an inter-house match, he scored 365 not out, albeit against very weak bowling. These achievements brought him some local acclaim. Hammond enjoyed less success in the classroom; his marks were usually low, and he preferred to be out playing cricket.

Leaving Cirencester in July 1920, Hammond planned to go to Winchester Agricultural College, following the path into farming mapped out by his mother. However, his plans changed when his headmaster wrote to the captain of Gloucestershire, Foster Robinson, reporting Hammond&#x27;s school cricket record and suggesting that they take a look at him. Hammond, who scored a century in his first appearance in adult cricket days after leaving school, played in a trial match for the Gloucestershire Club and Ground, scoring 60 runs, taking two wickets and impressing the local press. Subsequently, two members of Gloucestershire&#x27;s committee visited Hammond&#x27;s mother in an attempt to sign him for the club. Hammond&#x27;s mother was initially reluctant, but his eagerness finally convinced her and he signed a professional contract.

===First years with Gloucestershire===

Hammond made his first-class debut for Gloucestershire in August 1920. Although his first four innings yielded only 27 runs, the local press saw enough to predict a great future for him. He spent the winter working on a farm on the Isle of Wight, then moved to Bristol for the start of the 1921 English cricket season. Playing only two first-class matches in 1921, both against the powerful Australian tourists, Hammond scored two runs in three innings, overwhelmed by fast bowler Jack Gregory. In between these games, Gloucestershire arranged his appointment as assistant coach at Clifton College, Bristol, where he worked on his batting technique with former county cricketers John Tunnicliffe and George Dennett.

Gloucestershire gave Hammond an extended run at the start of the 1922 season. He played five matches without passing 32 runs in an innings at a batting average of under ten. He did not have the opportunity to improve his record as Lord Harris, the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C.) treasurer, noticed that Hammond was born in Kent. He had not resided in Gloucestershire long enough to be eligible to play for the team under County Championship rules, and was barred for the rest of the season. The press criticised the ruling for interrupting the career of a player seen as very promising, despite his lack of success thus far. Hammond spent the rest of the summer, which he later described as the most miserable of his life, watching county games, although Gloucestershire continued to pay him in full.

===Football career===
In the winter of 1921–22, Hammond, needing work, signed to play professional football for Bristol Rovers F.C. in Division Three South, following his success at school and in the Bristol Downs Football League. After some time in the reserves, he made four appearances for the first team that season. He played in ten games the following season, and four times in 1923–24. His usual position was on the right wing. Despite scoring twice in his career, he never showed much enthusiasm for the game and was cautious around tackles, mindful that his main career was cricket. He was criticised in the local press for his role in two defeats shortly before his final appearance. After he was left out of the team, he never played again and left the club, deciding that he could not play two sports professionally. Even so, the Rovers&#x27; trainer, Bert Williams, and manager, Andy Wilson, believed that Hammond, one of the fastest players they had seen at the club, would have had the potential to play international football.

===Making an impression===
Conscious of the need to improve after his uncertain start to first-class cricket, Hammond scored his maiden first-class century in the first match of the 1923 season, making 110 and 92 opening the batting against Surrey. He did not reach three figures again that season, but his performances and batting technique impressed several critics, such as cricket correspondent Neville Cardus, former England and Middlesex captain Plum Warner, and &quot;The Times&quot; correspondent; Cardus described him as a future England player. In all first-class matches that season, Hammond scored 1,421 runs at an average of 27.86. With the ball, he took 18 first-class wickets at an average of 41.22, including figures of six for 59 against Hampshire. Reviewing the season, &quot;Wisden&quot;″s correspondent declared that Hammond &quot;has all the world before him and there is no telling how far he may go&quot;.

Hammond reached 1,239 runs in 1924, scoring a century against Somerset and reaching fifty against Oxford, Essex and Hampshire. In the final County Championship match of the season, against Middlesex, he scored 174 not out after Gloucestershire had been bowled out for 31 in their first innings. He finished the season with an average of 30.21 and supplemented his batting with 29 wickets. He improved on this record in 1925 with 1,818 runs at an average of 34.30 and 68 wickets at an average of just under 30, more than doubling his career aggregate of wickets. His bowling performances led critics to describe him as a potentially good all-rounder. Hammond was not satisfied with his batting form in 1925, but against Lancashire at Old Trafford, he scored 250 not out, repeatedly hooking the short-pitched bowling of Australian Test bowler Ted McDonald. Cardus described it as &quot;one of the finest innings that can ever have been accomplished by a boy of his age&quot;. Over these two seasons, Hammond increasingly batted in the middle order, where he remained for most of his career.

===Serious illness===
Hammond&#x27;s performances earned him selection for the M.C.C. winter tour of the West Indies in the 1925–26 season. At that time, such tours were popular with amateur cricketers, who were often chosen for social rather than cricketing reasons. The touring party contained only eight professionals, who were expected to do most of the bowling and provide the cricketing quality. The West Indies team did not have Test status, so no official internationals were scheduled, but a series of representative matches against a West Indian team were played. Rain disrupted much of the cricket, but Hammond enjoyed the experience. In first-class matches, he scored 732 runs at an average of 48.80, with two hundreds and two fifties, and took 20 wickets at an average of 28.65. He scored 238 not out in the first representative game against a West Indies side. Following the tour, he won praise from Warner and the captain of the M.C.C. team, Freddie Calthorpe, and was believed to be close to the full England side.

Towards the end of the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; according to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his teammates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12 operations at the nursing home to which he was taken. His condition worsened to the point where the doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond&#x27;s illness was made, other than to say he was in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond&#x27;s subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.

==Test cricketer==

===Test debut===
On his return to first-class cricket in the 1927 season, Hammond made an immediate impact, becoming only the second man, after W. G. Grace, to score 1,000 runs in May, traditionally the first month of the English cricket season. This sequence included another effective performance against Lancashire, regarded by some observers as one of the best innings ever played. He scored 99 in the first innings and 187 in the second to ensure the match was drawn. He again hooked McDonald effectively, at one point hitting five consecutive fours. Hammond played in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord&#x27;s for the first time, although he neither batted nor bowled, as well as two Test trials. Coming close to scoring 1,000 runs in June as well, he finished the season with 2,969 runs, including 12 centuries. His average of 69.04 was the fifth highest in first-class cricket. He won selection for the M.C.C. team that would tour South Africa in the winter and the accolade of being named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.

While on tour in South Africa in 1927–28, Hammond did not dominate as expected. Still recovering from his illness, he was worn out from the strain of a long season. He showed good batting form, but once George Geary was injured, a strong but not fully representative side found itself short of bowling, forcing Hammond to play as an all-rounder. In all first-class matches on the tour, he scored 908 runs at an average of 47.78, and took 27 wickets at an average of 23.85. His Test debut came in the first match of the series, as he scored a quick 51 in his only innings and took five wickets for 36 runs in the South African second innings. At one point, he took three wickets for no runs and his bowling was described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as a key factor in an England victory. His best innings came in the third Test as he reached 90. He had some good bowling spells, and in the fourth Test he removed both South African openers. An innings of 66 in the fifth and final Test left him with 321 runs at an average of 40.12 in his debut series, while his 15 wickets cost 26.60 runs each. All of Hammond&#x27;s batting appearances were at number four in the order; of his 140 career Test innings, 118 were at number three or four. The series was drawn 2–2.

In the following season of 1928, Hammond scored 2,825 runs (average 65.69) with three double centuries, took 84 wickets (average 23.10), his highest total in a season, and held 79 catches, a single season record. These performances helped Gloucestershire to mount a rare but unsuccessful challenge for the County Championship. At the Cheltenham festival, in six days, Hammond scored 362 runs, took 11 wickets and held 11 catches. Against Surrey, he scored a century in both innings and held ten catches, including six in the second innings, which remains a first-class record as of 2015. In the following match, against Worcestershire, Hammond scored 80. Bowling off-spin on a testing pitch, he then took nine wickets for 23, the best bowling figures of his career. He followed up with six for 105 as Worcestershire followed on. He played in a Test trial and in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord&#x27;s for the second time, before participating in the three Test matches against the West Indies cricket team. While England won the series 3–0, Hammond had mixed success. Despite scores of 45 in the first Test and a careful 63 in the second, he made just 111 runs in the series at an average of 37.

===1928–29 tour of Australia===

In the winter of 1928–29, Hammond toured Australia with the M.C.C. The side was a strong one which overpowered Australia, winning the five-match series 4–1. Hammond was remarkably successful in his first campaign for The Ashes. &quot;Wisden&quot; described his batting as a &quot;series of triumphs&quot;. He scored 779 runs in five consecutive Test innings, totalling 905 runs at an average of 113.12 in the series, a record passed only by Don Bradman since. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,553 runs (average 91.35). However, except for one inspired spell in the final Test, in which he bowled the first three batsmen, &quot;Wisden&quot; described his bowling as disappointing. He began the tour with a century and a double century before the Test series. He scored 251 in a seven-hour innings in the second Test. This was his maiden Test century and the second highest Test score between England and Australia. In the next Test, Hammond scored 200 against an accurate attack, again taking around seven hours. In the fourth Test he scored 119 not out and then 177, in what &quot;Wisden&quot; judged his best innings of the tour due to his mastery of the bowlers and the difficult match situation when he came in to bat. Hammond had altered his usual batting style, playing more carefully and avoiding risk as runs were certain to come in the easy Australian batting conditions if a batsman did not get out. He eliminated the hook shot entirely from his repertoire and rarely played the cut shot. Unless the bowler bowled a bad ball, he limited his scoring between extra cover and midwicket, as the Australians unsuccessfully tried to block his shots in that area. &quot;Wisden&quot; stated that, even with his more cautious play, his batting on tour had shown skill and beauty.

Hammond married Dorothy Lister almost immediately after returning home, just before the 1929 season began. Gloucestershire&#x27;s inspirational new captain, Bev Lyon, led another Gloucestershire challenge for the County Championship. He used Hammond&#x27;s bowling less due to the emergence of Tom Goddard, but Hammond was less dominant with the bat than was expected. In first-class cricket, he scored 2,456 runs at an average of 64.63. He played in four of the five Tests against South Africa, missing the fourth due to injury; he also suffered an injury in the second Test which required him to use a runner. Adopting tactics similar to those with which he had success in Australia, he scored two centuries—an unbeaten 138 in the first Test, and a match-saving 101 not out in the final Test which gave England a 2–0 series victory. His only other innings over fifty was played in the third Test. He ended the series with 352 runs at an average of 58.66. At the time, critics considered him the best batsman in the world.

===Career in the early 1930s===

The 1930 season saw the Australians tour England, Bradman&#x27;s first tour. Over five Tests, the young Australian scored 974 runs in an excellent batting display to break Hammond&#x27;s record run aggregate and average set in the 1928–29 series. While Bradman dominated, Hammond found it very difficult to play the leg spin bowling of Clarrie Grimmett, who dismissed him five times. Hammond scored 306 runs at an average of 34.00, passing fifty just twice. He batted over five hours for a match-saving 113 in the third Test. On a difficult pitch and with little support, he made a hard-hitting 60 in the final Test in a losing cause. The visitors took the series 2–1, and the newspapers unfavourably compared Hammond&#x27;s scoring with Bradman&#x27;s. Later in the season, Hammond scored 89 for Gloucestershire in a tied match against the Australians which he described as the most exciting of his career. One player said that he had never seen Hammond as excited as he was at the conclusion of the game. In all first-class cricket that season, he scored 2,032 runs (average 53.47) and for Gloucestershire, he came top of the batting averages as the club finished second in the Championship. He took 30 wickets, including match figures of 12 for 74 against Glamorgan.

Hammond toured South Africa in the winter of 1930–31, in a weak M.C.C. side without some of the best English players. The tourists were short of opening batsmen, frequently forcing Hammond into the role. Although successful, he brought a more wary approach than usual to his unaccustomed position. In all first-class cricket, he scored 1,045 runs (average 61.47). In the five-Test series, which South Africa won 1–0, he scored 517 runs (average 64.62), passing fifty five times in nine innings. A very cautious approach batting at number three saw Hammond score 49 and 63 in the first Test. Opening the batting in the second Test, he scored two fifties to save the game; he also kept wicket for a time following an injury to the regular wicketkeeper. Hammond continued to open in the third Test, playing more aggressively for 136 not out, before returning to number three and making 75 in the fourth Test. In the final Test, he opened both the batting and the bowling.

In 1931, Hammond increased his first-class wicket total to 47, and scored 1,781 runs at an average of 42.40. Although he remained a key batsman for Gloucestershire, both his aggregate and average fell, at least partly due to wet weather that often led to difficult batting conditions. In the three Tests against New Zealand, their first in England, he made an attacking century in the second Test, England&#x27;s only victory. He did not pass fifty in the rest of the series, ending the victorious campaign with 169 runs at an average of 56.33. In 1932, Hammond was appointed vice-captain of Gloucestershire, but it was noted in &quot;Wisden&quot; that he sometimes failed to inspire his team. Hammond himself felt unable, as a new captain, to take the same risks that Lyon had done. He scored 2,528 runs (average 56.17), including his then highest score of 264, and his first hundred for the Players against the Gentlemen. He also took 53 wickets.

===Bodyline tour===
Hammond was selected for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1932–33. Known as the Bodyline series, it became notorious for the controversial English tactic of bowling short on the line of leg stump, making the ball rise towards the batsman&#x27;s body to create deflections that could be caught by leg-side fielders. Hammond, one of the first players selected, was part of the selection committee on tour, and the M.C.C. captain, Douglas Jardine, may have discussed tactics with him on the outward journey. Hammond disapproved of Bodyline bowling, believing it to be dangerous, although he understood some of the reasons for its use. He kept his feelings hidden during the tour, preferring to go along with his captain and the rest of the team. It was not until 1946 that he openly voiced his opinion.

&quot;Wisden&quot; described Hammond&#x27;s campaign as successful, although he failed to reach the heights of his previous tour. In the Tests, Hammond scored 440 runs (average 55.00) and took nine wickets (average 32.33), while scoring 948 runs (average 55.76) and taking 20 wickets (average 28.90) in all first-class matches. Although &quot;Wisden&quot; said that Hammond accomplished little with the ball, team manager Plum Warner praised his bowling, claiming that during the first Test it was comparable to that of revered former England bowler Sydney Barnes. His best performance was in a match against New South Wales, where he took six for 43, including the wicket of Bradman. In an early game on tour against Victoria, Hammond was instructed by Jardine to attack the bowling of Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, who was on the verge of making his Test debut. Hammond scored 203, freely punishing Fleetwood-Smith&#x27;s bowling and in effect delaying his Test debut for several years.

In England&#x27;s victory in the first Test, Hammond scored 112, playing powerfully through the off side. He took two wickets in two balls in the second Australian innings, making the ball move around. In the second Test, he bowled spin, as England left out Hedley Verity, their specialist spinner; his bowling impressed Jardine and the &quot;Wisden&quot; correspondent. His bowling against Bradman, who scored an unbeaten century, produced a personal duel that struck observers as particularly tense. Hammond took three for 23 in the second innings but achieved little with the bat as England lost the match. In the third Test, he appeared uncomfortable facing Tim Wall&#x27;s fast, short bowling, and was heard to say, &quot;If that&#x27;s what the bloody game&#x27;s coming to, I&#x27;ve had enough of it!&quot; He scored 85 in the second innings before being bowled by a full toss from Bradman, to his annoyance. Hammond did not pass 20 runs in England&#x27;s Ashes-securing victory in the fourth Test, attracting criticism from &quot;Wisden&quot; and others for overcautious batting. He returned to form in the final Test at Sydney, a ground on which he was often successful, scoring 101 and 75 not out. &quot;Wisden&quot; praised his style and brilliant play, and he ended the match with a six, securing England&#x27;s third successive victory and a 4–1 series win.

A short tour of New Zealand followed; Hammond scored 621 runs in three first-class innings. In the first Test, he scored 227, and in the second and final Test, he broke the world record for a Test innings on 1 April by scoring 336 not out. His record innings began cautiously, but against a weak bowling side, he increased his scoring rate after making his century and again after reaching 200. As he passed Bradman&#x27;s record of 334, he shouted &quot;Yes!&quot; He hit ten sixes, then a Test record, including three from consecutive balls. However, the weakness of the bowling compared to that faced by Bradman and the importance of Ashes matches meant that Hammond&#x27;s record was not as prestigious as the Australian&#x27;s. When Len Hutton broke the record in 1938, he considered Bradman&#x27;s 334 the score to beat.

===Loss of Test form===
The Bodyline controversy continued into the 1933 season. Bodyline tactics were used in several matches, including by the West Indian tourists in the second Test. In all first-class cricket, Hammond, no longer vice-captain of Gloucestershire, scored 3,323 runs, passing 3,000 in a season for the first time. With an average of 67.81, he topped the first-class tables for what would be the first of eight successive seasons. He also took 38 wickets. However, his highest score in three Test innings was 34. In the second Test, unsettled by Bodyline, Hammond was cut on the chin by a short ball, causing him to retire hurt. He again commented that he would quit rather than face such bowling; soon after his return, he was out. Les Ames, who played in the three-match series, won by England 2–0, believed that the West Indian pacemen worried Hammond, who showed a weakness against short, fast bowling.

Hammond spent much of the 1934 season troubled by sore throats and back problems which restricted his appearances for Gloucestershire. His form for his county was good and in all first-class matches, he scored 2,366 runs (average 76.32), although he took fewer wickets at a higher average than the previous season. Awarded a benefit match, which raised just over £2,600, Hammond was idolised by the press and public for his achievements. In Tests, it was a different story; according to &quot;Wisden&quot;, he failed badly. England lost the Ashes, 2–1, in a series overshadowed at times by the Bodyline controversy. Hammond played in all five Tests against Australia but his top score was 43; he scored 162 runs at an average of 20.25, and took five wickets at an average of 72.80. Although the press and selectors supported him, there were some suggestions he should be left out of the side, and Hammond felt under great pressure.

The pattern of failure in Test matches but success elsewhere continued during the 1934–35 tour of the West Indies. In all first-class cricket he scored 789 runs, averaging 56.35, with an innings of 281 not out the highest of his three centuries. The four-Test series, which England lost 2–1, was another matter. &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that the West Indian pace attack, considered the best in the world by Bob Wyatt, unsettled the English batsmen; the home bowlers were accused of intimidation by some of the England side. Hammond had a top score of 47 and scored 175 runs at an average of 25.00. He played well in difficult batting conditions, which he believed were among the worst he ever faced, in the first Test. In the first innings he scored 43, before dominating the bowlers at a critical time in his unbeaten 29 in the second innings, winning the match with a six.

Hammond&#x27;s health remained poor at the start of the 1935 season. He developed septic tonsillitis which made it difficult for him to breathe, eat and sleep, and ultimately required an operation to remove his tonsils in early 1936. Hammond&#x27;s form was indifferent and he believed it was his worst season. In first-class matches, he scored 2,616 runs (average 49.35) and took 60 wickets (average 27.26). He became the ninth player to reach 100 first-class centuries, emerging from a run of bad form against Somerset. Long a regular in the side, for the first time he captained the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord&#x27;s. In the five-Test series against South Africa, a run of low scores again brought press speculation about his place in the national side. He did not pass fifty until the third Test, when he scored 63 and 87 not out, ending a run of 22 innings without a fifty, in which time he averaged 23.47 over 14 Tests. Hammond made two more fifties in the last two Tests, although they were insufficient to prevent England from losing 1–0, their third successive series defeat. He finished the series with 389 runs at an average of 64.83, but remained unsatisfied with his form.

===Return to form===

As the 1936 season began, Hammond remained weak from the recent removal of his tonsils. Returning to cricket too soon, he was in poor form; he took a longer rest, which caused him to miss the first of three Tests against India. It was July before he felt fully well. In all first-class cricket that season, Hammond scored 2,107 runs, averaging 56.94, and took 41 wickets. In county cricket, Gloucestershire appointed a new captain, Dallas Page. Hammond had been offered the joint captaincy with Bev Lyon, conditional on his becoming assistant secretary at the club to enable him to play as an amateur, but declined for financial reasons. Hammond returned to the England side for the second Test, making 167, his first century in 28 innings, scoring quickly throughout. He was praised by &quot;Wisden&quot; for his control. Hammond continued to score heavily in the third Test, making 217 after being dropped twice early on. His highest score came in the last county match of the season, at Gloucestershire, which was Tom Goddard&#x27;s benefit match. A difficult pitch meant that wickets tumbled on the first day, prompting fears of an early finish which would possibly lose money for Goddard. Hammond batted all of the second day, ensuring the match lasted the full three days, to score 317 out of a total of 485.

Selected for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1936–37 under the captaincy of Gubby Allen, Hammond was again part of the tour selection committee. He was successful with bat and ball, scoring 1,206 runs (average 67.00) and taking 21 wickets (average 24.57) in all first-class matches in Australia (he played two more in New Zealand at the conclusion of the tour). In Tests, Hammond scored 468 runs at an average of 58.50 and took 12 wickets at an average of 25.08. His tour began with four consecutive first-class hundreds against the state teams, but &quot;Wisden&quot; reported that he never recaptured this form during the remainder of the tour, owing to the bowling of Bill O&#x27;Reilly. Hammond could not overcome O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s use of slow leg theory in the later Tests which restricted scoring. England won the first two Tests, although Hammond did not contribute in the first, making a first ball duck. In the second he scored an unbeaten 231, then took three for 29 with the ball in Australia&#x27;s second innings, during a period when the other bowlers lost control. From this point, his contributions fell away, although he believed that the best innings of his life, on one of the most difficult pitches he ever confronted, was his 32 in the third Test. Neville Cardus, who saw it, described it as remarkable. However, his free-scoring 51 in the second innings was not enough to prevent defeat in the face of an unrealistic target. In the fourth Test, Hammond took five for 57 in Australia&#x27;s second innings, but his dismissal on the final morning by Fleetwood-Smith ensured that Australia won the match to level the series. One of Hammond&#x27;s teammates opined that Bradman would not have been dismissed as easily in a similar situation. In the decisive final Test, he was restricted by O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s leg theory attack and failed in the first innings. His 56 in the second innings was not enough to prevent Australia&#x27;s third win in succession to take the Ashes 3–2.

In the 1937 season, Hammond scored 3,252 runs at an average of 65.04, passing 3,000 runs a second time, and taking 48 wickets. In the three Tests against New Zealand, he passed the previous record number of England appearances, overtaking Frank Woolley&#x27;s 64 Tests. While scoring 140 in the first Test, he passed the total number of runs scored by Jack Hobbs to become the leading run scorer in Tests, a record he held until it was broken by Colin Cowdrey in December 1970. This innings was his only score above fifty in the series, in which he scored 204 runs (average 51). At the end of the season, in November 1937, it was announced that he had accepted a job, joining the Marsham Tyres board of directors, meaning he would play as an amateur in the future. This led to immediate speculation that he would be made captain of England in the 1938 Ashes series. The chairman of selectors, Plum Warner, later wrote that there was never any doubt from then that Hammond would be captain.

==Amateur cricketer==

===England captain===
In the 1938 season, his first as an amateur, Hammond scored 3,011 runs at an average of 75.27. During the season, he was elected to life membership of Gloucestershire and membership of the M.C.C., which barred professionals. He captained the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord&#x27;s—having previously led the Players, he is the only person to skipper both teams. Early in the season, he led England in a Test trial before, as expected, being given the role full-time against Australia. His leadership during the series, which was drawn 1–1, won him praise. He was criticised, however, for his handling of bowlers, specifically for not giving enough work to spinners Hedley Verity in the first Test or Doug Wright in the fourth. In the second Test, he scored 240, briefly a record for an England batsman playing at home, to rescue the side from a poor start. This innings was lauded by observers including Warner, Bradman and Cardus, and &quot;The Times&quot; correspondent pronounced it one of the best ever. The match, like the first, was drawn and with the third Test completely washed out by rain, the crucial match proved to be the fourth. In a low-scoring game, Hammond scored 76, holding England&#x27;s first innings together. In the second innings, however, he made a first-ball duck; an English batting collapse allowed Australia to win the match and retain the Ashes. England had some consolation with a massive victory in the final Test; following Hammond&#x27;s instructions to be cautious, the side slowly amassed a record total of 903 for seven, with Hutton beating Hammond&#x27;s Test record innings by scoring 364. Hammond scored 59, giving him 403 runs at an average of 67.16 in the series.

In the 1938–39 season, Hammond captained the M.C.C. tour of South Africa in a five-match series. &quot;Wisden&quot; criticised both sides for slow play, and the almanack&#x27;s correspondent felt Hammond was reluctant to try to force a win. In general, though, judgements on his captaincy were positive; his teammates and opponents believed he had firm control of the side and E. W. Swanton complimented his tactics. In the Tests, he used the cautious batting method which had been successful in Australia. He scored three Test centuries, making 181 after a shaky start in the second Test, a quick 120 in the third and 140 in the fifth. England won the third match, the only one in the series with a result, and Hammond was praised for his use of bowlers. The final match, in which Hammond lost the toss, having previously won it eight consecutive times, was drawn after ten days&#x27; play. In the fourth innings, England faced a victory target of 696. Hammond was credited with nearly forcing a remarkable win, first by promoting Bill Edrich, who had failed thus far in the series but scored 219, and then by playing himself what &quot;Wisden&quot; described as &quot;one of the finest innings of his career&quot; before rain forced the match to be abandoned. Hammond also tallied two fifties in the series to score 609 runs in total, at an average of 87.00. In all first-class tour matches, he scored 1,025 runs (average 60.29). While on tour, he met Sybil Ness-Harvey, who was to become his second wife.

Appointed as Gloucestershire captain for the 1939 season, Hammond led the team to third in the County Championship and recorded a rare double victory over Yorkshire. While &quot;Wisden&quot; commended his adventurous style of leadership, others such as Basil Allen, his predecessor as captain, did not approve; their main criticism was his failure to encourage his players. In first-class cricket, he scored 2,479 runs at an average of 63.56. He placed at the top of the first-class averages for the seventh successive season, although some critics detected a decline in his abilities. While he led England to a 1–0 series victory over West Indies in three Tests, &quot;Wisden&quot; reported some criticism of his captaincy. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said that &quot;Hammond does not rank among the more imaginative England captains&quot;, although he concluded by defending Hammond as &quot;experienced and sound&quot;. In the second match, he took his 100th catch in Tests, and in the third, he scored 138, his final Test century. In the series, Hammond scored 279 runs (average 55.80). The impending war overshadowed much of the season; throughout the Tests, Hammond made public appeals for citizens to join the armed forces. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the services and was commissioned as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) in October 1939.

===Career in the war===
Hammond was posted to a training wing of the Royal Air Force (RAF) at Hastings in Sussex before he moved with his unit to Torquay. He had mainly administrative duties, including instructing recruits, for whom he made life hard. He played some games of cricket in 1940 for various teams before being posted to Cairo in December. His responsibilities in Egypt included organising, promoting and playing in cricket matches. Posted there until 1943, he was promoted to flight lieutenant and then to squadron leader. While Hammond may have helped to raise morale, Cairo was an easy posting during the war and he was not involved directly in combat. He also spent much time in South Africa, where he played cricket and was reunited with Sybil Ness-Harvey. At the beginning of 1944, Hammond was posted back to England, where he lectured and drilled cadets. Playing as captain in many one-day cricket matches, he was praised by &quot;Wisden&quot; for encouraging exciting contests. Others applauded his batting, including his hitting of many sixes, fitting the games&#x27; relaxed atmosphere. In December 1944, Hammond, suffering from fibrositis, was discharged from the RAFVR on health grounds and returned to work at Marsham Tyres. Once the war ended in Europe in May 1945, several first-class matches were organised. Hammond played in six, scoring 592 runs at an average of 59.20 with two centuries. In a match for an England team against the Dominions at Lord&#x27;s, he made a century in each innings, becoming the first man to do this seven times.

===End of career===
During 1946, the first full season after the war, Hammond played only 26 innings but scored 1,783 runs at an average of 84.90, topping the first-class averages for the eighth time in succession—still an English record as of 2015. At times, he began to show technical weaknesses. Captaining England to a 1–0 victory in a three-Test series against India, he scored one fifty, making 119 runs at an average of 39.66. He batted fifth in the order in the final match, as he would in four of his five remaining Tests. Gloucestershire fell to fifth in the County Championship, and Hammond, after enthusiastically making the team very competitive at the start of the season, became increasingly affected by pain, particularly in damp weather. As captain, he could be irritable and consciously created remoteness and division.

Remaining captain of England, Hammond led the M.C.C. side which toured Australia in 1946–47. The visit was unsuccessful as England lost the five-match Test series 3–0. According to &quot;Wisden&quot;, Hammond&#x27;s inability to make large scores was one of the reasons for the failure. Nor was he a success as captain. He was criticised for his field placement and people at home wondered if he had lost control of the team. While he suffered some ill luck, &quot;Wisden&quot; said that he &quot;was not the same inspiring leader as at home against Australia in 1938&quot;. Other journalists noted that he did not consult his players, one of whom later commented that he showed little imagination in his use of bowlers. Hammond approached the tour as an exercise in goodwill, promising his men an enjoyable time. It was noted that Bradman, the Australian captain, took a more competitive attitude towards the series. Team spirit was good on the outward journey, but Hammond&#x27;s forthcoming divorce and other domestic concerns caused him to become isolated from the players and increasingly moody. He had poor relations with the press, who were very critical of his captaincy and reporting details of the dissolution of his marriage. As the tour progressed, he lost his dynamism as a leader, gave poor advice to the batsmen and made poor selections for the team.

As a batsman, Hammond started the tour well, scoring 208 in an early game, but lost form once the Tests began. One of the turning points of the series was a disputed catch in the first Test. Bradman, who looked in poor form and uncertain to continue his cricket career for much longer, had reached 28 when the English team believed he had edged the ball to Jack Ikin at slip. Bradman, as was his entitlement, waited for the umpire&#x27;s decision instead of leaving the field. The fielders were certain that he was out, but the umpire said he was not, believing the ball had bounced before it was caught; opinion among other participants and spectators was divided. However, Hammond was extremely angry, saying loudly, either to Bradman or the umpires, &quot;a fine fucking way to start a series&quot;. Afterwards, relations between Hammond and Bradman deteriorated and there was a coldness between them. Bradman went on to score 187 and Australia won the match and, ultimately, the series. In that first Test, Hammond played two good innings on a very difficult wicket, but in the series, he did not pass fifty, scoring 168 runs at an average of 21.00 before missing the final Test. In all first-class cricket, he scored 633 runs (average 45.21). He suffered increasing pain from fibrositis throughout the series, and later admitted that he felt close to a breakdown. Hammond played his last Test in New Zealand at the end of the tour, scoring 79 in his final innings. He ended his career with 7,249 Test runs at an average of 58.46. His 22 centuries remained an English record until surpassed by Alastair Cook in December 2012.

Hammond decided to retire from all cricket after the tour, not returning for Gloucestershire in 1947. Within 24 hours of his arrival back in England, he married Sybil Ness-Harvey. He played only two more first-class games. He scored an unbeaten 92 for the M.C.C. against Ireland in 1950. To help boost a Gloucestershire membership drive, he joined his former side for a match the following year. Although given an excellent reception by the crowd, his tired appearance and struggle to score seven runs before being dismissed embarrassed many of those present. In all first-class cricket, Hammond scored 50,551 runs at an average of 56.10 with 167 centuries. He remains seventh on the list of highest run scorers in first-class cricket and has the third highest number of centuries, as of 2015.

==Style and technique==
&quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; obituary described Hammond as one of the top four batsmen who had ever played, calling him &quot;a most exciting cricketer. ... The instant he walked out of a pavilion, white-spotted blue handkerchief showing from his right pocket, bat tucked underarm, cap at a hint of an angle, he was identifiable as a thoroughbred.&quot; Throughout the 1930s, the public and critics regarded Hammond as England&#x27;s best batsman, succeeding Jack Hobbs, and next to Bradman, the best in the world (although George Headley also had a claim). Among English batsmen, only Herbert Sutcliffe, with a higher Test average, was similarly successful. According to Alan Gibson, however, although Sutcliffe was dependable in a crisis, &quot;his batting never gave quite the same sense of majesty and excitement that Hammond&#x27;s did&quot;. More recently, Hammond was one of the inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, launched in January 2009, and was selected by a jury of cricket journalists as a member of England&#x27;s all-time XI in August 2009.

Balanced and still at the crease, Hammond was known for the power and beauty of his driving through the off side, although he could play any shot. A very attacking player early in his career, he later became more defensive, playing more frequently off the back foot and abandoning the hook shot as too risky. He was particularly effective on difficult wickets, scoring runs where others struggled to survive. Many of his contemporaries believed that he was the finest off-side player in the history of cricket. In the words of Patrick Murphy, fellow players considered him &quot;on a different plane—majestic, assured, poised, a devastating amalgam of the physical and mental attributes that make up a great batsman.&quot; County bowlers who played against him considered it an achievement merely to prevent him scoring runs.

However, Australian bowlers such as O&#x27;Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he had fewer effective leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His teammate Charlie Barnett said that he did not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.

His bowling was smooth and effortless, with a classical action. He could bowl fast, but more often bowled at fast-medium pace. He could make the ball swing in humid weather, and deliver off-spin when conditions were suitable. However, Hammond was reluctant to bowl, particularly for Gloucestershire. Bill Bowes believed that he was a very good bowler who would not take it seriously. In his obituary, &quot;Wisden&quot; said that &quot;at slip he had no superior. He stood all but motionless, moved late but with uncanny speed, never needing to stretch or strain but plucking the ball from the air like an apple from a tree.&quot; He was also able to field further away from the batsmen than was the norm, particularly in his younger days, as he could chase the ball quickly and had a very good throwing arm.

==Personal life==

===Personality===
Hammond struck his contemporaries as a sad figure, a loner with few friends in cricket. He rarely encouraged young players or gave out praise. He liked to mix with middle-class people, spending money he did not really have, leading to accusations of snobbery. Teammates regarded him as moody, private and uncommunicative. Often silent in the company of others, he could be arrogant and unfriendly. Charlie Barnett and Charles Dacre, two of his Gloucestershire teammates, came almost to hate him. Dacre often played in a reckless way of which Hammond disapproved; Hammond, in turn, may have been jealous of him. Hammond once tried hard to injure Dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper. Barnett began as a close friend but fell out over Hammond&#x27;s treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in Barnett&#x27;s benefit match. Other players who were involved in disputes with Hammond included Denis Compton, whose cavalier approach Hammond disliked, and Learie Constantine, who believed Hammond insulted him in the West Indies in 1925, although the two later made peace. Hammond&#x27;s ultimate rivalry was with Bradman, who overshadowed him throughout his career, and with whom he developed an increasing obsession. It was not enough for Hammond to be the second-best batsman in the world, and he disliked the constant comparisons made between them in Bradman&#x27;s favour. He felt not only that he had to do well, but also that he had to score more than Bradman.

===Marriage===
David Foot quotes an unnamed cricketer saying that the two ruling passions of Hammond&#x27;s life &quot;were his cricket bat and his genitals&quot;. His strong desire for women was noticed by teammates from early in his career. Foot believes that Hammond had sexual relationships with many women, sometimes several contemporaneously, before and during his first marriage, some of which led to marriage proposals. This was widely known in cricket circles, prompting disapproval from figures such as Barnett.

In 1929, Hammond married Dorothy Lister, the daughter of a Yorkshire textile merchant, in a highly publicised ceremony at a parish church in Bingley. They met at a cricket match in 1927 but spent little time together before the wedding, having little in common. When married, they rarely communicated or got on well. Acquaintances believed Hammond treated her badly, particularly once her father lost nearly everything in the Depression, causing them financial worry. She remained loyal, but their relations gradually broke down, even after she sailed to South Africa, joining Hammond on tour in 1939 in an attempt to save the marriage. By that time, he was already seeing his future second wife, Sybil Ness-Harvey, a former beauty queen whom he had met while on tour.

During the war, Hammond spent much of his leave with Ness-Harvey in South Africa. In 1945, she followed him back to England, but did not like it. When Hammond left to tour Australia in 1946–47, Ness-Harvey remained behind with his mother, with whom she did not get along. This was one of the factors which led to Hammond&#x27;s problems on the tour. His divorce went through, and on his return, he and Sybil married at Kingston Register Office. She had already changed her name to Hammond by deed poll. Their first child, Roger, was born in 1948. Carolyn was born in 1950 and Valerie was born in 1952.

===Business===
Hammond was involved with several businesses. In 1933, to ease his financial concerns, he took a job with the Cater Motor Company. He was used as a sales promotions manager, which mainly involved publicity and meeting customers, although he also test-drove cars. Taking a job with Marsham Tyres in 1937 enabled him to become an amateur cricketer. He joined the board of directors and was again used for publicity, but he was never a hard worker or determined salesman. Returning to Marsham&#x27;s after he was discharged from the RAF in 1944, he supplemented his income by working as a journalist. He wrote for &quot;The Star&quot; during the 1948 Test series and penned three books with the assistance of a ghostwriter.

In 1951, Hammond resigned from Marsham&#x27;s; his wife was homesick, leading Hammond to plan a business in South Africa with a partner. However, after moving to Durban, they realised they had insufficient money. He took a job with Denham Motors in Durban, where he was forced to work much harder than in England. He lost his job in 1959 when the firm went out of business, and the Hammond family again found themselves in financial trouble.

===Final years===
At the end of 1959, Hammond was offered a job as a sports administrator at University of Natal with the aim of developing its sports facilities. In February 1960, he was involved in a serious car crash. It was uncertain whether he would survive, but he pulled through. Three months after the accident, he returned to work and became involved with coaching. In 1962, Hammond visited England as part of a drive to recruit new members for Gloucestershire. He showed some interest in taking over a pub, but nothing came of it. On the M.C.C. tour of South Africa in 1964–65, he joined the England dressing room, becoming popular with the players. On 1 July 1965, he had a heart attack and died after a few hours&#x27; illness.

He scored his final Test century against the West Indies at The Oval in London on 19 August 1939, making a score of 138, and his final Test match was against New Zealand at Lancaster Park in Christchurch on 21 March 1947.

He played in a total of 85 Test matches, and held the record for the most runs in Test cricket at the time, with 7,249 runs. Hammond&#x27;s highest score in Test cricket was 336 not out, scored against New Zealand at Eden Park, Auckland on 31 March 1933, at the time the highest score in an innings by a batsman until it was surpassed by Len Hutton&#x27;s 364 in 1938.

<doc id="585706" wikidata="Q676192" url="?curid=585706" title="Talking Book">
<text>Talking Book is the fifteenth studio album by American singer, songwriter, and musician Stevie Wonder, released on October 27, 1972, by Tamla, a subsidiary of Motown Records. This album and &quot;Music of My Mind&quot;, released earlier the same year, are generally considered to mark the start of Wonder&#x27;s &quot;classic period&quot;. The sound of the album is sharply defined by Wonder&#x27;s use of keyboards and synthesizers.

The album peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart and finished at number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s year-end chart for 1973. &quot;Superstition&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot Soul Singles charts, and &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot; hit number one on the Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts. &quot;Talking Book&quot; earned Wonder his first Grammy Award, with &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot; winning Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 16th Grammy Awards; &quot;Superstition&quot; also won Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best R&amp;B Song. Often included in lists of the greatest albums of all time, &quot;Talking Book&quot; was voted number 322 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000), and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 59 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2020. It was the first album purchased by former US president Barack Obama.

==Recording==

Much of the material on &quot;Talking Book&quot; was recorded at the same time as that on &quot;Music of My Mind&quot;. As the album saw Wonder enjoying more artistic freedom from Motown and relying less on Motown&#x27;s head Berry Gordy for musical direction and expression, it is often seen as the beginning of his transition from a youthful prodigy into an independent and experimental artist. Speaking of the album in 2000, Wonder said: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t so much that I wanted to say anything except where I wanted to just express various many things that I felt—the political point of view that I have, the social point of view that I have, the passions, emotion and love that I felt, compassion, the fun of love that I felt, the whole thing in the beginning with a joyful love and then the pain of love.&quot;

The sound of the album is sharply defined by Wonder&#x27;s keyboard work, especially synthesizers. While the synthesizers give a funky edge to tracks like &quot;Maybe Your Baby&quot;, the Hohner Clavinet embellishments on &quot;Big Brother&quot; evoke a six-string acoustic guitar, and the note-bending harmonica work on several tracks touches on some folk and blues influences. Wonder&#x27;s use of the Clavinet Model C on &quot;Superstition&quot; is widely regarded as one of the definitive tracks featuring the instrument. Wonder played the majority of the instruments on the album himself, but he received some support from such guest musicians as Jeff Beck, Ray Parker Jr., David Sanborn, and Buzz Feiten.

Robert Margouleff and Malcolm Cecil collaborated with Wonder on four of his &quot;classic&quot; albums: &quot;Music of My Mind&quot;, &quot;Talking Book&quot;, &quot;Innervisions&quot; and &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot;, as well as several albums by the Isley Brothers and others. Their unusual production technique of using multiple layers of instruments like the Clavinet, Fender Rhodes electric piano, and Arp and Moog synthesizers, rather than the more-typical string orchestra, helped to give &quot;Talking Book&quot; and these other three albums their distinctive sound.

==Packaging and title==
The album&#x27;s cover photo, taken by Robert Margouleff in Los Angeles, features Wonder with his hair in cornrows, wearing jewelry, and dressed in African-style robes, in a &quot;quasi-Biblical desert landscape&quot;. The inner photo of the gatefold sleeve shows Wonder in silhouette against a dramatic landscape sunrise.

The packaging of original pressings of the album incorporated both the album&#x27;s title and Wonder&#x27;s name embossed in braille (as well as being printed in English), along with a message that was only embossed in braille until the 2000 release of the album. The message reads:

Margouleff later recalled that it had been difficult to get Wonder to choose which songs to put on the album, because there were so many. Associate producer Malcolm Cecil said, &quot;Steve, you know, this is an album. It&#x27;s not a talking book... Oh, I think you should call this album &quot;Talking Book&quot;&quot; and Wonder agreed.

==Reception==
Released after Wonder toured with The Rolling Stones in 1972, &quot;Talking Book&quot; became a major hit, peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart in February 1973, and became the first album by Wonder to reach the top of the Top R&amp;B Albums chart, where it remained for three weeks. The popular appeal of the recording helped destroy the myth that R&amp;B artists were incapable of creating music that could be appreciated by rock audiences, and marked a unique period for R&amp;B artists (especially Motown artists). Wonder won three awards for &quot;Talking Book&quot; at the 1974 Grammys: Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;, and both Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best R&amp;B Song for &quot;Superstition&quot;. Incidentally, at the same ceremony, Wonder&#x27;s next album, &quot;Innervisions&quot;, won Album of the Year, and &quot;Talking Book&quot;″s associate producers, Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff, won the Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical award for their work on that album.
Reviewing the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; at the time of its release, Vince Aletti called &quot;Talking Book&quot; &quot;ambitious&quot; and &quot;richly-textured&quot;, writing that &quot;even at its dreamiest, the music has a glowing vibrancy&quot; and makes for an altogether &quot;exceptional, exciting album, the work of a now quite matured genius&quot;. Writing a few years later in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; about Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; (1976), Robert Christgau said that &quot;&quot;Talking Book&quot; is closer to a perfect album&quot;, as &quot;a more complex and satisfying delight—a delight that combines the freewheeling energy of Dylan and the Stones with the softer accessibility of a Carole King—is provided by an artist with the ambition to ride his own considerable momentum and the talent to do more than just hang on while doing so.&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Christgau said the album found Wonder taking artistic control and breaking through, continuing his &quot;wild multi-voice experiments&quot; and writing better ballads without losing &quot;his endearing natural bathos&quot;; Christgau also highlighted &quot;Superstition&quot; as a translation of Wonder&#x27;s &quot;way of knowledge into hard-headed, hard-rocking political analysis&quot;. J. D. Considine, in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), called the album &quot;a pop tour de force&quot;.

&quot;Talking Book&quot; has appeared in professional rankings of the greatest albums of all time. It was voted number 322 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 90 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; it maintained that ranking on the 2012 version of the list, and was number 59 on the 2020 edition.

<text>Vascular surgery is a surgical subspecialty in which vascular diseases involving the arteries, veins, or lymphatic vessels, are managed by medical therapy, minimally-invasive catheter procedures and surgical reconstruction. The specialty evolved from general and cardiovascular surgery where it refined the management of just the vessels, no longer treating the heart or other organs. Modern vascular surgery includes open surgery techniques, endovascular (minimally invasive) techniques and medical management of vascular diseases - unlike the parent specialities. The vascular surgeon is trained in the diagnosis and management of diseases affecting all parts of the vascular system excluding the coronaries and intracranial vasculature. Vascular surgeons also are called to assist other physicians to carry out surgery near vessels, or to salvage vascular injuries that include hemorrhage control, dissection, occlusion or simply for safe exposure of vascular structures.

==History==
Early leaders of the field included Russian surgeon Nikolai Korotkov, noted for developing early surgical techniques, American interventional radiologist Charles Theodore Dotter who is credited with inventing minimally invasive angioplasty (1964), and Australian Robert Paton, who helped the field achieve recognition as a specialty. Edwin Wylie of San Francisco was one of the early American pioneers who developed and fostered advanced training in vascular surgery and pushed for its recognition as a specialty in the United States in the 1970s. The most notable historic figure in vascular surgery is the 1912 Nobel Prize winning surgeon, Alexis Carrel for his techniques used to suture vessels.

===Evolution===

The specialty continues to be based on operative arterial and venous surgery but since the early 1990s has evolved greatly. There is now considerable emphasis on minimally invasive alternatives to surgery. The field was originally pioneered by interventional radiologists like Dr. Charles Dotter, who invented angioplasty using serial dilatation of vessels.

The surgeon Dr. Thomas J. Fogarty invented a balloon catheter, designed to remove clots from occluded vessels, which was used as the eventual model to do endovascular angioplasty. Further development of the field has occurred via joint efforts between interventional radiology, vascular surgery, and interventional cardiology. This area of vascular surgery is called Endovascular Surgery or Interventional Vascular Radiology, a term that some in the specialty append to their primary qualification as Vascular Surgeon. Endovascular and endovenous procedures (e.g., EVAR) can now form the bulk of a vascular surgeon&#x27;s practice.

The treatment of the aorta, the body&#x27;s largest artery, dates back to Greek surgeon Antyllus, who first performed surgeries for various aneurysms in the second century AD. Modern treatment of aortic diseases stems from development and advancements from Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley. In 1955, DeBakey and Cooley performed the first replacement of a thoracic aneurysm with a homograft. In 1958, they began using the Dacron graft, resulting in a revolution for surgeons in the repair of aortic aneurysms. He also was first to perform cardiopulmonary bypass to repair the ascending aorta, using antegrade perfusion of the brachiocephalic artery.

Dr. Ted Diethrich, one of Dr. DeBakey&#x27;s associates, went on to pioneer many of the minimally invasive techniques that later became hallmarks of endovascular surgery. Dietrich later founded the Arizona Heart Hospital in 1998 and served as its medical director from 1998 to 2010. In 2000, Diethrich performed the first endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Dietrich trained several future leaders in the field of endovascular surgery at the Arizona Heart Hospital including Venkatesh Ramaiah, MD who succeeded him as medical director of the institution in 2010.

The development of endovascular surgery has been accompanied by a gradual separation of vascular surgery from its origin in general surgery. Most vascular surgeons would now confine their practice to vascular surgery and, similarly, general surgeons would not be trained or practise the larger vascular surgery operations or most endovascular procedures. More recently, professional vascular surgery societies and their training program have formally separated vascular surgery into a separate specialty with its own training program, meetings and accreditation. Notable societies are Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), USA; Australia and New Zealand Society of Vascular Surgeons (ANZSVS). Local societies also exist (e.g., New South Wales Vascular and Melbourne Vascular Surgical Association (MVSA)). Larger societies of surgery actively separate and encourage specialty surgical societies under their umbrella (e.g., Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS)).

===Currently===
Arterial and venous disease treatment by angiography, stenting, and non-operative varicose vein treatment sclerotherapy, endovenous laser treatment have largely replaced major surgery in many first world countries. These procedures provide reasonable outcomes that are comparable to surgery with the advantage of short hospital stay (day or overnight for most cases) with lower morbidity and mortality rates. Historically performed by interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons have become increasingly proficient with endovascular methods. The durability of endovascular arterial procedures is generally good, especially when viewed in the context of their common clinical usage i.e. arterial disease occurring in elderly patients and usually associated with concurrent significant patient comorbidities especially ischemic heart disease. The cost savings from shorter hospital stays and less morbidity are considerable but are somewhat balanced by the high cost of imaging equipment, construction and staffing of dedicated procedural suites, and of the implant devices themselves.
The benefits for younger patients and in venous disease are less persuasive but there are strong trends towards nonoperative treatment options driven by patient preference, health insurance company costs, trial demonstrating comparable efficacy at least in the medium term.

A recent trend in the United States is the stand-alone day angiography facility associated with a private vascular surgery clinic, thus allowing treatment of most arterial endovascular cases conveniently and possibly with lesser overall community cost. Similar non-hospital treatment facilities for non-operative vein treatment have existed for some years and are now widespread in many countries.

NHS England conducted a review of all 70 vascular surgery sites across England in 2018 as part of its Getting It Right First Time programme. The review specified that vascular hubs should perform at least 60 abdominal aortic aneurysm procedures and 40 carotid endarterectomies a year. 12 trusts missed both targets and many more missed one of them. A programme of concentrating vascular surgery in fewer centres is proceeding.

Vascular surgery encompasses surgery of the aorta, carotid arteries, and lower extremities, including the iliac, femoral, vascular trauma and tibial arteries. Vascular surgery also involves surgery of veins, for conditions such as May–Thurner syndrome and for varicose veins. In some regions, vascular surgery also includes dialysis access surgery and transplant surgery.

==Management of arterial diseases==
The management of arterial pathology excluding coronary and intracranial disease is within the scope of vascular surgeons. Disease states generally arise from narrowing of the arterial system known as stenosis or abnormal dilation referred to as an aneurysm. There are multiple mechanisms by which the arterial lumen can narrow, the most common of which is atherosclerosis. Symptomatic stenosis may also result from a complication of arterial dissection. Other less common causes of stenosis include fibromuscular dysplasia, radiation induced fibrosis or cystic adventitial disease. Dilation of an artery which retains histologic layers is called an aneurysm. An aneurysms can be fusiform (concentric dilation), saccular (outpouching) or a combination of the two. Arterial dilation which does not contain three histologic layers is considered a pseudoaneurysm. Additionally, there are a number of congenital vascular anomalies which lead to symptomatic disease that are managed by the vascular surgeon, a few of which include aberrant subclavian artery, popliteal artery entrapment syndrome or persistent sciatic artery. Vascular surgeons treat arterial diseases with a range of therapies including lifestyle modification, medications, endovascular therapy and surgery.

===Aneurysms===

====Aortic aneurysms====
;Abdominal
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) refers to aneurysmal dilation of the aorta confined to the abdominal cavity. Most commonly, aneurysms are asymptomatic and located in the infrarenal position. Often, they are discovered incidentally or on screening exams in patients with risk factors such as a history of smoking. Patients with aneurysms which have a diameter less than 5 cm are at &lt;1% rupture risk per year. When the aneurysm meets size criteria it can be treated with aortic replacement or EVAR.

;Thoracic
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are contained in the chest. Aneurysms of the descending aorta can often be treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair or TEVAR. Treating aneurysms which involve the ascending aorta are generally within the scope of cardiac surgeons, but upcoming endovascular technology may allow for a more minimally invasive approach in some patients.

;Thoracoabdominal
Thoroacoabdominal aneurysms are those which span the chest and abdominal cavities. The Crawford classification was developed and describes five types of thoracoabdominal aneurysms.

====Other arterial aneurysms====
In addition to treating aneurysms which arise from the aorta, vascular surgeons also treat aneurysms elsewhere in the body.

;Visceral arteries
Visceral artery aneurysms include those isolated to the renal artery, splenic artery, celiac artery, and hepatic artery. Of these, data shows that splenic artery aneurysms are the most common.

Indications for repair differ slightly between arteries. For instance, current guidelines recommend repair of renal and splenic artery aneurysms greater than 3 cm, and those of any size in women of childbearing age; whereas celiac and hepatic artery aneurysms are indicated for repair when their size is greater than 2 cm. This is in contrast to superior mesenteric artery aneurysms which should be repaired regardless of size when they are discovered.

;Popliteal artery
A popliteal artery aneurysm is an arterial aneurysm localized in the popliteal artery which courses behind the knee. Unlike aneurysms located in the abdomen, popliteal artery aneurysm rarely present with rupture but rather with symptoms of acute limb ischemia due to embolization of thrombus. Thus, when a patient presents with an asymptomatic popliteal aneurysm that is greater than 2 cm in diameter a vascular surgeon are able to offer vascular bypass or endovascular exclusion depending on several factors.

===Arterial dissections===
The artery wall is composed of three concentric layers: the intima, media and adventitia. In general, an arterial dissection is a tear in the innermost layer of the arterial wall that makes a separation which allows blood to flow, and collect, between the layers. Arterial dissections include: an aortic dissection (aorta), a coronary artery dissection (coronary artery), two types of cervical artery dissection involving one of the arteries in the neck – a carotid artery dissection (carotid artery), and a vertebral artery dissection (vertebral artery), a pulmonary artery dissection is an extremely rare condition as a complication of chronic pulmonary hypertension.

Whereas cardiac surgeons are usually in charge of managing type A dissections, type B dissections are typically managed by vascular surgeons. The most common risk factor for type B aortic dissection is hypertension. The first line treatment for type B aortic dissection is aimed at reducing both heart rate and blood pressure and is referred to as anti-impulse therapy.
Should initial medical management fail or there is the involvement of a major branch of the aorta, vascular surgery may be needed for these type B dissections. Treatment may include thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with or without extra-anatomic bypass such as carotid-carotid bypass, carotid-subclavian bypass, or subclavian-carotid transposition.

====Visceral artery dissection====
Visceral artery dissections are arterial dissections involving the superior mesenteric artery, celiac artery, renal arteries, hepatic artery and others. When they are an extension of an aortic dissection, this condition is managed simultaneously with aortic treatment. In isolation, visceral artery dissections are discovered incidentally in up to a third of patients and in these cases may be managed medically by a vascular surgeon. In cases where the dissection results in organ damage it is generally accepted by vascular surgeons that surgery is necessary. Surgical management strategies depend on the associated complications, surgical ability and patient preference.

===Mesenteric ischemia===
Mesenteric ischemia results from the acute or chronic obstruction of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The SMA arises from the abdominal aorta and usually supplies blood from the distal duodenum through two-thirds of the transverse colon and the pancreas.

====Chronic mesenteric ischemia====
The symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia can be classified as abdominal angina which is abdominal pain which occurs a fixed period of time after eating. Due to this, patient&#x27;s may avoid eating, resulting in unintended weight loss. The first surgical treatment is thought to be performed by R.S. Shaw and described in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1958. The procedure Shaw described is referred to as mesenteric endarterectomy. Since then, many advances in treatment have been made in minimally invasive, endovascular techniques including angioplasty and stenting.

====Acute mesenteric ischemia====
Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) results from the sudden occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery.

===Renovascular hypertension===
The renal arteries supply oxygenated blood to the kidneys. The kidneys serve to filter the flood and control blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system. One cause of resistant hypertension is atherosclerotic disease in the renal arteries and is generally referred to as renovascular hypertension. If renovascular hypertension is diagnosed and maximal medical fails to control high blood pressure, the vascular surgeon may offer surgical treatment, either endovascular or open surgical reconstruction.

===Cerebrovascular disease===
Vascular surgeons are responsible for treating extracranial cerebrovascular disease as well as the interpretation of non-invasive vascular imaging relating to extracranial and intracranial circulation such as carotid ultrasonography and transcranial doppler. The most common of cerebrovascular conditions treated by vascular surgeons is carotid artery stenosis which is a narrowing of the carotid arteries and may be either clinically symptomatic or asymptomatic (silent). Carotid artery stenosis is caused by atherosclerosis whereby the buildup of atheromatous plaque inside the artery causes narrowing.

Symptoms of carotid artery stenosis can include transient ischemic attack or stroke. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis can be diagnosed with the aid of carotid duplex ultrasound which allows for the estimation of severity of narrowing as well as characterize the plaque. Treatment can include medical therapy, carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting.

The Society for Vascular Surgery publishes clinical practice guidelines for the management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Less common diseases involving cerebral circulation treated by vascular surgeons include vertebrobasilar insufficiency, subclavian steal syndrome, carotid artery dissection, vertebral artery dissection, carotid body tumor and carotid artery aneurysm among others.

===Peripheral arterial disease===
Peripheral artery disease PAD is the abnormal narrowing of the arteries which supply the limbs. Patients with this condition can present with intermittent claudication which is pain mainly in the calves and thighs while walking. If there is progression, a patient may also present with chronic limb threatening ischemia which encompasses pain at rest and non-healing wounds. Vascular surgeons are experts in the diagnosis, medical management, endovascular and open surgical treatment of PAD.

A vascular surgeon may diagnose PAD using a combination of history, physical exam and medical imaging. Medical imaging may include ankle-brachial index, doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography, among others. Treatments are individualized and may include medical therapy, endovascular intervention or open surgical options including angioplasty, stenting, atherectomy, endarterectomy and vascular bypass, among others.

==Management of venous diseases==
===Chronic venous disease===
Chronic venous insufficiency is the abnormal pooling of blood in the lower extremity venous system which can lead to reticular veins, varicose veins, chronic edema and inflammation among other things. Population data suggests that chronic venous insufficiency affects up to 40% of females and 17% of males. When chronic insufficiency leads to pain, swelling and skin changes it is referred to as chronic venous disease. Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is distinguished from post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in that CVI is primarily an issue of valvular incompetence of the superficial or deep veins whereas PTS may occur as a long-term complication of deep venous thrombosis.

The vascular surgeon has several modalities to treat lower extremity venous disease which including medical, interventional and surgical procedures. For instance, venous ulceration may be treated with Unna&#x27;s boots, superficial venous reflux with radiofrequency, laser ablation or vein stripping if indicated. When indicated, insufficiency in the deep veins may be treated with reconstruction of the venous valves with internal or external valvuloplasty.

===Varicose veins===

Lower extremity varicose veins is the condition in which the superficial veins become tortuous (snakelike) and dilated (enlarged) to greater than in the upright position. Incompetent or faulty valves are often present in these veins when investigated with duplex ultrasonography. Vascular treatments can include compression stockings, venous ablation or vein stripping, depending on specific patient presentation, severity of disease, among other things.

===Nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions===
Nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVL) include May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS) whereby there is compression of the left iliac venous outflow usually by the right iliac artery leading to left leg discomfort, pain, swelling and varicose veins. NIVL encompasses compression of the iliac veins on either the right or left side. Vascular surgeons may offer different treatment modalities depending on the patient presentation. Minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic options might include intravascular ultrasound, venography and iliac vein stenting whereas surgical management may be offered in refractory cases. Surgical management strategies involve reconstruction or bypass of the affected segment such as cross-pubic venous bypass, also known as the Palma procedure.

===Deep vein thrombosis===
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of thrombus in a deep vein. DVT is more likely to occur in the lower extremity than the upper extremity or jugular vein. When a DVT involves the pelvic and lower extremity veins it can sometimes be classified as an iliofemoral DVT. Some evidence to suggests that performing an intervention in these cases may be beneficial whereas other evidence does not. Overall, the data shows that there may be a reduction in the incidence in post-thrombotic syndrome in patients who undergo certain procedures for iliofemoral DVT but it is not without risks. A vascular surgeon may offer venogram, endovascular suction or mechanical thrombectomy and in some cases pharmacomechanical thrombectomy. Some lower extremity DVT can be severe enough to cause a condition called phlegmasia cerulea dolens or phlegmasia alba dolens and can be limb-threatening events. When phlegmasia is present, intervention is often warranted and may include venous thrombectomy.

===Post-thrombotic syndrome===
Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a medical condition that sometimes occurs as a long-term complication of DVT and is characterized by long term edema and skin changes following DVT. Presenting symptoms may include itchiness, pain, cramps and paresthesia. It is estimated that between 20% and 50% of patients will experience some degree of PTS. A treatment strategy for PTS may involve the use of compression stockings.

===Pulmonary embolism===
Surgical management of an acute pulmonary embolism (pulmonary thrombectomy) is uncommon and has largely been abandoned because of poor long-term outcomes. However, recently, it has gone through a resurgence with the revision of the surgical technique and is thought to benefit certain people. Chronic pulmonary embolism leading to pulmonary hypertension (known as &quot;chronic thromboembolic hypertension&quot;) is treated with a surgical procedure known as a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

==Compressive venopathies==
Compression of large veins by adjacent structures or masses may lead to distinct clinical syndromes including May–Thurner syndrome (MTS), nutcracker syndrome and superior vena cava syndrome to name a few. Treatment modalities include venography, intravascular ultrasound and venous stenting as well as more invasive open venous reconstruction and bypass.

==Management of hemodialysis access==
Patients with chronic kidney disease may have progression of disease which requires renal replacement therapy to filter their blood. One strategy for this therapy is hemodialysis, which is a procedure that involves filtering a patient&#x27;s blood to remove waste products and returning their blood back to them. One method which avoids repeated arterial trauma is to create an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The first procedure described for this purpose is named the Cimino fistula, after one of the surgeons who first had success with it. Vascular surgeons may create an AVF for a patient as well as undertake minimally invasive procedures to ensure the fistula remains patent.

==Management of vascular trauma==
One way that vascular trauma may be understood is by categorizing vascular injury by three criteria: mechanism of injury, anatomical site of injury and contextual circumstances. Mechanism of injury refers to etiology, e.g. iatrogenic, blunt, penetrating, blast injury, etc. Anatomical site functionally refers to whether there is compressible versus non-compressible hemorrhage, while contextual circumstances refers to injuries sustained in the civilian or military realm. Each context can be further broken down: military into combatant vs. noncombatant and civil into urban vs rural trauma. This categorization scheme is of both epidemiologic and clinical significance. For instance, arterial injury in military combatants currently occurs predominantly in males in their twenties who are exposed to improvised explosive devices or gunshot wounds; whereas in the civilian realm, one study conducted in the United States showed the most common mechanisms to include motor vehicle collisions, firearm injuries, stab wounds and falls from heights.

===Blunt thoracic aortic injury===
Advances in vascular surgery, specifically endovascular technologies, have led to a dramatic change in the operative approach to blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI). BTAI results from a high speed insult to the thorax such as a motor vehicle collision or a fall from a height. One widely-used classification scheme is based on the extent of injury to the anatomic layers of the aorta as seen with computed tomography angiography or intravascular ultrasound. Grade 1 BTAI are those which tear the aortic intima; grade 2 injuries refer to intramural hematoma; grade 3 injuries are pseudoaneurysm and are only contained by adventitial tissue; and grade 4 refer to free rupture of blood into the chest and surrounding tissue. When indicated, first line intervention involves TEVAR.

==Investigations==
===Major trials===
==Training==
Previously considered a field within general surgery, it is now considered a specialty in its own right. As a result, there are two pathways for training in the United States. Traditionally, a five-year general surgery residency is followed by a 1-2 year (typically 2 years) vascular surgery fellowship. An alternative path is to perform a five or six year vascular surgery residency. In many countries, Vascular surgeons can opt for additional training in cardiac surgery as well as post-residency.

Programs of training vary slightly between different regions of the world.

===NUTS codes prior to 31.12.2007===
Prior to 31.12.2007, the codes were as follows:

The &quot;National Areas of Sweden&quot; are 8 second level subdivisions (NUTS-2) of Sweden, created by the European Union for statistical purposes.

The 8 &quot;riksområden&quot; (Singular : Riksområde) includes the 21 counties of Sweden. Only Stockholm (SE01) corresponds simply to the homonymous county.

==Local administrative units==
Below the NUTS levels, the two LAU (Local Administrative Units) levels are:

&quot;The LAU codes of Sweden can be downloaded here:&quot; 

==NUTS 1 compared to Lands of Sweden==
While similar, NUTS 1 doesn&#x27;t correspond to Lands of Sweden.

<text>Amanses scopas, also known as the broom filefish, is a filefish, the only species in the genus &quot;Amanses&quot; of the family Monacanthidae. It is also called brush-sided leatherjacket in Australia or broom leatherjacket in Christmas Island.

The broom filefish is a harmless tropical reef fish from the Red Sea and the Indo-Pacific oceans, growing to a length of 20 cm. The body is brown with up to 12 narrow dark brown crossbars, the caudal fin is dark brown, and the soft dorsal, anal and pectoral fins are pale. Males have numerous long spines in front of the caudal peduncle, and females similarly have a toothbrush-like mass of setae in the same location.

They occur in areas of mixed sand, rubble, and coral heads of semi-protected seaward reefs.

<text>Los Lagos Region ( , &#x27;Region of the Lakes&#x27;) is one of Chile&#x27;s 16 regions, which are first order administrative divisions, and comprises four provinces: Chiloé, Llanquihue, Osorno and Palena. The region contains the country&#x27;s second-largest island, Chiloé, and the second-largest lake, Llanquihue. Its capital is Puerto Montt; other important cities include Osorno, Castro, Ancud, and Puerto Varas. Los Lagos Region is considered part of Patagonia.

Historically, the Huilliche have called this territory between Bueno River and Reloncaví Sound Futahuillimapu, meaning &quot;great land of the south&quot;. The region hosts Monte Verde, one of the oldest archaeological sites of the Americas. The largest indigenous group of the region are the Huilliche who lived in the area before the arrival of the Spanish. The Spanish crown settled Chiloé Archipelago in 1567 while the rest of the region begun to be slowly colonized by non-indigenous people only in the late 18th century. In the 1850s Germans arrived to colonize the shores of Llanquihue Lake under a Chilean state-sponsored program.

Los Lagos Region economy is dominated by the service sector but based in fishing, salmon aquaculture, forestry and cattle farming. Tourism is economically important in The Andes where ski resorts, hot springs and recreational fishing are popular offers.

== Geography ==
The region is bordered on the north by Los Ríos Region, on the south by Aisén Region, on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by Argentina (provinces of Neuquén, Río Negro and Chubut). Wild environments can be seen along the coastal area, such as Caleta Zorra.

=== Demography ===
The region has an area of and its population, according to the 2017 INE Census was 823,204, with a population density of 16.9 /km².

=== Principal towns ===

The Región de Los Lagos has seventeen towns according to the 2017 census, of which eleven have more than 10000 inhabitants each. 

=== Climate ===
The region, in general, has a natural vegetation of Valdivian temperate rain forest. The coastal part, except for the south of the Chiloé Island, has a temperate climate with cold winter rain. To the south, the climate is characterized by constant rain and not having dry seasons.

=== Protected areas ===

Protected areas include 7 national parks, 2 private-owned parks and 2 natural monuments.

<doc id="585724" wikidata="Q4970709" url="?curid=585724" title="British Rail Class 11">
<text>The British Rail Class 11 was applied to a batch of diesel shunting locomotives built from April 1945 to December 1952, based on a similar earlier batch built by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) between 1934 and 1936.

== Overview ==
===Numbering===
An initial batch of twenty locomotives was built during World War II, fourteen of which were built for the War Department, with the first ten of these (70260–70269) subsequently going to the Nederlandse Spoorwegen post-war as NS 501–510. LMS numbers 7120–7126 went straight into LMS stock, and a follow-up batch was built, 7129 being the last diesel shunter to be built for the LMS. British Railways continued to build the class from 1948 to 1952, using numbers M7130–M7131 and 12045–12138. 7120–7129 and M7130–M7131 became BR numbers 12033–12044. The whole class of 12033–12138 became Class 11. Locomotives up to 12102 were built at LMS/BR Derby and 12103–12138 at BR Darlington.

===Export locomotives===

Close to 100 almost identical machines were built by English Electric and supplied to Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) as their 500 Class &amp; 600 Class diesel locomotives. In addition to the exported 501–510 mentioned above, 500 Class also included 511–545. Sixty-five of the 600 Class locomotives were built by English Electric between 1950 and 1957, numbered 601–665, at either Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. Works (601–610) in Preston or Vulcan Foundry Works (remainder) in Newton-le-Willows. A further batch of 15 locomotives were exported without engines so that they could be fitted as such in the Netherlands. These were numbered 701–715.

Another export order was to Australia, with 16 locomotives built in 1951 but with the design modified for use on 5 ft 3 in gauge railways. The Victorian Railways bought ten, which were designated as F class, and six were bought by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria for shunting on sidings connected to Victorian Railways tracks.

One member of Class 11 was built for transporting British soldiers in the former Nazi-occupied countries. Throughout the liberation period it travelled through France, Belgium and the Netherlands before finally reaching Germany. It was then used for transporting British troops and for shunting, and was occasionally used on a few branch lines until 1957. The reason for this was that after the war the newly founded Deutsche Bundesbahn was slowly building up its locomotive fleet. As the more powerful German engines began to roll out, the Class 11 diesel was used less and in 1953 it was withdrawn. It stood in Hamm Engine shed, in West Germany, until it was bought by Danish State Railways in 1957. It was then renumbered to DSB ML 6 and liveried in the dark green that the Danish diesel shunters were painted in. It served on shunting duties in Copenhagen yards until 1973, when it was finally withdrawn for good; it was scrapped in 1974 in Hedehusene in Denmark.

===Technical details===
The diesel engine is an English Electric 6-cylinder, 10-inch bore by 12-inch stroke (254 mm by 305 mm); 4-stroke, 6KT and the traction motors are two: EE506 axle-hung, nose-suspended, force-ventilated traction motors with 21.7:1 double reduction gear drive. The main generator is an English Electric EE801, 441 A at 430 V.

==Withdrawal==
The 106 locomotives of British Railways were withdrawn between May 1967 and November 1972.

==Post-BR use==
Sixteen locomotives were sold to the National Coal Board, and were used in the North East England, South Wales and the Kent Coalfield.
==Preservation==

Only one of the LMS examples is preserved being:
* AD601 at Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway
The following BR examples of Class 11 diesel shunters are preserved:
* 12052 at Caledonian Railway
* 12077 at Midland Railway – Butterley
* 12083 at Battlefield Line Railway
* 12088 at Aln Valley Railway
* 12093 at Caledonian Railway
* 12099 at Severn Valley Railway
* 12131 at North Norfolk Railway
* A ninth example 12049 (renumbered from 12082) is preserved at the Watercress Line in Hampshire. At one time it was re-registered as 01553, in TOPS Class 01/5, carried both numbers and was owned by the Harry Needle Railroad Company. 12082 was renumbered to 12049 in October 2010 and painted in BR green with a late crest but without the yellow/black ends. This was as a replacement for the original Mid-Hants locomotive 12049 that was scrapped after suffering catastrophic damage during an engine shed fire on 26 July 2010.

<text>Wilhelm Scherer (26 April 18416 August 1886) was a German philologist and historian of literature. He was known as a positivist because he based much of his work on &quot;hypotheses on detailed historical research, and rooted every literary phenomenon in &#x27;objective&#x27; historical or philological facts&quot;. His positivism is different due to his involvement with his nationalist goals. His major contribution to the movement was his speculation that culture cycled in a six-hundred-year period.

==Life==
Scherer was born in Schönborn, Austrian Empire (present-day Göllersdorf, Lower Austria, Austria). He was educated at the academic gymnasium in Vienna and afterwards at the University of Vienna, where he was a favorite pupil of the distinguished Germanist, Karl Müllenhoff (1818–1884). Having taken the degree of &quot;doctor philosophiae&quot;, he became &quot;privatdozent&quot; for German language and literature in 1864.

In 1868 he was named a full professor at Vienna, and in 1872 received a call in a like capacity to the University of Strasbourg, and in 1877 to the University of Berlin, where in 1884 he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences.
He died in Berlin, German Empire at the age of 45.

==Works==
Scherer&#x27;s literary activity falls into three categories: in Vienna was the philologist, at Strasbourg the professor of literature and Berlin the author.

His earliest work was a biography of the philologist Jakob Grimm (1865, 2nd ed. 1885); the next, in conjunction with his former teacher Müllenhoff, published &quot;Denkmäler deutscher Poesie und Prosa aus dem 8. bis 12. Jahrhundert&quot; (1864, ed. 1892). His first major work was &quot;Zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache&quot; (Berlin, 1868; 3rd ed., 1890), a history of the German language with special reference to phonetic laws.

He contributed the section on Alsatian literature to Ottokar Lorenz&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte des Elsasses&quot; (1871, 3rd ed. 1886). Other important works are &quot;Geistliche Poeten der deutschen Kaiserzeit&quot; (Strassburg, 1875); &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung im 11. und 12. Jahrhundert&quot; (1875); and &quot;Vorträge und Aufsätze zur Geschichte des geistlichen Lebens in Deutschland und Österreich&quot; (1874).

Scherer&#x27;s best known work is his history of German literature, &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Literatur&quot; (Berlin, 1883; 10th ed., 1905; English translation Mrs F. C. Conybeare, 1883; new ed., 1906). This work is distinguished by the clarity with which details are co-ordinated with general and comprehensive survey of German literature from its beginnings right up until the death of Goethe.

Besides many other philological treatises, Scherer wrote largely on Goethe (&quot;Aus Goethes Frühzeit&quot;, 1879; &quot;Aufsätze über Goethe&quot;, 1886), and took an active part in the foundation of the Goethe archives at Weimar. A small treatise on &quot;Poetik&quot;, a biography of Karl Müllenhoff, and two volumes of &quot;Kleine Schriften&quot; were published after his death.

<text>The radius or radial bone (: radii or radiuses) is one of the two large bones of the forearm, the other being the ulna. It extends from the lateral side of the elbow to the thumb side of the wrist and runs parallel to the ulna. The ulna is longer than the radius, but the radius is thicker. The radius is a long bone, prism-shaped and slightly curved longitudinally. 

The radius is part of two joints: the elbow and the wrist. At the elbow, it joins with the capitulum of the humerus, and in a separate region, with the ulna at the radial notch. At the wrist, the radius forms a joint with the ulna bone. 

The corresponding bone in the lower leg is the tibia.

==Structure==


The long narrow medullary cavity is enclosed in a strong wall of compact bone. It is thickest along the interosseous border and thinnest at the extremities, same over the cup-shaped articular surface (fovea) of the head.

The trabeculae of the spongy tissue are somewhat arched at the upper end and pass upward from the compact layer of the shaft to the &quot;fovea capituli&quot; (the humerus&#x27;s cup-shaped articulatory notch); they are crossed by others parallel to the surface of the fovea. The arrangement at the lower end is somewhat similar. It is missing in radial aplasia.

The radius has a body and two extremities. The upper extremity of the radius consists of a somewhat cylindrical head articulating with the ulna and the humerus, a neck, and a radial tuberosity. The body of the radius is self-explanatory, and the lower extremity of the radius is roughly quadrilateral in shape, with articular surfaces for the ulna, scaphoid and lunate bones. The distal end of the radius forms two palpable points, radially the styloid process and Lister&#x27;s tubercle on the ulnar side. Along with the proximal and distal radioulnar articulations, an interosseous membrane originates medially along the length of the body of the radius to attach the radius to the ulna.
=== Near the wrist ===
The distal end of the radius is large and of quadrilateral form.

;Joint surfaces
It is provided with two articular surfaces – one below, for the carpus, and another at the medial side, for the ulna.
* The &quot;carpal&quot; articular surface is triangular, concave, smooth, and divided by a slight antero-posterior ridge into two parts. Of these, the lateral, triangular, articulates with the scaphoid bone; the medial, quadrilateral, with the lunate bone.
* The articular surface for the &quot;ulna&quot; is called the ulnar notch (&quot;sigmoid cavity&quot;) of the radius; it is narrow, concave, smooth, and articulates with the head of the ulna.

These two articular surfaces are separated by a prominent ridge, to which the base of the triangular articular disk is attached; this disk separates the wrist-joint from the distal radioulnar articulation.

;Other surfaces
This end of the bone has three non-articular surfaces – volar, dorsal, and lateral.
* The &quot;volar surface&quot;, rough and irregular, affords attachment to the volar radiocarpal ligament.
* The &quot;dorsal surface&quot; is convex, affords attachment to the dorsal radiocarpal ligament, and is marked by three grooves. Enumerated from the lateral side:
** The &quot;first&quot; groove is broad, but shallow, and subdivided into two by a slight ridge: the lateral of these two, transmits the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle; the medial, the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. 
** The &quot;second&quot; is deep but narrow, and bounded laterally by a sharply defined ridge; it is directed obliquely from above downward and lateralward, and transmits the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus muscle. 
** The &quot;third&quot; is broad, for the passage of the tendons of the extensor indicis proprius and extensor digitorum communis.
* The &quot;lateral surface&quot; is prolonged obliquely downward into a strong, conical projection, the styloid process, which gives attachment by its base to the tendon of the brachioradialis, and by its apex to the radial collateral ligament of wrist joint. The lateral surface of this process is marked by a flat groove, for the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus muscle and extensor pollicis brevis muscle.

===Body===
The body of the radius (or shaft of radius) is prismoid in form, narrower above than below, and slightly curved, so as to be convex lateralward. It presents three borders and three surfaces.

;Borders
The volar border (&quot;margo volaris; anterior border; palmar&quot;;) extends from the lower part of the tuberosity above to the anterior part of the base of the styloid process below, and separates the volar from the lateral surface. Its upper third is prominent, and from its oblique direction has received the name of the oblique line of the radius; it gives origin to the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle (also &quot;flexor digitorum sublimis&quot;) and flexor pollicis longus muscle; the surface above the line gives insertion to part of the supinator muscle. The middle third of the volar border is indistinct and rounded. The lower fourth is prominent, and gives insertion to the pronator quadratus muscle, and attachment to the dorsal carpal ligament; it ends in a small tubercle, into which the tendon of the brachioradialis muscle is inserted.

The dorsal border (&quot;margo dorsalis; posterior border&quot;) begins above at the back of the neck, and ends below at the posterior part of the base of the styloid process; it separates the posterior from the lateral surface. is indistinct above and below, but well-marked in the middle third of the bone.

The interosseous border (&quot;internal border; crista interossea; interosseous crest;&quot;) begins above, at the back part of the tuberosity, and its upper part is rounded and indistinct; it becomes sharp and prominent as it descends, and at its lower part divides into two ridges which are continued to the anterior and posterior margins of the ulnar notch. To the posterior of the two ridges the lower part of the interosseous membrane is attached, while the triangular surface between the ridges gives insertion to part of the pronator quadratus muscle. This crest separates the volar from the dorsal surface, and gives attachment to the interosseous membrane. The connection between the two bones is actually a joint referred to as a syndesmosis joint.

;Surfaces
The volar surface (&quot;facies volaris; anterior surface&quot;) is concave in its upper three-fourths, and gives origin to the flexor pollicis longus muscle; it is broad and flat in its lower fourth, and affords insertion to the Pronator quadratus. A prominent ridge limits the insertion of the Pronator quadratus below, and between this and the inferior border is a triangular rough surface for the attachment of the volar radiocarpal ligament. At the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the volar surface is the nutrient foramen, which is directed obliquely upward.

The dorsal surface (&quot;facies dorsalis; posterior surface&quot;) is convex, and smooth in the upper third of its extent, and covered by the Supinator. Its middle third is broad, slightly concave, and gives origin to the Abductor pollicis longus above, and the extensor pollicis brevis muscle below. Its lower third is broad, convex, and covered by the tendons of the muscles which subsequently run in the grooves on the lower end of the bone.

The lateral surface (&quot;facies lateralis; external surface&quot;) is convex throughout its entire extent and is known as the convexity of the radius, curving outwards to be convex at the side. Its upper third gives insertion to the supinator muscle. About its center is a rough ridge, for the insertion of the pronator teres muscle. Its lower part is narrow, and covered by the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus muscle and extensor pollicis brevis muscle.

===Near the elbow===
The upper extremity of the radius (or proximal extremity) presents a head, neck, and tuberosity.
* The radial &quot;head&quot; has a cylindrical form, and on its upper surface is a shallow cup or fovea for articulation with the capitulum (or capitellum) of the humerus. The circumference of the head is smooth; it is broad medially where it articulates with the radial notch of the ulna, narrow in the rest of its extent, which is embraced by the annular ligament. The deepest point in the fovea is not axi-symmetric with the long axis of the radius, creating a cam effect during pronation and supination.
* The head is supported on a round, smooth, and constricted portion called the &quot;neck&quot;, on the back of which is a slight ridge for the insertion of part of the supinator muscle. 
* Beneath the neck, on the medial side, is an eminence, the &quot;radial tuberosity&quot;; its surface is divided into a posterior, rough portion, for the insertion of the tendon of the biceps brachii muscle, and an anterior, smooth portion, on which a bursa is interposed between the tendon and the bone.

===Development===
The radius is ossified from &quot;three&quot; centers: one for the body, and one for each extremity. That for the body makes its appearance near the center of the bone, during the eighth week of fetal life.

Ossification commences in the lower end between 9 and 26 months of age. The ossification center for the upper end appears by the fifth year.

The upper epiphysis fuses with the body at the age of seventeen or eighteen years, the lower about the age of twenty.

An additional center sometimes found in the radial tuberosity, appears about the fourteenth or fifteenth year.

==Function==

===Muscle attachments===
The biceps muscle inserts on the radial tuberosity of the upper extremity of the bone. The upper third of the body of the bone attaches to the supinator, the flexor digitorum superficialis, and the flexor pollicis longus muscles.
The middle third of the body attaches to the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, and the pronator teres muscles.
The lower quarter of the body attaches to the pronator quadratus muscle and the tendon of the supinator longus.

==Clinical significance==
Radial aplasia refers to the congenital absence or shortness of the radius.

===Fracture===

Specific fracture types of the radius include:
*Proximal radius fracture. A fracture within the capsule of the elbow joint results in the fat pad sign or &quot;sail sign&quot; which is a displacement of the fat pad at the elbow.

**Essex-Lopresti fracture – a fracture of the radial head with concomitant dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint with disruption of the interosseous membrane.
*Radial shaft fracture
*Distal radius fracture
**Galeazzi fracture – a fracture of the radius with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint
**Colles&#x27; fracture – a distal fracture of the radius with dorsal (posterior) displacement of the wrist and hand
**Smith&#x27;s fracture – a distal fracture of the radius with volar (ventral) displacement of the wrist and hand
**Barton&#x27;s fracture – an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius with dislocation of the radiocarpal joint.

==History==
The word &quot;radius&quot; is Latin for &quot;ray&quot;. In the context of the radius bone, a ray can be thought of rotating around an axis line extending diagonally from center of capitulum to the center of distal ulna. While the ulna is the major contributor to the elbow joint, the radius primarily contributes to the wrist joint.

The radius is named so because the radius (bone) acts like the radius (of a circle). It rotates around the ulna and the far end (where it joins to the bones of the hand), known as the styloid process of the radius, is the distance from the ulna (center of the circle) to the edge of the radius (the circle). The ulna acts as the center point to the circle because when the arm is rotated the ulna does not move.

==Other animals==
In four-legged animals, the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb. Its structure is similar in most terrestrial tetrapods, but it may be fused with the ulna in some mammals (such as horses) and reduced or modified in animals with flippers or vestigial forelimbs.

<text>Solenopsis fugax is a myrmicine ant of the genus &quot;Solenopsis&quot;.

It is the only member of its genus to be native to the British Isles, and although rare, it has been taken by Horace Donisthorpe in a number of localities on England&#x27;s southern coast, including Sandown and Shanklin on the Isle of Wight, and also in the southwesterly region of Lyme Regis It Can Be Found Throughout Europe And Central Asia and some parts of South West Asia.

The species is a thief ant and usually has its nest near another species, stealing food by entering the foreign colony through minute tunnels dug from their own nest.

== Relations ==
&quot;Solenopsis fugax&quot; is a close relative of some tropical species from the genus &quot;Solenopsis&quot;; some of its many close relatives are &quot;S. geminata&quot;, &quot;S. molesta&quot; and &quot;S. invicta&quot;. The key difference is that the more temperately adapted &quot;Solenopsis fugax&quot; hibernates in the winter to avoid the harsh cold and lack of food found in these temperate environments. &quot;S. fugax&quot; is also separated by its lighter colour.

<text>Programming is a form of music production and performance using electronic devices and computer software, such as sequencers and workstations or hardware synthesizers, sampler and sequencers, to generate sounds of musical instruments. These musical sounds are created through the use of music coding languages. There are many music coding languages of varying complexity. Music programming is also frequently used in modern pop and rock music from various regions of the world, and sometimes in jazz and contemporary classical music. It gained popularity in the 1950s and has been emerging ever since.

Music programming is the process in which a musician produces a sound or &quot;patch&quot; (be it from scratch or with the aid of a synthesizer/sampler), or uses a sequencer to arrange a song.

== Coding languages ==
Music coding languages are used to program the electronic devices to produce the instrumental sounds they make. Each coding language has its own level of difficulty and function.

Alda

The music coding language Alda provides a tutorial on coding music and is, &quot;designed for musicians who do not know how to program, as well as programmers who do not know how to music&quot;. The website also has links to install, tutorial, cheat sheet, docs, and community for anyone visiting the website.

LC

LC computer music programming language is a more complex computer music programming language meant for more experienced coders. One of the differences between this language and other music coding languages is that, &quot;Unlike existing unit-generator languages, LC provides objects as well as library functions and methods that can directly represent microsounds and related manipulations that are involved in microsound synthesis.&quot;

== History and development ==
Music programming has had a vast history of development leading to the creation of different programs and languages. Each development comes with more function and utility and each decade tends to favor a certain program and or piece of equipment.

=== MUSIC N ===

The first digital synthesis family of computer programs and languages being MUSIC-N created by Max Mathews. The development of these programs, allowed for more flexibility and utility, eventually leading them to become fully developed languages. As programs such as MUSIC I, MUSIC II and MUSIC III were developed, which were all created by Max Matthews, new technologies were incorporated in such as the table-lookup oscillator in MUSIC II and the unit generator in MUSIC III. The breakthrough technologies such as the unit generator, which acted as a building block for music programming software, and the acoustic compiler, which allowed &quot;unlimited number of sound synthesis structures to be created in the computer&quot;, further the complexity and evolution of music programming systems.

=== Drum machines ===
Around the time of the 1950s, electric rhythm machines began to make way into popular music. These machines began to gain much traction amongst many artists as they saw it as a way to create percussion sounds in an easier and more efficient way. Artists who used this kind of technology include J. J. Cale, Sly Stone, Phil Collins, Marvin Gaye, and Prince. Some of the popular drum machines through the time of the 1950s-1970s were the Side Man, Ace Tone&#x27;s Rhythm Ace, Korg&#x27;s Doncamatic, and Maestro&#x27;s Rhythm King. In 1979, the LM-1 drum machine computer was released by guitarist Roger Linn, its goal being to help artists achieve realistic sounding drum sounds. This drum machine had eight different drum sounds: kick drum, snare, hi-hat, cabasa, tambourine, two tom toms, two congas, cowbell, clave, and handclaps. The different sounds could be recorded individually and they sounded real because of the high frequencies of the sound (28 kHz). Some notable artists who used the LM-1 were Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and Madonna. These developments continued to happen in future decades leading to the creation of new electrical instruments such as the Theremin, Hammond organ, electric guitar, synthesizer, and digital sampler. Other technologies such as the phonograph, tape-recorder, and compact disc have enabled artists to create and produce sounds without the use of live musicians.

Music programming in the 1980s

The music programming innovations of the 1980s brought many new unique sounds to this style of music. Popular music sounds during this time were the gated reverb, synthesizers, drum machines with 1980s sounds, vocal reverb, delay, and harmonization, and master bus mix downs and tape. Music programming began to emerge around this time which drew up controversy. Many artists were adapting more towards this technology and the traditional way music was made and recorded began to change. For instance, many artists began to record their beats by programming instead of recording a live drummer.

Music programming in the early 2000s

Today, music programming is very common, with artists using software on a computer to produce music and not actually using physical instruments. These different programs are called digital audio workstations (DAW) and are used for editing, recording, and mixing music files. Most DAW programs incorporate the use of MIDI technology, which allows for music production software to carry out communication between electronic instruments, computers, and other related devices. While most DAWs carry out the same function and do the same thing, there are some that require less expertise and are easier for beginners to operate. These programs can be run on personal computers. Popular DAWs include: FL Studio, Avid Pro Tools, Apple Logic Pro X, Magix Acid Pro, Ableton Live, Presonus Studio One, Magix Samplitude Pro X, Cockos Reaper, Propellerhead Reason, Steinberg Cubase Pro, GarageBand, and Bitwig Studio.

<text>The University of Lisbon (ULisboa; ) is a public research university in Lisbon, and Portugal&#x27;s largest university. It was founded in 1911, but the university&#x27;s present structure dates to the 2013 merger of the former University of Lisbon (1911–2013) and the Technical University of Lisbon (1930–2013).

==History==

University of Coimbra, the first Portuguese university, was established in Lisbon between 1288 and 1290, when Dinis I promulgated the letter &quot;Scientiae thesaurus mirabili&quot;, granting several privileges to the students of the &quot;studium generale&quot; in Lisbon, proving that it was already founded on that date. There was an active participation in this educational activity by the Portuguese Crown and its king, through its commitment of part of the subsidy of the same, as by the fixed incomes of the Church. This institution moved several times between Lisbon and Coimbra, where it settled permanently in 1537.

The current University of Lisbon is the result of the merger of two former public universities of Lisbon, the former University of Lisbon, founded in 1911 and the Technical University of Lisbon, founded in 1930. The merger process was initiated in 2011 and was made into law on 31 December 2012. As stated on the decree-law No. 266-E/2012, the new University of Lisbon began its legal existence on the day the newly elected rector took office, on 25 July 2013.

== Lisbon University Student&#x27;s Union ==

The Associação Académica da Universidade de Lisboa, founded on March 8, 2007, is the representative structure of the collective interests of all students of the University of Lisbon.

The AAUL is an Association with a Federative character, recognized by the Government as a Federation of Students balancing a model of direct election by students with the pursuit of the institutional interests of the Federated Academic and Student Associations themselves.

Within the Associação Académica da Universidade de Lisboa, the paradigm of two chambers, personified by the General Assembly and the General Council, finds parallels in the upper and lower chambers of bicameral parliamentary systems. The term upper chamber is particularly relevant when analyzing the structure and function of these bodies in the context of the AAUL.

The General Council of the AAUL emerges as the representative body of the Student Associations and the students of the Faculties, playing an essential role in defining the programmatic lines of AAUL activity. The representativeness of these associations and faculties in the General Council reflects the diversity of interests and perspectives, providing a more comprehensive and institutionalized view.

On the other hand, the General Assembly, resembling a lower chamber, represents all students of the University of Lisbon. This is the highest point of deliberation, where all students exercise a direct voice in decision-making on matters related to the AAUL. The direct participation of students in the General Assembly reflects the popular and democratic nature of this chamber, contrasting with the more institutional character of the General Council.

This bicameral structure, similar to parliamentary systems in various parts of the world, finds echoes in examples such as the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, reflecting the specific nuances of the European Union. Similarly, in the United States, the Senate represents the member states in a federative manner, while the House of Representatives directly reflects the voice of the citizens. In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords, with an aristocratic character, contrasts with the House of Commons, representing the general population. This diversity of examples highlights the adaptability and effectiveness of the bicameral model in managing different perspectives and interests, ensuring a more inclusive and representative approach in decisions relevant to the student community of the University of Lisbon.

<doc id="585750" wikidata="Q61873" url="?curid=585750" title="Dorothea of Brandenburg">
<text>Dorothea of Brandenburg (31 December 1430 – 10 November 1495) was Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden under the Kalmar Union as the consort of first Christopher III of Denmark and later Christian I of Denmark. She served as interim regent during the interregnum in 1448 and as regent in the absence of her second spouse during his reign. She and Christian had three surviving children: John, Margaret, and Frederick, of whom John served as king of the union and both sons served as kings of Denmark and Norway.

==Early life==

Dorothea was born in 1430 or 1431 to John, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, and Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg (1405–1465), the daughter of Rudolf III, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg. She had two sisters: Barbara (1423–1481), who became Marchioness of Mantua, and Elisabeth (14??-1451), who became Duchess of Pomerania.
From about the age of eight, she lived in Bayreuth, where her father was ruler. In 1443, Christopher of Bavaria, the newly elected King of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, inherited Oberpfalz close to Bayreuth, and a marriage was suggested between Christopher and Dorothea to secure her father&#x27;s support for Christopher&#x27;s power over his German domain. The engagement was proclaimed prior to the application of Papal dispensation for affinity in February 1445, which was approved on 10 March.

==Marriage to Christopher of Bavaria==
On 12 September 1445, the wedding ceremony was conducted between Christopher and Dorothea in Copenhagen, followed by the coronation of Dorothea as queen. The King had financed it with a special tax in all three Kingdoms, and the occasion is described as one of the most elaborate in Nordic Medieval history. The festivities lasted for eight days and were attended by the Princes of Braunschweig, Hesse, and Bavaria and envoys of the Hanseatic League and the Teutonic Order as well as the nobility of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Dorothea made her entrance into the city escorted by noblemen from all three Kingdoms dressed in gold riding on white horses, and crowned Queen of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway by bishops from all three Kingdoms with the golden crown from the Vadstena Abbey. On 15 September, she was granted dowers in all three Kingdoms: Roskilde, Ringsted, Haraldsborg, and Skioldenses in Denmark; Jämtland in Norway, and Örebro, Närke, and Värmland in Sweden. Should she choose to live outside of Scandinavia as a widow, she would instead be given a fortune of 45,000 Rhine guilders, one-third from each Kingdom.

Queen Dorothea left for Sweden with the King in January 1446, where they visited Vadstena Abbey and her dower Örebro. During this visit, she met her future antagonist Charles, Lord High Constable of Sweden. According to the chronicle &quot;Karlskrönikan&quot;, their meeting was a good one during which Charles presented her and her ladies-in-waiting with many gifts. The couple returned to Denmark in September. 
The marriage between Dorothea and Christopher was politically favorable: her father governed Christopher&#x27;s German domain and was a loyal supporter and adviser. It did not result in any offspring, however, and according to Ericus Olai, the marriage was not sexually active.

In January 1448, King Christopher died childless, which resulted in a succession crisis that immediately broke the Kalmar Union of the three Kingdoms. Queen dowager Dorothea, being the only royal in Denmark, was proclaimed interim regent of Denmark until a new monarch could be elected. In Sweden, however, the Lord High Constable was elected as King Charles VIII, who was soon elected king of Norway as well. In September, Christian of Oldenburg was elected monarch as Christian I of Denmark and the queen dowager turned over the power to him upon his election.

==Marriage to Christian I of Denmark==
Queen Dorothea was given a proposal from king Casimir IV of Poland and Albert VI, Archduke of Austria, but she chose to remain in Denmark and marry the newly elected king, Christian I of Denmark. The wedding ceremony was conducted 26 October 1449, followed by the coronation of Christian and herself as king and queen of Denmark. She renounced her existing dower lands in Denmark and Norway, which were replaced with Kalundborg and Samsø in Denmark, and Romerike in Norway, but refused to renounce her Swedish dower lands. The election of Charles as king in Sweden and Norway deprived her of her dower lands in these kingdoms. The newly married couple&#x27;s ambition was to have Christian crowned in Sweden and Norway as well, and thereby reunite the shattered Kalmar Union.

Christian was crowned in Norway in 1450. The task to win back Sweden was more difficult, and Dorothea waged a long campaign to recruit followers among the Swedish clerics and nobility. Her message to her followers was that their elected king Charles VIII, as her former Lord Constable and subject, was to be regarded as a usurper and a traitor who had broken his vow by depriving her, his former queen, of her dower lands in Sweden. In 1455, she also appealed to the Pope. In February 1457 her campaign succeeded when the rebellion of Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna deposed Charles VIII, who fled to Germany. Christian was elected king of Sweden in July 1457, thereby reuniting the three Nordic kingdoms. Dorothea made an official entry in Stockholm in December, and her Swedish dower lands were returned to her. In May 1458 the Swedish council approved her and Christian&#x27;s wish that their sons be secured in the succession to the Swedish throne, a position they had already been granted in Denmark and Norway. The king and queen returned to Denmark in July 1458.

In 1460, Christian bought the Duchy of Schleswig and Holstein, which placed him in debt. He raised taxes to offset this debt, which destroyed his support in Sweden. Sweden again elected Charles VIII as king in 1464. The loss of Sweden was a blow to Queen Dorothea, who started a lifelong campaign to have her spouse (and later her son) again elected king of Sweden, to restore the Kalmar Union of the three Kingdoms and to retrieve her Swedish dower lands.

The loss of her personal dower lands enabled her to pursue the Swedish cause in court, and she sued Charles VIII before the Pope in Rome for depriving her of her dower lands. When Charles VIII was succeeded as the regent of Sweden by Sten Sture the Elder, she pursued her case against him.

In 1475, she traveled to Italy and visited her sister Barbara in Mantua, and Pope Sixtus IV in Rome, and formally applied to have Sten Sture excommunicated. Under excommunication, the Swedish kingdom would be placed under interdict, which would be economically and politically ruinous, resulting in the fall of the Swedish regent and the election of the Danish king as king of Sweden. This was a driving force for the queen during the last twenty years of her life. Following her visit to Rome in May 1475, Sixtus IV subsequently issued a bull to King Christian permitting the establishment of a university in Denmark. As a result, the University of Copenhagen was inaugurated in 1479.

In Denmark, Queen Dorothea was granted the &quot;Slotsloven&quot;, which gave her the right to command all the castles in Denmark, and she served as regent whenever the king was absent. Her personal wealth also gave her influence. When King Christian acquired Holstein and Schleswig in 1460 and was unable to pay, she loaned him the amount necessary to buy these domains and incorporate them into Denmark. By 1470, she had de facto seized control over Holstein and Schleswig: when Christian was unable to pay back the loan she had given him to buy the domains, she took over the rule of Holstein (1479) and Schleswig (1480) herself and ruled them as her own fiefs. After the death of her father in 1464, she battled her uncle Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg, over the inheritance.

Queen Dorothea has been described as efficient and ambitious, haughty and frugal.

===Queen Dowager===
Christian I died on 21 May 1481 and was succeeded by their son John, King of Denmark. As queen dowager, she preferred to reside at Kalundborg Castle. She remained politically active during the reign of her son until her death. She granted the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein to her younger son Frederick, but it caused a conflict with her elder son and ended in the division of the Duchy between her sons.

Dorothea continued with her ambition to reunite the Kalmar Union of the Nordic Kingdoms, now by having her son elected king of Sweden rather than her spouse by ousting the Swedish regent through an excommunication. In January 1482, she informed her son the king of this plan, and in 1488 she made a second trip to her sister Barbara in Mantua, meeting with Frederick III in Innsbrück, and Pope Innocent VIII in Rome. Dorothea again pressed the matter of excommunicating the Swedish regent. It was with great difficulty that the Swedish envoy in Rome, Hemming Gadh, managed to prevent this. The queen dowager continued this fight until her death: the matter was resolved three years later when her son stated he did not wish to pursue the matter further. Though she died before her son was elected king of Sweden, her work is regarded to have contributed to this outcome.

Dorothea died on 25 November 1495, and is interred next to her second spouse in Roskilde Cathedral.

<text>The Crew-Cuts (sometimes spelled Crew Cuts or Crewcuts) were a Canadian vocal and doowop quartet, that made a number of popular records that charted in the United States and worldwide. They named themselves after the then popular crew cut haircut, one of the first connections made between pop music and hairstyle. They were most famous for their recording of The Chords&#x27; hit record, &quot;Sh-Boom&quot;.

==Group members==
* Rudi Maugeri (&quot;né&quot; Rudolph Peter Maugeri; January 27, 1931 – May 7, 2004) (lead and baritone)
* John Perkins (born August 28, 1931) (lead and tenor)
* Ray Perkins (born November 24, 1932) (bass) (John Perkins&#x27; brother)
* Pat Barrett (September 15, 1933 – July 27, 2016) (lead and tenor)

==Biography==
They all had been members of the St. Michael&#x27;s Choir School in Toronto, which also spawned another famous quartet, The Four Lads. Maugeri, John Perkins, and two others (Bernard Toorish and Connie Codarini) who later were among the Four Lads first formed a group called &quot;The Jordonaires&quot; (not to be confused with a similarly named group, The Jordanaires, that was known for singing backup vocals on Elvis Presley&#x27;s hits) and also &quot;The Otnorots&quot; (&quot;Toronto&quot; spelled backwards being &quot;Otnorot&quot;), but they split from the group to finish high school. When the Four Lads returned to Toronto for a homecoming concert, John Perkins and Maugeri ran into each other and decided that they could themselves have a musical future. They joined with Barrett and Ray Perkins in March 1952. The group was originally called &quot;The Four Tones&quot; (not to be confused with The Four Tunes, a group on the borderline between pop music and rhythm and blues).

A Toronto disk jockey, Barry Nesbitt, put them on his weekly teen show, whose audience gave the group a new name, &quot;The Canadaires.&quot; All four of the members were at the time working at jobs with the Ontario government, but quit their jobs to sing full-time. They worked clubs in the Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York area, but saved up their money and drove to New York City, so they could appear on Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s television and radio program, &quot;Talent Scouts,&quot; where they came in second to a comedian. While they did get a record with Thrillwood Records and recorded a song titled &quot;Chip, Chip Sing A Song Little Sparrow&quot;, this led to no improvement in their fortune, however, and they continued playing minor night clubs.

In March 1953, they returned to Toronto and appeared as an opening act for Gisele MacKenzie at the Casino Theatre. She was impressed with them and commented favorably to her record label, but could not remember the group&#x27;s name.

They were playing in a Sudbury, Ontario, night club in a sub-zero Canadian winter when they received notice that they had been invited to appear as a guest on a Cleveland television program. They drove 600 miles in -40° temperatures to appear on the Gene Carroll show, where they remained for three appearances. While in Cleveland, they met local disc jockey Bill Randle. On his show, on Cleveland radio station WERE (1300 AM), he coined the name that would, from that point on, belong to the group. In addition, Randle arranged for them to audition with Mercury Records, who liked them enough to sign the quartet to a contract.

Although their first hit, &quot;Crazy &#x27;Bout You, Baby&quot;, was written by Maugeri and Barrett themselves, they quickly became specialists in cover recordings of originally-R&amp;B songs. Their first cover, &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; (of which the R&amp;B original was recorded by The Chords) hit number one on the U.S. charts in 1954. It sold over a million copies. A number of other hits followed including &quot;Earth Angel&quot; which rose to the number 2 spot on the charts and had great success in the UK and Australia. Many of the non-cover songs of theirs that became hits in Canada were unknown in the United States, while it was only their covers that had great success in the United States.

In the week beginning 19 September 1955, they played six nights at Liverpool Empire, in Liverpool, United Kingdom. A 12-year-old George Harrison was among the crowd on one of those nights, and a 13-year-old Paul McCartney got an autograph from them.

The group moved from Mercury to RCA Records in 1958 and eventually broke up in 1964, but they all moved to the U.S. and reunited in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1977. In the 1990s they were inducted into the Juno Hall of Fame. In recent years, the three remaining members (Rudi Maugeri died in 2004) appeared on a Public Broadcasting Service special filmed at Atlantic City&#x27;s Trump Taj Mahal. The program, &quot;Magic Moments: The Best of &#x27;50s Pop&quot;, continues to air as part of the fundraising efforts for PBS.

A remix of their version of the song &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; was featured in the credits of the video game &quot;Destroy All Humans!&quot;. The original recording of their song &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; can also be heard on one of the in-game radio stations in &quot;Mafia II&quot;.

In later years, Rudi Maugeri became a music director of one of the music syndication companies, Radio Arts in Burbank, California. The company supplied music on ten-inch reels of audiotape for use in radio station automation systems and for &quot;Live Assist&quot; use, around the world. Maugeri selected and issued a playlist every week for the company. His record of picking hit songs for syndication was in the upper 90% and record promoters had Radio Arts on their list of &#x27;must see&#x27; companies because Radio Arts provided music to hundreds of stations weekly. Interviewed in 1979 on the syndicated radio show &quot;ShBoom Radio Show&quot;, Maugeri was quoted, &quot;We came along at a time when the big bands were almost finished and we were the new... and yet we toured with Ralph Marterie&#x27;s big band as the opening act and were quite well accepted by both the adults and the teens of the day. It wasn&#x27;t until we hit the charts with &quot;Crazy &#x27;Bout Ya Baby&quot; that the teens adopted us as their own and after that tour we became the headliners.&quot;

<text>Newfoundland ( ) is a village in Dreher Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is most famously known as host to the Greene-Dreher-Sterling Fair every Labor Day weekend.

Newfoundland is also host to an annual fireman&#x27;s picnic and parade every 4th of July weekend. Promised Land State Park is close to the village.

==Geography==
Newfoundland is located along the East Branch of the Wallenpaupack Creek, which feeds into Lake Wallenpaupack to the north. It is about southeast of Scranton, Pennsylvania.

==Education==
Newfoundland is home to the South Elementary School, which falls under the purview of the Wallenpaupack Area School District. South Elementary currently serves students grades K through 5.

==Services==
Two emergency services are headquartered in Newfoundland: the Greene-Dreher Volunteer Fire Association and the Newfoundland Area Ambulance Association. They both provide coverage for the village and surrounding Dreher Township, in addition to portions of adjoining Lehigh and Sterling Townships in Wayne County, as well as parts of Greene, and Palmyra Townships in Pike County, Pennsylvania, and Coolbaugh Township in Monroe County, Pennsylvania.

Dreher Township&#x27;s municipal building is located in Newfoundland.

==Transportation==
Major roads in Newfoundland include PA 507, PA 191, and PA 447. Neighboring villages are Greentown, Pennsylvania; Sterling, Pennsylvania; Tafton, Pennsylvania; and Hamlin, Pennsylvania.

==Notable people==
* Johnny &quot;Onionhead&quot; Eng⁣ — Hong Kong-born triad leader, Eng&#x27;s estate was confiscated by the FBI

<text>The Price Tower is a nineteen-story, tower at 510 South Dewey Avenue in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, United States. One of the few skyscrapers designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Price Tower is derived from a 1929 proposal for apartment buildings in New York City. Harold C. Price Sr., the head of the pipeline-construction firm H. C. Price Company, commissioned the Price Tower. The building was widely discussed when it was completed in 1956. In addition, the Price Tower received the American Institute of Architects&#x27; Twenty-five Year Award in 1983, and it has also been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

By the 1950s, the H. C. Price Company wanted to develop a modern headquarters in Bartlesville, and Harold Price hired Wright to design a headquarters for his company in 1952. Groundbreaking took place on November 13, 1953, and a topping out ceremony took place in March 1955. The Price Tower opened on February 10, 1956, attracting thousands of sightseers. The Price Company sold the tower in 1981 to Phillips Petroleum, which occupied the tower&#x27;s offices until the mid-1980s. Phillips donated the structure to the Price Tower Arts Center (PTAC) in 2001. The arts center subsequently converted part of the building into a museum, opening a boutique hotel and restaurant on the upper stories. The Price Tower was sold in 2023 and closed the next year following financial issues and legal disputes. It was resold in 2025 to McFarlin Building LLC.

As built, the Price Tower had about of rentable space, split across one residential and three office quadrants. The floor plan is laid out on a grid of parallelograms with 30-60-90 triangles, arranged around a pinwheel-shaped structural core with four piers. The facade includes embossed copper spandrels and louvers, tinted glass windows, and poured stucco surfaces. The reinforced-concrete floors are cantilevered outward from the structural core. Initially, the residential and office portions of the building were accessed by different lobbies and elevators. The top three stories originally functioned as a penthouse apartment and office for the Price family. Although the exterior has remained intact over the years, the apartments have been converted to offices.

== Site ==
The Price Tower is located at 510 South Dewey Avenue in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, United States. It is located in Washington County in the northeastern part of Oklahoma, approximately north of Tulsa. The Price Tower is located on a city block bounded by the now-closed Silas Street (formerly Sixth Street) to the south, Dewey Avenue to the west, Fifth Street to the north, and Osage Avenue to the east. The Price Tower&#x27;s base occupies two land lots measuring a combined . The walkways and driveways outside the building are painted Cherokee red. There are two carports outside the building: one to the north for office tenants, and one to the south for residents.

The rest of the block includes a storage annex, which originally functioned as a grocery store and car dealership, as well as a parking lot. The Tower Center at Unity Square, immediately south of the Price Tower, links the tower with the Bartlesville Community Center. Work on the park began in March 2019, and the park opened in May 2020.

== History ==

=== Development ===
Bartlesville, a small city in northeastern Oklahoma, had become economically prosperous in the late 19th and 20th centuries due to the success of the local oil industry. Oil magnates in Bartlesville commissioned architects to design lavish residences and offices. Among these was the Price Tower, commissioned by Harold C. Price Sr. as a corporate headquarters for his eponymous company, a pipeline-construction firm. Meanwhile, the architect Frank Lloyd Wright had wanted to develop a skyscraper ever since the early 1920s, when he drew up plans for the National Insurance Company Building, an unbuilt office tower in Chicago with cantilevered floor slabs.

==== Original New York plans ====
The Price Tower is directly derived from Wright&#x27;s unbuilt plan for the redevelopment of St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery in East Village, Manhattan, New York City. Wright had been friends with St. Mark&#x27;s rector, William Norman Guthrie, since at least 1908. Guthrie wrote to Wright in October 1927, telling the architect about his intention to construct a high-rise building to alleviate the church&#x27;s ongoing financial shortfalls. Negotiations over architects&#x27; fees continued over the next year. Guthrie asked Wright to waive all but $150 of his $7,500 design fee, claiming that the proposed buildings were located in an undesirable neighborhood and were thus unlikely to attract high-paying rental tenants. It was not until December 1928 that Wright sketched out designs for the St. Mark&#x27;s towers. Wright historian Edgar Kaufmann Jr. wrote that the St. Mark&#x27;s towers were loosely based on the Romeo and Juliet Windmill, which Wright had designed for his aunts at Taliesin, his family&#x27;s estate in Wisconsin. To comply with New York City building codes, Wright devised plans for towers of between 10 and 20 stories.

Wright&#x27;s initial design called for several 16-to-18-story apartment buildings between 10th and 11th streets west of Second Avenue. In contrast to the skyscrapers that predominated in Manhattan at the time, which had setbacks, Wright&#x27;s designs resembled inverted cones. The floor plans, rotated 30 degrees from a rectangular ground-level site, were divided into quadrants around a pinwheel-shaped core. The rooms were laid out on a grid of 30-60-90 parallelograms and triangles. The floors would have been cantilevered outward from the core, the only part of each building anchored to the ground. A steel-and-glass curtain wall would have been suspended from the ends of each floor slab. The structures would have contained steel furniture and copper walls. The apartments would have been duplex units, with 36 units in each building; the second-floor units would have run diagonally across each structure.

Wright called his design &quot;modern—not modernistic&quot;. Guthrie began to express doubts in Wright&#x27;s plans in 1930, following objections from St. Mark&#x27;s vestry, and the project was ultimately canceled during the Great Depression. Wright attempted to resurrect the St. Mark&#x27;s project multiple times without success, including in his Broadacre City. Wright continued to refine his tower design in the 1930s and 1940s. In particular, the superstructure of the Johnson Wax Headquarters&#x27; research tower (completed in Racine, Wisconsin, in 1950) is similar to that of the St. Mark&#x27;s towers, except for the design of the curtain wall. Wright&#x27;s next building in New York City, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, would not be constructed until the 1950s.

==== Bartlesville plans ====

By the 1950s, the H. C. Price Company wanted to develop a modern headquarters in Bartlesville. At the time, the city had 19,000 residents, and its only other tall building was a 14-story structure developed by the Phillips Petroleum Company. Sources disagree on how Wright and the Price family came in contact. Several sources write that the architect Bruce Goff, who chaired the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s (OU) school of architecture, recommended that the Prices hire Wright to design the headquarters. According to &quot;&quot;, Goff had become involved after Price&#x27;s son Joe, a student at OU, had asked him for advice. Other accounts state that Harold Sr.&#x27;s wife Mary Lou Price had read about Wright and recommended him to her husband, or that Harold&#x27;s sons and daughter-in-law had recommended Wright after attending one of the architect&#x27;s lectures at OU. Initially, Harold Sr. did not believe that Wright would be interested in designing a headquarters for the Price Company, as Harold Sr. neither sought a corporate icon nor needed large amounts of space. His sons, Joe and Harold Jr., told their father that hiring Wright would be no more expensive than hiring any other architect to design a generic &quot;box-type structure&quot;.

The Prices went to Wright&#x27;s Wisconsin studio, and Price and Wright haggled over the building&#x27;s proposed height. Price had wanted a low-rise structure measuring two or three stories tall; as he said, he wanted a small building and a place to park ten trucks. Although Price envisioned a structure with in total, Wright wanted a 25-story structure with 25,000 square feet per story. Price claimed a skyscraper would be &quot;such a big building for a small town&quot;, while Wright countered that he had taken a regular low-rise structure and &quot;stood it on end&quot;. Wright also allegedly told Price that &quot;I&#x27;m going to give you the building I&#x27;ve been trying to build for 35 years.&quot; By August 1952, Harold Price Sr. sought to develop a building that was at least 10 stories tall, which would also include some apartments. Joe Price, one of Harold&#x27;s two sons, later recalled that it took Wright two hours to convince Price to agree to a 12-story structure. As Harold Price Sr. later wrote, &quot;we finally compromised on nineteen floors.&quot;

The final design was nearly identical to the St. Mark&#x27;s design, although the dimensions of each floor at the Price Tower were smaller than those of the St. Mark&#x27;s towers. The Price Company&#x27;s vice president, John M. Thomas, later recalled that Harold Price &quot;wanted that building to be a monument to the work our company had done, laying a pipeline through Alaska&quot;. On the other hand, Price himself said that &quot;it was not our intent to build a monument&quot; but that, nonetheless, the tower became a point of pride for Bartlesville. Wright thought the Bartlesville location was ideal because he believed that skyscrapers belonged in rural areas, where they stood out from the surrounding landscape. Joe Price also asked Goff to design a house next to the Price Tower, but after Wright asked if Goff&#x27;s design was meant as a joke, the planned house was canceled.

==== Construction ====
In May 1953, Price announced plans for an 18-story tower to be built on a site at the northeastern corner of Dewey Avenue and Sixth Street in Bartlesville. The structure was to be tall, with a three-story penthouse for the Price Company, eight double-story apartments, and a two-story annex for the Public Service Company. Wright, who had added the apartments at the Prices&#x27; request, envisioned the Price Tower as a model for other mixed-use high-rises in smaller American towns and cities. Price had anticipated that the building would cost $500,000. Haskell Culwell, a company from Oklahoma City, was hired as the main contractor in July 1953. W. Kelly Oliver was the lighting consultant, L. B. Perkins was hired as the electrical engineer, and Collins and Gould served as the mechanical engineer. Subcontractors submitted extremely high bids for materials; for example, one bidder offered to install the exterior copper for $450,000, while another bidder offered to pour concrete for $300,000. During the building&#x27;s development, there were also disputes between Wright and Price over such details as chairs.

Work was delayed for several months due to difficulties in securing materials and widening a nearby street; in addition, it took more than a year to sketch out the design details. Groundbreaking took place on November 13, 1953, and site excavation was complete by that December. William Wesley Peters was appointed as Wright&#x27;s on-site representative, and several contractors from Oklahoma and Texas were hired for the project. Wright visited Bartlesville in early 1954 to discuss the tower&#x27;s design with 400 college students. Construction was temporarily halted that March due to a labor strike. Workers installed a temporary elevator hoist, which was extended upward as the building&#x27;s superstructure rose. Simultaneously, the floor slabs were poured; the lowest stories took a month to pour, but workers became more efficient at pouring concrete as the structure ascended. By August 1954, concrete work had reached the sixth story, which had been poured in a week.

Work on the tower continued through late 1954, with workers completing one story every 12 days; the tower had reached the 15th story by December. The developers were so heavily focused on the Price Tower&#x27;s completion that they discouraged sightseers from coming, and they did not respond to he myriad of inquires about the tower&#x27;s construction. The 19th and final story was completed in February 1955, and workers began installing interior finishes on the lowest stories. In addition, workers began installing some of the windows. A topping out ceremony took place the next month, March 14, 1955, at which point the building was scheduled to be completed in mid-1955. Joe Price was so heavily involved with the Price Tower&#x27;s development that he lived on site while the tower was being completed. By that October, the building was still not open, but the Price Company was preparing to receive its first tenants. In January 1956, in preparation for the tower&#x27;s opening, Bartlesville&#x27;s traffic committee voted to add parking spaces to the streets surrounding the tower.

=== Late 20th century ===

==== Completion and early years ====

The Price Tower opened for media previews on February 4, 1956, and the building officially opened five days later on February 9. Only residents of Bartlesville were allowed to tour the structure on the first day, and the general public was allowed to visit over the weekend of February 11 and 12. The opening ceremonies attracted 13,000 sightseers. A retrospective &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; article claimed that the Price Tower had cost $2.4 million to construct, while contemporary estimates ranged as high as $13 million. The Price family publicly cited the building&#x27;s cost as $6.5 million, and Harold Sr. wrote in an August 1956 letter that he had spent $2.1 million. At the time of construction, the Price Tower was reportedly the most expensive building ever constructed in Bartlesville. The structure was also among the first skyscrapers with both apartments and offices from the outset. The tower&#x27;s completion also helped bring attention to the Price family.

Harold Price was proud of the structure, placing images of it on the cover of his company&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;Tie-In&quot;; the Price Company also gave free tours of the building. The apartments were variously cited as having been rented out for $285 or $325 a month. The offices rented for $135 to $165 a month depending on the office&#x27;s location in the building. The Price Company initially occupied the office space on the 12th through 19th floors, employing sixty people there. The Public Service Company of Oklahoma moved into the two-story annex east of the main tower. Other early tenants included the General Acceptance Company on three stories, the Claiborne Company on the 11th floor, and an ophthalmologist&#x27;s office. The building&#x27;s tenants also included doctors and lawyers, as well as communications, utility, and real-estate firms. Bruce Goff moved into the Price Tower&#x27;s 9th-and-10th-floor apartment and maintained an office in the building.

Two years after the Price Tower opened, it still attracted 40 to 50 tourists during the weekend, though two of the eight apartments were vacant. After Wright&#x27;s death in 1959, Price hired a Swiss company to manufacture a sundial in Wright&#x27;s honor. The sundial, which was installed next to the tower&#x27;s southwest corner in November 1961, was vandalized shortly afterward. In 1960, Taliesin Associated Architects, the successor firm to Wright&#x27;s practice, drew up plans to convert some of the unused apartments into offices. Although the Price family continued to take pride in the building&#x27;s design, Joe Price said the company did not earn much from rental income; even if the Price Tower were fully occupied, it would still earn only $24,000 a year. The apartments were particularly difficult to rent, since one could buy a house in rural Oklahoma rather than paying the apartments&#x27; high rents, and there was virtually no demand for the apartments. Goff later recalled that, though up to five of the apartments were sometimes rented simultaneously, there were times when he was the only resident.

By the late 1960s, the Public Service Company had outgrown its offices in the building. In addition, the lobby displayed a rotating exhibit of photographs that Joe Price had taken while on a safari. Thirty-five to forty Price Company employees still worked at the Price Tower in the early 1970s. The remaining apartments were converted to office space in the 1960s and early 1970s, and only the Price penthouse remained by 1972. As part of a master plan for Bartlesville, city officials announced plans in 1978 for a $10.5 million community center next to the Price Tower, which was finished in 1982. The drive-through counter between the main tower and its annex was enclosed in the late 1970s, and a shop in the lobby had become a reception desk by the early 1980s. The exterior remained almost entirely unchanged, and the furniture and interior decorations remained in place.

==== Philips Petroleum ownership ====
In December 1980, the H. C. Price Company agreed to sell the Price Tower to Phillips Petroleum, which wanted to help preserve the building. Phillips formally took over the Price Tower in April 1981, and &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot; wrote the next month that Phillips had paid $2.5 million. Though Phillips preserved the building&#x27;s interior decorations, it left the penthouse unused. During the 1980s, Phillips constructed or acquired several other buildings in downtown Bartlesville, and by 1983 there were media reports that Phillips planned to move out of the building. Phillips moved out during the middle of the decade. Several reasons have been cited for Phillips&#x27;s relocation, including the 1980s oil glut, the opening of the nearby Plaza Office Building in 1985, and a decline in the local labor force. Harold Jr.&#x27;s ex-wife, Carolyn S. Price, said that even though the tower was seemingly out of place in Bartlesville, &quot;when the Price Tower closed, people realized how much they missed it&quot;.

Phillips initially sought new tenants for the Price Tower, as the company planned to move employees to one of its other office towers nearby. The company received several proposals, including one plan that would have converted the Price Tower to residential condominiums. Phillips&#x27;s lawyers ultimately deemed the exterior exit staircase a safety risk, and Phillips subsequently used the building only for storage. The Bartlesville Museum (later the Price Tower Arts Center, or PTAC) opened at the Price Tower in 1990, becoming its only tenant and occupying some ground-floor space. Under an agreement with Phillips, the museum was allowed to occupy the building without paying rent. The OK Mozart International Music Festival and the Landmark Preservation Council also moved into the building. In addition, tours of the building were given one day a week by the early 1990s.

Phillips began replacing the tower&#x27;s roof in 1994, and the building was placed for sale the next year. After the Bartlesville Museum expressed interest in buying the tower in early 1996, Phillips agreed to postpone the building&#x27;s sale for a year. Local residents formed the Price Tower Preservation Committee that May to raise $10 million for the building, including $5–6 million for maintenance. Phillips agreed in August 1998 to donate the building to the PTAC after the arts center raised a $3.5 million endowment fund for the tower&#x27;s future operation. Subsequently, the art center asked charitable foundations to donate to the endowment fund. The spire was also restored in 1998, followed the next year by the facade. The same year, the PTAC restored Bruce Goff&#x27;s apartment, and the organization received $125,000 for furnishings and educational programming. The family of Phillips&#x27;s chief executive C. J. Silas also donated $3.2 million for the building&#x27;s restoration, as well as $4 million to fund the PTAC&#x27;s programs.

=== 21st century ===

==== PTAC takeover and renovation ====

Phillips Petroleum donated the building to the PTAC in either 2000 or 2001. Following an extensive renovation, the tower was rededicated on February 10, 2001. As part of a second phase of renovations, the PTAC wished to convert part of the Price Tower into a hotel and a restaurant, profits from which would be used to help maintain the tower. Wendy Evans Joseph was hired to convert the middle stories into a boutique hotel, the Inn at Price Tower, for $2.1 million, of which $1.9 million was raised privately. The interior layout was largely preserved, and some objects were placed into storage. The hotel opened in April 2003. Joseph designed the Copper Bar and Restaurant on the 15th and 16th stories, and the PTAC renovated the lobby and penthouse suite as well.

The British architect Zaha Hadid was commissioned to design an expansion of the PTAC in 2002. The expansion was planned to cost $15 million, and it would have covered or . The annex&#x27;s design was inspired by that of the original building, with triangular motifs, and was boomerang-shaped. Had the annex been built, it would have included three galleries, classrooms, offices, and an auditorium. Most of the art center&#x27;s collection would have been moved to this annex, freeing up space in the original building for the hotel and restaurant. Although Hadid&#x27;s design was showcased at New York&#x27;s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2006, the expansion was never completed.

The PTAC proposed adding a sculpture garden next to the tower in 2004, and the office interiors were restored in the mid-2000s. The penthouse was restored to its original condition, reopening in 2006 as part of the PTAC. For the penthouse suite&#x27;s restoration, the PTAC received $20,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts and $6,740 from the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Fund for Historic Interiors. Ambler Architects, which had helped restore the Price Tower, moved into one of the offices. The Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy gave the Silas family a preservation award in 2006 for their work restoring the Price Tower. The Inn at Price Tower became a popular attraction, with visitors from around the world, and its opening helped revive Bartlesville&#x27;s economy. The Copper restaurant closed temporarily in 2009 due to the 2000s financial crisis, but the bar remained open. The museum also struggled financially during the 2000s financial crisis.

The building had 30,000 annual visitors by 2014, and visitation increased in the late 2010s. The Copper Restaurant and Bar&#x27;s chefs-in-residence program, and the Pioneer Woman Museum in nearby Ponca City, Oklahoma, were credited with increasing the Price Tower&#x27;s popularity. The PTAC also formed a partnership with the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, where another Wright–designed building, the Bachman–Wilson House, was being used as an exhibit. In 2017, the PTAC received a $75,000 matching funds grant through the Getty Foundation&#x27;s Keeping It Modern program. The grant was used to hire a team of conservationists led by Gunny Harboe, who began devising plans for the building&#x27;s preservation in November 2019. At the time, PTAC director Scott Amble said the building was prone to flooding and lacked insulation.

==== Sale and closure ====

By 2022, the Price Tower experienced financial issues due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, decreased revenue and donations, and the deaths of two Silas family members. The PTAC voted in February 2023 to sell the building to Copper Tree Inc., which took over the tower that March for a nominal fee of $10. At the time, the building was reportedly $500,000 or $600,000 in debt, for which Copper Tree took over responsibility. The Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy also held an easement on the building, requiring the owners to pay insurance and maintain the building, among other things. Cynthia Blanchard, one of the principals in Copper Tree, had planned to renovate the tower to attract technology-related tenants. The renovation was initially planned to cost $10 million and include upgrades to mechanical systems, elevators, and windows. Work on the renovation had not started by 2024. The Bartlesville Development Authority also offered $88,000 in tax incentives to attract two restaurants to the building. Copper Tree began selling off the tower&#x27;s furniture and decorations in April 2024, despite opposition from local residents and the PTAC. The owner of Tulsa&#x27;s Mayo Hotel, John Snyder, offered to buy the tower for $1.4 million that May.

By mid-2024, Copper Tree owed more than $2 million. Blanchard claimed that, even though the hotel, restaurant, and bar had been truncated to three-day-a-week operation, Copper Tree was still not receiving enough revenue from rent. As a result, in August, Copper Tree announced that the tower would close on September 1. The hotel was closed immediately, and most employees were fired. In addition, tenants received 30-day eviction notices, and Copper Tree sold more furniture. Visit Bartlesville, the city&#x27;s tourism agency, said at the time that the Price Tower was the city&#x27;s most popular attraction. The Price Tower was supposed to have been sold at an auction in early October 2024, which was halted amid a lawsuit from Snyder&#x27;s company, McFarlin Building LLC, over whether an earlier sale agreement covering the structure was still active. McFarlin alleged that Blanchard had agreed to sell the building to Snyder before reneging. Copper Tree also sued the Wright Building Conservancy in mid-October, requesting that a judge nullify the conservancy&#x27;s liens on the building. The building was scheduled to go up for bid again in mid-November, but that auction was also canceled. 

The Wright Building Conservancy filed a counterclaim in December 2024, saying that Copper Tree had violated the easement, which the organization claimed was still valid. In addition, the building&#x27;s owners owed the Oklahoma Tax Commission at least $9,000. The utilities were temporarily shut off before a judge ordered them to be reinstated. In January 2025, a Washington County judge ruled that the tower had to be sold to McFarlin for $1.4 million; at the time, Copper Tree and Green Copper Holdings reportedly had only $216 in assets. In February, the judge confirmed the sale would go through, with the proceeds to be held by the court until all claims were considered, which prompted Blanchard to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection shortly after. Timing of the sale remained unclear, however. Meanwhile, as the interior remained closed, Visit Bartlesville gave tours of the tower&#x27;s exterior.

== Architecture ==
The Price Tower, a 19-story building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, measures tall from ground level to the tip of the building&#x27;s spire. Excluding the spire, the building is tall. The main tower is divided into a two-story base and a 17-story upper section, which includes a three-story penthouse. There is a two-story annex adjacent to the base.

Wright nicknamed the Price Tower &quot;the tree that escaped the crowded forest&quot;, referring both to the building&#x27;s design and to his original plans for a New York skyscraper. The Price Tower has been described either as Wright&#x27;s only completed skyscraper or one of his only two completed towers, the other being the Johnson Wax Headquarters&#x27; research tower. The building is divided into quadrants, of which one originally contained double-height apartments, while the other three were for offices. One of the quadrants is slightly smaller than the others.

=== Facade ===

As designed, each elevation of the main tower measures wide. The building is asymmetrical, and each elevation has a different appearance. The facade panels are suspended from the floor slabs, and most of the exterior decorations are made of copper. The facade includes louvers to help shield the interiors from sunlight. The louvers are wide and were oxidized into a blue-green color before they were installed. The louvers on the office sections of the building are arranged horizontally, while those on the residential section are arranged vertically. The horizontal louvers were intended to keep out the wind and rain while also blocking direct sunlight, while the vertical louvers are placed on the southwest corner, which has the most exposure to sunlight throughout the day. On the 16th-story terrace are movable louvers. There are also embossed copper spandrels embedded into the ends of the concrete floor slabs, which are decorated with a motif loosely resembling the floor plans. Wright anticipated that the spandrels would change color as they aged.

The rest of the facade is generally made of poured concrete, which is covered with stucco. All exterior trim is made of aluminum, while the exterior lamps are made of copper. The glass panes were originally tinted in gold and copper hues. A reflective film was added to the windows in the late 20th century, though the film on the southeast-quadrant windows was removed in 2003. Balconies on each floor provide shade to parts of the facade, and roof gardens were planted atop the annex and the apartment balconies. Wright, a major proponent of organic architecture, believed that the roof gardens and glass-and-steel facade would help integrate the building&#x27;s interior and exterior. He envisioned the terraces as &quot;intermediaries&quot; that connected the indoors and outdoors. The facade also contains a red tile, on which Wright signed his initials.

At the ground or first story, the annex was originally divided from the main tower via a drive-through counter with vertical windows. Although the second story of the annex was physically connected to the main tower, there was no way to travel between the two parts of the building without going outside. The annex&#x27;s northern wall has an rhombus window with embossed copper bands, as well as a skylight with a copper frame. Between 1978 and 1979, the drive-through counter was enclosed, becoming the Taliesin Room. There is also a one-story storage shed to the east, which was built in the 1980s or 1990s, in addition to canopies and loggias for pedestrians and vehicles.

=== Structural and mechanical features ===

The structural core is made of four reinforced-concrete support piers extending the full height of the tower, each measuring wide by thick. The piers rest on a concrete platform below ground, which measures thick. The piers are arranged in a pinwheel configuration around a small open area in the center, forming a hollow &quot;X&quot; shape as seen from above. Utility pipes, wires, and ducts are embedded into these piers, and an air-conditioning system is placed within the piers and floor slabs. The building&#x27;s interior is divided into four air-conditioning zones, one for each quadrant; the ducts in each pier serve a different quadrant. The building is served by three air-cooling machines above the main tower&#x27;s 15th story, as well as another machine above the two-story annex.

The main tower&#x27;s floor slabs are made of reinforced concrete, while the walls are made of glass and concrete. The floor slabs taper in thickness from at the core to at the building&#x27;s perimeter. The floors are cantilevered outward, extending as much as from the crossbeams that connect each pair of piers. The cantilevered floors permitted a more flexible floor plan while also making the building one-seventh the weight of similar skyscrapers. Conversely, since the piers in the Price Tower&#x27;s core carry all of the building&#x27;s weight, this limits the extent to which the central portion of each floor could be modified. Wright himself claimed that a similar-sized building in New York&#x27;s Rockefeller Center weighed about as much as 6.1 buildings of the Price Tower&#x27;s size.

The upper stories were originally served by four elevators, one in each pier, which could fit only two to four people comfortably. Each hexagonal elevator cab covers about and was custom-made. One elevator was originally used exclusively by residents, while the other three were used by office tenants; the elevators skipped certain floors based on which quadrant they served. All four elevators could be either operated automatically or staffed by an elevator operator. There was no freight elevator because Wright thought it was redundant, given that the building&#x27;s furnishings were mostly built-in. The residential elevator shaft is no longer used, and the cab has been removed to make way for additional ducts and wires. The building was constructed with a single emergency-exit staircase, which is placed outdoors and is covered by a canopy. The stairway is also extremely narrow. The condition of the stair may have contributed to the building&#x27;s abandonment in the late 20th century, as fire-safety regulations required at least two emergency exit stairs.

=== Interior ===
As built, the Price Tower had about or of rentable space. Including corridors and other non-rentable spaces, the gross floor area was . PTAC executive Michael Christopher described Wright as having planned the building as an &quot;urban microcosm concept, where you would live, work, eat, and shop all in the same space&quot;. When the building had been designed, Wright had believed that people could live &quot;a richer, more connected life&quot; if residential and business uses were combined in one building. Each quadrant is rotated 30 degrees from the neighboring piers, except for odd-numbered stories in the southwestern quadrant&#x27;s apartments.

The floor plan is laid out around a grid of parallelograms, each composed of four 30-60-90 triangles. The parallelograms measure on each side and are spaced apart. Each floor has a usable floor area of . On each floor, were originally used for offices; the remaining space was part of an apartment. The Price Company had the 11th to 16th-floor offices, while the offices on the 3rd to 10th floors were rented out. There were eight apartments including the Prices&#x27; penthouse. The hallways are low, narrow corridors, while the rooms&#x27; ceilings descend to as low as at the building&#x27;s core. Due to the differing thicknesses of the floor slabs, the ceilings slope up toward the building&#x27;s perimeter. As seen from the side, the sloping floor slabs resembled the branches of a tree. 

Wright used a different color scheme on each floor, and he also designed the tower&#x27;s fabric and wallpaper, which were part of his Taliesin Line. Wright designed furniture for the building and specific tenants, which was mostly assembled on site.The Price Tower&#x27;s furniture is similar to pieces that Wright designed for his residential clients. Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the tower&#x27;s furniture as &quot;geometric and almost futuristic&quot;. The lighting fixtures, ventilation grilles, and built-in furniture fit within the building&#x27;s floor grid. Mahogany, aluminum, and tarnished copper are used in furniture throughout the building. Wright designed chairs with heavy aluminum bases, sloped arms, and hexagonal seatbacks, which were custom-made by a firm from Dewey, Oklahoma, and failed to sell commercially. He also designed hexagonal trash cans, as well as aluminum dining chairs and built-in upholstered wood benches for the residences. Bruce Goff donated additional furniture for the building.

==== Lower stories ====

The lobby was accessed from the north via a driveway from Dewey Avenue, as well as from Sixth Street to the south. The lobby contains a newsstand. The floor is painted Cherokee red, while the fluted, light-colored walls contain low seats. Inscribed on the walls are two quotes, adapted from the work of Walt Whitman; one is from the concluding stanza of &quot;Salut au Monde&quot;, and the other is from &quot;Song of the Broad-Axe&quot;. On the lobby&#x27;s double-height ceiling are triangular lamps with copper frames and opaque glass panes. The second story is designed as an open-air mezzanine, running from west to east.

The two-story annex covers more than 10,000 square feet. It had offices for the Public Service Company of Oklahoma, as well as a superintendent&#x27;s apartment with a living room, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. The superintendent&#x27;s apartment subsequently became a catering room for the Price Tower Arts Center, while the offices became a lobby and welcome center. When the art center moved into the building, two partition walls and a restroom were added, and the second floor was converted into exhibition space. In addition, there was a basement with laundry, storage, and garbage rooms, and a sub-basement with elevator equipment.

==== Intermediate stories ====
The 3rd to 15th floors, which contain the offices and apartments, have very similar layouts. The southwestern quadrant was devoted to residential use. There were seven double-story apartments on the 3rd through 16th floors, each occupying approximately . Generally, each apartment had a Cherokee-red floor, light-colored walls, and mahogany furniture. Although the main entrance of each apartment was on the lower level, the elevator provided access to both levels. Each apartment had a narrow entrance vestibule, with a stair leading to the upper level, as well as a small kitchen with various appliances, laminate counters, and a trash chute. The lower level also had a living–dining space, closets, and a bathroom. The upper level had two bedrooms overlooking the lower level, in addition to a bathroom and more closets. A glass skylight illuminated each apartment&#x27;s upper level, and Wright and his assistant Eugene Masselink decorated the upper-level balustrade with a copper artwork. Each apartment also had fireplaces, which were located near the core and, according to Wright, were intended to celebrate Oklahoma&#x27;s oil and gas reserves. Small balconies were placed on the exterior of each apartment. The apartments, which were unpopular because of their small size and high prices, were later converted to regular offices.

The office space on the upper stories was designed so that it could be further subdivided; tenants could install partitions along the parallelogram grid. At the 16th story is an open terrace, buffet, and kitchen, placed on a setback in one quadrant. Because of the tower&#x27;s small footprint, the &quot;Bartlesville Record&quot; wrote that &quot;every unit of space [is] an outside unit&quot;. Wright&#x27;s sketches indicate that the office spaces were to be furnished with hexagonal desks, in addition to triangular drawers with triangular knobs; at least some of these decorations were retained in the Price Company&#x27;s offices. Wright added swivel chairs and U-shaped desks in other offices to minimize office workers&#x27; movement. Wright also designed removable glass and plywood partition walls, which were placed between the different offices and were removed by the building&#x27;s later occupants.

By the 2000s, the 3rd to 6th floors had become offices for the PTAC. A boutique hotel named The Inn at Price Tower occupied the 7th to 14th floors, with 21 units in total. These include 18 single rooms and 3 duplex suites, the latter of which were converted from apartments. Some of the hotel units were two-story spaces with sleeping lofts on a balcony level. The hotel had earth-toned upholstery, reflecting the building&#x27;s original colors, in addition to furnishings and motifs inspired by Wright&#x27;s original design. There were Tibetan rugs, green curtains, and maple furniture, along with copper-accented furniture. Furniture was manufactured on-site because the elevators were too small to accommodate new furniture. The modifications were designed so they could be easily reversed if the hotel closed; for example, showers were installed in existing closets. On the 7th to 14th floors, the apartments&#x27; original bathrooms and kitchens remain in place, but the other rooms on these stories have been modified. Tours of the tower were included with room reservations.

The 15th and 16th stories were converted into Copper, a restaurant and bar, after the hotel opened. This bar had a copper countertop above a maple plywood counter, an allusion to the materials used in Wright&#x27;s original furniture. The bar&#x27;s shape referenced the curved facade of the Guggenheim Museum, which Wright also designed. In addition, the barstools and chairs were made of plywood and copper.

==== Penthouse ====
The top three stories originally functioned as an office and a duplex apartment for the Prices, occupying all four quadrants. The former corporate office is at the middle of the 17th floor, and the Price family&#x27;s living room occupies the same story. The corporate office includes a glass curtain wall. Another wall includes a full-height wood-burning fireplace. Wright designed a custom rolling chair for Harold Sr., along with four aluminum chairs for visitors. There was also a bronze lamp with a pebbled glass shade and a retractable banquette under Harold Sr.&#x27;s desk. Wright designed a mural called &quot;The Blue Moon&quot;, a reference to the phrase &quot;once in a blue moon&quot;, used as a metaphor for rare occurrences. Wright said at the time that it was very rare for &quot;the perfect design, perfect architect and perfect buyer&quot; to be present on the same project. Outside Harold Sr.&#x27;s office was another office for his assistant, with a U-shaped desk and swivel chair. There is a terrace to the north and a roof garden to the south of Harold Sr.&#x27;s office.

The 18th floor includes a conference room and bedrooms for the Prices. The conference room provides a secondary entrance to the Price apartment, whose two bedrooms are accessed by a steep staircase. The 19th floor was used as an executive office and, unlike all the other stories, was not divided into quadrants. Eugene Masselink designed a glass mural for the wall of Price&#x27;s 19th-floor office, which includes gold, copper, red, and turquoise hues. As planned, there was to be a rooftop kitchen and buffet area, an open terrace, and a television antenna above the 19th floor. The PTAC used the penthouse as a museum space after taking over.

== Management ==
The Price Tower Arts Center, the art complex at Price Tower, was founded in 1985 as a civic art museum and reorganized in 1998. The PTAC focused on art, architecture, and design, with a particular emphasis on Wright&#x27;s and Goff&#x27;s architectural works. The center provided tours of the building, in addition to displays of modern art. furniture, textiles, and design. The museum&#x27;s collection included contemporary art, including Frederic Remington sculptures, in addition to architectural works by Wright and Goff. There were also many objects collected by Bruce Goff, including 7,000 phonograph records, pieces of laundry, and paintings created using toothbrushes. In addition, the PTAC operated summer camps for art and architecture.

Before the Inn at Price Tower closed in 2024, it was a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Condé Nast listed the Inn at Price Tower as one of the world&#x27;s 100 best hotels when it opened, and the hotel was on the 2021 list of Top 25 Historic Hotels of America Most Magnificent Art Collections.

==== Contemporary ====
When plans for the Price Tower were announced in 1953, &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; magazine published a ten-page article about the planned building, saying that &quot;Never has so tall an office building been built in so small a city.&quot; A writer for the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; described the Price Tower as &quot;a slender, blade-like building&quot;, and &quot;Americas&quot; magazine wrote that the Price Tower &quot;reveals Wright&#x27;s curious concept of skyscrapers&quot;. The &quot;Bartlesville Record&quot; predicted that the Price Tower would help bring good publicity to Oklahoma.

When the building was completed, it was one of the most widely discussed skyscrapers in the U.S., and it was depicted in magazines such as &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot;. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote that it was &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most modern buildings&quot;. Thomas W. Ennis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the Price Tower a seeming &quot;reversal of the natural order of things&quot;, and the &quot;Enid Daily Eagle&quot; called the Price Tower &quot;perhaps the most notable achievement in art in Oklahoma&quot; during 1955. The Nowata, Oklahoma, &quot;Daily Star&quot; regarded the tower as &quot;slim and graceful&quot;, and the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; wrote that the building &quot;adds a distinctive note&quot; to Bartlesville&#x27;s downtown. The author Allan Temko said that, even though the Price Tower &quot;makes use of standard parts, mass produced by machine technology&quot;, it was a good example of Wright&#x27;s organic architecture. Conversely, critics likened the Price Tower to a hood ornament and a spaceship, and people derided it as &quot;Price&#x27;s folly&quot;. The British architectural writer Ian Nairn called the tower &quot;the saddest case of an unrealized focus&quot; because it was set back from the city&#x27;s street grid and, thus, did not readily attract passersby&#x27;s attention.

The &quot;Bartlesville Morning Examiner&quot; wrote in 1957 that many publications had ranked the Price Tower among Wright&#x27;s best works or among the best new buildings. Depictions of the tower were displayed at Expo 58 in Brussels, and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) also hosted an exhibit in Washington, D.C., with photos of the tower. The United States Information Agency displayed pictures of the Price Tower overseas as part of campaigns promoting Oklahoma. When Wright died in 1959, Walter H. Stern of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;to attribute a single architectural style to Mr. Wright would be a misjudgment of his art&quot;, citing the contrasts between the Price Tower and Wright&#x27;s Taliesin studio.

==== Retrospective ====
The Price Tower received the Twenty-five Year Award from the AIA in 1983; as the AIA said, &quot;The Price Tower is an embodiment of [Wright&#x27;s] organic philosophy that buildings should grow out of the ground.&quot; The Price Tower was the third Wright–designed building to receive the award, after Taliesin West and the Johnson Wax Headquarters, and the first building in Oklahoma to be so recognized. The AIA&#x27;s Oklahoma chapter also voted the Price Tower as one of the state&#x27;s ten best buildings, and &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot; listed it as one of the few buildings in Oklahoma that had garnered national attention. A writer for &quot;&quot; said in 1982 that &quot;The very complexity of the building [...] gives particular identity to each space within&quot;. Although Paul Goldberger wrote that the Price Tower was &quot;full of Wright&#x27;s tense, energetic desire to break out of the box&quot;, he felt that it was not &quot;a major building of the twentieth century&quot; because it had languished as an unfinished project for too long. Jane Holtz Kay of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote in 1983 that Wright had not been properly recognized for his work, even though the Price Tower and his other designs &quot;make him a model for architecture&#x27;s latest high-rise hipsters&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the Price Tower &quot;presides over this city of 36,000 with a strange totemic power&quot;, while &quot;Architectural Record&quot; wrote that the building was &quot;as much a social manifesto as a work of architecture&quot;. The architect Tadao Ando described the Price Tower as one of the most important 20th-century buildings. A writer for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine described the building as &quot;easily one of the more bizarre towers ever built&quot;. Observers also wrote about the small sizes of spaces such as elevators. Blair Kamin of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, reviewing the hotel rooms, felt them to be &quot;an exemplary exercise in the art of respectful contrast&quot; despite the cramped spaces. A writer for the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; said in 2016 that the Price Tower was an &quot;engineering marvel in the middle of the prairie&quot; that architecture students, architects, and engineers came to visit.

=== Media ===
Shortly after the Price Tower was completed, Wright wrote a book about the building&#x27;s construction, &quot;The Story of the Tower&quot;, in which he compared the floors to the branches of a tree. Joe Price, who produced a film about the tower&#x27;s development, recalled that &quot;the true building itself became visible to me&quot; one day while the louvers were being installed on the facade. The book &quot;Prairie Skyscraper: Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Price Tower&quot;, published in 2005, includes essays about and photographs of the building, and the 2014 book &quot;Frank Lloyd Wright: Preservation, Design, and Adding to Iconic Buildings&quot; also includes an essay about the Price Tower. Wendy Evans Joseph, who designed the building&#x27;s hotel, also created a pop-up book featuring the tower.

=== Landmark designations ===

The Price Tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1974. It is one of several NRHP sites in Bartlesville, along with LaQuinta, the Old Washington County Courthouse, and the Frank Phillips Home. The building was further nominated for a National Historic Landmark designation in 2006. On March 29, 2007, the United States Department of the Interior designated the building as a National Historic Landmark; at the time, it was one of 20 such sites in Oklahoma. In designating the building, the Interior Department described the structure as embodying &quot;the powerful architectural idea of the cantilevered tower&quot;.

In 2008, the U.S. National Park Service submitted the Price Tower, along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties, to a tentative list for World Heritage status. The Price Tower and ten other Wright buildings were renominated to the list in 2011. Ten buildings including the Price Tower were again nominated to the World Heritage List in 2015, but after the UNESCO World Heritage Committee rejected this nomination, the Price Tower was removed from the proposed listing. UNESCO ultimately added eight properties to the World Heritage List in July 2019 under the title &quot;The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;; the Price Tower was not one of them.

=== Exhibits and architectural influence ===
After the building was announced, models of it were displayed at Tulsa&#x27;s Petroleum Exposition, Bartlesville&#x27;s First National Bank, New York City&#x27;s American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Guggenheim Museum during 1953 alone. The building was also depicted in a 1954 exhibit about Wright&#x27;s work at Los Angeles&#x27;s Barnsdall Art Park, the Bartlesville Museum&#x27;s first exhibit in 1990, and an exhibit at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in 1994. In addition, a custom chair from the building was exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1991, and MoMA owns a model of the building. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the tower&#x27;s opening, the PTAC hosted a traveling exhibit on the building&#x27;s history in 2005. The tower itself also attracted visitors from around the world.

The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; wrote that the building &quot;has been imitated but never duplicated&quot;. The Price Tower&#x27;s design may have inspired that of the Citizens Bank Tower (now The Classen) in Oklahoma City, which was designed by the architectural firm Bozalis &amp; Roloff. Other projects based on the Price Tower&#x27;s design include a Domino&#x27;s Pizza headquarters in Michigan, as well as Wright&#x27;s Crystal Heights towers in Washington, D.C.. Another of Wright&#x27;s buildings, Point View Residences, also used a parallelogram floor grid, though that building was not finished during his lifetime. Wright&#x27;s unfinished design for The Illinois, a mile-high skyscraper, was loosely derived from the cantilevered structure of the Price Tower and Tokyo&#x27;s Imperial Hotel. The concept of mixed residential and office skyscrapers did gain popularity; Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Price Tower&#x27;s mix of uses as having been copied by buildings such as the Olympic Tower and the Galleria in New York. The designs of other buildings, such as the interiors of Bachman–Wilson House in Arkansas, The Arlington in North Carolina, and the Morton International Building in Illinois, have been compared to that of the Price Tower.

Harold Jr. also commissioned Wright to design a house in Bartlesville, which became known as Hillside. The Usonian–style home has two stories and an L-shaped hipped roof. The Price Tower and Hillside are two of the only three Wright buildings in Oklahoma; the other is Westhope in Tulsa. The Price family, impressed with the Price Tower&#x27;s construction, asked Wright to design a house in the desert in Phoenix, Arizona. The neighboring Bartlesville Community Center was designed by Wright&#x27;s apprentice and son-in-law William Wesley Peters; the city&#x27;s decision to hire Peters was influenced in part by the presence of the Price Tower. Reproductions of the tower&#x27;s furniture have also been sold.

Other syndicated programming includes &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot;, &quot;The Mark Levin Show&quot;, &quot;The Larry Elder Show&quot;, &quot;The Dave Ramsey Show&quot;, and &quot;Red Eye Radio&quot;.

==History==

WROK was a very popular Top 40 music station in Rockford during the 1970s. Sister station WZOK carries on the Top 40 heritage, although that station&#x27;s format has shifted toward hot adult contemporary in recent years.

The WROK callsign was used in the 1996 movie &quot;Down Periscope&quot;. During the scene where Nitro (Toby Huss) is making a call fingering wire connections to Admiral Graham (Bruce Dern) for Captain Dodge (Kelsey Grammer) Nitro passes the phone to Captain Dodge. Captain Dodge is then heard saying &quot;Stairway to Heaven, Led Zeppelin, 1971.&quot; He passes the phone back to Nitro saying he answered the WROK question of the day, followed by &quot;Now get me Admiral Graham.&quot;

On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare would acquire 53 Cumulus Media stations, including WROK, for $238 million. The deal was part of Cumulus&#x27; acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global were both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The transaction was consummated effective November 14, 2013.

<text>The Mierscheid law is a satirical forecast hypothesis based on a spurious relationship, published in the German magazine &quot;Vorwärts&quot; on 14 July 1983 and attributed to the fictitious politician Jakob Maria Mierscheid. It forecasts the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD)&#x27;s share of the popular vote based on the size of crude steel production in the old states that used to make up West Germany:

There is a special rule for early elections. One then has to take the arithmetic mean of the regular and early year of election.

The last corroboration of the law was in the 2002 election, where the West German crude steel production was 38.6 million tonnes, and the vote share of the SPD 38.5%. For the early election in 2005 the vote share was 38.4%, with a mean crude steel value of 40.0 million tonnes. Over the last ten elections, the two values were within two units nine times, and within one unit seven times.

==Possible refutation of the hypothesis in 2005==

In the German federal elections of 18 September 2005 (which were originally due to be held in 2006), the law appeared not to hold, since the SPD obtained 34.3% of the relevant votes while the crude steel production of the &quot;old&quot; &quot;Länder&quot; (i.e. those states that belonged to the Federal Republic of Germany before reunification) in the previous year was 39.9 million tonnes.

However, an article attributed to Jakob Mierscheid, published on the German Federal Parliament&#x27;s website provided a correction to the hypothesis, to take account of the special situation. Since the elections had been brought forward, it was argued that the last months of the year should be discounted, yielding a steel production figure of 33.5 million tonnes. The graph included in the article showed a good match, thus supporting the (corrected) hypothesis. This &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypothesis alteration might be considered an example of the Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

Following the 2005 elections, an article was published by the statistical office of the state of Baden-Württemberg attempting to further refine the model in the form of the Mierscheid-Walla law. This article also mentions promising but inconclusive attempts to replace steel production with other measures that exhibited a degree of apparent correlation, such as the export value of automobiles, employment levels in the field of legal advice, the price of coffee, and the number of accidents on town roads.

<text>Gérard Pelletier (; June 21, 1919 – June 22, 1997) was a Canadian journalist and politician.

== Career ==
Pelletier initially worked as a journalist for &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, a French-language newspaper in Montreal, Quebec. In 1961 he became editor-in-chief of the Montreal daily and North America&#x27;s largest French circulating newspaper, &quot;La Presse&quot;. Pelletier, with other French-Canadian intellectuals, Pierre Elliott Trudeau included, founded the journal &quot;Cité Libre&quot;. First elected to Parliament in 1965, he served as a member of the cabinet of Pierre Elliott Trudeau.

In 1964 he made a small appearance in Denis Héroux&#x27;s student film &quot;Over My Head (Jusqu&#x27;au cou)&quot;, as himself in a political debate.

Pelletier met Trudeau while studying in France and worked with him and Jean Marchand during the Asbestos Strike of 1949 in Quebec. Dubbed the &quot;Three Wise Men&quot; in English and &quot;Les trois colombes&quot; (The three doves) in French, they entered politics at the same time in the federal election of 1965. The trio was recruited by Liberal prime minister Lester Pearson to help derail the rising Quebec separatist movement.

He served in various cabinet posts in the Trudeau government until 1975 (Secretary of State: 1968–1973, Minister of Communications: 1973–5), when he left the Liberal caucus and became ambassador to France and then ambassador to the United Nations (1981–1984). In 1978 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

<text>TV Nova is a commercial television station in the Czech Republic. It began broadcasting in February 1994 as the first privately held nationwide Czech TV station. Its first CEO was Vladimír Železný. It quickly achieved the largest market share in the country and remained in this position until the early 2010s.

==History==
During the 1990s, Nova produced a number of comedy shows, featuring actors like Jiří Lábus and Oldřich Kaiser. The channel also created its own quiz show.

The channel attracted some notoriety for its late-night nude weather reports (&quot;Počasíčko&quot;), in which a female (and later male) presenter would appear naked to present the weather. The presenter would then put on clothes appropriate to the weather being forecast.

Disputes between broadcasting license holder CET 21 and financial supplier CME resulted in an international arbitration (&quot;CME/Lauder v. Czech Republic&quot;) which ended with the Czech Republic forced to pay CME compensation of 353 million USD (approx. 10 billion CZK).

Vladimír Železný sold CET 21 to the financial group PPF of Petr Kellner, and now TV Nova is owned by CME. The current CEOs are Klára Brachtlová and Jan Vlček.

==Nova HD==
Since October 2008, TV Nova is broadcast in high definition quality via satellite, cable, and also a test airing via DVB-T is in progress. Currently the signal is broadcast in 1920×1080i with a bitrate of 18 Mbit/s.

<text>The Rainbow Family of Living Light is a counter-culture, in existence since approximately 1970. It is a loose affiliation of individuals, some nomadic, generally asserting that it has no leader. They put on yearly, primitive camping events on public land known as Rainbow Gatherings.

== Origins and practices ==

The Rainbow Family was created out of the Vortex I gathering at Milo McIver State Park in Estacada, Oregon (30 miles south of Portland, Oregon), from August 28 to September 3, 1970. Inspired in large part by the first Woodstock Festival, two attendees at Vortex, Barry &quot;Plunker&quot; Adams and Garrick Beck, are both considered among the founders of the Rainbow Family. Adams emerged from the Haight-Ashbury scene in San Francisco and is the author of &quot;Where Have All the Flower Children Gone?&quot; Beck is the son of Julian Beck, founder of The Living Theatre, known for their production &quot;Paradise Now!&quot;

The first official Rainbow Family Gathering was held at the Strawberry Lake, Colorado, on the Continental Divide, in 1972. Use of this site was offered by Paul Geisendorfer, a local developer, after a court order was issued against their gathering at the original location on nearby Table Mountains.

Regional Rainbow Gatherings are held throughout the year in the United States, as are annual and regional gatherings in dozens of other countries. These Gatherings are non-commercial, and all who wish to attend peacefully are welcome to participate. There are no leaders, and traditionally the Gatherings last for a week, with the primary focus being on gathering on public land on the Fourth of July in the U.S., when attendees pray, meditate, and/or observe silence in a group effort to focus on world peace. Most gatherings elsewhere in the world last a month from new moon to new moon, with the full moon being the peak celebration. Rainbow Gatherings emphasize a spiritual focus towards peace, love, and unity.

Those who attend Rainbow Gatherings usually share an interest in intentional communities, ecology, spirituality, and entheogens. Attendees refer to one another as &quot;brother&quot;, &quot;sister&quot;, or the gender neutral term, &quot;sibling&quot;. Attendance is open to all interested parties, and decisions are reached through group meetings leading to some form of group consensus. Adherents call the camp &quot;Rainbowland&quot; and refer to the world outside of gatherings as &quot;Babylon&quot;. The exchange of money is frowned upon, and barter is stressed as an alternative.

== Goals ==

The organization is a loose, international affiliation of individuals who have a stated goal of trying to achieve peace and love on Earth. Participants make the claim that they are the &quot;largest non-organization of non-members in the world.&quot; In addition to referring to itself as a non-organization, the group&#x27;s &quot;non-members&quot; also even playfully call the group a &quot;disorganization.&quot;

There are no official leaders or structure, no official spokespersons, and no formalized membership. Strictly speaking, the only goals are set by each individual, as no individual can claim to represent all Rainbows in word or deed. Also contained within the philosophy are the ideals of creating an intentional community, embodying spirituality and conscious evolution, and practicing non-commercialism.

== Gatherings ==

The Rainbow Family is best known for its large annual American Gatherings (i.e., U.S. &quot;Nationals&quot; or &quot;Annuals&quot;) which are held on U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (or B.L.M.) land. These U.S. Annual Gatherings usually attract between 8,000 and 20,000 participants.

In addition to these larger U.S. Annuals, individuals practice this throughout the year in dozens of other countries. &quot;World Gatherings&quot; are also held from time to time in various countries. Other activities include regional Gatherings (or Regionals) and retreats. There are also small, local activities such as local drum circles, potlucks, music related events, and campouts.

The first European Rainbow gathering took place in 1983. In 1992, American immigrants organized the first Rainbow gathering in Israel, which was extended to six weeks.

Money is not used (or not encouraged), camps set up kitchens to share food, and there is a circle on the Fourth of July to pray for peace.

Colorado law enforcement agencies and the U.S. Forest Service indicated they expected a month-long gathering in 2022 for the 50th anniversary of the first official Gathering.

== Controversy ==

An outbreak of shigellosis (bloody diarrhoea) occurred at the 1987 gathering in Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest in Graham County, North Carolina, in the remote southwestern NC Great Smoky Mountains. Hundreds of participants were sickened, overwhelming area hospitals and EMS agencies. Graham County had no hospital. As Graham County&#x27;s small EMS and five ambulances were overwhelmed, dozens of ambulances from as far away as Jackson County and the Eastern Band Cherokee reserve were dispatched. The outbreak was attributed to poor hygiene. The county sheriff requested outside law enforcement assistance. NC Governor Jim Martin ordered deployment of 50 NC state troopers, 25 state game wardens, and additional SBI agents. Dozens of deputies and police officers from surrounding jurisdictions, and over 75 US Forest Service law enforcement officers and agents responded from as far away as Alabama. State and federal criminal charges included hundreds of traffic and alcohol citations, with impoundment of dozens of vehicles. Hundreds of criminal charges included disorderly conduct, indecent exposure, DWI, alcohol violations, revoked licenses, stolen tags, stolen vehicles, drug charges, child neglect, weapons violations, assault, interfering with peace officers and at least one kidnapping. A prison department bus was called to handle the volume of arrestees. County jails in all of the southwestern NC counties were filled on July 4 weekend. Federal, state and local officers eventually charged a remaining group that refused to leave with trespassing on federal land, to bring the event to a close.

A parvovirus outbreak among the dogs at a 2006 Rainbow Gathering in Big Red Park required 200 doses of vaccine and cost the Routt County Humane Society $800. Although Rainbow Family spokespeople have stated that the group removes its trash after gatherings, the Forest Service has criticized their cleanup efforts as being only &quot;cosmetic&quot; and &quot;not rehabilitation by any stretch of the imagination.&quot;

In Montana in 2000, then-governor Marc Racicot declared a &quot;state of emergency&quot; because of fears of the coming environmental destruction of the Rainbows on the National Forest. A year later, Dennis Havig, the District ranger from the nearby town of Wisdom, commented that &quot;There were 23,000 people here and you can find virtually no trash. There&#x27;s an aspect of diminished vegetation, but you&#x27;d have to look hard to see the damage. The untrained eye isn&#x27;t going to see it.&quot;

Summit County health officials also had a positive assessment of the site, said Bob Swensen, environmental director for the agency: &quot;My opinion is, it looks as if no one had been there,&quot; Swensen concluded. &quot;I&#x27;d have to give them an &#x27;A&#x27; for their cleanup.&quot;

At the California National Gathering in 2004, in Modoc County, after public health officials reported speaking with their counterparts in Utah, opted to take preventive measures apart from law enforcement, which the Utah individuals found to be the source of many of the problems encountered at their event. The Public Health Department reported that the Forest Service officers were observed being confrontational and antagonistic toward the Rainbows at the Gathering site, which &quot;did not facilitate a cooperative response from the Rainbows,&quot; the report states. &quot;The explanation that was given is that this was an illegal gathering because no permit had been signed. However, even after the permit had been signed, this attitude was unchanged.&quot;

After the 2005 Rainbow Gathering in the National Forest near Richwood, West Virginia, Mayor Bob Henry Baber stated: &quot;I never saw one bit of any activity that required any Forest Service legal intervention.&quot; He calls the Incident Management Team &quot;bizarre and unnecessary,&quot; and adds that he was not put off by the Rainbows or their behavior.

In an effort at self-policing and conflict resolution, Rainbow attendees have created a method they call &quot;Shanti Sena,&quot; that involve peaceful nonviolent community response to issues. It is used in emergencies or serious conflict, as a call for help, and responders with a variety of skills show up to help facilitate a solution to the problem.

In 1980, two young women were shot to death in late June while hitchhiking to the Rainbow Gathering at Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia, and members were questioned about possible involvement. There had been tension between local residents and the &quot;hippies&quot;, and police concluded local men led by Greenbrier County resident Jacob Beard were responsible. Beard was convicted in 1999, but exonerated on appeal in 2000 and received a $2 million settlement for wrongful conviction. White supremacist Joseph Paul Franklin confessed to the murders but later revealed he had just read about them. The killers remain at large and filmmaker Julia Huffman is working on a documentary, &quot;The Rainbow Murders&quot;, hoping to bring more facts to light.

There were three non-fatal stabbings at a gathering in Colorado in 2014. The same year, a woman was found dead at a Rainbow Gathering in Utah. In early 2015, there was a fatal shooting at a gathering in Florida.

In 2015, a group of Native American academics and writers issued a statement against the Rainbow Family members who are &quot;appropriating and practicing faux Native ceremonies and beliefs. These actions, although Rainbows may not realize, dehumanize us as an indigenous Nation because they imply our culture and humanity, like our land, is anyone&#x27;s for the taking.&quot; The signatories specifically named this misappropriation as &quot;cultural exploitation.&quot; On July 4 of the same year, the Winnemem Wintu issued a cease and desist letter, on behalf of itself and the Pit River and Modoc tribes, ordering the Rainbow Family off of sacred and sensitive lands in Shasta–Trinity National Forest.

== Misrepresentation of Hopi legend ==

There has been a longstanding Rainbow rumor that the group is recognized by the elders of the Hopi people, or other Indigenous peoples of the Americas, as the fulfilment of a Native American prophecy, and that this excuses the cultural appropriation that is common in the group. This rumor was debunked as fakelore by Michael I. Niman in his 1997 &quot;People of the Rainbow: A Nomadic Utopia.&quot; Niman traced the supposed Hopi prophecies to the 1962 book &quot;Warriors of the Rainbow&quot; by William Willoya and Vinson Brown, which compares prophecies of major religious sects throughout the world with tales of visions from various Indigenous cultures. The fake prophecy was written by non-Natives as part of an Evangelical Christian agenda; Niman describes the source as purveying &quot;a covert anti-Semitism throughout, while evangelizing against traditional Native American spirituality.&quot;

<text>Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets is a book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb that deals with the fallibility of human knowledge. It was first published in 2001. Updated editions were released a few years later. The book is the first part of Taleb&#x27;s multi-volume philosophical essay on uncertainty, titled the &quot;Incerto&quot;, which also includes &quot;The Black Swan&quot; (2007–2010), &quot;The Bed of Procrustes&quot; (2010–2016), &quot;Antifragile&quot; (2012), and &quot;Skin in the Game&quot; (2018).

==Thesis==
Taleb sets forth the idea that modern humans are often unaware of the existence of randomness. They tend to explain random outcomes as non-random.

Human beings:
# overestimate causality, e.g., they see elephants in the clouds instead of understanding that they are in fact randomly shaped clouds that appear to our eyes as elephants (or something else);
# tend to view the world as more explainable than it really is. So they look for explanations even when there are none.

Other misperceptions of randomness that are discussed include:
* Survivorship bias. We see the winners and try to learn from them, while forgetting the huge number of losers.
* Skewed distributions. Many real life phenomena are not 50:50 bets like tossing a coin, but have various unusual and counter-intuitive distributions. An example of this is a 99:1 bet in which you almost always win, but when you lose, you lose all your savings. People can easily be fooled by statements like &quot;I won this bet 50 times&quot;. According to Taleb: &quot;Option sellers, it is said, eat like chickens and go to the bathroom like elephants&quot;, which is to say, option sellers may earn a steady small income from selling the options, but when a disaster happens they lose a fortune.

==Reaction==
The book was selected by &quot;Fortune&quot; as one of the 75 &quot;Smartest Books of All Time.&quot; &quot;U.S.A Today&quot; recounted that many criticisms raised in this book of the financial industry turned out to be justified. &quot;Forbes&quot; described the book as being playful, self-effacing and at times insufferably arrogant, but always thought provoking. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (one of the publications which receives more favourable comments in this book) said that the book was to conventional Wall Street wisdom what Martin Luther’s ninety-nine &quot;[sic]&quot; theses were to the Catholic Church.

==Editions==
*In 2001, TEXERE published the first edition of the book. (, London : Texere, 2001)
*In 2004, TEXERE published a revamped second edition.
*In 2005, Random House published a softback edition with more changes. (, New York : Random house, 2005)
*In 2005, a French version appeared, with many unique changes.
*The book has been translated into 20 languages, and is reported to have sold over half a million copies.
*Further editions have been published by Penguin (softback, May 2007) and Random House (hardback, October 2008.)

<doc id="585780" wikidata="Q1192514" url="?curid=585780" title="Galaxian">
<text>is a 1979 fixed shooter video game developed and published by Namco for arcades. The player assumes control of the Galaxip starfighter in its mission to protect Earth from waves of aliens. Gameplay involves destroying each formation of aliens, who dive down towards the player in an attempt to hit them.

Designed by company engineer Kazunori Sawano, &quot;Galaxian&quot; was Namco&#x27;s answer to &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, a similar space shooter released the previous year by rival developer Taito. &quot;Space Invaders&quot; was a sensation in Japan, and Namco wanted a game that could compete against it. Sawano strove to make the game simplistic and easy to understand. He was inspired by the cinematic space combat scenes in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, with enemies originally being in the shape of the film&#x27;s TIE Fighters. &quot;Galaxian&quot; is one of the first video games to feature RGB color graphics and the first ever to use a tile-based hardware system, which was capable of animated multi-color sprites as well as scrolling, though the latter was limited to the starfield background while the game itself remained a fixed shooter.

&quot;Galaxian&quot; was Namco&#x27;s first major arcade video game hit. It was the second highest-grossing arcade video game of 1979 and 1980 in Japan and the second highest-grossing of 1980 in the United States, where it became one of the best-selling arcade games of all time with 50,000 arcade units sold by 1982. The game was celebrated for its gameplay and use of true color graphics. In retrospect, it has gained fame for its historical importance and technological accomplishments. Its success led to several sequels and reimaginings, most notably &quot;Galaga&quot;, which surpassed it in popularity. &quot;Galaxian&quot; has also been ported to many home systems and is included in numerous Namco compilations.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Galaxian&quot; is a space-themed fixed shooter. The player controls a starship called the &quot;Galaxip&quot;, the objective being to clear each round of aliens. The enemies appear in formation towards the top of the screen, with two escort ships, labeled the &quot;Galaxian Flagship&quot; or &quot;Galboss&quot;. Enemies will make a divebomb towards the bottom of the screen while shooting projectiles in an attempt to hit the player. The Galaxip can only fire a single shot at a time, and the player must wait for it to either hit an enemy or the top of the screen before being able to fire another, due to limitations of the hardware.

Flagships will make a divebomb with two red escort ships - shooting all three of these will award the player bonus points, with extra points awarded to the destruction of the flagship. Enemy movement will increase as the game progresses alongside the number of shots that the enemies fire. Rounds are indicated by small flags at the bottom of the screen. The game&#x27;s attract mode featured a slim scenario, reading &quot;WE ARE THE GALAXIANS. MISSION: DESTROY ALIENS&quot;.

==Development==
&quot;Galaxian&quot; was designed by Kazunori Sawano, who had previously worked on many of Namco&#x27;s electro-mechanical shooting gallery arcade games, notably &quot;Shoot Away&quot; (1977). Early in the game&#x27;s development, Taito had released &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in Japan, which swept the country by storm and helped turn the video game industry into a highly-profitable business. To help capitalize on the game&#x27;s success, Namco president Masaya Nakamura ordered Sawano to make the best &quot;post-Invaders&quot; game they could, which put a vast amount of pressure on the development team. Although development of the game lasted six months, Sawano had made several ideas half a year before production began.

Sawano and his team set out to make a game anybody could play, using a &quot;simple is best&quot; motto during production – this helped trim away large-scale ideas in favor of a game that could loop endlessly and be able to use only two enemy types. Alongside &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, a large portion of the game was inspired by &quot;Star Wars&quot;, specifically its large-scale space battles. Sawano had wanted to replicate the feeling of a space battle, specifically with the game&#x27;s sound effects. Several back-and-forth sound effects were made, many being rejected by Sawano for not matching his vision. The game was Namco&#x27;s first arcade game to be composed with a synthesizer.

Game balance was an important part of the game, as Sawano did not want to make the game suddenly spike in difficulty with no build-up or warning; the development team made the number of enemies on-screen the same and gradually increased the difficulty as the player progresses, becoming more noticeable in later stages. The enemies themselves were designed to have a personality of their own, programmed to monitor the player&#x27;s movements and make attacks based on them - early in development, Sawano had envisioned the enemies to resemble TIE Fighters from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. To save up on hardware memory and processing, programmers created a tilemap hardware model, which created a set of 8x8 pixel tiles – this reduced processing and memory requirements up to 64 times, compared to the framebuffer model used in &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. The game&#x27;s hardware was also capable of features such as multi-color sprites, sprite animation, and scrolling, though the game remained a fixed shooter with a scrolling effect only used for the starfield background.

==Ports==

Atari, Inc. published ports of &quot;Galaxian&quot; for its own systems—Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 2600, Atari 5200— in 1982–3, three or more years after &quot;Galaxian&quot; appeared in arcades and a year or more after &quot;Galaga&quot;. Additional ports were published under the Atarisoft label: Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, VIC-20, IBM PC, and ZX Spectrum. Ports from other companies were sold for MSX (Europe and Japan only), NEC PC-8801, Famicom (Japan only), and Sharp X1.

A Bally Astrocade version was published as &quot;Galaxian&quot;, but the name was later changed to &quot;Galactic Invasion&quot;.

Coleco released a stand-alone Mini-Arcade tabletop version of &quot;Galaxian&quot; in 1981, which, along with &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, and &quot;Frogger&quot;, sold three million units combined. Entex released a handheld electronic game called &quot;Galaxian 2&quot; in 1981. The game is called &quot;Galaxian 2&quot; because it has a two-player mode. It is not a sequel, as there is no &quot;Entex Galaxian&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Galaxian&quot; was released by Namco in Japan on September 15, 1979. Following its large success, Namco approached Midway Manufacturing in terms of releasing the game overseas. Midway, who had previously lost their license with Taito due to the success of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in the west, was in the midst of trying to find a new partner for releasing games. After Namco showed Midway the game on October 17, 1979, Midway was interested in the game&#x27;s unique features and wanted to acquire the rights to the game. They agreed to the deal and Midway introduced the game at a trade exhibit in November 1979, followed by a wide release for North America in early 1980 – this move helped strengthen Midway and challenged Atari&#x27;s leadership in the market. To help keep up demand for the game in Japan, Namco licensed the game to other companies for manufacturing cabinets, including Taito and Irem.

=== Versions ===
As well as allowing other companies to manufacture cabinets, Namco would also give them permission to release their own versions. One such was Moon Alien by Nichibutsu, a hack which only adds a title screen and slightly changes the sprites. A sequel to it would also be made, known as Moon Alien Part 2. It features an energy meter which kills the player if it fully depletes. The game would become a subject of litigation when Nichibutsu would create more boards than what Namco allowed them.

Taito would also release T.T Spacian Part-2, which modifies the game to use the aliens from Space Invaders.

==Reception==
&quot;Galaxian&quot; was a critical and commercial success upon release. In Japan, it was the second highest-earning arcade game of 1979, below &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. The following year, &quot;Galaxian&quot; outperformed &quot;Pac-Man&quot; for a while, before the year ended with &quot;Galaxian&quot; again being the second highest-earning arcade game of 1980, below &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. &quot;Galaxian&quot; was later the 18th highest-grossing arcade video game of 1981, tied with &quot;Defender&quot; and &quot;Turbo&quot;. The game continued to see success in Japan throughout the early 1980s; &quot;Game Machine&quot; reported that it was still performing well as late as August 1983.

In the United States, &quot;Galaxian&quot; was also the second highest-grossing arcade game of 1980, below &quot;Asteroids&quot;, according to &quot;Play Meter&quot; and &quot;Cash Box&quot;. &quot;Galaxian&quot; had sold 40,000 arcade units in the United States by 1981, and 50,000 units in the US .

===Reviews===
Critics applauded the game&#x27;s use of true color graphics and for improving the formula established in &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. The April 5, 1980 issue of &quot;Cashbox&quot; noted of the game&#x27;s colorful and attractive cabinet design, while the April 26 issue called it an &quot;earthshaking hit&quot;, referring to it as a true followup to &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. In a 2007 retrospective review, Sir Clive of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; labeled it a masterpiece, praising its &quot;beautifully drawn&quot; game graphics, intense gameplay, and for being a historically important game for the industry. In 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed &quot;Galaxian&quot; as the greatest video game of the 1970s. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the arcade version 63 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

Home versions and ports of the game received mixed responses by platforms. &quot;Video&quot; magazine in 1982 reviewed the Astrocade version of &quot;Galaxian&quot; (named &quot;Galactic Invasion&quot;), noting that the graphics were inferior to the coin-op and PC versions, but praising the play-action as &quot;magnificent&quot; compared to other console versions. The Astrocade version was later awarded a Certificate of Merit for &quot;Best Arcade-to-Home Video Game Translation&quot; at the 4th annual Arkie Awards. &quot;Home Computing Weekly&quot; in 1983 gave the Spectrum version of &quot;Galaxian&quot; 3/5 stars describing it as a well-written version and praising the graphics as fast although flickery. &quot;Softline&quot; in 1983 criticized the Atari 8-bit version of the game, stating that &quot;this game becomes tedious very quickly&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The &quot;Galaxian&quot; arcade hardware had a significant influence on the hardware design of Nintendo&#x27;s later arcade and console systems, including the arcade hardware for &quot;Radar Scope&quot; (1980) and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) as well as the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System. According to Nintendo R&amp;D2 lead engineer Masayuki Uemura, &quot;Galaxian&quot; replaced the more intensive bitmap rendering system of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; with a hardware sprite rendering system that animated sprites over a scrolling background, allowing more detailed graphics, faster gameplay and a scrolling animated starfield background. This provided the basis for Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Radar Scope&quot; arcade hardware, which improved on &quot;Galaxian&quot; with technology such as high-speed emitter-coupled logic integrated circuit chips and memory on a 50 MHz printed circuit board. Following the commercial failure of &quot;Radar Scope&quot;, the game&#x27;s arcade hardware was converted for use with &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, which became a major arcade hit. Home systems at the time were not powerful enough to handle an accurate port of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, so Nintendo wanted to create a system that allowed a fully accurate conversion of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; to be played in homes, leading to the development of the Famicom.

===Sequels===
&quot;Galaxian&quot; spawned a long series of sequels and spin-offs for multiple game platforms, including arcade hardware and home video game systems. The first of these, &quot;Galaga&quot;, was released in 1981, usurping the original in popularity as one of the greatest video games of all time, becoming a popular game during the golden age of arcade video games in North America. It was followed by &quot;Gaplus&quot; in 1984, which added power-up items and juggling-based bonus stages. &quot;Galaga &#x27;88&quot; was released in 1987, published in North America by Atari Games, which featured branching level paths, new enemy types and multiple endings.

In 1990, Namco produced a theme-park attraction based on the series, &quot;Galaxian3: Project Dragoon&quot;. Originally presented at Expo &#x27;90 and moved to Namco&#x27;s Wonder Eggs theme park two years later, it was a rail shooter where up to 28 players used lightguns to shoot down enemies and projectiles. A smaller version for arcades was released in 1992, followed by a 1996 PlayStation release in Japan and Europe. In 1995, an arcade remake of &quot;Galaga&quot; was released for the &quot;Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1&quot; compilation, &quot;Galaga Arrangement&quot;. This game added two-player co-operative play and boss fights, alongside new enemy and weapon types. It was ported to the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube in 2002 as part of the compilation disk &quot;Namco Museum&quot;.

A Japan-only medal game spin-off, &quot;Galaxian Fever&quot;, was released in 2000 as part of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Shooting Medal&quot; series. The following year, Hasbro Interactive released &quot;&quot; for the PlayStation and Game Boy Color, adding side-scrolling and third-person stages to the core gameplay. The 2005 PlayStation Portable compilation &quot;Namco Museum Battle Collection&quot; includes a remake of &quot;Galaga&quot; titled &quot;Galaga Arrangement&quot;, having no relation to the one featured in &quot;Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1&quot;. This game was later ported to iOS devices in 2009, renamed &quot;Galaga Remix&quot;. In 2008, Namco Bandai Games released a downloadable game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, &quot;Galaga Legions&quot; – this game was instead a twin-stick shooter game with score attack modes and multiple stages. It was followed by a 2011 sequel, &quot;Galaga Legions DX&quot;, branded under the now-defunct Namco Generations label.

===Re-releases===
&quot;Galaxian&quot; is included in the &quot;Namco Museum&quot; series of collections across several platforms.

&quot;Galaxian&quot; and &quot;Galaga&quot; were bundled together for a Game Boy release as &quot;Arcade Classic 3&quot;.

&quot;Galaxian&quot; was released on Microsoft Windows in 1995 as part of &quot;Microsoft Return of Arcade&quot;.

The game was also released as part of the &quot;Pac-Man&#x27;s Arcade Party&quot; 30th Anniversary arcade machine.

The game has also been seen in Jakks Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Plug It In &amp; Play&quot; TV game controllers.

&quot;Galaxian&quot;, along with &quot;Galaga&quot;, &quot;Gaplus&quot;, and &quot;Galaga &#x27;88&quot;, was &quot;redesigned and modernized&quot; for an iPhone app compilation called the &quot;Galaga 30th Anniversary Collection&quot;, released in commemoration of the event by Namco Bandai.

Super Impulse also released a stand-alone &quot;Tiny Arcade&quot; version of &quot;Galaxian&quot;.

The Galaxian world record has been the focus of many competitive gamers since its release. The most famous Galaxian rivalry has been between British player Gary Whelan and American Perry Rodgers, who faced off at Apollo Amusements in Pompano Beach, Florida, USA, on April 6 to 9, 2006. Whelan held the world record with 1,114,550 points, until beaten by newcomer Aart van Vliet, of the Netherlands, who scored 1,653,270 points on 27 May 2009 at the Funspot Family Fun Center in Weirs Beach, New Hampshire, USA. The record has since been raised to 2,010,000 points, set on May 20, 2016 by David Lyne and verified by Twin Galaxies on May 28, 2016.

<doc id="585782" wikidata="Q828181" url="?curid=585782" title="Rock Against Communism">
<text>Rock Against Communism (RAC) was the name of white power rock concerts, (that had nothing to do with combatting actual communism), in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and has since become the catch-all term for music with racist lyrics as well as a specific genre of rock music derived from Oi! The lyrics can focus on racism and antisemitism, although this depends on the band.

==History==
The Rock Against Communism movement originated in the United Kingdom in late 1978 with far right activists associated with the National Front (NF). It was intended to counter the Rock Against Racism organisation. The first RAC concert was in Leeds, England in 1978, featuring the Nazi punk bands The Dentists and The Ventz. RAC held one concert in 1979 and another in spring 1983, which was headlined by Skrewdriver, a white power rock band led by Ian Stuart Donaldson. After that, RAC concerts were held more often. They were often headlined by Skrewdriver and featured other white power bands, such as Skullhead and No Remorse. In the mid-1980s, summer concerts were often held at the Suffolk home of Edgar Griffin, a Conservative Party activist and father of Nick Griffin, an NF organiser who later became the national chair of the British National Party. By the late 1980s, the RAC name had given way to the White Noise Club (another NF-based group), and later Blood and Honour, which was set up by Donaldson when they fell out with the NF leadership. As hardcore punk music became more popular in the 1990s and 2000s, many white power bands took on a more hardcore-influenced sound and effectively spawned its own offshoot known as &quot;skinhead hardcore&quot;, many fans/performers of this music are known as hardcore skinheads.
