<text>Philip Lamantia (October 23, 1927 – March 7, 2005) was an American poet, writer and lecturer. His poetry incorporated stylistic experimentation and transgressive themes, and has been regarded as surrealist and visionary, contributing to the literature of the Beat Generation.

==Biography==
Lamantia was born in San Francisco, California, United States, to Sicilian immigrants and was raised in the city&#x27;s Excelsior District neighborhood. His poetry was first published in &quot;View magazine&quot; in 1943, when he was 15 years old, and his poetry appeared in the final issue of the Surrealist magazine &quot;VVV&quot; the following year. He dropped out of Balboa High School to pursue poetry in New York City, and appeared the same year in American filmmaker Maya Deren&#x27;s &quot;At Land&quot;. Aged just 16, Lamantia was hailed by Andre Breton as &quot;a voice that rises once in a hundred years&quot;. He returned to the Bay Area in 1945, and his first book, &quot;Erotic Poems&quot;, was published a year later.

Lamantia was one of the post-World War II poets now sometimes referred to as the San Francisco Renaissance, and later became involved with the San Francisco Beat Generation poets and the Surrealist Movement in the United States. On October 7, 1955, he was on the bill at San Francisco&#x27;s Six Gallery, where poet Allen Ginsberg read his poem &quot;Howl&quot; for the first time; at this event, Lamantia chose to read the poems of John Hoffman, a friend who had recently died. Gerd Stern, a poet who had met Lamantia at a reading at the San Francisco Museum of Art in 1947, recalled of his friend: &quot;He admired Dylan Thomas and Wallace Stevens. He had a strange relationship with the surrealists. I could never get him to talk about it. In a way, it was not helping him with his reputation. He was very ambitious. In his last years, he returned to Catholicism and turned reclusive.&quot;

Lamantia was also known for his journeys with native peoples in the United States and Mexico, participating in the peyote-eating rituals of the Washo Indians of Nevada, which often inspired his poems. In the 1950s, Lamantia wrote multiple political texts, including a polemical prose text criticizing federal prohibitions of drugs. After he re-embraced Catholicism in the later half of his life, his poetry onward began to explore Catholic themes. American writer Nancy Peters, who was Lamantia&#x27;s wife and literary editor, commented that &quot;he found in the narcotic night world a kind of modern counterpart to the Gothic castle—a zone of peril to be symbolically or existentially crossed.&quot;

<text>William Humfrey (also Humphrey or Humphreys) (c.1515–1579) was an English goldsmith, mining promoter, and Assay Master at the Royal Mint during the reign of Elizabeth I.

==Life==

Little is known of Humfrey&#x27;s life before 1560, when he is recorded as a member of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in London, and as a resident of the parish of St Vedast. He obtained the patronage of Sir William Cecil, later Lord Burghley, who &#x27;considered him an expert on metallurgical matters&#x27;, and provided him with both financial and political backing.

Humfrey was appointed Assay Master at the Royal Mint in 1561. German technologists had recently been brought to England to assist with the recoinage of the debased English currency, and through these contacts both Humfrey and Cecil became convinced that German metallurgical techniques could be used in the development of the English mining industry. In particular, Humfrey needed someone knowledgeable about calamine ore, essential to the production of latten and brass, and in 1563 he paid the way to England of a metallurgist from Saxony, Christopher Schutz. In 1564 Schutz, aided by twenty German-speaking workers, built England&#x27;s first blast furnace at Tintern. In a letter of 16 August 1565 to Sir William Cecil, Humfrey stated that Schutz was &#x27;bound in £10,000 to communicate his art in working metals&#x27;, and requested that he and Schutz be granted a joint patent. In September 1565 Humfrey and Schutz were granted licences to prospect for calamine in England and in The Pale in Ireland, and to mine and process the ore, being joined in some of their licences with Thomas Smythe, William Williams and Humfrey Cole. Only a few months later, in early 1566, they found calamine in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, and Daniel Hoechstetter designed a refining process by which it could be used in Schutz&#x27; furnace at Tintern. According to Hulme, &#x27;the first true brass&#x27; produced in England by this new refining process was exhibited in 1568.

While these mining ventures were ongoing, Humfrey was embroiled in a scandal at the Mint. In October 1565 the Under-Treasurer of the Mint, Thomas Stanley, had charged Humfrey with robbery. The allegations were confirmed in a confession by Humfrey&#x27;s colleague, John Bull, Comptroller of the Mint, who admitted that he and Humfrey had attempted to discredit Stanley by stealing money under his control. An investigation followed, and a letter of 10 November from Thomas Smythe expressing the wish that he could deliver Humfrey from his &#x27;unexpected thraldom&#x27; suggests that Humfrey was imprisoned for a time. In April 1567 the State Papers record that Humfrey was to be restored to his office of Assay Master. According to Challis, Humfrey could not have survived this episode had he not had the favour of Sir William Cecil.

In May 1568 Elizabeth I granted charters for the incorporation of two joint-stock companies, the Society of the Mines Royal, and the Company of Mineral and Battery Works. Humfrey was one of the twenty-four original shareholders in the former Company, and he and Schutz were leading shareholders in the latter, which took over the patents they had obtained from the Queen in 1565 for the &#x27;manufacture of brass, brass and iron wire, battery (the hammering of metal into plates and utensils), and the introduction of new mining and smelting technology&#x27;. The extraction of calamine ore at Worle Hill in the Mendips had proved prohibitively expensive for the production of brass, however, and on 28 May 1568 the Company of Mineral and Battery Works took over the operation of the furnace at Tintern, and converted it to the production of iron wire for use in wool-carding, the first such mill in England. However this enterprise also struggled to survive financially.

In 1569 Humfrey, having leased a part of his original patents to the Company of Mineral and Battery Works, became involved in the smelting of lead. In about 1570 he and Schutz were responsible for two developments in the English lead industry, the construction of a water-powered lead-smelting furnace at the former Beauchief Abbey near Sheffield, and the use of a German sieve in the processing of ore in Derbyshire. Both these inventions were purportedly protected by Humfrey&#x27;s earlier patent, which &#x27;covered all subsequent inventions of the patentees in this particular branch of metallurgy&#x27;. Humfrey&#x27;s water-powered smelting mill &#x27;rapidly ousted both traditional boles and footblasts&#x27;, but Humfrey was unable to stop both its unlicensed use and the unlicensed use of his German sieve, although in 1574 and 1581 injunctions were granted against the owners of lead mines in Derbyshire who were using his methods. The alleged infringements of Humfrey&#x27;s patents by, among others, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, who had built a furnace on his estate at Chatsworth, were investigated after Humfrey&#x27;s death by four commissions in the Court of Exchequer between 1581 and 1584. As a result of his difficulties in Derbyshire, Humfrey abandoned his interests there, and embarked on a silver-mining venture in Cardiganshire in Wales.

According to Kiernan, Humfrey&#x27;s lead-smelting furnace was far more efficient than the traditional boles, and its eventual widespread adoption enabled rapid expansion of the mining industry after 1570, and the export from England of large quantities of lead. Humfrey did not live to see this, however. In a letter dated 16 October 1578 from Wales he complained to Lord Burghley that his &#x27;impoverishment prevented him from following many good things&#x27;. He died intestate in July 1579.

==Marriage and issue==
At an unknown date Humfrey married a wife named Alice, by whom he had two daughters:

*Elizabeth Humfrey, who on 30 July 1570 married a merchant taylor, Robert Ledger, in the parish church of St Vedast.
*Alice Humfrey, who married an embroiderer, Alexander Fownde.

<text>Scenario planning, scenario thinking, scenario analysis, scenario prediction and the scenario method all describe a strategic planning method that some organizations use to make flexible long-term plans. It is in large part an adaptation and generalization of classic methods used by military intelligence.

In the most common application of the method, analysts generate simulation games for policy makers. The method combines known facts, such as demographics, geography and mineral reserves, with military, political, and industrial information, and key driving forces identified by considering social, technical, economic, environmental, and political (&quot;STEEP&quot;) trends.

In business applications, the emphasis on understanding the behavior of opponents has been reduced while more attention is now paid to changes in the natural environment. At Royal Dutch Shell for example, scenario planning has been described as changing mindsets about the exogenous part of the world prior to formulating specific strategies.

Scenario planning may involve aspects of systems thinking, specifically the recognition that many factors may combine in complex ways to create sometimes surprising futures (due to non-linear feedback loops). The method also allows the inclusion of factors that are difficult to formalize, such as novel insights about the future, deep shifts in values, and unprecedented regulations or inventions. Systems thinking used in conjunction with scenario planning leads to plausible scenario storylines because the causal relationship between factors can be demonstrated. These cases, in which scenario planning is integrated with a systems thinking approach to scenario development, are sometimes referred to as &quot;dynamic scenarios&quot;.

Critics of using a subjective and heuristic methodology to deal with uncertainty and complexity argue that the technique has not been examined rigorously, nor influenced sufficiently by scientific evidence. They caution against using such methods to &quot;predict&quot; based on what can be described as arbitrary themes and &quot;forecasting techniques&quot;.

A challenge and a strength of scenario-building is that &quot;predictors are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a prediction and may influence that context in the process&quot;. As a consequence, societal predictions can become self-destructing. For example, a scenario in which a large percentage of a population will become HIV infected based on existing trends may cause more people to avoid risky behavior and thus reduce the HIV infection rate, invalidating the forecast (which might have remained correct if it had not been publicly known). Or, a prediction that cybersecurity will become a major issue may cause organizations to implement more secure cybersecurity measures, thus limiting the issue.

==Principle==
===Crafting scenarios===
Combinations and permutations of fact and related social changes are called &quot;scenarios&quot;. Scenarios usually include plausible, but unexpectedly important, situations and problems that exist in some nascent form in the present day. Any particular scenario is unlikely. However, futures studies analysts select scenario features so they are both possible and uncomfortable. Scenario planning helps policy-makers and firms anticipate change, prepare responses, and create more robust strategies.

Scenario planning helps a firm anticipate the impact of different scenarios and identify weaknesses. When anticipated years in advance, those weaknesses can be avoided or their impacts reduced more effectively than when similar real-life problems are considered under the duress of an emergency. For example, a company may discover that it needs to change contractual terms to protect against a new class of risks, or collect cash reserves to purchase anticipated technologies or equipment. Flexible business continuity plans with &quot;PREsponse protocols&quot; can help cope with similar operational problems and deliver measurable future value.

===Wargames===
Strategic military intelligence organizations also construct scenarios. The methods and organizations are almost identical, except that scenario planning is applied to a wider variety of problems than merely military and political problems.

As in military intelligence, the chief challenge of scenario planning is to find out the real needs of policy-makers, when policy-makers may not themselves know what they need to know, or may not know how to describe the information that they really want.

Good analysts design wargames so that policy makers have great flexibility and freedom to adapt their simulated organisations. Then these simulated organizations are &quot;stressed&quot; by the scenarios as a game plays out. Usually, particular groups of facts become more clearly important. These insights enable intelligence organizations to refine and repackage real information more precisely to better serve the policy-makers&#x27; real-life needs. Usually the games&#x27; simulated time runs hundreds of times faster than real life, so policy-makers experience several years of policy decisions, and their simulated effects, in less than a day.

This chief value of scenario planning is that it allows policy-makers to make and learn from mistakes without risking career-limiting failures in real life. Further, policymakers can make these mistakes in a safe, unthreatening, game-like environment, while responding to a wide variety of concretely presented situations based on facts. This is an opportunity to &quot;rehearse the future&quot;, an opportunity that does not present itself in day-to-day operations where every action and decision counts.

===How military scenario planning or scenario thinking is done===
# &quot;Decide on the key question to be answered by the analysis.&quot; By doing this, it is possible to assess whether scenario planning is preferred over the other methods. If the question is based on small changes or a very small number of elements, other more formalized methods may be more useful.
# &quot;Set the time and scope of the analysis.&quot; Take into consideration how quickly changes have happened in the past, and try to assess to what degree it is possible to predict common trends in demographics, product life cycles. A usual timeframe can be five to 10 years.
# &quot;Identify major stakeholders.&quot; Decide who will be affected and have an interest in the possible outcomes. Identify their current interests, whether and why these interests have changed over time in the past.
# &quot;Map basic trends and driving forces.&quot; This includes industry, economic, political, technological, legal, and societal trends. Assess to what degree these trends will affect your research question. Describe each trend, how and why it will affect the organisation. In this step of the process, brainstorming is commonly used, where all trends that can be thought of are presented before they are assessed, to capture possible group thinking and tunnel vision.
# &quot;Find key uncertainties.&quot; Map the driving forces on two axes, assessing each force on an uncertain/(relatively) predictable and important/unimportant scale. All driving forces that are considered unimportant are discarded. Important driving forces that are relatively predictable (ex. demographics) can be included in any scenario, so the scenarios should not be based on these. This leaves you with a number of important and unpredictable driving forces. At this point, it is also useful to assess whether any linkages between driving forces exist, and rule out any &quot;impossible&quot; scenarios (ex. full employment and zero inflation).
# &quot;Check for the possibility to group the linked forces&quot; and if possible, reduce the forces to the &quot;two&quot; most important. (To allow the scenarios to be presented in a neat xy-diagram)
# &quot;Identify the extremes&quot; of the possible outcomes of the two driving forces and check the dimensions for consistency and plausibility. Three key points should be assessed:
## Time frame: are the trends compatible within the time frame in question?
## Internal consistency: do the forces describe uncertainties that can construct probable scenarios.
## Vs the stakeholders: are any stakeholders currently in disequilibrium compared to their preferred situation, and will this evolve the scenario? Is it possible to create probable scenarios when considering the stakeholders? This is most important when creating macro-scenarios where governments, large organisations et al. will try to influence the outcome.
# &quot;Define the scenarios,&quot; plotting them on a grid if possible. Usually, two to four scenarios are constructed. The current situation does not need to be in the middle of the diagram (inflation may already be low), and possible scenarios may keep one (or more) of the forces relatively constant, especially if using three or more driving forces. One approach can be to create all positive elements into one scenario and all negative elements (relative to the current situation) in another scenario, then refining these. In the end, try to avoid pure best-case and worst-case scenarios.
# &quot;Write out the scenarios.&quot; Narrate what has happened and what the reasons can be for the proposed situation. Try to include good reasons why the changes have occurred as this helps the further analysis. Finally, give each scenario a descriptive (and catchy) name to ease later reference.
# &quot;Assess the scenarios.&quot; Are they relevant for the goal? Are they internally consistent? Are they archetypical? Do they represent relatively stable outcome situations?
# &quot;Identify research needs.&quot; Based on the scenarios, assess where more information is needed. Where needed, obtain more information on the motivations of stakeholders, possible innovations that may occur in the industry and so on.
# &quot;Develop quantitative methods.&quot; If possible, develop models to help quantify consequences of the various scenarios, such as growth rate, cash flow etc. This step does of course require a significant amount of work compared to the others, and may be left out in back-of-the-envelope-analyses.
# &quot;Converge towards decision scenarios.&quot; Retrace the steps above in an iterative process until you reach scenarios which address the fundamental issues facing the organization. Try to assess upsides and downsides of the possible scenarios.

===Use by managers===
The basic concepts of the process are relatively simple. In terms of the overall approach to forecasting, they can be divided into three main groups of activities (which are, generally speaking, common to all long range forecasting processes):
#Environmental analysis
#Scenario planning
#Corporate strategy
The first of these groups quite simply comprises the normal environmental analysis. This is almost exactly the same as that which should be undertaken as the first stage of any serious long-range planning. However, the quality of this analysis is especially important in the context of scenario planning. 
The central part represents the specific techniques – covered here – which differentiate the scenario forecasting process from the others in long-range planning.
The final group represents all the subsequent processes which go towards producing the corporate strategy and plans. Again, the requirements are slightly different but in general they follow all the rules of sound long-range planning.

==Applications==
===Business===
In the past, strategic plans have often considered only the &quot;official future&quot;, which was usually a straight-line graph of current trends carried into the future. Often the trend lines were generated by the accounting department, and lacked discussions of demographics, or qualitative differences in social conditions.

These simplistic guesses are surprisingly good most of the time, but fail to consider qualitative social changes that can affect a business or government. Paul J. H. Schoemaker offers a strong managerial case for the use of scenario planning in business and had wide impact.

The approach may have had more impact outside Shell than within, as many others firms and consultancies started to benefit as well from scenario planning. Scenario planning is as much art as science, and prone to a variety of traps (both in process and content) as enumerated by Paul J. H. Schoemaker. More recently scenario planning has been discussed as a tool to improve the strategic agility, by cognitively preparing not only multiple scenarios but also multiple consistent strategies.

===Military===

Scenario planning is also extremely popular with military planners. Most states&#x27; department of war maintains a continuously updated series of strategic plans to cope with well-known military or strategic problems. These plans are almost always based on scenarios, and often the plans and scenarios are kept up-to-date by war games, sometimes played out with real troops. This process was first carried out (arguably the method was invented by) the Prussian general staff of the mid-19th century.

=== Finance ===

In economics and finance, a financial institution might use scenario analysis to forecast several possible scenarios for the economy (e.g. rapid growth, moderate growth, slow growth) and for financial returns (for bonds, stocks, cash, etc.) in each of those scenarios. It might consider sub-sets of each of the possibilities. It might further seek to determine correlations and assign probabilities to the scenarios (and sub-sets if any). Then it will be in a position to consider how to distribute assets between asset types (i.e. asset allocation); the institution can also calculate the scenario-weighted expected return (which figure will indicate the overall attractiveness of the financial environment). It may also perform stress testing, using adverse scenarios.

Depending on the complexity of the problem, scenario analysis can be a demanding exercise. It can be difficult to foresee what the future holds (e.g. the actual future outcome may be entirely unexpected), i.e. to foresee what the scenarios are, and to assign probabilities to them; and this is true of the general forecasts never mind the implied financial market returns. The outcomes can be modeled mathematically/statistically e.g. taking account of possible variability within single scenarios as well as possible relationships between scenarios. In general, one should take care when assigning probabilities to different scenarios as this could invite a tendency to consider only the scenario with the highest probability.

=== Geopolitics ===

In politics or geopolitics, scenario analysis involves reflecting on the possible alternative paths of a social or political environment and possibly diplomatic and war risks.

==History of use by academic and commercial organizations==
Most authors attribute the introduction of scenario planning to Herman Kahn through his work for the US Military in the 1950s at the RAND Corporation where he developed a technique of describing the future in stories as if written by people in the future. He adopted the term &quot;scenarios&quot; to describe these stories. In 1961 he founded the Hudson Institute where he expanded his scenario work to social forecasting and public policy. One of his most controversial uses of scenarios was to suggest that a nuclear war could be won. Though Kahn is often cited as the father of scenario planning, at the same time Kahn was developing his methods at RAND, Gaston Berger was developing similar methods at the Centre d’Etudes Prospectives which he founded in France. His method, which he named &#x27;La Prospective&#x27;, was to develop normative scenarios of the future which were to be used as a guide in formulating public policy. During the mid-1960s various authors from the French and American institutions began to publish scenario planning concepts such as &#x27;La Prospective&#x27; by Berger in 1964 and &#x27;The Next Thirty-Three Years&#x27; by Kahn and Wiener in 1967. By the 1970s scenario planning was in full swing with a number of institutions now established to provide support to business including the Hudson Foundation, the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), and the SEMA Metra Consulting Group in France. Several large companies also began to embrace scenario planning including DHL Express, Dutch Royal Shell and General Electric.

Possibly as a result of these very sophisticated approaches, and of the difficult techniques they employed (which usually demanded the resources of a central planning staff), scenarios earned a reputation for difficulty (and cost) in use. Even so, the theoretical importance of the use of alternative scenarios, to help address the uncertainty implicit in long-range forecasts, was dramatically underlined by the widespread confusion which followed the Oil Shock of 1973. As a result, many of the larger organizations started to use the technique in one form or another. By 1983 Diffenbach reported that &#x27;alternate scenarios&#x27; were the third most popular technique for long-range forecasting – used by 68% of the large organizations he surveyed.
Practical development of scenario forecasting, to guide strategy rather than for the more limited academic uses which had previously been the case, was started by Pierre Wack in 1971 at the Royal Dutch Shell group of companies – and it, too, was given impetus by the Oil Shock two years later. Shell has, since that time, led the commercial world in the use of scenarios – and in the development of more practical techniques to support these. Indeed, as – in common with most forms of long-range forecasting – the use of scenarios has (during the depressed trading conditions of the last decade) reduced to only a handful of private-sector organisations, Shell remains almost alone amongst them in keeping the technique at the forefront of forecasting.

There has only been anecdotal evidence offered in support of the value of scenarios, even as aids to forecasting; and most of this has come from one company – Shell. In addition, with so few organisations making consistent use of them – and with the timescales involved reaching into decades – it is unlikely that any definitive supporting evidenced will be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. For the same reasons, though, a lack of such proof applies to almost all long-range planning techniques. In the absence of proof, but taking account of Shell&#x27;s well documented experiences of using it over several decades (where, in the 1990s, its then CEO ascribed its success to its use of such scenarios), can be significant benefit to be obtained from extending the horizons of managers&#x27; long-range forecasting in the way that the use of scenarios uniquely does.

==Process==
The part of the overall process which is radically different from most other forms of long-range planning is the central section, the actual production of the scenarios. Even this, though, is relatively simple, at its most basic level. As derived from the approach most commonly used by Shell, it follows six steps:
#Decide drivers for change/assumptions
#Bring drivers together into a viable framework
#Produce 7–9 initial mini-scenarios
#Reduce to 2–3 scenarios
#Draft the scenarios
#Identify the issues arising

===Step 1 – decide assumptions/drivers for change===
The first stage is to examine the results of environmental analysis to determine which are the most important factors that will decide the nature of the future environment within which the organisation operates. These factors are sometimes called &#x27;variables&#x27; (because they will vary over the time being investigated, though the terminology may confuse scientists who use it in a more rigorous manner). Users tend to prefer the term &#x27;drivers&#x27; (for change), since this terminology is not laden with quasi-scientific connotations and reinforces the participant&#x27;s commitment to search for those forces which will act to change the future. Whatever the nomenclature, the main requirement is that these will be informed assumptions.
This is partly a process of analysis, needed to recognise what these &#x27;forces&#x27; might be. However, it is likely that some work on this element will already have taken place during the preceding environmental analysis. By the time the formal scenario planning stage has been reached, the participants may have already decided – probably in their sub-conscious rather than formally – what the main forces are.
In the ideal approach, the first stage should be to carefully decide the overall assumptions on which the scenarios will be based. Only then, as a second stage, should the various drivers be specifically defined. Participants, though, seem to have problems in separating these stages.
Perhaps the most difficult aspect though, is freeing the participants from the preconceptions they take into the process with them. In particular, most participants will want to look at the medium term, five to ten years ahead rather than the required longer-term, ten or more years ahead. However, a time horizon of anything less than ten years often leads participants to extrapolate from present trends, rather than consider the alternatives which might face them. When, however, they are asked to consider timescales in excess of ten years they almost all seem to accept the logic of the scenario planning process, and no longer fall back on that of extrapolation. There is a similar problem with expanding participants horizons to include the whole external environment.

In any case, the brainstorming which should then take place, to ensure that the list is complete, may unearth more variables – and, in particular, the combination of factors may suggest yet others. 
A very simple technique which is especially useful at this – brainstorming – stage, and in general for handling scenario planning debates is derived from use in Shell where this type of approach is often used. An especially easy approach, it only requires a conference room with a bare wall and copious supplies of 3M Post-It Notes.
The six to ten people ideally taking part in such face-to-face debates should be in a conference room environment which is isolated from outside interruptions. The only special requirement is that the conference room has at least one clear wall on which Post-It notes will stick. At the start of the meeting itself, any topics which have already been identified during the environmental analysis stage are written (preferably with a thick magic marker, so they can be read from a distance) on separate Post-It Notes. These Post-It Notes are then, at least in theory, randomly placed on the wall. In practice, even at this early stage the participants will want to cluster them in groups which seem to make sense. The only requirement (which is why Post-It Notes are ideal for this approach) is that there is no bar to taking them off again and moving them to a new cluster.

A similar technique – using 5&quot; by 3&quot; index cards – has also been described (as the &#x27;Snowball Technique&#x27;), by Backoff and Nutt, for grouping and evaluating ideas in general.
As in any form of brainstorming, the initial ideas almost invariably stimulate others. Indeed, everyone should be encouraged to add their own Post-It Notes to those on the wall. However it differs from the &#x27;rigorous&#x27; form described in &#x27;creative thinking&#x27; texts, in that it is much slower paced and the ideas are discussed immediately. In practice, as many ideas may be removed, as not being relevant, as are added. Even so, it follows many of the same rules as normal brainstorming and typically lasts the same length of time – say, an hour or so only.
It is important that all the participants feel they &#x27;own&#x27; the wall – and are encouraged to move the notes around themselves. The result is a very powerful form of creative decision-making for groups, which is applicable to a wide range of situations (but is especially powerful in the context of scenario planning). It also offers a very good introduction for those who are coming to the scenario process for the first time. Since the workings are largely self-evident, participants very quickly come to understand exactly what is involved. 
Important and uncertain
This step is, though, also one of selection – since only the most important factors will justify a place in the scenarios. The 80:20 Rule here means that, at the end of the process, management&#x27;s attention must be focused on a limited number of most important issues. Experience has proved that offering a wider range of topics merely allows them to select those few which interest them, and not necessarily those which are most important to the organisation.
In addition, as scenarios are a technique for presenting alternative futures, the factors to be included must be genuinely &#x27;variable&#x27;. They should be subject to significant alternative outcomes. Factors whose outcome is predictable, but important, should be spelled out in the introduction to the scenarios (since they cannot be ignored). The Important Uncertainties Matrix, as reported by Kees van der Heijden of Shell, is a useful check at this stage.
At this point it is also worth pointing out that a great virtue of scenarios is that they can accommodate the input from any other form of forecasting. They may use figures, diagrams or words in any combination. No other form of forecasting offers this flexibility.

===Step 2 – bring drivers together into a viable framework===
The next step is to link these drivers together to provide a meaningful framework. This may be obvious, where some of the factors are clearly related to each other in one way or another. For instance, a technological factor may lead to market changes, but may be constrained by legislative factors. On the other hand, some of the &#x27;links&#x27; (or at least the &#x27;groupings&#x27;) may need to be artificial at this stage. At a later stage more meaningful links may be found, or the factors may then be rejected from the scenarios. In the most theoretical approaches to the subject, probabilities are attached to the event strings. This is difficult to achieve, however, and generally adds little – except complexity – to the outcomes.
This is probably the most (conceptually) difficult step. It is where managers&#x27; &#x27;intuition&#x27; – their ability to make sense of complex patterns of &#x27;soft&#x27; data which more rigorous analysis would be unable to handle – plays an important role. There are, however, a range of techniques which can help; and again the Post-It-Notes approach is especially useful:
Thus, the participants try to arrange the drivers, which have emerged from the first stage, into groups which seem to make sense to them. Initially there may be many small groups. The intention should, therefore, be to gradually merge these (often having to reform them from new combinations of drivers to make these bigger groups work). The aim of this stage is eventually to make 6–8 larger groupings; &#x27;mini-scenarios&#x27;. Here the Post-It Notes may be moved dozens of times over the length – perhaps several hours or more – of each meeting. While this process is taking place the participants will probably want to add new topics – so more Post-It Notes are added to the wall. In the opposite direction, the unimportant ones are removed (possibly to be grouped, again as an &#x27;audit trail&#x27; on another wall). More important, the &#x27;certain&#x27; topics are also removed from the main area of debate – in this case they must be grouped in clearly labelled area of the main wall.
As the clusters – the &#x27;mini-scenarios&#x27; – emerge, the associated notes may be stuck to each other rather than individually to the wall; which makes it easier to move the clusters around (and is a considerable help during the final, demanding stage to reducing the scenarios to two or three).
The great benefit of using Post-It Notes is that there is no bar to participants changing their minds. If they want to rearrange the groups – or simply to go back (iterate) to an earlier stage – then they strip them off and put them in their new position.

===Step 3 – produce initial mini-scenarios===
The outcome of the previous step is usually between seven and nine logical groupings of drivers. This is usually easy to achieve. The &#x27;natural&#x27; reason for this may be that it represents some form of limit as to what participants can visualise. 
Having placed the factors in these groups, the next action is to work out, very approximately at this stage, what is the connection between them. What does each group of factors represent?

===Step 4 – reduce to two or three scenarios===
The main action, at this next stage, is to reduce the seven to nine mini-scenarios/groupings detected at the previous stage to two or three larger scenarios
There is no theoretical reason for reducing to just two or three scenarios, only a practical one. It has been found that the managers who will be asked to use the final scenarios can only cope effectively with a maximum of three versions! Shell started, more than three decades ago, by building half a dozen or more scenarios – but found that the outcome was that their managers selected just one of these to concentrate on. As a result, the planners reduced the number to three, which managers could handle easily but could no longer so easily justify the selection of only one! This is the number now recommended most frequently in most of the literature. 
Complementary scenarios
As used by Shell, and as favoured by a number of the academics, two scenarios should be complementary; the reason being that this helps avoid managers &#x27;choosing&#x27; just one, &#x27;preferred&#x27;, scenario – and lapsing once more into single-track forecasting (negating the benefits of using &#x27;alternative&#x27; scenarios to allow for alternative, uncertain futures). This is, however, a potentially difficult concept to grasp, where managers are used to looking for opposites; a good and a bad scenario, say, or an optimistic one versus a pessimistic one – and indeed this is the approach (for small businesses) advocated by Foster. In the Shell approach, the two scenarios are required to be equally likely, and between them to cover all the &#x27;event strings&#x27;/drivers. Ideally they should not be obvious opposites, which might once again bias their acceptance by users, so the choice of &#x27;neutral&#x27; titles is important. For example, Shell&#x27;s two scenarios at the beginning of the 1990s were titled &#x27;Sustainable World&#x27; and &#x27;Global Mercantilism&#x27;[xv]. In practice, we found that this requirement, much to our surprise, posed few problems for the great majority, 85%, of those in the survey; who easily produced &#x27;balanced&#x27; scenarios. The remaining 15% mainly fell into the expected trap of &#x27;good versus bad&#x27;. We have found that our own relatively complex (OBS) scenarios can also be made complementary to each other; without any great effort needed from the teams involved; and the resulting two scenarios are both developed further by all involved, without unnecessary focusing on one or the other.
Testing
Having grouped the factors into these two scenarios, the next step is to test them, again, for viability. Do they make sense to the participants? This may be in terms of logical analysis, but it may also be in terms of intuitive &#x27;gut-feel&#x27;. Once more, intuition often may offer a useful – if academically less respectable – vehicle for reacting to the complex and ill-defined issues typically involved. If the scenarios do not intuitively &#x27;hang together&#x27;, why not? The usual problem is that one or more of the assumptions turns out to be unrealistic in terms of how the participants see their world. If this is the case then you need to return to the first step – the whole scenario planning process is above all an iterative one (returning to its beginnings a number of times until the final outcome makes the best sense).

===Step 5 – write the scenarios===
The scenarios are then &#x27;written up&#x27; in the most suitable form. The flexibility of this step often confuses participants, for they are used to forecasting processes which have a fixed format. The rule, though, is that you should produce the scenarios in the form most suitable for use by the managers who are going to base their strategy on them. Less obviously, the managers who are going to implement this strategy should also be taken into account. They will also be exposed to the scenarios, and will need to believe in these. This is essentially a &#x27;marketing&#x27; decision, since it will be very necessary to &#x27;sell&#x27; the final results to the users. On the other hand, a not inconsiderable consideration may be to use the form the author also finds most comfortable. If the form is alien to him or her the chances are that the resulting scenarios will carry little conviction when it comes to the &#x27;sale&#x27;. 
Most scenarios will, perhaps, be written in word form (almost as a series of alternative essays about the future); especially where they will almost inevitably be qualitative which is hardly surprising where managers, and their audience, will probably use this in their day to day communications. Some, though use an expanded series of lists and some enliven their reports by adding some fictional &#x27;character&#x27; to the material – perhaps taking literally the idea that they are stories about the future – though they are still clearly intended to be factual. On the other hand, they may include numeric data and/or diagrams – as those of Shell do (and in the process gain by the acid test of more measurable &#x27;predictions&#x27;).

===Step 6 – identify issues arising===
The final stage of the process is to examine these scenarios to determine what are the most critical outcomes; the &#x27;branching points&#x27; relating to the &#x27;issues&#x27; which will have the greatest impact (potentially generating &#x27;crises&#x27;) on the future of the organisation. The subsequent strategy will have to address these – since the normal approach to strategy deriving from scenarios is one which aims to minimise risk by being &#x27;robust&#x27; (that is it will safely cope with all the alternative outcomes of these &#x27;life and death&#x27; issues) rather than aiming for performance (profit) maximisation by gambling on one outcome.

==Use of scenarios==
Scenarios may be used in a number of ways:
a) Containers for the drivers/event strings
Most basically, they are a logical device, an artificial framework, for presenting the individual factors/topics (or coherent groups of these) so that these are made easily available for managers&#x27; use – as useful ideas about future developments in their own right – without reference to the rest of the scenario. It should be stressed that no factors should be dropped, or even given lower priority, as a result of producing the scenarios. In this context, which scenario contains which topic (driver), or issue about the future, is irrelevant. 
b) Tests for consistency
At every stage it is necessary to iterate, to check that the contents are viable and make any necessary changes to ensure that they are; here the main test is to see if the scenarios seem to be internally consistent – if they are not then the writer must loop back to earlier stages to correct the problem. Though it has been mentioned previously, it is important to stress once again that scenario building is ideally an iterative process. It usually does not just happen in one meeting – though even one attempt is better than none – but takes place over a number of meetings as the participants gradually refine their ideas.
c) Positive perspectives
Perhaps the main benefit deriving from scenarios, however, comes from the alternative &#x27;flavors&#x27; of the future their different perspectives offer. It is a common experience, when the scenarios finally emerge, for the participants to be startled by the insight they offer – as to what the general shape of the future might be – at this stage it no longer is a theoretical exercise but becomes a genuine framework (or rather set of alternative frameworks) for dealing with that.

==Scenario planning compared to other techniques==
Scenario planning differs from contingency planning, sensitivity analysis and computer simulations.

Contingency planning is a &quot;What if&quot; tool, that only takes into account one uncertainty. However, scenario planning considers combinations of uncertainties in each scenario. Planners also try to select especially plausible but uncomfortable combinations of social developments.

Sensitivity analysis analyzes changes in one variable only, which is useful for simple changes, while scenario planning tries to expose policy makers to significant interactions of major variables.

While scenario planning can benefit from computer simulations, scenario planning is less formalized, and can be used to make plans for qualitative patterns that show up in a wide variety of simulated events.

During the past 5 years, computer supported Morphological Analysis has been employed as aid in scenario development by the Swedish Defence Research Agency in Stockholm. This method makes it possible to create a multi-variable morphological field which can be treated as an inference model – thus integrating scenario planning techniques with contingency analysis and sensitivity analysis.

===Scenario analysis===

Scenario analysis is a process of analyzing future events by considering alternative possible outcomes (sometimes called &quot;alternative worlds&quot;). Thus, scenario analysis, which is one of the main forms of projection, does not try to show one exact picture of the future. Instead, it presents several alternative future developments. Consequently, a scope of possible future outcomes is observable. Not only are the outcomes observable, also the development paths leading to the outcomes. In contrast to prognoses, the scenario analysis is not based on extrapolation of the past or the extension of past trends. It does not rely on historical data and does not expect past observations to remain valid in the future. Instead, it tries to consider possible developments and turning points, which may only be connected to the past. In short, several scenarios are fleshed out in a scenario analysis to show possible future outcomes. Each scenario normally combines optimistic, pessimistic, and more and less probable developments. However, all aspects of scenarios should be plausible. Although highly discussed, experience has shown that around three scenarios are most appropriate for further discussion and selection. More scenarios risks making the analysis overly complicated. Scenarios are often confused with other tools and approaches to planning.

==== Principle ====

Scenario-building is designed to allow improved decision-making by allowing deep consideration of outcomes and their implications.

A scenario is a tool used during requirements analysis to describe a specific use of a proposed system. Scenarios capture the system, as viewed from the outside

Scenario analysis can also be used to illuminate &quot;wild cards.&quot; For example, analysis of the possibility of the earth being struck by a meteor suggests that whilst the probability is low, the damage inflicted is so high that the event is much more important (threatening) than the low probability (in any one year) alone would suggest. However, this possibility is usually disregarded by organizations using scenario analysis to develop a strategic plan since it has such overarching repercussions.

==Combination of Delphi and scenarios==
Scenario planning concerns planning based on the systematic examination of the future by picturing plausible and consistent images of that future. The Delphi method attempts to develop systematically expert opinion consensus concerning future developments and events. It is a judgmental forecasting procedure in the form of an anonymous, written, multi-stage survey process, where feedback of group opinion is provided after each round.

Numerous researchers have stressed that both approaches are best suited to be combined. Due to their process similarity, the two methodologies can be easily combined. The output of the different phases of the Delphi method can be used as input for the scenario method and vice versa. A combination makes a realization of the benefits of both tools possible. In practice, usually one of the two tools is considered the dominant methodology and the other one is added on at some stage.

The variant that is most often found in practice is the integration of the Delphi method into the scenario process (see e.g. Rikkonen, 2005; von der Gracht, 2008;). Authors refer to this type as Delphi-scenario (writing), expert-based scenarios, or Delphi panel derived scenarios. Von der Gracht (2010) is a scientifically valid example of this method. Since scenario planning is “information hungry”, Delphi research can deliver valuable input for the process. There are various types of information output of Delphi that can be used as input for scenario planning. Researchers can, for example, identify relevant events or developments and, based on expert opinion, assign probabilities to them. Moreover, expert comments and arguments provide deeper insights into relationships of factors that can, in turn, be integrated into scenarios afterwards. Also, Delphi helps to identify extreme opinions and dissent among the experts. Such controversial topics are particularly suited for extreme scenarios or wildcards.

In his doctoral thesis, Rikkonen (2005) examined the utilization of Delphi techniques in scenario planning and, concretely, in construction of scenarios. The author comes to the conclusion that the Delphi technique has instrumental value in providing different alternative futures and the argumentation of scenarios. It is therefore recommended to use Delphi in order to make the scenarios more profound and to create confidence in scenario planning. Further benefits lie in the simplification of the scenario writing process and the deep understanding of the interrelations between the forecast items and social factors.

== Critique ==

While there is utility in weighting hypotheses and branching potential outcomes from them, reliance on scenario analysis without reporting some parameters of measurement accuracy (standard errors, confidence intervals of estimates, metadata, standardization and coding, weighting for non-response, error in reportage, sample design, case counts, etc.) is a poor second to traditional prediction. Especially in “complex” problems, factors and assumptions do not correlate in lockstep fashion. Once a specific sensitivity is undefined, it may call the entire study into question.

It is faulty logic to think, when arbitrating results, that a better hypothesis will render empiricism unnecessary. In this respect, scenario analysis tries to defer statistical laws (e.g., Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality Law), because the decision rules occur outside a constrained setting. Outcomes are not permitted to “just happen”; rather, they are forced to conform to arbitrary hypotheses ex post, and therefore there is no footing on which to place expected values. In truth, there are no ex ante expected values, only hypotheses, and one is left wondering about the roles of modeling and data decision. In short, comparisons of &quot;scenarios&quot; with outcomes are biased by not deferring to the data; this may be convenient, but it is indefensible.

“Scenario analysis” is no substitute for complete and factual exposure of survey error in economic studies. In traditional prediction, given the data used to model the problem, with a reasoned specification and technique, an analyst can state, within a certain percentage of statistical error, the likelihood of a coefficient being within a certain numerical bound. This exactitude need not come at the expense of very disaggregated statements of hypotheses. R Software, specifically the module “WhatIf,” (in the context, see also Matchit and Zelig) has been developed for causal inference, and to evaluate counterfactuals. These programs have fairly sophisticated treatments for determining model dependence, in order to state with precision how sensitive the results are to models not based on empirical evidence.

Another challenge of scenario-building is that &quot;predictors are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a prediction and may influence that context in the process&quot;. As a consequence, societal predictions can become self-destructing. For example, a scenario in which a large percentage of a population will become HIV infected based on existing trends may cause more people to avoid risky behavior and thus reduce the HIV infection rate, invalidating the forecast (which might have remained correct if it had not been publicly known). Or, a prediction that cybersecurity will become a major issue may cause organizations to implement more secure cybersecurity measures, thus limiting the issue.

===Critique of Shell&#x27;s use of scenario planning===
In the 1970s, many energy companies were surprised by both environmentalism and the OPEC cartel, and thereby lost billions of dollars of revenue by mis-investment. The dramatic financial effects of these changes led at least one organization, Royal Dutch Shell, to implement scenario planning. The analysts of this company publicly estimated that this planning process made their company the largest in the world. However other observers of Shell&#x27;s use of scenario planning have suggested that few if any significant long-term business advantages accrued to Shell from the use of scenario methodology. Whilst the intellectual robustness of Shell&#x27;s long term scenarios was seldom in doubt their actual practical use was seen as being minimal by many senior Shell executives. A Shell insider has commented &quot;The scenario team were bright and their work was of a very high intellectual level. However neither the high level &quot;Group scenarios&quot; nor the country level scenarios produced with operating companies really made much difference when key decisions were being taken&quot;.

The use of scenarios was audited by Arie de Geus&#x27;s team in the early 1980s and they found that the decision-making processes following the scenarios were the primary cause of the lack of strategic implementation ), rather than the scenarios themselves. Many practitioners today spend as much time on the decision-making process as on creating the scenarios themselves.

<text>The crimson-fronted barbet (Psilopogon rubricapillus), also called Sri Lanka barbet, is an Asian barbet endemic to Sri Lanka where it inhabits tropical moist lowland forests up to elevation.

==Taxonomy==
The crimson-fronted barbet was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the puffbirds in the genus &quot;Bucco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Bucco rubricapillus&quot;. The specific epithet combines the Latin &quot;ruber&quot; meaning &quot;red&quot; with &quot;-caillus&quot; meaning &quot;-capped&quot; or &quot;-crowned&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;red-crowned barbet&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1776 by the English illustrator and naturalist Peter Brown. The crimson-fronted barbet is now one of 33 species placed in the genus &quot;Psilopogon&quot; that was introduced in 1836 by Salomon Müller. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;heen kottoruwa-හීන් කොට්ටෝරුවා&quot; in Sinhala language.

==Description==
The crimson-fronted barbet has a mainly green plumage and wings, a blue band down the side of the head and neck, and a black crescent behind the eye. It is long with a short neck, large head and short tail. Its forages for fruit and insects, and nests in tree holes, laying 2-4 eggs.

<doc id="600504" wikidata="Q3063021" url="?curid=600504" title="Ryne Duren">
<text>Rinold George &quot;Ryne&quot; Duren (February 22, 1929 – January 6, 2011) was an American professional baseball relief pitcher who played ten seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB).

He was known for the combination of his blazing fastball and his very poor vision. With his thick eyeglasses, few batters dared to dig in against Duren. Casey Stengel said, &quot;I would not admire hitting against Ryne Duren, because if he ever hit you in the head you might be in the past tense.&quot;

==Career==
Duren was originally signed by the St. Louis Browns as a free agent before the season. His only game with the franchise, his major league game debut, came on September 25, , by which time the Browns had become the Baltimore Orioles. On September 21, , he was traded to the Kansas City Athletics with Jim Pisoni in exchange for Al Pilarcik and Art Ceccarelli.

The Athletics and New York Yankees were frequent trading partners in the late 1950s, and on June 15, , Duren, Pisoni, and Harry Simpson were sent to the Yankees for Billy Martin, Ralph Terry, Woodie Held, and Bob Martyn. Duren kept his A&#x27;s uniform number of 26 with the Yankees. Duren received the first of his three All-Star selections in . He has been retroactively credited with saving 20 games in 1958, the high mark in the American League that year. In 1959, his win–loss record was much poorer, but his earned run average of 1.88 was the best of his career.

Duren was a showman. In those days, the Yankee bullpen was a part of the short-porch right field and only a low chain link fence served as the boundary. When called upon by Casey Stengel to relieve, he would not use the gate, but preferred to hop the fence with one hand and begin a slow walk to the mound with his blue Yankee warm-up jacket covering his pitching arm; he followed this routine even on the hottest days. When he finally took the ball and began his warmups, the first pitch was sometimes a hard fastball 20 feet over the catcher&#x27;s head. The succeeding warmup pitches would be thrown lower and lower (but not slower) until Duren would finally &quot;find&quot; the plate. He was so wild that he allegedly hit a player in the on-deck circle.

Duren stayed with the Yankees until May 8, , when he was traded to the Los Angeles Angels with Johnny James and Lee Thomas in exchange for Tex Clevenger and Bob Cerv. Shortly after being traded to the Angels, he struck out seven successive Red Sox batters, then an American League record. He was sold to the Philadelphia Phillies before the season. Early in the season, he was shipped to the Cincinnati Reds. Released by Cincinnati in April , he was signed by the Phillies; after being released two months later, he joined the Washington Senators, but was released again on August 24 to bring a close to his 10-year Major League career.

==Personal life==
In , Duren was presented with the Yankee Family Award for his conquering alcoholism, and for service as an alcohol abuse educator. In 2003, Duren and author Tom Sabellico wrote the book, &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot;. Duren talks from the heart about life, baseball and alcohol. The foreword was written by Jim &quot;Mudcat&quot; Grant.

Duren is the uncle of singer Blackie Lawless from the heavy metal band W.A.S.P. 

Baseball Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg was named in honor of Duren.

Duren was the inspiration for the character Ricky &quot;Wild Thing&quot; Vaughn in the movie &quot;Major League&quot;, according to its author and director David S. Ward.

<text>is a Japanese manual tie-dyeing technique, which produces a number of different patterns on fabric.

==History==
Some discussion exists as to the origin of as a technique within Japan, and indeed, the exact country of origin of some of the earliest surviving examples. Much of the debate surrounds the technical capacities within Japan at the time to produce the variety of fabrics seen in some of the earliest examples.

One of the earliest written descriptions of dates to 238 CE, where it was recorded in the of the Chinese document &quot;Treatise on the Wa People&quot; that Queen Himiko gifted the emperor of Cao Wei over of &quot;spotted cloth&quot; – potentially describing a form of wax-resist decoration on the fabric.

The earliest surviving examples of -dyed cloth date back to the mid-8th century, donated to the Tōdai-ji Buddhist temple in Nara in 756 CE, as part of the goods donated by the Emperor Shōmu upon his death. The techniques seen on these earliest fragments show bound resists, wax resists and folded and clamped resists. However, at least some of the -dyed fabric in this collection is Chinese in origin.

Surviving examples of resist-dyeing in China (known as 絞纈) date to a much earlier time period; the earliest surviving examples dating to 418 CE.

==Techniques==
There are many ways to create , with techniques generally grouped into three categories: , tied or bound resists; , wax resists; and , resists where the fabric is folded and clamped between two carved wooden blocks. Most techniques recognised within these three categories have names and a number of varieties of technique.

The technique chosen and the resulting dyed fabric depends upon both the type of fabric and the dyestuff used; demands a pliant and easy-to-handle fabric, with some historic dyeing techniques – such as the original technique of – now impossible to recreate entirely due to the fact that the fabric necessary for the technique is no longer produced.

The desired result for may be to create a larger pictographic or geometric design (as seen on many full- kimono), or simply to display the on its own. Differing techniques may be combined in some cases to achieve increasingly more elaborate results.
 is what is commonly thought of in the West as tie-dye. It involves binding certain sections of the cloth using thread – traditionally a type of untwisted thread known as – to achieve the desired pattern. The pattern achieved depends on how tightly the cloth is bound and where the cloth is bound. If random sections of the cloth are bound, the result will be a pattern of random circles. If the cloth is first folded then bound, the resulting circles will be in a pattern depending on the fold used.

 is also known as looped binding. It involves taking a hooked needle and plucking sections of the cloth. Then a thread is looped around each section twice. The thread is not knotted; tension is the only thing that holds the sections in place. The resulting dyed cloth is a water-like design. Because no knot is used, is very easy to bind and unbind, making this technique commonly used.
 is a pleated and bound resist. This technique involves pleating sections of the cloth very finely and evenly. Then the cloth is bound in very close sections. The result is a very specific spider-like design. This specific design requires very precise technique.

 includes stitched . A simple running stitch is used on the cloth then pulled tight to gather the cloth. The thread must be pulled very tight to work, and a wooden dowel must often be used to pull it tight enough. Each thread is secured by knotting before being dyed. This technique allows for greater control of the pattern and greater variety of pattern, but it is much more time-consuming.
 is also known as pole-wrapping . The cloth is wrapped on a diagonal around a pole. Then the cloth is very tightly bound by wrapping thread up and down the pole. Next, the cloth is scrunched on the pole. The result is a pleated cloth with a design on a diagonal. is the Japanese word for storm; the patterns are always on a diagonal in , which suggest the driving rain of a heavy storm.
 is a shaped-resist technique. Traditionally, the cloth is sandwiched between two pieces of wood, which are held in place with string. The fabric is typically folded more than once, creating a repeating pattern of resists throughout the fabric when unfolded.

One of the traditional forms of textiles is (), also known as or . textiles were lining-weight fabrics dyed with pictorial patterns using red safflower () dye, and were used for underlayers or linings as recently as the early Shōwa period (1926–1989), with production centred around Kyoto and Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture, a city known for the production of fine, lightweight silks.

The last dyeworks, the Yoshimura dyeworks of Takasaki, closed in 1932, and the technique of dyeing was relatively unknown until investigation into it was undertaken in 2010 by Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada and Masanao Arai, with the assistance of the Yoshimura dyeworks archive and the Takasaki-Beni-no-Kai research group. The research discovered that the boards used in the process were lacquered on all but the sides and centre to resist the dye, and were soaked in water for 2 weeks before dyeing, as dry boards would warp and distort the resist. The low-quality, slightly coarse texture of the silk traditionally used in the process was important to the takeup of the dye and the ability to layer the fabric within the dye process, as the fabric would be folded eight times, with the ideal fabric weighing no more than per piece. The fabric was folded using the technique, before a thin starch paste was applied to the faces of the boards to aid in the adhesion of the silk to its surface. The block was clamped tightly and hot dye was poured over the dye block – whilst rotating it to bathe every side in the dye – for three hours. This resulted in a perfect recreation of the crisp red-and-white pictorial designs of older fabrics.

Modern textile artists, instead of using carved or uncarved wooden boards painted with lacquer, often use shapes cut from acrylic or plexiglass and holding the shapes with C-clamps. The shapes prevent the dye from penetrating the fabric they cover.

<text>Florida Bay is the bay located between the southern end of the Florida mainland (the Florida Everglades) and the Florida Keys in the United States. It is a large, shallow estuary that while connected to the Gulf of Mexico, has limited exchange of water due to shallow mudbanks dividing the bay into many basins or lakes. The banks separate the bay into basins, each with its own unique physical characteristics.

==Description==

Encompassing roughly one-third of Everglades National Park, Florida Bay is variously stated to be , or , or . The bay has been described as an inner continental shelf lagoon. The northern edge of the bay is formed by the Florida mainland. The eastern and southern edge of the bay is defined by the Florida Keys, with only a few natural passages between islands connecting to the Atlantic Ocean. The western edge of the bay is defined by the westernmost mud banks of the bay. Nearly all of Florida Bay is included in Everglades National Park. The southern edge, along the Florida Keys, is in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

While there is no sharp boundary between Florida Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, the westernmost edge of Florida Bay can be approximated by a line drawn from Long Key to Cape Sable on the mainland, which is very close to the boundary line of Everglades National Park. The northeastern edge of Florida Bay is at Jewfish Creek in Key Largo. Blackwater Sound, southwest of Jewfish Creek, is generally considered part of Florida Bay; Barnes Sound, on the other side of jewfish Creek, is not. Barnes Sound is generally considered part of the Biscayne Bay system.

The bay consists of more than 50 shallow (one to three meters deep) basins or lakes separated by mud banks and mangrove islands. Such basins include: Little Blackwater Sound, Blackwater Sound, Tarpon Basin, Buttonwood Sound, Duck Key Basin, Eagle Key Basin, Madeira Bay, Calusa Key Basin, Crane Key Basin, Rankin Lake, Whipray Basin, Twin Key Basin, Rabbit Key Basin, and Johnson Key Basin.

Water flows between the basins in narrow channels and over the mud banks. The bay is open to the Gulf of Mexico to the west, but connection to the Atlantic Ocean to the east is restricted to narrow channels between the Florida Keys. The average tidal range along the western edge of the bay is 1 to 1.5 meters, but the tidal range diminishes quickly eastward in the bay due to the restricted flow of water between basins. Fresh water flow into the bay is restricted to Taylor Slough and Trout Creek in the northeast corner of the bay, and is only 10% of the freshwater supply to the bay (rainfall provides the rest of the fresh water). Due to the poor circulation of water within the bay, salinity increases rapidly away from the margins of the bay, except for the northeast part of the bay where it receives fresh water from rivers.

===Temperature===
Water temperature ranges from in interior bays. Cold fronts cross the bay 30 to 40 times each year between November and April, rarely lowering the temperature in parts of the bay to below .

===Tides===
Tides in Florida Bay are semi-diurnal, with a range of on the Atlantic side of connecting creeks in the Florida Keys and at Cape Sable. Tidal ranges are less than behind the first line of mud banks and absent in the northeast corner of the bay.

===Salinity===
Due to the poor circulation of water within the bay, salinity increases rapidly away from the margins of the bay, except for the northeast part of the bay where it receives fresh water from rivers. Salinity is 30% to 40% near the open waters of the continental shelf, while salinity levels range from 4% to 70% in the northeast corner of the bay.

Examination of the paleontology of biota in cores from bay muds in Florida Bay have found that historically the salinity of water in Florida Bay has been primarily dependent on rainfall rather than flow from the Everglades.

Salinity partially controls the occurrence of biota in the bay. The particular species of foraminifera, molluscs, algae, and seagrasses present in the waters of a locality in Florida Bay depend on the salinity. Analysis of core samples extracted from mud banks have provided a record of past salinity levels in a few parts of the bay, going back about two centuries in one case. At a site called Bob Allen in the central part of the bay, sparse seagrass cover was present from the bottom of the core, and the species present indicated a salinity in 18 to 25 parts-per-thousand (ppt) range, from about 1810, until about i840. Around 1840, the foraminifera and mollusc species present changed, and vegetation almost completely disappeared from the bottom, indicating a rise in salinity to above 25 ppt. Those conditions continued until about 1910, when the pre-1840 conditions returned, with relatively dense vegetation on the bay floor. The bay floor remains covered with vegetation, but variations in the foraminifera and mollusc species present indicate rapid oscillations in salinity levels since 1940. Around 1970, changes in species and a reduction in the amount of vegetation for a few years indicated a sharp increase in salinity.

A second core from Russell Bank, also in the central part of the bay, goes back to about 1876. Until about 1884, salinity at the location was greater than 25 ppt. From 1884 to about 1900 salinity was below 25 ppt, and below 18 ppt at times. From about 1900 to about 1910 salinity rose above 25 ppt. From 1910 to 1940, salinity was between 18 and 25 ppt. Salinity rose to above 25 ppt around 1940, and stayed there until about 1960, when it fell to between 15 and 25 ppt until 1980. As at the Bob Allen site, there was a brief event around 1970 that severely disrupted the presence of various species at Russell Bank. Around 1980, salinity again rose above 25 ppt.

The 2015 drought period of low precipitation combined with high temperatures and calm winds that produced rapid evaporation caused salinity to increase in the semi-enclosed basins in north-central Florida Bay. Without the freshwater, the water has become stagnant and salty with excess nitrogen from the fertilizer. This hyper-salinity contributes to the massive seagrass die-offs and algal blooms, and kills submerged aquatic vegetation.

==Geology==
Florida Bay is underlain by a flat oolitic limestone bedrock, the Miami Limestone. The top of the bedrock is about below sea level in the northeast corner of the bay, and slopes to below sea level in the southwest. Isolated high spots occur at East Key, Arsnicker Key, and Lignumvitae Key, which are underlain by patches of Pleistocene coral. The Miami Limestone under Florida Bay ranges in thickness from about at Cape Sable to up to along the Florida Keys, and at Key West, and is underlain by the Fort Thompson Formation.

The Miami Limestone of Florida Bay formed during the Sangamon interglacial between the most recent glacial period, the Wisconsin, and the preceding Illinoian, centered on about 125,000 years ago. The sea level stood higher then than at present, covering much of what is now southern Florida. A coral reef grew on the eastern edge of the Florida platform, while the shallow, protected waters west of the reef formed oolites or hosted large fields of bryozoans.

===Origin===
Throughout the Wisconsin glaciation the sea level was much lower than today and the area that is now Florida Bay was dry land. As the glaciation ended with the Pleistocene period, sea level rise rapidly, only slowing down about 7,000 years ago as the sea level reached about below the late 20th century level. Sea level continued to rise thereafter at an average rate of about per century. During the last 6,000 to 7,000 years a wet climate allowed sawgrass-dominated wetlands resembling the Evereglades to develop on the land that is now under Florida Bay. Between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago, the continued rise of the sea level flooded the gently sloping southernmost part of the Everglades to form Florida Bay.

There are tree islands throughout the Everglades, clusters of trees growing on slight elevations. Tree islands accumulate plant litter which becomes peat, which in turn facilitates the creation of caliche, a dense limestone crust on the limestone bedrock. As the bay flooded, a layer of grey to black calcium carbonate mud, rich in hydrogen sulfide, formed on the bottom. The mud layer is thicker on islands covered by mangroves, and in banks connecting the islands. Peat and caliche remnants from the Everglades tree islands remain under the islands and banks.

===Mud mounds===
As the rising sea level flooded the area that is now Florida Bay between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago, peat deposits from tree islands, shore levees, and irregularities in the bedrock surface served as nuclei for mud banks. The mud mounds (islands and banks) of Florida Bay, which divide the bay into many basins or lakes, are subject to various processes that degrade, move, and built the mounds. These processes are dependent on the production of carbonate, which occurs at different rates across the bay. Carbonate is produced at high enough rates in the more open (western) part of the bay for mud mounds to acquire sediment, and have grown together to form large structures, while mounds in the central part of the bay can grow only by the movement of sediment from the bottoms of basins onto the mounds. Mounds in the inner part of the bay are smaller, and grow slowly because of low production rates of carbonate. The growth and development of mud banks is controlled by biological processes, including the baffling of water movement and binding of sediment by seagrasses.

Mud banks in the central part of the bay tend to run in a northwest to southeast direction, corresponding to the direction of approach of cold fronts across the bay. The mud bank called Upper Cross Bank is long and wide. Upper Cross Bank is eroding on the windward (east) side at a rate of vertically and laterally over five years, while the leeward (west) side is growing at a rate of vertically and laterally 0ver the same five years.

Mud mounds are made up of facies, thin layers of different types of rock. The lowest facies of Upper Cross Bank, thick, is a basal packstone, which is also found widely on the bottom of basins in the bay. The packstone resembles stone that commonly forms on limestone at the bottom of lakes. The presence of remnants of the algae Halimeda in the packstone may indicate that it formed when the bay was more open. Mud mounds appear to be migrating over the basal packstone in the basins. The basal packstone in the basins has also been reworked by hurricanes.

== Flora and fauna ==
The bay&#x27;s many basins that are broken up by banks serve as plentiful fishing grounds for snook (&quot;Centropomus undecimalis&quot;), redfish (&quot;Sciaenops ocellatus&quot;), spotted seatrout (&quot;Cynoscion nebulosus)&quot;, tarpon (&quot;Megaflops atlanticus),&quot; bonefish (&quot;Albula vulpes)&quot;, and permit (&quot;Trichinous falcatus)&quot;, among others.

The bay is home to many species of wading birds. Most notably, Roseate spoonbills (&quot;Platalea ajaja&quot;), Reddish egrets (&quot;Egretta rufescens&quot;), and Great White Herons (A&quot;rdea herodias occidentalis&quot;) have unique subpopulations that are largely restricted to Florida Bay. Other bird species include Bald eagles, seagulls, pelicans, sandpipers, cormorants, ospreys, and flamingos.

Bay land animals include raccoons, opossums, bobcats, and fox squirrels.

==Environmental issues==

Florida Bay has undergone a series of ecological changes beginning in the late 1980s that have severely altered the ecosystem. Originally, clean freshwater flowed south through the state into the Florida Bay. To support the state&#x27;s agricultural water needs, namely for sugar cultivation, the water was rerouted and no longer flows into the Bay. The flow of fresh water is believed to have caused environmental issues and loss of native wildlife.

===Seagrass die-off===

The rerouting of the flow of freshwater to the Bay coupled with periods of drought have caused massive seagrass die-offs. The first major die-off occurred from 1987 to 1991 as thousands of hectares of turtlegrass beds (&quot;Thalassia testudinum&quot;) were devastated by high levels of toxic dissolved sulfide. 10,000 acres died in the central and western bay, and almost 60,000 additional acres suffered reduced productivity and biomass as a result. Then, following the 2015 drought, extreme temperatures and heightened salinity reduced the amount of oxygen that could remain dissolved in the water, causing periods of anoxia during nighttime and thereby damaging the health of the turtlegrass in the bay. During the summer and fall of 2015, approximately 40,000 acres of seagrass died. 

=== Algae blooms ===
Cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms (also known as blue-green algae) have flourished in the bay due to a variety of environmental stressors: Agricultural fertilizer run-off increases nutrients in the delicately balanced environment and the excess increases the bacteria&#x27;s rate of growth; The newly hyper-saline environment provides an ideal breeding ground for cyanobacteria; Rafts of dead seagrass floating on the surface of the water as well as decaying on the bay bottom leads to anoxia and in turn, algal blooms.

Blue-green algae causes numerous severe health consequences for the marine ecosystem as well surrounding human populations. Blooms result in reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, alterations in aquatic food webs, algal scum lining the shores, the production of compounds that cause distasteful drinking water and fish flesh, and the production of toxins severe enough to poison aquatic as well as terrestrial organisms. Blooms have been reported throughout the continental United States, and resulting cyanotoxins have been associated with human and animal illness and death in at least 43 states. Most cyanobacteria produce the neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) that has been implicated as a significant environmental risk in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The cyanobacteria has also been linked to liver cancer, chronic fatigue illness, skin rashes, abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.

The 2002 algal bloom in the central portion of the Florida Bay was associated with high concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus, whereas the eastern bay regions bloom was associated with high concentration of inorganic nutrients.

=== Loss of native wildlife ===
By the mid 1930s, the three main species of wading birds in the bay (Roseate spoonbills, Reddish egrets, Great herons) were driven to near extinction by human harvesting for food and feathers.

The cyanobacteria create an oxygen-free environment teaming with toxic gases, creating an unsuitable living environment for many marine and terrestrial animal species. As a result, seasons during which algal blooms flourish cause a temporary loss in wildlife.

Spotted seatrout populations in the coasted Everglades are declining. As the second most commonly caught species of fish in the Florida Bay, spotted seatrout comprise a large portion of the fishing industry and are integral to the ecosystem as well as surrounding economy. Water temperature of less than and salinity levels below 37.5 parts per thousand (ppt) are ideal for seatrout spawning; however, water management stations in the Everglades and Florida Bay reported salinity levels of 64.4 ppt in July 2015 and recorded water temperatures of up to . These environmental conditions are far from ideal for the seatrout and add additional difficulties for the survival of juveniles as well as important prey such as larval shrimp and small fish.

== Economy ==
The bay is an economic and environmental asset. , the recreational fishing industry in Florida Bay had an estimated value of $7.1 billion, and generated $73 million in federal, state and local taxes annually, while the bay&#x27;s commercial fishing industry had an estimated value of $400 million, and generated $3 million in taxes.

== Water management projects ==
Various projects are funded by the government in an attempt to manage the hydrology issues present in the Florida Bay, including the C-111 South Dade, Modified Water Deliveries, and C-111 Spreader Canal Western Project from the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). These projects seek to distribute more freshwater into the sloughs but do not deliver additional water to the bay.

== Navigation ==

The U.S. Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway goes through Florida Bay, generally following the southern boundary of the Everglades National Park. Florida Bay is a Marine protected area designated as a &quot;Particularly Sensitive Sea Area&quot; by the International Maritime Organization in 2002. Boating in Florida Bay off the Intracoastal Waterway is considered challenging, because of shallow depths, mud, and seagrass.

<doc id="600529" wikidata="Q6858923" url="?curid=600529" title="Millennium Point, Birmingham">
<text>Millennium Point is a multi-use meeting and conference venue, public building and charitable trust in Birmingham, England, situated in the developing Eastside of the city centre. The complex contains multiple event spaces, including a 354-seat auditorium, formerly Giant Screen IMAX cinema; Birmingham Science Museum, Royal Birmingham Conservatoire&#x27;s School of Acting and Birmingham City University&#x27;s Faculty of Computing, Engineering and The Built Environment, part of Birmingham Metropolitan College.

The building is owned by the Millennium Point Charitable Trust with a percentage of profits from the organisation&#x27;s commercial activity being invested into projects, events and initiatives which support science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) and education in the West Midlands. The Millennium Point Charitable Trust has contributed on average more than £5 million annually to the region through their charitable work.

The complex was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 2 July 2002, although it had been in use since the previous year.

In 2021, Millennium Point was announced as one of the first eight mass-vaccination centres, and the first in the West Midlands, as part of the COVID-19 Vaccination programme in the United Kingdom. Millennium Point&#x27;s main Atrium and Level 2 spaces remained in use as a vaccination centre until 31 August that same year.

==Occupants==
The purpose of the complex is primarily educational, and as such is home to Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum. The largest tenant of the building is currently the Faculty of Computing, Engineering and the Built Environment - the technology faculty of Birmingham City University. The university also operates the Birmingham School of Acting on site.

==Design==
Millennium Point is a Millennium Commission project, and it was designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners. Construction is estimated to have cost £114 million, and £50 million funding was granted by the National Lottery.

The building is constructed mainly as a cuboid, with a cylindrical offshoot holding the cinema. This annexe glows different colours at night. The front facade is mainly glass, and is covered in long slats with the logo of Millennium Point revealed behind.

== Millennium Point Trust ==
Commercial Activity that takes place in the Millennium Point building feeds back into the Millennium Point Charitable Trust. This enables the charity to donate to, invest in, and facilitate STEM-related projects, events and initiatives in the West Midlands. 

In 2021, The Millennium Point Charitable Trust announced it had reached a landmark £30m in STEM support to organisations across the West Midlands over the last seven years. 

==Previous attractions==
A major attraction within Millennium Point was the Giant Screen Cinema, which extended into the complex&#x27;s atrium. After a 10-year deal with IMAX ended, Millennium Point made the commercial decision to become an independent large-screen movie theatre. They renovated the cinema, including replacing the original silver coated IMAX screen with a brand new white screen that was installed through the roof. Barco 4K digital projectors, paired with Dolby Digital 3D technology were fitted, along with a major update to the existing 15000 W sound system. The decision was made to close the Giant Screen Cinema at the beginning of 2015 with the announcement being made on 5 September 2014.

Millennium Point was the location of Birmingham&#x27;s annual &quot;Christmas Lights Switch On&quot; event. The 2008 event saw fairground rides and live music, including performances by Alesha Dixon, Alphabeat and Scouting for Girls, with Lemar switching on the lights. Previous events have hosted sets by Leona Lewis and McFly.

In May 2006, the atrium of the building was used to host a theatrical extravaganza, &quot;From Ithaca With Love&quot;, a modern retelling of Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, which was the launch event of the New Generation Arts Festival. Produced by Simon M. Woods and adapted and directed by Malachi Bogdanov, the event required blacking out the roof and windows and incorporated both a speedboat and Lotus car.

In June 2006, the front car park was converted into a viewing area for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, including a large 6m × 10m digital screen. On 19 July 2006, the screen was strengthened to withstand strong winds, but eventually it collapsed. For safety reasons, subsequent games were shown on a smaller, temporary screen.

At around the same time, and over a period of two days, 20,107 people drew around their feet on A4 pieces of paper and placed them outside Millennium Point to create the longest display of footprints.

In 2008, Millennium Point hosted the Hello Digital arts festival. The focus was interactive multimedia, and numerous performances of the Birmingham ElectroAcoustic Sound Theatre were held.

In the last few years, Millennium Point has become a hub of activity for events that have been publicised around the city. In both 2014 and 2015, Millennium Point hosted the Birmingham Independent Food Fair alongside Food Birmingham which saw a number of exhibitors descend onto the premises both inside and on the grass area outside to create a weekend celebrating local food and drink traders and what they have to offer.

Millennium Point hosts many public-facing events, notable examples of which have included the UK version of the World Barista Championship and Crowd Out - an exclusive performance by Pulitzer Prize-winning American composer David Lang alongside the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group. Events with an educational focus have included hosting the Anne Frank Trust UK traveling exhibit &quot;Anne Frank + You&quot; in 2015. More recently, we are home to Birmingham Film Festival and Indian Film Festival, both celebrating talent and creativity from the region. 

The organisation supports growth within the Eastside area and the city as a whole and has hosted events such as the High Speed 2 rail line panel discussions and the &quot;Birmingham Made Me&quot; event promoting local industries in 2014 and 2015. 

In 2018, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited Millennium point to join in on an event run by Stemettes to celebrate International Women&#x27;s Day.

In 2020, the Duchess of Cambridge visited Thinktank, Science Museum at Millennium Point to talk to children and parents about her project about raising the next generation. 

On 4 January 2022, Labour Party Leader, Keir Starmer delivered a keynote speech at Millennium Point, setting out his party&#x27;s ambition for Britain. 

In 2022, Millennium Point hosted Luke Jerrram&#x27;s Gaia, an art installation of Earth as it looks from space using NASA imagery. 

==Ongoing development==
Millennium Point is located adjacent to the current Eastside Locks development and also the planned future High Speed 2 rail station and terminus. The former front car park is now Eastside City Park and a replacement multi-storey car park has been built to the rear of the building fronting Jennens Road to provide access for visitors to Millennium Point, Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum and Birmingham City University.

<doc id="600530" wikidata="Q2998867" url="?curid=600530" title="Council for British Archaeology">
<text>The Council for British Archaeology (CBA) is an educational charity established in 1944 in the UK. It works to involve people in archaeology and to promote the appreciation and care of the historic environment for the benefit of present and future generations. It achieves this by promoting research, conservation and education, and by widening access to archaeology through effective communication and participation.

==History and objectives==
The origins of the CBA lie in the Congress of Archaeological Societies, founded in 1898, but it was in 1943, with the tide of war turning, that archaeologists in Britain began to contemplate the magnitude of tasks and opportunities that would confront them at the end of hostilities. In London alone more than 50 acres of the City lay in ruins awaiting redevelopment, while the historic centres of Bristol, Canterbury, Exeter, Southampton, and many other towns had suffered devastation. In response to a resolution from the Oxford Meeting of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, Sir Alfred Clapham, then President of the Society of Antiquaries of London, called a meeting of the Congress of Archaeological Societies &quot;to discuss the requirements of archaeology in the post-war period&quot;. As a result, it was agreed to form a Council for British Archaeology to promote, both collectively and through its members, British archaeology in all its aspects.

The new Council defined one of its objectives as the &quot;safeguarding of all kinds of archaeological material and the strengthening of existing measures for the care of ancient and historic buildings, monuments, and antiquities&quot;. Following its first meeting in March 1944 under Clapham&#x27;s Presidency (he was succeeded later that year by Sir Cyril Fox), the Council initiated local excavation committees in a number of war-damaged towns, began to seek information about reconstruction projects, and set its Regional Groups the task of watching sites of all kinds. The Congress of Archaeological Societies was quickly wound up, and one of the tasks that the CBA inherited from it was the drawing up of a Survey and Policy for Field Research, which was seen as fundamental to an integrated approach to the exploration of Britain&#x27;s heritage. This monumental task was undertaken by Christopher Hawkes and Stuart Piggott (both subsequently CBA Presidents) and the first volume appeared in 1948. The CBA also recognised the need for adequate bibliographical backup for British archaeology, and the first volume of its regular &quot;Archaeological Bulletin&quot;, later renamed the &quot;Archaeological Bibliography&quot;, and now the online British and Irish Archaeological Bibliography first appeared in 1949.

Within five years the CBA had established the direction of its programme and key roles. It provides a forum and acts as a facilitator for opinion, ideas and policy development in British archaeology, connecting government, the media, and the public. It champions archaeology at all levels in education. It promotes and supports research, in the professional and voluntary sectors alike, with the essential services of its bibliographic information, digital resources, and publications. Today British archaeology is served by scores of specialist and thematic societies and groups. This busy scene did not exist in the early 1950s, when the Council set up six period-based Research Committees, spanning the whole of Britain&#x27;s past from the Palaeolithic to the post-medieval period which, along with the Natural Sciences Panel (set up as early as 1945) had the remit of coordinating earlier initiatives, providing guidance where required, and establishing new projects on a national basis. In 1959 the CBA set up the first Industrial Archaeology Committee in the world. In 1965, the CBA&#x27;s response to the Buchanan report &quot;Traffic in Towns&quot; introduced the concept of historic urban areas, as opposed to individual buildings or sites. Further CBA specialist Committees were established throughout the 1960s to 1980s. One of these led to the creation of the organisation which became the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists.

Today the CBA&#x27;s work is focused on three strategic areas: participation, discovery and advocacy which bring together its wide-ranging activities in education, research, publication, and information provision. More recently the CBA has adopted &quot;archaeology for all&quot; as its focus, concentrating on increasing opportunities for participation and learning through archaeology and the care of the historic environment. They work in partnership with many other heritage and environmental bodies and with educational and research institutions across the UK.

As one of the National Amenity Societies, the council is a statutory consultee on alterations to listed buildings, and by law must be notified of any applications in England and Wales to demolish in whole or part any listed building.

==Membership==
Until 1993, membership of the CBA was limited to societies and organisations. Today there are over 600 institutional members, which range from village archaeological groups to museums, county societies, universities, commercial archaeological units and national bodies. Individual membership has climbed steadily since its introduction in 1993, and now exceeds 6,000. Through the eleven English Regional Groups, CBA Wales/Cymru and the Council for Scottish Archaeology (all of which have individual membership), the CBA provides a unique forum for the British archaeological community, and the public beyond.

Members of the CBA help to ensure they have the resources to develop their work in education, conservation and providing information, and strengthen the profile of archaeology in the minds of decision-makers. Members receive:

* Six issues of the CBA&#x27;s flagship magazine &quot;British Archaeology&quot;, including &quot;CBA Briefing&quot;, with lists of projects and events
* Three issues a year of the &quot;CBA Newsletter&quot;, with news of the latest CBA projects and initiatives
* Membership of a CBA English regional group with access to local meetings, newsletters, activities and publications; or membership of national groups in Scotland or Wales for a small additional fee
* An annual 16pp booklet featuring all Festival of British Archaeology events (see below)
* Discounts on publications and access to events

Young people up to the age of 16 can join their local Young Archaeologists&#x27; Club supported by the CBA.

==Research priorities==
From its earliest years, the CBA has invested in research support services for the UK archaeological community through its publication programme and latterly through a range of web-based resources and services. In addition to its role in facilitating, convening and disseminating the research of others, it has maintained its own programme of research.

The CBA&#x27;s track record is principally in applied research to support its programmes in education, public participation and environmental protection. The CBA has also led research in key areas such as the impact of metal detecting on archaeology, television archaeology and the media, education outside the classroom, and assessment of information and data management needs for archaeology. The Mick Aston Archaeology Fund and the Marsh Award for Community Archaeology aim to foster and celebrate voluntary research in the historic environment.

Research themes relate to the CBA&#x27;s central aim to increase opportunities for participation and learning through archaeology. Priority areas for research in partnership with major heritage organisations and other bodies in the sector are:

1) Archaeology in the classroom and beyond: developing local and national identities
2) Social outcomes and impacts of community archaeology and conservation projects
3) Adapting archaeology: mediating climate change histories
4) Innovation in managing digital media and serving up archaeological information to a wide audience

The CBA provides research support services through the CBA website, the TORC (Training Online Resource Centre) website, with its online guide to educational and research opportunities, and the extensive programme of publication and electronic dissemination outlined below.

==Information provision and publishing==
The CBA provides electronic access to archaeological materials, information, interpretations and discussion.

It has published almost 200 books since 1945. Today, these publications take two main forms: the Research Report series publishes monographs of research into the archaeology of Britain, largely deriving from excavation, buildings and landscape surveys. The Practical Handbooks series is methodological, and aims to present straightforward summaries of topics for those new to a particular specialism.

It also publishes &quot;British Archaeology&quot;, a bi-monthly news magazine aimed at both the general reader and the academic. Since 1997, it has published the e-journal &quot;Internet Archaeology&quot;. Since 1949, it has overseen the compilation of a comprehensive archaeological bibliography, now available free-of-charge online as the British and Irish Archaeological Bibliography. A programme of digitisation has enabled free, electronic access to much of the CBA&#x27;s back catalogue of publications, including &quot;British Archaeology&quot; and many books and occasional papers.

==Events==
The flagship CBA event each year is The Festival of Archaeology, held in July. This two-week event brings together around 500 excavation open days, guided tours, exhibitions, lectures and ancient art and craft workshopse. Over a hundred thousand people take part.

In September, the Weekend Event brings together CBA members and specialists to examine the archaeology of a particular region of the UK. The weekend also includes the annual Beatrice de Cardi lecture, in honour of the CBA&#x27;s first permanent secretary, and the CBA AGM. Each year, the CBA hosts its Winter General Meeting at the British Academy, featuring a series of lectures on a theme linking archaeology with a related discipline.

In addition, the twelve CBA English Regional Groups, CBA Wales/Cymru and Archaeology Scotland (formerly the Council for Scottish Archaeology), along with Branches of the Young Archaeologists&#x27; Club, hold over a thousand events each year throughout the UK.

<doc id="600535" wikidata="Q920063" url="?curid=600535" title="Sympathetic string">
<text>Sympathetic strings or resonance strings are auxiliary strings found on many Indian musical instruments, as well as some Western Baroque instruments and a variety of folk instruments. 

They are typically not played directly by the performer (except occasionally as an effect), only indirectly through the tones that are played on the main strings, based on the principle of sympathetic resonance. 

The resonance is most often heard when the fundamental frequency of the string is in unison or an octave lower or higher than the catalyst note, although it can occur for other intervals, such as a fifth, with less effect.

==Description==
Sympathetic strings are used to enhance the sound of an instrument. Some instruments have only a few sympathetic strings such as the Hardanger fiddle (pictured above right). Other instruments which have more include the sitar with 11-13 sympathetic strings and sarod with 15 sympathetic strings, and the sarangi, which has a total of 37 sympathetics. 

In Western music, some members of the viola family appeared in the middle of the 17th century that were fitted with an extra choir of thin wire strings running through a hollow chamber through the neck of the instrument, the head of which was then elongated to accommodate as many extra tuning pegs as necessary. These were generally called viola d&#x27;amore; another historical example is the baryton, for which Haydn wrote many trios. 

Other instruments such as the harp, lute, guitar, harpsichord, and piano do not have additional strings, but make use of the effect by allowing their playing strings to vibrate sympathetically when they are not being played directly. In keyboard instruments like the piano, the string dampers can be raised to produce this effect.

The guitar is normally unable to produce effective sympathetic string resonance for tones other than E (resonance from the 6th and 5th strings, tuned to E and A, respectively), B (from the 6th string), D (from the 4th string), and A (from the 5th and 4th strings). The treble strings are negligible in practice, as they are almost constantly being fingered. 

However, the ten-string guitar invented in 1963 by Narciso Yepes, adds four strings tuned to C, A, G, F, which resolves the imbalance of resonance on the guitar. By adding the abovementioned resonances and, of course, their fifths (the fifth being a strong resonant frequency)—that is to say, G, F, D, C—the guitar&#x27;s strings now resonate more equally with all 12 notes of the chromatic scale, bringing the guitar&#x27;s sound closer to the consistency and sustainability of the harpsichord and piano.

==Sympathetic string resonance in music instruments==

Strings or parts of strings may resonate at their fundamental or harmonic frequencies when other strings are sounded. In general, non-played strings respond in sympathy to other strings being played. Two tones of the same pitch will give maximum sympathetic resonance as all harmonics of both strings will overlap. Other harmonic combinations will cause sympathetic resonance at the fifth, fourth and major third. 

For example, an A string at 440 Hz will cause an E string at 330 Hz to resonate, because they share an overtone of 1320 Hz (3 x 440 = 4 x 330 = 1320; third overtone of A and fourth overtone of E).

===Tuning===
The musician retunes the sympathetic strings for each mode or raga, so that when the corresponding note (or one an octave below it) is played on the main strings of the instrument, the sympathetic strings (called &quot;tarabs&quot; in Indian music) will vibrate in response, providing a lingering halo of sound.

<doc id="600540" wikidata="Q886506" url="?curid=600540" title="Vieillot's barbet">
<text>Vieillot&#x27;s barbet (Lybius vieilloti) is a small bird in the family Lybiidae. Barbets are a group of near passerine birds with a pantropical distribution which get their name from the bristles which fringe their heavy bills. This bird is named after the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.

==Habitat==
The Vieillot&#x27;s barbet is a resident breeder in the African scrubland on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert from Senegal to Ethiopia. It is often found along wooded creeks in Zaria, Nigeria and its breeding season takes place during the months of April to July. It is an arboreal species of savannah and farmland which eats insects and fruit, especially figs. It nests in a tree hole, laying three eggs.

==Description==

This is a sparrow-sized barbet at . It is a plump bird, with a short neck, large head and short tail. The adult has a red head, and the neck and breast are a mixture of red and white. The upperparts are dark brown apart from a yellow stripe down the back. The rest of the underparts are yellowish with dark flank spotting. The bill is thick and dark grey. Sexes are similar, but immature birds are duller.

==Calls==
This species of African barbet is known to duet year-round, unlike other species that only duet during breeding season. The &quot;L. vieilloti&quot; has been reported to &quot;yodel&quot;, which is a succession of two flute-like notes which are uttered by two birds sitting on a bough as they bow ceremoniously to each other. This yodel is immediately answered by the other bird of the pair with the sound &quot;poop-poop&quot;. The duet seems to be initiated by a snarl like the &quot;Lybius torquatus&quot;. The duets are considered quite unusual because the birds call with different rhythms. Other duetting pairs have occasionally accompanied or followed the original duetting pair. This species uses simultaneous polyphonic duets with a pre-duet greeting ceremony. Polyphonic duets have many sounds occurring simultaneously so the song sounds &quot;many-voiced&quot;.

<text>The Client is a 1993 legal thriller novel written by American author John Grisham. It is Grisham&#x27;s fourth novel and follows the story of an 11-year-old boy, Mark Sway, who becomes entangled in a mob-related legal case after witnessing the suicide of a lawyer who knows the location of a murdered U.S. senator’s body. The novel is set primarily in Memphis, Tennessee, and New Orleans, Louisiana.

==Plot==
Boyd Boyette, a U.S. senator from Louisiana, goes missing after vocalizing opposition to a Mafia-backed toxic landfill project. His disappearance leads the authorities to suspect foul play, but no body is found. Desperate for a breakthrough, Roy Foltrigg, a federal U.S. attorney, focuses on Barry &quot;The Blade&quot; Muldanno, a notorious thug and nephew of Johnny Sulari, the acting boss of the New Orleans Mafia. The FBI monitors Muldanno, hoping he will lead them to Boyette&#x27;s body.

Meanwhile, 11-year-old Mark Sway and his younger brother Ricky stumble upon Jerome Clifford, a lawyer, attempting suicide. Before killing himself, Clifford reveals to Mark that Muldanno has hidden Boyette&#x27;s body and that he fears being murdered by the Mafia. Mark escapes, but Ricky becomes catatonic after witnessing the traumatic event and is hospitalized. Both the FBI and the Mafia suspect Mark knows where Boyette&#x27;s body is located, making him a target.

To protect himself, Mark seeks the legal help of Regina &quot;Reggie&quot; Love, a lawyer who specializes in child protection cases. Reggie helps Mark navigate a dangerous legal battle, representing him in interviews with the FBI while he faces threats from Mafia operatives. Foltrigg pushes aggressively to force Mark to reveal the body&#x27;s location, but Mark remains resolute in his refusal.

Mark is placed in juvenile detention for his own protection and is brought before a judge, where he still refuses to divulge what he knows. Eventually, the Sway family agrees to enter the witness protection program to escape the Mafia&#x27;s reach. Before leaving, Reggie finally reveals the location of Boyette&#x27;s body to the FBI, securing the safety for Mark and his family.

==Character analysis==
===Mark Sway===
Mark Sway serves as the protagonist of the novel, and through his character, Grisham explores the vulnerability and moral strength of a child thrust into an adult world of legal intricacies and criminal dangers. Mark is depicted as street-smart, independent, and resourceful, traits that make him a moral force within the novel, akin to Huck Finn from Mark Twain&#x27;s work. As noted by scholars, Grisham’s portrayal of Mark situates him among literary adolescents like Holden Caulfield and Huck Finn, where the young protagonist must navigate complex moral and societal landscapes.

===Regina &quot;Reggie&quot; Love===
Reggie Love is a 52-year-old lawyer who represents Mark and acts as a counterbalance to the aggressive tactics of Roy Foltrigg. A survivor of divorce, substance abuse, and an emotional breakdown, Reggie is depicted as an empathetic and resilient character. She becomes a maternal figure for Mark, advocating for his rights while respecting his fear of the legal system. Scholars have highlighted Reggie&#x27;s character as an example of 1990s feminism, where her role as an independent woman overcoming personal hardship plays into Grisham’s broader critique of traditional gender roles.

===Roy Foltrigg===
Roy Foltrigg, the ambitious U.S. Attorney, serves as the novel&#x27;s primary antagonist. His desire to convict Muldanno is driven more by personal ambition than by a sense of justice. Scholars have critiqued Foltrigg as embodying the darker side of the legal system, where justice is sacrificed for personal gain. His aggressive, masculine approach contrasts with Reggie&#x27;s more empathetic and nuanced method of handling the case.

==Themes==
&quot;The Client&quot; explores themes of childhood vulnerability, justice, and ethical dilemmas within the legal system. Grisham&#x27;s depiction of Mark, a child caught between the criminal underworld and the legal system, serves as a critique of how society handles young witnesses. The novel also raises questions about attorney-client privilege, as Reggie grapples with her ethical responsibility to protect Mark while fulfilling her legal obligations. In this sense, Grisham presents a nuanced exploration of the legal profession&#x27;s moral complexities.

The environmental backdrop of the novel—Boyette’s opposition to a Mafia-controlled toxic landfill—adds another layer to Grisham’s critique of corruption and corporate greed. By intertwining environmental concerns with legal intrigue, Grisham broadens the novel&#x27;s scope, connecting personal justice with broader social issues.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Client&quot; received mixed to positive reviews. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; praised its fast pace and suspense, calling it &quot;gripping&quot; and &quot;filled with tension.&quot; However, some critics, like those from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, found the novel&#x27;s pacing uneven, noting that while the opening chapters hooked readers, the middle sections felt &quot;plodding.&quot; Despite these critiques, the novel’s commercial success solidified Grisham’s reputation as a master of legal thrillers.

Scholars have noted Grisham&#x27;s ability to merge legal suspense with social commentary. According to Wolfgang Funk, &quot;The Client&quot; stands out for its moral complexity, where the protagonist’s struggle mirrors larger societal concerns about justice, ethics, and child protection.

==Adaptations==
In 1994, &quot;The Client&quot; was adapted into a successful film directed by Joel Schumacher, starring Susan Sarandon as Reggie Love and Tommy Lee Jones as Roy Foltrigg. Sarandon received an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for her role, and the film was praised for its performances and suspense. The success of the film led to a television series adaptation (1995–1996), starring JoBeth Williams and John Heard.

<text>Emma Bull (born December 13, 1954) is an American science fiction and fantasy author. Her novels include the Hugo- and Nebula-nominated &quot;Bone Dance&quot; and the urban fantasy &quot;War for the Oaks&quot;. She is also known for a series of anthologies set in Liavek, a shared universe that she created with her husband, Will Shetterly. As a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, she has been a member of the Minneapolis-based folk/rock bands Cats Laughing and The Flash Girls.

==Early years==
Emma Bull was born in Torrance, California. She attended Beloit College in Wisconsin, and graduated in 1976 with a degree in English Literature and Composition. After graduating, she worked for a while as a journalist and graphic designer.

== Career ==
Emma Bull&#x27;s best-known novel is &quot;War for the Oaks&quot;, one of the pioneering works of urban fantasy.

Her 1991 post-apocalyptic science fiction novel &quot;Bone Dance&quot; was nominated for the Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Awards. She was a member of the writing group The Scribblies, which included her husband, Will Shetterly, as well as Pamela Dean, Kara Dalkey, Nate Bucklin, Patricia Wrede and Steven Brust.

With Steven Brust, Bull wrote &quot;Freedom and Necessity&quot; (1997), an epistolary novel set during the 19th century Chartist movement of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

=== Shared universes ===

Bull and Shetterly created the shared universe of Liavek, for which they have both written stories. There are five Liavek collections extant.

Bull has also participated in Terri Windling&#x27;s &quot;Borderland&quot; shared universe, which is the setting of her 1994 novel &quot;Finder&quot;.

=== Music ===
 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Bull sang in the Minneapolis-based rock-folk band Cats Laughing. She also reunited with the band for two concerts in 2015, including a reunion show at the Minicon 50 science fiction convention. Bull appears on Cats Laughing&#x27;s two studio albums, and on the live CD and reunion concert DVD &quot;Cats Laughing: A Long Time Gone&quot; (2016).

From the early 1990s to 2001, Bull also both sang and played guitar in the &quot;goth-folk&quot; duo The Flash Girls, with whom she recorded three albums.

=== Screenwriting ===
Bull wrote a screenplay for &quot;War for the Oaks&quot;, which was made into an 11-minute mini-film designed to look like a film trailer. She made a cameo appearance as the Queen of the Seelie Court, and Will Shetterly directed.

She is Executive Producer and one of the writers for &quot;Shadow Unit&quot;, along with Shetterly, Elizabeth Bear, Sarah Monette, and Amanda Downum.

== Personal life ==
Bull and Shetterly live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

<doc id="600570" wikidata="Q1562471" url="?curid=600570" title="H-space">
<text>In mathematics, an H-space is a homotopy-theoretic version of a generalization of the notion of topological group, in which the axioms on associativity and inverses are removed.

==Definition==
An H-space consists of a topological space , together with an element of and a continuous map , such that and the maps and are both homotopic to the identity map through maps sending to . This may be thought of as a pointed topological space together with a continuous multiplication for which the basepoint is an identity element up to basepoint-preserving homotopy.

One says that a topological space is an H-space if there exists and such that the triple is an H-space as in the above definition. Alternatively, an H-space may be defined without requiring homotopies to fix the basepoint , or by requiring to be an exact identity, without any consideration of homotopy. In the case of a CW complex, all three of these definitions are in fact equivalent.

==Examples and properties==
The standard definition of the fundamental group, together with the fact that it is a group, can be rephrased as saying that the loop space of a pointed topological space has the structure of an H-group, as equipped with the standard operations of concatenation and inversion. Furthermore a continuous basepoint preserving map of pointed topological space induces a H-homomorphism of the corresponding loop spaces; this reflects the group homomorphism on fundamental groups induced by a continuous map.

It is straightforward to verify that, given a pointed homotopy equivalence from a H-space to a pointed topological space, there is a natural H-space structure on the latter space. As such, the existence of an H-space structure on a given space is only dependent on pointed homotopy type.

The multiplicative structure of an H-space adds structure to its homology and cohomology groups. For example, the cohomology ring of a path-connected H-space with finitely generated and free cohomology groups is a Hopf algebra. Also, one can define the Pontryagin product on the homology groups of an H-space.

The fundamental group of an H-space is abelian. To see this, let &quot;X&quot; be an H-space with identity &quot;e&quot; and let &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; be loops at &quot;e&quot;. Define a map &quot;F&quot;: [0,1] × [0,1] → &quot;X&quot; by &quot;F&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)&quot;g&quot;(&quot;b&quot;). Then &quot;F&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,0) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,1) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)&quot;e&quot; is homotopic to &quot;f&quot;, and &quot;F&quot;(0,&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(1,&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;eg&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) is homotopic to &quot;g&quot;. It is clear how to define a homotopy from [&quot;f&quot;][&quot;g&quot;] to [&quot;g&quot;][&quot;f&quot;].

Adams&#x27; Hopf invariant one theorem, named after Frank Adams, states that &quot;S&quot;0, &quot;S&quot;1, &quot;S&quot;3, &quot;S&quot;7 are the only spheres that are H-spaces. Each of these spaces forms an H-space by viewing it as the subset of norm-one elements of the reals, complexes, quaternions, and octonions, respectively, and using the multiplication operations from these algebras. In fact, &quot;S&quot;0, &quot;S&quot;1, and &quot;S&quot;3 are groups (Lie groups) with these multiplications. But &quot;S&quot;7 is not a group in this way because octonion multiplication is not associative, nor can it be given any other continuous multiplication for which it is a group.

<text>In phonetics, vowel roundedness is the amount of rounding in the lips during the articulation of a vowel. It is labialization of a vowel. When a &quot;rounded&quot; vowel is pronounced, the lips form a circular opening, and &quot;unrounded&quot; vowels are pronounced with the lips relaxed. In most languages, front vowels tend to be unrounded, and back vowels tend to be rounded. However, some languages, such as French, German and Icelandic, distinguish rounded and unrounded front vowels of the same height (degree of openness), and Vietnamese distinguishes rounded and unrounded back vowels of the same height. Alekano has only unrounded vowels. In the International Phonetic Alphabet vowel chart, rounded vowels are the ones that appear on the right in each pair of vowels. There are also diacritics, and , to indicate greater and lesser degrees of rounding, respectively.
Thus has less rounding than cardinal , and has more (closer to the rounding of cardinal ). These diacritics can also be used with unrounded vowels: is more spread than cardinal , and is less spread than cardinal .

==Typology==

There are two types of vowel rounding: &quot;protrusion&quot; and &quot;compression&quot;. In protruded rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together and the lips protrude like a tube, with their inner surface visible. In compressed rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together, but the lips are also drawn together horizontally (&quot;compressed&quot;) and do not protrude, with only their outer surface visible. That is, in protruded vowels the inner surfaces of the lips form the opening (thus the alternate term &quot;endolabial&quot;), whereas in compressed vowels it is the margins of the lips which form the opening (thus &quot;exolabial).&quot; observes that back and central rounded vowels, such as German and , are typically protruded, whereas front rounded vowels such as German and are typically compressed. Back or central compressed vowels and front protruded vowels are uncommon, and a contrast between the two types has been found to be phonemic in only one instance.

There are no dedicated IPA diacritics to represent the distinction, but the superscript IPA letter or can be used for compression and for protrusion. Compressed vowels may be pronounced either with the corners of the mouth drawn in, by some definitions rounded, or with the corners spread and, by the same definitions, unrounded. The distinction may be transcribed vs (or vs ).

The distinction between protruded and compressed holds for the semivowels and as well as labialization. In Akan, for example, the is compressed, as are labio-palatalized consonants as in &quot;Twi&quot; &quot;Twi&quot; and &quot;adwuma&quot; &quot;work&quot;, whereas and simply labialized consonants are protruded. In Japanese, the is compressed rather than protruded, paralleling the Japanese . The distinction applies marginally to other consonants. In Southern Teke, the sole language reported to have a phonemic , the labiodental sound is &quot;accompanied by strong protrusion of both lips&quot;, whereas the found as an allophone of before in languages such as English is not protruded, as the lip contacts the teeth along its upper or outer edge. Also, in at least one account of speech acquisition, a child&#x27;s pronunciation of &quot;clown&quot; involves a lateral with the upper teeth contacting the upper-outer edge of the lip, but in &quot;crown&quot;, a non-lateral is pronounced with the teeth contacting the inner surface of the protruded lower lip.

Some vowels transcribed with rounded IPA letters may not be rounded at all. An example is , the vowel of &quot;lot&quot;, which in Received Pronunciation has very little if any rounding of the lips. The &quot;throaty&quot; sound of the vowel is instead accomplished with sulcalization, a furrowing of the back of the tongue also found in , the vowel of &quot;nurse&quot;.

It is possible to mimic the acoustic effect of rounded vowels by narrowing the cheeks, so-called &quot;cheek rounding&quot;, which is inherent in back protruded (but not front compressed) vowels. The technique is used by ventriloquists to mask the visible rounding of back vowels like . It is not clear if it is used by languages with rounded vowels that do not use visible rounding.

Of the open-mid vowels, occurs in Swedish and Norwegian. Central and back have not been reported to occur in any language.

==Spread and neutral==
The lip position of unrounded vowels may be classified into two groups: &quot;spread&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot;. Front vowels are usually pronounced with the lips spread, and the spreading becomes more significant as the height of the vowel increases. Open vowels are often neutral, i.e. neither rounded nor spread, because the open jaw allows for limited rounding or spreading of the lips. This is reflected in the IPA&#x27;s definition of the cardinal , which is unrounded yet not spread either.

==Labialization==
Protruded rounding is the vocalic equivalent of consonantal labialization. Thus, rounded vowels and labialized consonants affect one another by phonetic assimilation: Rounded vowels labialize consonants, and labialized consonants round vowels.

In many languages, such effects are minor phonetic detail, but in others, they become significant. For example, in Standard Chinese, the vowel is pronounced after labial consonants, an allophonic effect that is so important that it is encoded in pinyin transliteration: alveolar () &#x27;many&#x27; vs. labial () &#x27;wave&#x27;. In Vietnamese, the opposite assimilation takes place: velar codas and are pronounced as labialized and or even labial-velar and , after the rounded vowels and .

In the Northwest Caucasian languages of the Caucasus and the Sepik languages of Papua New Guinea, historically rounded vowels have become unrounded, with the rounding being taken up by the consonant. Thus, Sepik and are phonemically and .

In the extinct Ubykh, and were phonemically and . A few ancient Indo-European languages like Latin had labiovelar consonants.

==English==
Vowel pairs differentiated by roundedness can be found in some British dialects (such as the Cardiff dialect, Geordie and Port Talbot English) as well as in General South African English. They involve a contrastive pair of close-mid vowels, with the unrounded vowel being either or a monophthongal and the rounded counterpart being . Contrasts based on roundedness are rarely categorical in English and they may be enhanced by additional differences in height, backness or diphthongization.

In addition, contemporary Standard Southern British English as well as Western Pennsylvania English contrast with mostly by rounding. An example of a minimal pairs is &quot;nut&quot; vs. &quot;not&quot;. The vowels are open-mid in the former dialect and open in the latter. In Western Pennsylvania English, the class also includes the class (see cot-caught merger) and the one (see father-bother merger). In addition, may be longer than due to its being a free vowel: . In SSBE, these are all distinct and is a checked vowel. In Scottish English, the two vowels tend to be realized as and , respectively. The latter often includes the class as the cot-caught merger is common in Scotland. If is distinct, it is realized as , whereas is lowered to or raised to . This means that while &quot;nought&quot; contrasts with &quot;nut&quot; by rounding, &quot;not&quot; may have a different vowel . In addition, all three vowels are short in Scotland (see Scottish vowel length rule), unless followed by a voiced fricative where (and , if they are merged) is long, as in England.

General South African English is unique among accents of English in that it can feature up to three front rounded vowels, with two of them having unrounded counterparts.

The potential contrast between the close-mid and the open-mid is hard to perceive by outsiders, making utterances such as &quot;the total onslaught&quot; sound almost like &quot;the turtle onslaught&quot; .

<text>Dan Margalit (; born March 13, 1938) is an Israeli journalist, author and television host.

==Biography==
Dan Margalit was born and raised in Tel Aviv. His father, Israel, was a doctor, and his mother, Ora, was a psychologist. He studied international relations and modern Jewish history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He began writing for the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; in the 1960s.

Margalit was married to Eliora Lucci Margalit, with whom he had three daughters: Keren, Shira, and Noya. Shira is the deputy director general of the Reshet television network, while Keren is a television director and screenwriter. After divorcing Eliora, Margalit married Dana, a lecturer at Ariel University.

==Journalism career==
In 1977, while serving as Washington correspondent of &quot;Haaretz&quot;, he revealed that Leah Rabin, wife of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, had a United States bank account, illegal in Israel at the time. The story, known as the Dollar Account affair, led to Rabin&#x27;s resignation and the nomination of Shimon Peres as the Alignment&#x27;s candidate for prime minister.

In 1992 he was appointed editor of &quot;Maariv&quot; by publisher Ofer Nimrodi, but he resigned six months later. In June 2007, Margalit began to write for &quot;Israel HaYom&quot;, a new free daily newspaper in Israel.
On 6 June 2017, Margalit informed the public via his Twitter account that he had been fired from &quot;Israel Hayom&quot;.

==Television career==

Margalit has been one of the regular hosts of the Israeli Educational Television&#x27;s current affairs show &quot;Erev Hadash&quot; since its early days in 1982. During the 1990s he hosted current affairs panel shows on Channel 1 and later on commercial television. Since 2004 he has hosted a current affairs panel show on Channel 10.

==Sexual harassment allegations==
Newspaper Haaretz reported that five female co-workers accused Dan Margalit of sexual harassment made on them, individually, during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

One of the women who accused Margalit, Hannah Kim, a former journalist for &quot;Ha&#x27;ir&quot; &quot;Hadashot&quot; (news) and &quot;Haaretz&quot; revealed her story on her social media account. Margalit in return to those allegations said: &quot;There is nothing to these claims about incidents that allegedly happened more than 30 years ago. I don&#x27;t intend to devote my remaining years to an argument that has no chance at this moment, given the prevailing mood.&quot;

On 18 October 2018, Orly Azoulay told that Margalit sexually harassed her after a Popolitica talk show which he hosted. As a result, Margalit announced on the same day that he would cease journalistic work.

<text>8TV(), formerly known as &quot;TD8&quot; and then &quot;Citytv&quot;, was a Catalan language private TV station based in Barcelona, Spain owned by OC 2022. 

The station went on the air on 23 April 2001 as Citytv Barcelona under the ownership of Grupo Godó using the Citytv brand licensed from its then-owner CHUM Limited in Canada, making it the first Citytv franchise in European soil.

After several ownership changes, rebrandings and later a delay in the payment of its debts, the station ceased operations on 17 October 2023.

==History==
8TV began as a local TV channel in Barcelona in 2001. In its early years, the station used the Citytv name and brand identity, similar to the Citytv system of television stations in Canada and licensed to Grupo Godó by then-owner of the brand, CHUM Television International. Officially limited to inner Barcelona, it slowly expanded its coverage to the suburbs of the city, as well as other important places such as Girona or Lleida.

In 2003, Emissions Digitals de Catalunya (Digital Broadcasting of Catalonia), won a bid for a digital license to broadcast in all Catalonia, (DVB-T). As the Godó group was part of this commercial bid, Citytv could (by law) broadcast as a &quot;de facto&quot; Catalonia-wide station, but only in digital.

As the first launch of Digital terrestrial television in Catalan Countries in 2003 did not succeed, most television channels decided to postpone any further plans to broadcast in digital. Consequently, Citytv continued to expand its analogue coverage in the following years. For all this, it was not until March 2005 that Citytv began broadcasting in DVB-T in March 2005 (restricted to Barcelona).

With a steady relaunch of Digital terrestrial television in November 2005, the channel&#x27;s owners decided to rename Citytv to 8TV and become a private Catalan broadcaster.

On 27 February 2006, the channel was renamed TD8 (&quot;Televisió Digital 8&quot; &quot;Digital Television 8&quot;), and began broadcasting to all Catalonia (in analogue). Initial digital coverage was limited to Barcelona, but on 4 April 2006 TD8 was also available in Tarragona, Girona and Lleida. Later that year, TD8 was once again renamed 8TV- &quot;vuit televisió&quot; (eight television).

As of 2007, the channel began to reduce the percentage of its own production, which is why only some entertainment and information programs were kept, in addition to increasing the programming of series and movies, while some of its journalists left the channel. Since that period, the channel increased its synergy with RAC 1, which is why some radio programs began to be broadcast on TV.

In 2015, Grupo Godó and Mediaset España entered into an alliance to improve the situation of the channel, for which Mediaset bought 40% of the shares of Emissions Digitals de Catalunya, the company that owned 8TV, which came to reinforce spaces like &quot;Arucitys&quot; (entertainment) and &quot;8 al día&quot; (news and debates), which were the main programs on 8TV. In 2018 the channel stopped broadcasting Arucitys because its presenter, Alfonso Arús, was hired by LaSexta to do a similar program nationwide. Subsequently, the channel also stopped broadcasting &quot;8 al día&quot;, so it returned to programming based on series, films, contests and documentaries, some of them broadcast by TV3 in previous years.

In 2021, Emissions Digitals de Catalunya was bought by the company OC 2022, which is why it began a process to reform the channel so that it would once again be occupied mostly by its own programming with the aim of competing with TV3. The programming was once again based on news and entertainment programs produced live, in addition, the channel hired some figures from Catalan politics and TV3 to present some programs this with the aim of capturing viewers who are dissatisfied with Catalan public television and looking the support of some political parties.

On June 2, 2023, the company managing the channel, Emissions Digitals de Catalunya, declared a debt moratorium, starting a 3-month period to renegotiate the debt with its creditors. After having obtained an overtime concession from the Catalan government, the company filed for bankruptcy and the channel was due to cease broadcasting at midnight on 15 October 2023. The broadcast finally ended on 17 October 2023 at 00:03 CEST.

== Programming ==
The station broadcasts a mixture of old films, entertainment (&quot;Arucitys&quot;; &quot;Envasat al 8&quot;; &quot;X-tra&quot;; &quot;Amics, coneguts i saludats&quot;), news (&quot;Notícies 8&quot;), sports (&quot;Força Barça&quot;), cartoons (&quot;Garfield &amp; Xou de Lupo i DuesEspatlles&quot;). Most programs are broadcast in Catalan, but foreign films and series are dubbed in Spanish.

One original program on the station was &quot;Notícies 10&quot;, airing at 8:25 pm.

<doc id="600592" wikidata="Q1516893" url="?curid=600592" title="United Hockey League">
<text>The United Hockey League (UHL), originally known as the Colonial Hockey League from 1991 to 1997 and last known as the International Hockey League from 2007 to 2010, was a low-level minor professional ice hockey league, with teams in the United States and Canada. The league was headquartered in Rochester, Michigan, and, in its last year, consisted of seven teams. It folded in 2010, with most of its teams joining the Central Hockey League. The Central Hockey League teams still operating in 2014 were then added to ECHL. The only former CoHL/UHL/IHL teams still active as of 2024 are the Fort Wayne Komets and Kalamazoo Wings.

==History==

The UHL was originally formed in 1991 as the Colonial Hockey League and had teams in Brantford, Ontario; Detroit, Michigan; Flint, Michigan; St. Thomas, Ontario; and Thunder Bay, Ontario; the avowed goal of the league organizers was to fill the low-level niche in the Great Lakes area abandoned by the original International Hockey League as the latter league engaged in upmarket expansion. As time passed, the CoHL moved eastward, into places like Glens Falls, NY; Danbury, CT; Utica, NY; Binghamton, NY; and Richmond, VA. During that expansion, the league was renamed &quot;United Hockey League&quot; (UHL) and the headquarters was moved to Lake St. Louis, Missouri, in 1997.

The 2006–07 season was the last season of play for the league under the UHL name. Following the 2006–07 season, the league lost half of its ten teams. The franchises in Moline and Rockford, Illinois moved to the American Hockey League, the team in Elmira, New York, went to the ECHL, and the franchises in Chicago, Illinois and Port Huron, Michigan ceased operations. In June 2007, at the league’s annual meeting, the UHL announced that it was changing its name to the &quot;International Hockey League&quot; (IHL). Paul L. Pickard was named the first president and CEO of the new IHL. During that summer, the UHL headquarters moved from Lake St. Louis, Missouri, to Rochester, Michigan. The UHL&#x27;s rebranding was intended to evoke the original IHL, which had ceased operations in 2001 and covered much of the new IHL&#x27;s footprint. The Fort Wayne Komets were a longtime member of the original league while the Kalamazoo Wings and Flint Generals franchises were revived names of the original Kalamazoo and Flint IHL teams.

On July 13, 2010, the league announced an agreement with the Central Hockey League, the effects of which saw five IHL teams – the Bloomington PrairieThunder, Dayton Gems, Evansville IceMen, Fort Wayne Komets and Quad City Mallards – absorbed into the CHL. The remaining two franchises from the league&#x27;s last season that were not absorbed into the CHL, the Flint Generals and the Port Huron Icehawks, folded.

==Governance==

Dennis Hextall was named as the president and commissioner of the International Hockey League on September 2, 2009. Hextall was preceded by Paul Pickard, who served as commissioner for the first two years of the renamed league (2007–2009).

Several UHL teams had affiliations with the National Hockey League, American Hockey League, and the All American Hockey League.

<text>James David Van Der Beek (; born March 8, 1977) is an American actor. Known for his portrayal of Dawson Leery on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1998–2003), he also played a fictionalized version of himself on the cult ABC sitcom &quot;Don&#x27;t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23&quot; (2012–2013), starred on &quot;&quot; as FBI Agent Elijah Mundo (2015–2016), and appeared as Matt Bromley on the first season of the FX drama &quot;Pose&quot; (2018). 

His film credits include &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; (1998), &quot;Texas Rangers&quot; (2001), &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (2002), &quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot; (2009), &quot;Labor Day&quot; (2013), and &quot;Bad Hair&quot; (2020).

==Early life==
Van Der Beek was born in Cheshire, Connecticut, the son of Melinda (; 1950–2020), a former dancer and gymnastics teacher, and husband James William Van Der Beek, a cellular phone company executive and former minor league baseball pitcher. He is of Dutch, German, English, Scots-Irish, and French descent; his last name translates to &quot;from the creek&quot; in Dutch.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Van Der Beek played the role of Reuben in his middle school production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. At the age of 15, he asked his mother to take him into New York City to get an agent and try his hand in professional acting. He made his professional debut off-Broadway at age 16 in 1993 in the New York premiere of Edward Albee&#x27;s play &quot;Finding the Sun&quot; with the Signature Theatre Company. He played the role of &quot;Fergus&quot;. Both he and the production, which was also directed by Albee, received positive reviews. A decade later, in 2003, he appeared again off-Broadway, briefly, in the play &quot;Rain Dance&quot;.

At 17, while still in high school at Cheshire Academy, he performed in the musical &quot;Shenandoah&quot; at the Goodspeed Opera House, made his feature film debut as a sadistic bully in &quot;Angus&quot; (1995) and shot a small role in the independent film &quot;I Love You, I Love You Not&quot; (1996).

He attended Drew University on an academic scholarship, where he participated in an all-male a cappella group, but dropped out once &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was picked up to series. He performed at the Vineyard Theater in New York in Nicky Silver&#x27;s play, &quot;My Marriage to Ernest Borgnine&quot;, and he played a supporting role in the independent film &quot;Cash Crop&quot;, which was originally shot in spring of 1997 and originally titled &quot;Harvest&quot; until released in 2001.

===Television and film===
In early 1997, Van Der Beek auditioned for three television pilots. One of them was for the fledgling WB Network show &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Van Der Beek won the title role of Dawson Leery, and the show&#x27;s 1998 debut was a success that helped to establish the network and its cast. The series ran for six seasons and was syndicated worldwide. In 1999, he starred in the teen football drama &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;, which held the number 1 spot at the U.S. box office for its first two weeks. He won an MTV Movie Award for his role.

Around this time he was selected one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot;, and he appeared in several other films, including &quot;Texas Rangers&quot;, &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, and &quot;Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, playing himself playing Jay in the film within the film opposite Jason Biggs as Silent Bob. In 2002, he played Sean Bateman (younger brother of &quot;American Psycho&quot; protagonist Patrick Bateman) in the film adaptation of the novel &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; by Bret Easton Ellis, written and directed by Roger Avary. The film was an initial box office failure but found a cult following on DVD.

In 2006, he appeared on the Direct-to-DVD thriller &quot;The Plague&quot;, which was produced by Clive Barker and was panned by critics. After &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; ended in 2003, he returned to off-Broadway, in Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Rain Dance&quot;. He completed an unproduced screenplay titled &quot;Winning&quot;. Since then, he made a few appearances on television, including a role on &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;. In 2007, he guest-starred in a two-part episode of the series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, playing a serial killer with dissociative identity disorder called Tobias Hankel who kidnaps and drugs one of the main characters, Spencer Reid. In 2008, he made a guest appearance on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, in which he played Simon, one of Robin Scherbatsky’s early boyfriends, multiple times.

In 2008, he began a recurring role on &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; as a filmmaker who was largely the satirical opposite of Dawson Leery. He appeared in an episode of the fifth season of &quot;Medium&quot;. In 2009, he portrayed real life kidnapper Anthony Steven &quot;Tony Zappa&quot; Wright in the Lifetime network television film &quot;Taken In Broad Daylight&quot;. In 2009, he won Best Actor at the 8th Annual San Diego Film Festival for his portrayal of FBI agent Jake Kelly working in Taiwan in the political thriller &quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot;, which also won Best Picture. The film was distributed theatrically in the United States starting February 26, 2010.

On January 5, 2010, TVGuide.com confirmed that Van Der Beek had been cast in a major recurring role on the television series &quot;Mercy&quot;. He played Dr. Joe Briggs, the new womanizing ICU chief who harbors a dark secret. He starred alongside Rhona Mitra, Josh Lucas, and Jon Hamm in the Anders Anderson thriller film &quot;Stolen&quot;.

In 2011, he portrayed Kesha&#x27;s nemesis in her music video for &quot;Blow&quot;. He portrayed a fictionalized version of himself on the television series &quot;Don&#x27;t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23&quot;. The show debuted to critical praise, with Van Der Beek earning particularly good notices for his comic timing and sendup of his own image. The show was cancelled after two seasons but remains popular on Netflix and on Logo TV, which picked it up in syndication.

On March 4, 2015, he began his role as Senior Field Agent Elijah Mundo on &quot;&quot;. In 2017, Van Der Beek appeared in the British comedy series &quot;Carters Get Rich&quot;. He made a cameo in the film &quot;Downsizing&quot; (2017), starring Matt Damon, and voices Boris Hauntley in the Disney Junior show &quot;Vampirina&quot;.

As a writer, Van Der Beek co-created, wrote, produced and starred in &quot;What Would Diplo Do?&quot;, in which he portrays producer and DJ Diplo. It was Van Der Beek&#x27;s first foray as a showrunner of a series. The show debuted on Viceland to positive reviews, both for the writing and Van Der Beek&#x27;s performance, was called, “The Veep of DJ Culture” by the L.A. Times and scored 90% on Rotten Tomatoes

In 2019, Van Der Beek was cast in the Emmy-nominated &quot;Pose&quot; as Matt Bromley on FX, a role he played for one season.

Van Der Beek joined the cast of the 28th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was paired with professional dancer Emma Slater. A surprisingly good dancer, Van Der Beek was consistently scored in the top spot and favored to win until he was eliminated in the semi-finals, finishing in fifth place. That night, he revealed that his wife, Kimberly, had suffered a miscarriage forty-eight hours prior. The judges scored him lowest, and then, in a decision that was controversial with fans, sent him home.

==Personal life==
Van Der Beek was married to actress Heather McComb from 2003 until their separation in April 2009. Van Der Beek filed for divorce in the fourth quarter of that year; the divorce was finalized in the second quarter of 2010.

Van Der Beek married business consultant Kimberly Brook on August 1, 2010, in a small ceremony at the Kabbalah Center near Dizengoff Plaza in Tel Aviv, Israel. The couple have six children: four daughters (born 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2018) and two sons. He has spoken about a miscarriage Brook suffered in November 2019, just a month after announcing she was pregnant. Following the birth of their sixth child, he disclosed that she had actually suffered two miscarriages at 17 weeks or later, explaining in a November 22, 2021 announcement on Instagram that the couple had waited five weeks to publicly announce the arrival of their sixth child. In September 2020, he and Brook announced that they were leaving Los Angeles and moving to Texas.

===Illness===
On August 31, 2023, Van Der Beek was diagnosed with colorectal cancer; he did not make his diagnosis public until November 2024. He stated that he has &quot;been privately dealing with this diagnosis and [has] been taking steps to resolve it&quot; with the support of his family.

<text>Dumisani Shadrack Kumalo (16 September 1947 – 20 January 2019) was a South African anti-apartheid activist and diplomat, who served as the Permanent Representative of South Africa to the United Nations.

== Early life ==
He was born in Kwambunda, Natal on the banks of the Blood River. His father was a carpenter and preacher and his mother a counsellor and midwife. The family soon moved to Evaton, south of Johannesburg. He was educated at missionary school, Wilburforce College in Evaton. He would later obtain a Bachelor of Arts from the University of South Africa and later in exile, a Master of Arts from Indiana University. He started work as a journalist in 1967, working for the &quot;Golden City Post&quot;, feature writer for &quot;DRUM&quot; from 1969 until 1970, and as a political reporter for the Johannesburg &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in 1970. After the Soweto Riots in 1976, he joined Total Oil as a marketing executive.

==Political life==
In 1977 he was forced into exile for his anti-apartheid activities and sought asylum in the United States, where he continued his political activity. As Project Director at the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) and its sister organisation The Africa Fund from 1979 to 1997 he played a key role in the mobilisation of U.S. sanctions against apartheid. He helped to build the divestment movement which led to 28 states, 24 counties and more than 90 cities and 155 colleges and universities divesting from U.S. banks and companies which did business with the South African government. He visited almost every state in the union, testifying before state legislatures and city councils and speaking in communities and at countless colleges and universities. After the end of apartheid he returned to South Africa and was appointed Director of the United States Desk in the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1997. Kumalo was subsequently appointed as South Africa&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations; he presented his credentials as Permanent Representative on 21 April 1999.

He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on 13 April 2004, encouraging participation of the member nations of the United Nations, on the matter of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.

He was on the Advisory Committee of the African Activist Archive Project of the African Studies Center at Michigan State University.

He returned to South Africa in 2009 and until 2013, he was CEO of the Thabo Mbeki Foundation.

==Death==
Kumalo died at his home in Midrand after an asthma attack. He was survived by his wife Tikky and two sons.

<doc id="600616" wikidata="Q4690602" url="?curid=600616" title="After school special">
<text>The American Broadcasting Company coined the term After School Special (sometimes rendered Afterschool Special) in 1972 with a series of television films, usually dealing with controversial or socially relevant issues, that were generally broadcast in the late afternoon and meant to be viewed by school-age children, particularly teenagers. The specials were generally broadcast four to six times during the school year, pre-empting local programming that would usually follow the network schedule in the late afternoon hours. ABC&#x27;s series ran from 1972 to 1997.

==Competitors==
CBS distributed its own productions as the &quot;CBS Afternoon Playhouse&quot; (later known as &quot;CBS Schoolbreak Special&quot;). It also had a program called &quot;Famous Classic Tales&quot;, which aired Australian cartoons that were adapted from literature books (similar to &quot;Family Classic Tales&quot;). NBC had after-school programs under the umbrella title &quot;Special Treat&quot;. ABC had the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot;; similar programs included &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot; and the &quot;ABC Weekend Special&quot;.

==Legacy==
The cult TV show &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; and its 2005 feature film adaptation, featuring Amy Sedaris as an ex-con, prostitute, and junkie, spoofs after-school special conventions.

<doc id="600618" wikidata="Q554403" url="?curid=600618" title="Duality (order theory)">
<text>In the mathematical area of order theory, every partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; gives rise to a dual (or opposite) partially ordered set which is often denoted by &quot;P&quot;op or &quot;P&quot;&quot;d&quot;. This dual order &quot;P&quot;op is defined to be the same set, but with the inverse order, i.e. &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; holds in &quot;P&quot;op if and only if &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; holds in &quot;P&quot;. It is easy to see that this construction, which can be depicted by flipping the Hasse diagram for &quot;P&quot; upside down, will indeed yield a partially ordered set. In a broader sense, two partially ordered sets are also said to be duals if they are dually isomorphic, i.e. if one poset is order isomorphic to the dual of the other.

The importance of this simple definition stems from the fact that every definition and theorem of order theory can readily be transferred to the dual order. Formally, this is captured by the Duality Principle for ordered sets:

: If a given statement is valid for all partially ordered sets, then its dual statement, obtained by inverting the direction of all order relations and by dualizing all order theoretic definitions involved, is also valid for all partially ordered sets.

If a statement or definition is equivalent to its dual then it is said to be self-dual. Note that the consideration of dual orders is so fundamental that it often occurs implicitly when writing ≥ for the dual order of ≤ without giving any prior definition of this &quot;new&quot; symbol.

== Examples ==

Naturally, there are a great number of examples for concepts that are dual:
* Greatest elements and least elements
* Maximal elements and minimal elements
* Least upper bounds (suprema, ∨) and greatest lower bounds (infima, ∧)
* Upper sets and lower sets
* Ideals and filters
* Closure operators and kernel operators.

Examples of notions which are self-dual include:
* Being a (complete) lattice
* Monotonicity of functions
* Distributivity of lattices, i.e. the lattices for which ∀&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;: &quot;x&quot; ∧ (&quot;y&quot; ∨ &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;y&quot;) ∨ (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;z&quot;) holds are exactly those for which the dual statement ∀&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;: &quot;x&quot; ∨ (&quot;y&quot; ∧ &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;y&quot;) ∧ (&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;z&quot;) holds
* Being a Boolean algebra
* Being an order isomorphism.

Since partial orders are antisymmetric, the only ones that are self-dual are the equivalence relations (but the notion of partial order is self-dual).

<text>Animals in space originally served to test the survivability of spaceflight, before human spaceflights were attempted. Later, many species were flown to investigate various biological processes and the effects microgravity and space flight might have on them. Bioastronautics is an area of bioengineering research that spans the study and support of life in space. To date, seven national space programs have flown non-human animals into space: the United States, Soviet Union, France, Argentina, China, Japan and Iran.

A wide variety of non-human animals have been launched into space, including monkeys and apes, dogs, cats, tortoises, mice, rats, rabbits, fish, frogs, spiders, insects, and quail eggs (which hatched on &quot;Mir&quot; in 1990). The US launched the first Earthlings into space, with fruit flies surviving a 1947 flight, followed by primates in 1949. The Soviet space program launched multiple dogs into space, with the first sub-orbital flights in 1951, and first orbital flights in 1957.

Two tortoises and several varieties of plants were the first Earthlings to circle the Moon in September 1968 on the Zond 5 mission. In 1972, five mice nicknamed Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey orbited the Moon a record 75 times aboard command module &quot;America&quot; as part of the Apollo 17 mission (the most recent to put Earthlings into lunar orbit).

==Background==
Animals had been used in aeronautic exploration since 1783 when the Montgolfier brothers sent a sheep, a duck, and a rooster aloft in a hot air balloon to see if ground-dwelling animals can survive (the duck serving as the experimental control). The limited supply of captured German V-2 rockets led to the U.S. use of high-altitude balloon launches carrying fruit flies, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, frogs, goldfish and monkeys to heights of up to . These high-altitude balloon flights from 1947 to 1960 tested radiation exposure, physiological response, life support and recovery systems. The U.S. high-altitude manned balloon flights occurred in the same time frame, one of which also carried fruit flies.

== Timeline ==

=== 1940s ===
The first animals sent into space were fruit flies aboard a U.S.-launched V-2 rocket on 20 February 1947 from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The purpose of the experiment was to explore the effects of radiation exposure at high altitudes. The rocket reached in 3 minutes 10 seconds, past both the U.S. Air Force and the international 100 km definitions of the boundary of space. The Blossom capsule was ejected and successfully deployed its parachute. The fruit flies were recovered alive. Other V-2 missions carried biological samples, including moss.

Albert II, a rhesus monkey, became the first monkey, first primate, and first mammal in space on 14 June 1949, in a U.S.-launched V-2, after the failure of the original Albert&#x27;s mission on ascent. Albert I reached only altitude; Albert II reached about , and died on impact after a parachute failure. 

Numerous monkeys of several species were flown by the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s. Monkeys were implanted with sensors to measure vital signs, and many were under anesthesia during launch. The death rate among these monkeys was very high: about two-thirds of all monkeys launched in the 1940s and 1950s died on missions or soon after landing.

=== 1950s ===

On 31 August 1950, the U.S. launched a mouse into space (137 km) aboard a V-2 (the Albert V flight, which, unlike the Albert I-IV flights, did not have a monkey), however the animal died following descent because the parachute system failed. The U.S. launched several other mice in the 1950s.

On 22 July 1951, the Soviet Union launched the R-1 IIIA-1 flight, carrying the dogs Tsygan (, &quot;Gypsy&quot; or &quot;Țigan/Țagaur&quot; in romani language) and Dezik () into space, but not into orbit. These two dogs were the first living higher organisms successfully recovered from a spaceflight. Both space dogs survived the flight, although Dezik would die on a subsequent flight. The U.S. launched mice aboard spacecraft later that year; however, they failed to reach the altitude for true spaceflight.

On 3 November 1957, the second-ever orbiting spacecraft carried the first animal into orbit, the dog Laika, launched aboard the Soviet Sputnik 2 spacecraft (nicknamed &#x27;Muttnik&#x27; in the West). Laika died during the flight, as was expected because the technology to return spacecraft from orbit had not yet been developed. At least 10 other dogs were launched into orbit and numerous others on sub-orbital flights before the historic date of 12 April 1961, when Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space.

On 13 December 1958, a Jupiter IRBM, AM-13, was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a United States Navy-trained South American squirrel monkey named Gordo on board. The nose cone recovery parachute failed to operate and Gordo was lost. Telemetry data sent back during the flight showed that the monkey survived the 10 g of launch, 8 minutes of weightlessness and 40 &quot;g&quot; of reentry at . The nose cone sank downrange from Cape Canaveral and was not recovered.

Monkeys Miss Able and Miss Baker became the first monkeys to survive spaceflight after their 1959 flight. On 28 May 1959, aboard Jupiter IRBM AM-18, were a American-born rhesus monkey, Able, from Independence, Kansas, and a squirrel monkey from Peru, Baker. The monkeys rode in the nose cone of the missile to an altitude of and a distance of down the Atlantic Missile Range from Cape Canaveral, Florida. They withstood forces 38 times the normal pull of gravity and were weightless for about 9 minutes. A top speed of was reached during their 16-minute flight. The monkeys survived the flight in good condition. Able died four days after the flight from a reaction to anesthesia, while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode. Baker was the center of media attention for the next several months as she was watched closely for any ill-effects from her space flight. She was even mated in an attempt to test her reproductive system. Baker lived until 29 November 1984, at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

On 2 July 1959, a launch of a Soviet R2 rocket, which reached , carried two space dogs and Marfusha, the first rabbit to go into space.

A 19 September 1959 launch, a Jupiter AM-23, carried two frogs and 12 mice but was destroyed during launch.

On 4 December 1959, a rhesus macaque Sam flew on the Little Joe 2 mission of Project Mercury to an altitude of .

=== 1960s ===
On 19 August 1960 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 5 (also known as Korabl-Sputnik 2) which carried the dogs Belka and Strelka, along with a gray rabbit, 40 mice, 2 rats, and 15 flasks of fruit flies and plants. It was the first spacecraft to carry animals into orbit and return them alive. One of Strelka&#x27;s pups, Pushinka, bred and born after her mission, was given as a present to Caroline Kennedy by Nikita Khrushchev in 1961, and many descendants are known to exist.

The US sent three black mice: Sally, Amy and Moe 1,000 km up and 8,000 km distance from Cape Canaveral on 13 October 1960 using an Atlas D 71D launch vehicle. The mice were retrieved from the nosecone near Ascension Island and were said to be in good condition.

On 31 January 1961, Ham, a chimpanzee, was launched into sub-orbital space in a Mercury capsule aboard a Redstone rocket to become the first great ape in space. Ham&#x27;s mission was Mercury-Redstone 2. The chimpanzee had been trained to pull levers to receive rewards of banana pellets and avoid electric shocks. His flight demonstrated the ability to perform tasks during spaceflight. A little over three months later the United States sent Alan Shepard into space on a suborbital flight. 

Enos became the first and only chimpanzee to reach Earth orbit when, on 29 November 1961, he flew two orbits in a Mercury capsule on the Mercury-Atlas 5 mission. Two months later Project Mercury pilot John Glenn orbited the Earth. 

On 9 March 1961 the Soviet Union launched the Korabl-Sputnik 4 that carried a dog named Chernushka, some mice, frogs and, for the first time into space, a guinea pig. All were successfully recovered.

France flew their first rat (Hector) into space on 22 February 1961. Two more rats were flown in October 1962.

On 18 October 1963, France launched Félicette the cat aboard Veronique AGI sounding rocket No. 47. The launch was directed by the French Centre d&#x27;Enseignement et de Recherches de Médecine Aéronautique (CERMA). Félicette was recovered alive after a 15-minute flight and a descent by parachute. Félicette had electrodes implanted into her brain, and the recorded neural impulses were transmitted back to Earth. After two months of analysis, she was euthanized so an autopsy could be performed. On 18 December 2019 a bronze statue with the effigy of Félicette was inaugurated at the &quot;Université internationalle de l&#x27;espace&quot; in Strasbourg, France. A second cat was sent to space by CERMA on 24 October 1963, but the flight ran into difficulties that prevented recovery. In 1967, France launched two pig-tailed macaque monkeys into suborbital space.

China launched mice and rats in 1964 and 1965, and two dogs in 1966.

During the Voskhod program, two Soviet space dogs, Veterok (Ветерок, Little Wind) and Ugolyok (Уголёк, Blackie), were launched on 22 February 1966, on board Cosmos 110 and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on 16 March. This spaceflight of record-breaking duration was not surpassed by humans until Soyuz 11 in 1971 and still stands as the longest space flight by dogs.

The US launched Biosatellite I in 1966 and Biosatellite I/II in 1967 with fruit flies, parasitic wasps, flour beetles and frog eggs, along with bacteria, amoebae, plants and fungi.

On 11 April 1967, Argentina also launched the rat Belisario, atop a Yarará rocket, from Cordoba military range, which was recovered successfully. This flight was followed by a series of subsequent flights using rats. It is unclear if any Argentinean biological flights passed the 100 km limit of space.

The first animals in deep space, the first to circle the Moon, and the first two tortoises in space were launched on Zond 5 on 14 September 1968 by the Soviet Union. The Horsfield&#x27;s tortoises were sent on a circumlunar voyage to the Moon along with wine flies, meal worms, and other biological specimens. These were the first inhabitants of Earth to travel around the Moon. The capsule overshot its terrestrial landing site but was successfully recovered at sea on 21 September. The animals survived but underwent weight loss. More turtles followed on the circumlunar Zond 6 mission of November 1968 (ahead of the December U.S. crewed Apollo 8 mission) and four turtles flew on the circumlunar Zond 7 mission which flew around the Moon on August 11, 1969, three weeks after Apollo 11&#x27;s Moon walk.

On 28 June 1969, the US launched the monkey Bonny, a macaque, on Biosatellite 3 in what was intended to have been a 30-day orbit around the Earth, with the monkey being fed by food pellets from a dispenser that he had been trained to operate. Bonny&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly and he was returned to Earth on 7 July, but died the next day after the Biosatellite capsule was recovered in the Pacific Ocean.

In total in the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union launched missions with at least 57 passenger slots for dogs. The actual number of dogs in space is smaller, because some dogs flew more than once.

On 23 December 1969, as part of the &#x27;Operación Navidad&#x27; (Operation Christmas), Argentina launched Juan (a cai monkey, native of Argentina&#x27;s Misiones Province) using a Canopus II rocket. It ascended 82 kilometers and then was recovered successfully. Later, on 1 February 1970 the experience was repeated with a female monkey of the same species using a X-1 Panther rocket. It reached a higher altitude than its predecessor, but it was lost after the capsule&#x27;s parachute failed.

=== 1970s ===

Two bullfrogs were launched on a one-way mission on the Orbiting Frog Otolith satellite on 9 November 1970, to understand more about space motion sickness.

Apollo 16, launched on 16 April 1972, carried nematodes. Apollo 17, launched on 7 December 1972, carried five pocket mice, Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey, who stayed in the command module with astronaut Ronald Evans as it circled the Moon for six days. One of the mice died on the trip.

Skylab 3 (1973) carried pocket mice and the first fish in space (a mummichog), and the first spiders in space (garden spiders named Arabella and Anita). Mummichog were also flown by the U.S. on the Apollo–Soyuz joint mission, launched 15 July 1975.

The Soviets flew several Bion program missions which consisted of satellites with biological cargoes. On these launches they flew tortoises, rats, and mummichog. On Soyuz 20, launched 17 November 1975, tortoises set the duration record for an animal in space when they spent 90.5 days in space. Salyut 5 on 22 June 1976, carried tortoises and a fish (a zebra danio).

=== 1980s ===

The Soviet Union sent eight monkeys into space in the 1980s on Bion flights. Bion flights also flew zebra danio, fruit flies, rats, stick insect eggs and the first newts in space.

In 1985, the U.S. sent two squirrel monkeys aboard Spacelab 3 on the Space Shuttle with 24 male albino rats and stick insect eggs.

Bion 7 (1985) had 10 newts (&quot;Pleurodeles waltl&quot;) on board. The newts had part of their front limbs amputated, to study the rate of regeneration in space, knowledge to understand human recovery from space injuries.

After an experiment was lost in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, chicken embryos (fertilized eggs) were sent into space in an experiment on STS-29 in 1989. The experiment was designed for a student contest.

=== 1990s ===

Four monkeys flew aboard the last Bion flights of the Soviet Union as well as frogs and fruit flies. The Foton program flights carried dormant brine shrimp (&quot;Artemia franciscana&quot;), newts, fruit flies, and sand desert beetles (&quot;Trigonoscelis gigas&quot;).

China launched guinea pigs in 1990.

Toyohiro Akiyama, a Japanese journalist, carried Japanese tree frogs with him during his trip to the &quot;Mir&quot; space station in December 1990. Other biological experiments aboard Mir involved quail eggs.

In 1994, four Japanese rice fish successfully mated and laid eggs that hatched to produce healthy fry aboard STS-65, making them the first animals to conceive and bear offspring in space.

Japan launched its first animals, a species of newt, into space on 18 March 1995 aboard the Space Flyer Unit.

During the 1990s the U.S. carried crickets, mice, rats, frogs, newts, fruit flies, snails, carp, medaka (rice fish), oyster toadfish, sea urchins, swordtail fish, spongy moth eggs, stick insect eggs, brine shrimp (&quot;Artemia salina&quot;), quail eggs, and jellyfish aboard Space Shuttles.

=== 2000s ===
The last flight of &quot;Columbia&quot; in 2003 carried silkworms, garden orb spiders, carpenter bees, harvester ants, and Japanese killifish (medaka). Nematodes (&quot;C. elegans&quot;) from one experiment were found still alive in the debris after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.

&quot;C. elegans&quot; are also part of experiments aboard the International Space Station as well as research using quail eggs.

Earlier Space Shuttle missions included grade school, junior high and high school projects; some of these included ants, stick insect eggs and brine shrimp cysts. Other science missions included spongy moth eggs.

On 12 July 2006, Bigelow Aerospace launched their &quot;Genesis I&quot; inflatable space module, containing many small items such as toys and simple experiments chosen by company employees that would be observed via camera. These items included insects, perhaps making it the first private flight to launch animals into space. Included were Madagascar hissing cockroaches and Mexican jumping beans — seeds containing live larvae of the moth &quot;Cydia saltitans&quot;. On 28 June 2007, Bigelow launched &quot;Genesis II&quot;, a near-twin to &quot;Genesis I&quot;. This spacecraft also carried Madagascar hissing cockroaches and added South African flat rock scorpions (&quot;Hadogenes troglodytes&quot;) and seed-harvester ants (&quot;Pogonomyrmex californicus&quot;).

In September 2007, during the European Space Agency&#x27;s FOTON-M3 mission, tardigrades, also known as water-bears, were able to survive 10 days of exposure to open-space with only their natural protection.

On the same mission, a number of cockroaches were carried inside a sealed container and at least one of the females, named Nadezhda, conceived during the mission and produced 33 offspring after returning to Earth.

On 15 March 2009, during the countdown of the STS-119, a free-tailed bat was seen clinging to the fuel tank. NASA observers believed the bat would fly off once the Shuttle started to launch, but it did not. Upon analyzing the images, a wildlife expert who provided support to the center said it likely had a broken left wing and some problem with its right shoulder or wrist. The animal most likely perished quickly during &quot;Discovery&quot;″s climb into orbit.

In November 2009, STS-129 took painted lady and monarch butterfly larvae into space for a school experiment as well as thousands of &quot;C. elegans&quot; roundworms for long-term weight loss studies.

=== 2010s ===
In May 2011, the last flight of (STS-134) carried two golden orb spiders, named Gladys and Esmeralda, as well as a fruit fly colony as their food source in order to study the effects of microgravity on spiders&#x27; behavior. Tardigrades and extremophiles were also sent into orbit.

In November 2011, the Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment on the Fobos-Grunt mission planned to carry tardigrades to Mars and back; however, the mission failed to leave Earth orbit.

In October 2012, 32 medaka fish were delivered to the International Space Station by Soyuz TMA-06M for the new Aquatic Habitat in the Kibo module.

On 28 January 2013, Iranian news agencies reported that Iran sent a monkey in a &quot;Pishgam&quot; rocket to a height of and retrieved a &quot;shipment&quot;. Later Iran&#x27;s space research website uploaded an 18-minute video. The video was uploaded later on YouTube.

On 3 February 2013, on the 31st anniversary of its revolution, Iran became the latest country to launch animals into space. The animals (a mouse, two turtles and some worms) were launched on top of the Kavoshgar 3 rocket and returned alive to Earth.

In January 2014, the search strategies of pavement ants were studied on the ISS.

On 19 July 2014, Russia announced that they launched their Foton-M4 satellite into low Earth orbit (575 kilometers) with one male and four female geckos (possibly gold dust day geckos) as the payload. This was an effort to study the effects of microgravity on reproductive habits of reptiles. On 24 July 2014, it was announced that Russia had lost control of the Foton-M4 satellite, leaving only two months to restore contact before the geckos&#x27; food supply was exhausted. Control of the satellite was subsequently restored on 28 July 2014. On 1 September 2014 Russia confirmed the death of all five geckos, stating that their mummified bodies seem to indicate they froze to death. Russia is said to have appointed an emergency commission to investigate the animals&#x27; deaths.

On 23 September 2014, SpaceX CRS-4 mission delivered 20 mice to live on the ISS for study of the long-term effects of microgravity on the rodents. This was the first use of the Rodent Research Hardware System.

On 14 April 2015, the SpaceX CRS-6 delivered 20 C57BL/6NTAC mice to live on the ISS for evaluating microgravity as the extreme opposite of a healthy active lifestyle. In the absence of gravity, astronauts are subject to a decrease in muscle, bone, and tendon mass. &quot;Although, we&#x27;re not out to treat couch potatoes,&quot; states head Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research (NIBR) scientist on the project Dr. Sam Cadena, &quot;we&#x27;re hoping that these experiments will help us to better understand muscle loss in populations where physical activity in any form is not an option; e.g., in the frail elderly or those subjected to bed rest or immobilization due to surgery or chronic disease.&quot;

On 8 April 2016, Rodent Research 3 delivered 20 mice on SpaceX CRS-8. The experiment sponsored by Eli Lilly and Co. was a study of myostatin inhibition for the prevention of skeletal and muscle atrophy and weakness. Mice are known to have rapid loss of muscle and bone mass after as little as 12 days of space flight exposure. The mice were euthanized and dissected on the station and then frozen for eventual return to Earth for further study.

On 29 June 2018, a SpaceX Dragon spaceship blasted off from Florida carrying 20 mice. The rodent crew arrived at the ISS on 2 July 2018. Their record-breaking journey – this was the longest mice have been off the planet – was part of a study on how Earth-dwellers&#x27; physiology and sleep schedules responded to the stress of being in space.

The Chinese lunar lander Chang&#x27;e 4 carries a 3 kg sealed container with seeds and insect eggs to test whether plants and insects could hatch and grow together in synergy. The experiment includes six types of organisms: cottonseed, potato, rapeseed, &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; (a flowering plant), as well as yeast and fruit fly eggs. If the eggs hatch, the larvae would produce carbon dioxide, while the germinated plants would release oxygen through photosynthesis. A miniature camera is imaging the growth.

On 11 April 2019, the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet crashed into the Moon during a failed landing attempt. Its payload included a few thousand tardigrades. They could potentially survive on the lunar surface for some years, although it is unclear if they survived the impact.

=== 2020s ===
On 3 June 2021, SpaceX CRS-22 launched tardigrades (water bears) and Hawaiian bobtail squid to the ISS. The squid were launched as hatchlings and will be studied to see if they can incorporate their symbiotic bacteria into their light organ while in space.

<text>The Sancy, a pale yellow diamond of , was once reputed to have belonged to the Mughals of antiquity, but it is more likely of Indian origin owing to its cut, which is unusual by Western standards. The stone has been owned by a number of important figures in European history, such as Charles the Bold, James VI and I, and the Astor family.

The shield-shaped stone comprises two back-to-back crowns (the typical upper half of a stone) but lacks any semblance to a pavilion (the lower portion of a stone, below the girdle or midsection).

==History==
The diamond now known as the &quot;Sancy&quot; began as an even larger diamond called the &quot;Balle de Flandres&quot; with a possible weight of over . The &quot;Balle&quot; was part of the dowry of Valentina Visconti when she married Louis I, Duke of Orléans (the younger brother of King Charles VI of France) in 1398. While the precise path of ownership over the next 75 years is uncertain, the stone found its way to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who lost it together with an array of other treasures – including his silver bath and the Three Brothers jewel – in the Battle of Grandson in 1476. Balfour (2009) posits that this diamond is the same stone that eventually became the &quot;Sancy&quot;.

After Charles died, in 1477 the diamond passed to his cousin King Manuel I of Portugal. When Portugal was threatened to come under Spanish rule, claimant António, Prior of Crato fled the country with the bulk of the Portuguese Crown Jewels. He spent his life trying to get allies to regain the Portuguese throne in the French and English courts, and eventually sold the diamond to Nicolas de Harlay, seigneur de Sancy.
 Other sources claim that the diamond was purchased in Constantinople by de Sancy. He was popular in the French Court and was later French Ambassador to Turkey. Something of a gem connoisseur, de Sancy used his knowledge to prosperous advantage.

Henry III of France suffered from premature baldness and tried to conceal this fact by wearing a cap. As diamonds were becoming increasingly fashionable at the time, Henry arranged to borrow de Sancy&#x27;s diamond to decorate his cap. Henry&#x27;s successor Henry IV of France also borrowed the stone, but for the more practical purpose of collateral for financing an army. An apocryphal tale from the time of de Sancy&#x27;s possession of the stone tells of a messenger carrying the jewel, but never reaching his destination. Nevertheless, de Sancy (by then Superintendent of Finance) was convinced that the man had remained loyal and conducted a search until the messenger was discovered robbed and murdered. When the body was disinterred, the jewel was found in the faithful man&#x27;s stomach.

Facing financial difficulties, de Sancy was forced to sell the diamond to King James VI and I in March 1605 when it is thought the &quot;Sancy&quot; acquired its name. It weighed 53 carats and cost 60,000 French crowns. De Sancy&#x27;s brother, Robert de Harlay, Baron of Monglat, and his cousin Christophe de Harlay, Count of Beaumont, the French ambassador in London handled the sale. It was described in the Tower of London&#x27;s 1605 Inventory of Jewels as &quot;...one fayre dyamonde, cut in fawcetts, bought of Sauncy.&quot; James had it set into the Mirror of Great Britain, with diamonds from the Great H of Scotland.

The &quot;Sancy&quot; was briefly possessed by Charles I (King of England, Scotland and Ireland) and then by his third son James II. Beleaguered after a devastating defeat, James took shelter under Louis XIV of France, a fickle host who tired of his exiled guest. Facing destitution, James had no choice but to sell the &quot;Sancy&quot; to Cardinal Mazarin in 1657 for the reported sum of £25,000. The cardinal bequeathed the diamond to the king upon his death in 1661.

The &quot;Sancy&quot; was thus domiciled in France but disappeared during the French Revolution when brigands raided the Garde Meuble (Royal Treasury). As well as the &quot;Sancy&quot;, other treasures stolen were the Regent Diamond, and the French Blue diamond which is known today as the Hope Diamond.

The &quot;Sancy&quot; was in the collection of Konstantin Rudanovsky until 1828 when purchased by Prince Paul Demidoff for £80,000. Prince Demidoff gave the &quot;Sancy&quot; 1836 to his Finnish wife, Aurora Demidoff (Stjernvall), as a morning gift. Prince Demidoff died 1840 and Aurora married again 1846 with colonel Andrei Karamzin who died 1854 in Crimean war. Aurora Karamzin had to sell the &quot;Sancy&quot; in 1865 to Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, an Indian merchant prince, for £100,000 to cover the debts of her son Paul Demidoff. Sir Jamtsetjee sold the &quot;Sancy&quot; only a year later, creating another gap in its history. It reappeared in 1867, displayed at the Paris Exposition, carrying a price tag of one million francs; the gem then vanished again for forty years.
The &quot;Sancy&quot; next surfaced in 1906 when bought by William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor, from famous Russian collector A.K. Rudanovsky. The prominent Astor family possessed it for 72 years until the 4th Viscount Astor sold it to the Louvre for $1 million in 1978. The &quot;Sancy&quot; now rests in the Apollo Gallery, together with the likes of the Regent Diamond and the Hortensia Diamond.

<doc id="600631" wikidata="Q7297777" url="?curid=600631" title="Ray Mallon">
<text>Ray Mallon (born 1955) is a British politician who was the independent Mayor of Middlesbrough from 2002 to 2015. Prior to his political career he served in the police until he resigned after pleading guilty to charges of misconduct.

==Early life==
Mallon was born to an undertaker and was raised as a Catholic. He left school at the age of sixteen with no qualifications. He played water polo internationally.

==Police career==
Mallon joined Cleveland Police in 1974. He was appointed detective chief inspector for Hartlepool in 1994. During his tenure in this role, crime fell in the area by 35%. He was promoted to detective superintendent in November 1996, and crime rates continued to fall. Mallon was nicknamed &quot;Robocop&quot; over his New York-inspired zero tolerance approach to anti-social crime. This approach was praised by Tony Blair and by home secretaries, but was criticised by police officers as &quot;old-style confrontational policing&quot;.

===Investigation and resignation===
In December 1997, Mallon was one of sixty-one police officers suspended from duty amid allegations of misconduct as part of Operation Lancet. Claims against the officers included tipping off suspects and exchanging drugs for confessions. Charges against Mallon included nine of neglect of duty, three of falsehood and prevarication, one of discreditable conduct and one of misconduct towards of a member of the police force, which he described as &quot;minor&quot; disciplinary matters. By June 2000, the Crown Prosecution Service had found insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Mallon remained under internal disciplinary investigation. He offered his resignation in August 2001, but this was rejected by the chief constable so that a disciplinary hearing could take place. He pleaded guilty to all fourteen charges against him in February 2002, claiming he did nothing wrong but only pleaded guilty so he could be free to stand to be Mayor of Middlesbrough, as police officers are unable to campaign politically. The chief constable, Barry Shaw, described Mallon as &quot;a liar at the centre of an empire of evil&quot;.

After his resignation and before his election, Mallon worked as a consultant for a bathroom company.

== Mayor of Middlesbrough ==
Mallon was elected as the first Mayor of Middlesbrough in 2002, winning more than 60% of the vote as an independent candidate. He accepted applications for roles in his nine-member cabinet from all parties, though the Labour group on the council initially maintained a boycott. He kept a council of seven Labour councillors, one Conservative and one independent.

He increased the use of CCTV in the town centre and started a programme of neighbourhood wardens that brought street offences to a historic low. Many residents in Gresham, near central Middlesbrough, including ward councillor and former council leader Ken Walker, vocally opposed Mallon-supported 2005 plans to demolish 1,453 homes across thirty-seven streets as part of a regeneration scheme. Mallon ordered the demolition to pause in 2013 after 280 properties were demolished, saying he had made a mistake. The final demolition plan was scaled back to 561 homes. Mallon proclaimed a boycott of Channel 4 and protested to Ofcom over a description of Middlesbrough as the worst place to live in Britain as part of its programme Location, Location, Location.

In 2011, owner of local taxi firm Boro Taxis Mohammed Bashir published a recording of a conversation he had with Mallon in which the mayor made an inappropriate remark about a female colleague and used slurs on local British Asian taxi drivers. The Standards Board for England found that he had brought the office into disrepute and failed to declare an interest regarding his friendship with Bashir on two occasions.

The council sold Acklam Hall, the town&#x27;s only Grade I-listed building, for £900,000 in 2014. The sale was criticised at the time as undervalued, with independent councillor Len Junier suggesting the deal made had been &quot;dodgy&quot;. Mallon defended the sale and referred himself to the council&#x27;s Standards Committee.

Mallon stood down in 2015, not contesting the mayoral election of that year. He declared that he would leave politics whilst leaving open the option of returning to politics if a local metro mayoralty were to be established.

== After mayoralty ==
After leaving the position of Mayor of Middlesbrough, Mallon took up a role as a non-executive director for a project to redevelop the site of Manston Airport in Kent. Controversy over the sale of Acklam Hall remained, with the former council monitoring officer Karen Whitmore claiming that then-deputy mayor Dave Budd had told her about a conversation in which Mallon had admitted discussion reducing the price of the building with a property developer, which Budd later denied. Sales of assets to Mallon&#x27;s former election agent Nasser Din at prices lower than other offers that the council rejected as well as independent valuations were also criticised and investigated, with the Tees Valley Audit and Assurance Services finding that there was a &quot;cause for concern bordering on significant concern&quot; but without any evidence of criminal activity.

== Political views ==
Mallon has been sought for roles by both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. He has described himself as a &quot;socialist type&quot; and &quot;more of a Labour person&quot; but not &quot;anti-Conservative&quot;, and been identified with New Labour. He chaired a policing policy group for the Centre for Social Justice, a conservative think tank. In 2011, Mallon criticised cuts to local government as &quot;a financial war on us&quot; disproportionally affecting more deprived areas, while supporting deficit reduction in principle. He identified the greatest problem in Middlesbrough as premature death.

In the 2004 referendum on a North East England regional assembly, Mallon was described as a &quot;late comer&quot; to the race by BBC Look North political correspondent Richard Moss. Mallon supported a regional assembly, however the &quot;yes&quot; campaign was defeated by almost 500,000 votes, and lost in every electing council area.

Following his background in the police, Mallon kept focus on law and order. He has consistently expressed hostility towards beggars, including accusing them of begging as a more profitable alternative to crime.

Mallon was sceptical of the introduction of directly-elected police and crime commissioners. He opposes the system of directly elected mayors for local authorities and has advocated for a mayor for the Tees Valley.

<doc id="600636" wikidata="Q7196034" url="?curid=600636" title="Pink Lady (TV series)">
<text>Pink Lady is an American variety show that aired for five weeks on NBC in 1980, starring the Japanese musical duo of the same name. The show is also referred to by the title Pink Lady and Jeff, referring to co-star Jeff Altman. The show was riddled with complications, including a dispute over the name: agents for the starring parties were never able to settle on one, and the show was advertised both ways during its run. Other difficulties included scriptwriting disagreements, guest star booking mishaps, taping and touring conflicts, and the inability of Mie and Kei, the members of Pink Lady, to understand or speak English.

Pink Lady was massively popular in Japan and even enjoyed a hit in the U.S. with the English-language song &quot;Kiss in the Dark&quot;. A television show for the duo was proposed and swiftly approved. The show&#x27;s developers, Sid and Marty Krofft, pursued the project under the erroneous assumption that the stars spoke both English and Japanese. When the reality became apparent, network executives insisted that Mie and Kei not only perform their English dialog phonetically, but also sing in English. The resulting clumsy diction compounded the show&#x27;s other problems, and despite the infusion of expensive co-stars, the series did poorly and was cancelled after five episodes. The series ranked #35 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;The 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time&quot; list.

==Synopsis==
The series starred Japanese female singing duo Pink Lady, composed of &quot;Mie&quot; (Mitsuyo Nemoto) and &quot;Kei&quot; (Keiko Masuda), and American comedian Jeff Altman. The format of the show featured musical numbers alternating with sketch comedy. A running gag of the series was the girls&#x27; lack of understanding of American culture and of English; in reality, Pink Lady spoke no English at all. On the show, Jeff attempted to translate and explain, leading to more confusion.

The series featured Pink Lady performing songs, usually English-language disco and pop songs such as &quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot; or &quot;Yesterday&quot;, and interaction with celebrity and musical guests. The group would end the show by jumping into a hot tub together. After the poorly rated series premiere, NBC moved &quot;Pink Lady&quot; to Friday nights and added Jim Varney as a character actor. The move and retooling failed to help ratings and the series was canceled after five episodes.

==Production==
The show was the brainchild of Fred Silverman, then president and CEO of NBC, who wanted to replicate the success he had had at ABC and CBS. After seeing a Walter Cronkite story about Pink Lady on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, Silverman thought their Japanese success could be translated to the American market, so he brought in Sid and Marty Krofft to produce a variety show for them. At the time, Pink Lady had recently achieved their first and only top-40 hit on the U.S. &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&quot;, when their song &quot;Kiss in the Dark&quot; peaked at no. 37 in August 1979. The Krofft brothers were told that the ladies were fluent in English, which they were not. Unsure of how to stage the show, Sid Krofft developed the concept of making &quot;the strangest thing that&#x27;s ever been on television...The whole show was gonna come out of a little Japanese box.&quot; Silverman&#x27;s response was, &quot;No, that&#x27;s just too different. Let&#x27;s just do &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;.&quot;

Comedian Jeff Altman had a contract with NBC, and on that basis, was offered work hosting the show to compensate for the leads having no knowledge of English. Writer Mark Evanier previously worked with the Kroffts on &quot;The Krofft Superstar Hour&quot; and the pilot &quot;Bobby Vinton&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rollers&quot; and was brought on board as head writer, and seasoned variety show director Art Fisher (&quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;) was brought in to direct. According to Evanier, Fisher disliked the show and only participated because he was contractually obligated.

The language barrier proved to be the biggest obstacle. Mie and Kei had to hold English conversations using an on-set translator. The writers struggled because once dialogue had been written for and learned by the ladies, it could not be changed. This was particularly problematic when a guest star would be booked at the last minute, such as Lorne Greene, who agreed to appear on the show only four hours before the episode was taped. Mie and Kei wanted to sing the songs that had made them famous in their native country, but NBC insisted they perform in English. This resulted in recording English songs phonetically and lip-syncing for the show&#x27;s taping. Lip-syncing was already a common practice on American variety shows, but it was especially noticeable since the ladies were performing in a language that was foreign to them. Additional problems were caused when the network insisted the writers develop separate identities for Mie and Kei. The established &quot;Pink Lady&quot; act was so fixed in unison that they performed as one entity, so the two were not comfortable having separate stage personalities.

Because Mie and Kei commuted between the U.S. and Japan to appear in sold-out concerts, their time on the set was spent memorizing lines and routines, forcing the brunt of the comedy on Altman and ensemble players Jim Varney, Cheri Steinkellner and Anna Mathias. On the rare occasions when Mie and Kei appeared in sketches, their time was minimal.

Booking guests for the show was also a problem. Variety shows were fading by 1980, which was exacerbated by the fact the series&#x27; headliners were not a household name in the U.S. Larry Hagman and other A-list stars were coerced into appearing by offering sizable monetary incentives. Other stars who had previously worked with the Kroffts were also brought in, including Florence Henderson (&quot;The Brady Bunch Hour&quot;), Donny Osmond (&quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;), Red Buttons (&quot;Side Show&quot;) and Bobby Vinton (&quot;Bobby Vinton&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rollers&quot;). To ease the need for live, in-person performances, &quot;Pink Lady&quot; incorporated pre-recorded music videos in lieu of musical acts. Alice Cooper was friends with the Kroffts and submitted an original performance from his upcoming album as a favor to them. Cheap Trick&#x27;s music video for &quot;Dream Police&quot; was shown as were Blondie&#x27;s videos for &quot;Shayla&quot; and &quot;Eat to the Beat,&quot; both shot for a then-newly released home video.

Each show ended with a tuxedo-clad Jeff getting lured, pushed or pulled into the on-set hot tub by Mie and Kei. This gag originated with Sid Krofft, who had used a similar device on &quot;The Brady Bunch Hour;&quot; in each episode, Greg would push Peter into the swimming pool. Altman felt it would have been an amusing one-time gag, but by employing it each week, it became contrived. Altman tried to convince the writing staff to do away with this segment, but he was vetoed, likely because the segment afforded everyone the opportunity to see Mie and Kei in bikinis.

The show&#x27;s title was a source of confusion. The onscreen title was &quot;Pink Lady,&quot; but the series was commonly referred to as &quot;Pink Lady and Jeff&quot;. Altman felt that since he carried the show, his name should appear in the title, and the network agreed, but Pink Lady&#x27;s manager strongly protested and threatened a lawsuit if &quot;and Jeff&quot; appeared on the show&#x27;s title. NBC&#x27;s promos occasionally referred to as &quot;Pink Lady,&quot; whereas at other times the voice-over announcer referred to it as &quot;Pink Lady and Jeff.&quot; In print advertisements for &quot;TV Guide&quot; the show was always titled &quot;Pink Lady and Jeff,&quot; though it was cited as &quot;Pink Lady&quot; in the text TV listings.

<doc id="600648" wikidata="Q257557" url="?curid=600648" title="Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly">
<text>Anne de Pisseleu d&#x27;Heilly (), Duchess of Étampes, (15081580) was chief mistress of Francis I of France. She became Francis&#x27; mistress following his return from captivity in 1526. Anne enriched her family and friends through her courtly influence and after Francis&#x27; death was banished from court and temporarily imprisoned in her husband&#x27;s castle. She would spend her later years ensuring the fortune of her family. Anne died in 1580.

== King&#x27;s mistress ==
Born in 1508, Anne was the daughter of Guillaume de Pisseleu, &quot;seigneur&quot; d&#x27;Heilly, a nobleman of Picardy, and Anne Sanguin. She came to court before 1522 and was one of the maids-of-honour of Marie of Luxembourg and later Louise of Savoy, Duchess of Angoulême, the mother of Francis I. Francis made Anne his mistress, probably upon his return from his captivity at Madrid (1526), and soon gave up his long-term mistress, Françoise de Foix, for her.

Anne was described as being sprightly, pretty, witty and cultured, &quot;the most beautiful among the learned and the most learned among the beautiful&quot;. The liaison received some official recognition when Francis started wearing Anne&#x27;s colors. Anne was appointed lady-in-waiting to the new queen, Eleanor of Austria, and later became governess to Francis&#x27; two daughters. She used her influence with Francis to elevate and enrich her family; her brother, Adrien sieur d&#x27;Heilly, was made captain of the Picard legion, her uncle, Antoine Sanguin, being made Bishop of Orléans in 1533 and a cardinal in 1539; her three other brothers were made bishops. In 1534, Francis gave her in marriage to Jean IV de Brosse, whom he created Duke of Étampes.


==Court influence==
With the political fall of the Duke of Montmorency in 1540, Anne became all-powerful at court. Surrounded by those seeking royal favor, she dominated court functions. Foreign diplomats quickly learned they had to gain Anne&#x27;s favor for their plans to have any chance in succeeding. In doing so, she usurped Queen Eleanor&#x27;s position at court. Anne later illustrated her political influence by having Admiral Chabot released and returned to court, marrying her sister Louise to Chabot&#x27;s nephew in the process.

Despite her capabilities, Anne was of a fickle nature. In 1545, she tried to discredit Admiral d&#x27;Annebault, despite him owing his advancement to her. When her intrigues were discouraged by Archbishop Tournon, Anne attempted to bring about his fall on a charge of dishonesty.

The influence of Anne, especially in the last years of Francis&#x27; reign, continued to grow. A staunch Protestant, she counseled Francis on toleration for Huguenots. By October 1546, Anne, along with Cardinal du Bellay, was pressuring Francis to break with Rome. Due to her influence Francis was attending more council meetings, and according to an imperial envoy, Anne was &quot;the real president of the king&#x27;s most private and intimate council&quot;.

Basking in her success at bringing peace between Francis and Charles at Crepy in 1544, Anne convinced Francis that his son the Dauphin Henry and Diane de Poitiers were working to reinstate Montmorency at court. Francis, so instructed, banished Diane from court. In response, Henry and his supporters retreated to the chateau of Anet; father and son would not reconcile until 1545.

==Loss of position==
Despite having influence at Francis&#x27; court, Anne had made many enemies: Henry, his mistress, Diane de Poitiers, and Anne de Montmorency were among them. Following Francis&#x27; death in March 1547, Henry, now king, had Anne dismissed from the court and confiscated her possessions. By 1548, Anne was facing the threat of trial for heresy. Henry chose not to pursue this possibly out of respect for his father. Her husband accused her of theft of his governorship salary and disgracing his family, and had Anne confined temporarily to the castle of La Hardoinaye.

Anne was still a wealthy woman, having properties in Paris and a capital of 47,615 livres in &quot;rentes&quot;. By 1554-55 she was maintaining her niece Jossine de Pisseleu&#x27;s rights to the Lenoncourt succession from the Guise family. In March 1560, she gave 114,000 livres to her niece, Diane de Barbançon, for her marriage to Jean de Rohan, baron de Frontenay. Anne gave 30,000 livres for her nephew Jean d&#x27;Heilly&#x27;s first marriage, and acted as the intermediary for Jean&#x27;s second marriage, writing to the lady&#x27;s ward. She continued to be involved in the lives of her nieces and nephews into her later years.

Anne died in 1580.

<text>NOCTI (National Occupational Competency Testing Institute) delivers a battery of assessments or Standardized tests for students studying career and technical programs in high schools and technical colleges in the United States. 
The assessments, based on a job and task analysis process, incorporate input from subject-matter experts (SMEs) representing regions of the United States in secondary and post-secondary education as well as business and industry. The assessments are updated on a regular basis and are aligned with O*NET, national academic standards (math, science, and language arts) as well as business and industry standards. When appropriate, customized assessments may be developed to meet the educational needs of a specific region or a state. 
A number of the assessments are linked to industry certifications programs.

==History==
NOCTI originated in 1966 funded by a grant from the US Commissioner of Education to Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. Due to the lack of vocational technical (currently referred to as career and technical) educators, a consortium of states was identified to develop assessments that would validate knowledge and skill sets of individuals coming from the workforce working toward a degree in career and technical education. NOCTI developed both written/multiple choice and performance/practical tests to assess teacher candidates. These assessments were given in a paper/pencil format at testing sites across the nation and scored at the NOCTI headquarters.

1972 NOCTI is established as a permanent organization, including a constitution, by-laws, and operating policies. 
1973 NOCTI is established as a not-for-profit corporation at Educational Testing Services (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey. 
1975 NOCTI becomes independent from ETS and moves to new headquarters in Albany, New York. 
1979 NOCTI expands its original mission of teacher candidate testing to secondary and post secondary student testing also known as SOCAT (student occupational competency assessment testing)

1983 NOCTI relocates to Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan. 
1985 NOCTI - Industrial assessments added to NOCTI&#x27;s battery of assessments. 
1995 NOCTI moves to its current address at 500 N. Bronson Avenue in Big Rapids, Michigan. 
1999 NOCTI - The Whitener Group is established as a wholly owned subsidiary of NOCTI to address the growing demand by business and industry NOCTI type assessments and services.

2003 NOCTI develops online testing platform to allow secondary and post secondary testing to be completed via the Internet. Currently both online and paper/pencil testing are available to clientele.

2006 NOCTI aligns all standardized assessments to the national academic standards for math, science and language arts. 
2007 NOCTI converts all standardized assessments to Text-to-Speech technology to address assessment accommodation needs.

<doc id="600660" wikidata="Q3411120" url="?curid=600660" title="Puyo Puyo~n">
<text>, also known as Puyo Puyo 4 and Puyo Puyo~n Party (for the N64 version), is a 1999 puzzle video game and the fourth installment of the &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; series, created by Compile for the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color. Like many of the Puyo Puyo games, it was never officially released outside Japan. The title of &quot;Puyo Puyo~n&quot; comes from the Japanese word , signifying the fourth game in the series.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of &quot;~n&quot; remains similar to &quot;Puyo Puyo 2&quot;, with a new addition of character specials. As Puyo are erased from the field, a power gauge fills up, enabling the use of a special ability. Each character&#x27;s ability differs, and vary between the home console versions and the Game Boy Color version. Each grid in the home console versions follows Special Rule, where a preset field and special board rules are implemented. In the Game Boy Color version, whenever garbage is countered, Sun Puyo fall on the field. The game also features several Endless modes involving grids larger or smaller than 6x12, and a Free Battle mode allowing for matches against any unlocked characters. The art is also vastly different from its predecessors, adopting a more serious tone.

There were subtle differences between the home console versions of &quot;~n&quot;, but the Game Boy Color version is vastly different. &quot;Puyo Puyo~n: Kaa-kun to Issho&quot; (lit. &quot;Puyo Puyo~n: Together with Carby&quot;) for the PlayStation has the same music as the Dreamcast version of &quot;Puyo Puyo~n&quot;, but only supports up to two players. &quot;Puyo Puyo~n Party 64&quot; for the Nintendo 64 has different music from the Dreamcast version and lacks the voiced cutscenes, but retains four player multiplayer and includes Transfer Pak support where the player can unlock more artwork by plugging in &quot;Pocket Puyo Puyo SUN&quot;. &quot;Pocket Puyo Puyo~n&quot; for the Game Boy Color uses music from &quot;Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun&quot; as well as music from &quot;Puyo~n&quot; itself, and features more characters, including some of the cast from &quot;Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun&quot;. It supports two players and follows the story of &quot;~n&quot;, retaining the comic humor of previous handheld versions. &quot;Pocket Puyo Puyo~n&quot; also has a special Rally mode to unlock the specials, and allows the player to choose their special before the game starts. &quot;Pocket Puyo Puyo~n&quot; does not have Special Rule or any board-specific functions like the home console versions, nor does it have any of the different grid sizes for Endless Puyo Puyo, but it does feature the ability to play Endless similarly to &quot;Puyo Puyo 2&quot;″s Action Endless (where garbage appears in the tray, and helpers appear at random times depending on the difficulty setting).

==Plot==
Unlike previous games in the series where the plot is rather comical, &quot;~n&quot; has a serious storyline, reminiscent of those in the &quot;Madō Monogatari&quot; games. The Dark Prince is found looking at some books in a magical library when he comes across a black box. He begins to examine the black box before it breaks free from his hands and opens. The next morning a Puyo Circus arrives, which Arle Nadja and Carbuncle go to check out. They are greeted by Pierrot, a mysterious jester-looking character.

When Arle arrives, something does not appear right, and Carbuncle disappears once more. Arle has to navigate her way past a number of foes as before. During her quest Draco, Serilly, Witch and Chico join up with Arle as they face Schezo and Rulue. Rulue knew something was up with the Dark Prince, and when Arle meets him, he appears strange and unlike his normal self. He freezes the other characters so that they do not interfere. Arle defeats the Dark Prince, who wakes up and asks why Arle is there. He further explains to Arle that he was brainwashed by a stronger foe, and Pierrot appears afterwards, revealing herself to be Doppelganger Arle. She and Arle fight to see who should exist, and Arle is victorious.

After the fight, Doppelganger Arle insists that she is &quot;The Real Arle&quot; who existed in the previous world. Weakened by her defeat, she soon fades away, much to Arle&#x27;s shock. Seconds later, Carbuncle reappears in the room and Arle is thrilled to see him again. The gem on Carbuncle&#x27;s forehead shines, and as Arle asks what was wrong, he discharges the beam from his forehead. The screen fades to white, then black, and the credits roll.

<doc id="600665" wikidata="Q2256391" url="?curid=600665" title="If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next">
<text>&quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 24 August 1998, through Epic Records as the first single from their fifth studio album, &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; (1998). The track sold 156,000 copies in its first week and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in August 1998. Outside the United Kingdom, the song reached number one in Iceland and the top 20 in Norway and Sweden. It became the band&#x27;s only song to chart in North America, peaking at number 19 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Alternative 30 chart.

==Background==
The song&#x27;s theme is inspired by the Spanish Civil War, and the idealism of Welsh volunteers who joined the left-wing International Brigades fighting for the Spanish Republic against Francisco Franco&#x27;s military rebels. The song takes its name from a Republican propaganda poster of the time written in English and displaying a photograph of a child killed by the Nationalists, under a sky filled with bomber aircraft, with the song&#x27;s titular warning written at the bottom.

Nicky Wire wrote the song&#x27;s lyrics in Barcelona. He felt especially proud of coming up with the opening line: &quot;The future teaches you to be alone, the present to be afraid and cold.&quot; Various real-life events from the Spanish Civil War provided inspiration. For example, the line &quot;If I can shoot rabbits/then I can shoot fascists&quot; is attributed to a remark made by a man to his brother who signed up with the Republican fighters. This was originally quoted in the book &quot;Miners Against Fascism&quot; by Hywel Francis. Another line, &quot;I&#x27;ve walked Las Ramblas/but not with real intent&quot;, brings to mind the account in George Orwell&#x27;s first-hand account of the war, &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; of fighting on the Ramblas. According to Orwell, the various factions were seemingly getting nowhere with the fighting and often a sense of camaraderie overriding the vaunted principles each side was supposed to be fighting for. Wire has also acknowledged that he was also inspired by a song by the Clash, &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot;, which features a similar subject.

The song was not originally intended for inclusion on &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot;. It was recorded in a separate session from the rest of the album and was seen as a potential B-side; its original demo was described by bassist Nicky Wire as &quot;crap.&quot;

==Release==
The song was released in the United Kingdom on 24 August 1998 as two CD singles. The first disc includes versions of &quot;Prologue to History&quot; and &quot;Montana/Autumn/78&quot;, and the second features a remix by Massive Attack and a mix by David Holmes. Six days later, the single secured the number-one spot on the UK Singles Chart despite competition from &quot;One for Sorrow&quot; by Steps, which was released the same day. It has sold more than 600,000 copies in the UK and has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also became the group&#x27;s biggest success on the Irish Singles Chart, reaching number three, and is the only Manic Street Preachers track to be released as a single in the United States and Canada. Although it did not appear on any US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, it became a moderate rock hit in Canada, peaking at number 19 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Alternative 30 chart for two weeks in August 1999.

The single was also a success in Sweden, where it reached number 21 and stayed in the chart for a total of 10 weeks. In Germany it reached number 79 and in the Netherlands, number 62; in both countries it remained on the charts for nine weeks. In Norway the song only charted for two weeks despite reaching number 19. It also reached number 49 in Australia and number 44 in New Zealand. In Japan, the single was released on 26 August 1998. &quot;If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next&quot; was nominated in the category of Best British Single at the 1999 BRIT Awards, losing to &quot;Angels&quot; by Robbie Williams.

In March 2009, it was discovered that the song was used on the website of the British National Party as the soundtrack of an article describing &quot;the violence, hatred, fragmentation and despair&quot; wrought on London by the &quot;great multicultural experiment&quot;. The choice of this song was considered ironic by many, considering the song contains lyrics such as &quot;So if I can shoot rabbits/Then I can shoot fascists&quot;. Record company Sony successfully had the song removed from the site on the grounds of unauthorised use. The BNP later released a press statement claiming that &quot;the song had mistakenly been automatically streamed on to its site and had nothing to do with the official party&quot;, and that &quot;you can interpret the lyrics any way you want&quot;.

==Music video==
The melody of the socialist anthem, &quot;The Internationale&quot; can be heard at the start and end of the video, played on a musical box. This was a popular song on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War.

Wire praised the single&#x27;s video, directed by W.I.Z. It features a typical nuclear family but with their eyes, mouths and ears sealed over with a flesh toned applicant with James Dean Bradfield also having his eyes sealed over by the same applicant in the last few seconds of the video. The family seem to exist in a futuristic show room, fashioned into a highly clinical &#x27;home&#x27; of sorts. Nicky Wire described the video as &quot;surreal, mildly disturbing ... with a suffocating feel to it despite its brightness.&quot; It was the fourth and final video directed by W.I.Z. for the band.

==Legacy==
The song is in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the number one single with the longest title without brackets. The song was voted number 20 on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Number One Singles&quot; list. The song was performed at the Concert for Ukraine by the band on 29 March 2022.

<doc id="600670" wikidata="Q7985893" url="?curid=600670" title="West Mercia Police">
<text>West Mercia Police (), formerly the West Mercia Constabulary, is the territorial police force responsible for policing the counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire (including Telford and Wrekin) and Worcestershire in England. The force area covers making it the fourth largest police area in England and Wales. The resident population of the area is 1.19 million Its name comes from the ancient kingdom of Mercia.

The force represents a diverse range of policing environments from densely populated urban areas on the edge of Birmingham as well as Telford, Shrewsbury, and Worcester, to sparsely populated rural areas, such as Herefordshire, which remains an important part of the force&#x27;s responsibility.

As of September 2017, the force has a workforce of 2,017 police officers, 223 police community support officers, 1541 police staff and 388 members of the special constabulary.

The force has its headquarters in the historical manor house and grounds of Hindlip Hall on the outskirts of Worcester. Its badge combines the heraldry of Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire.

==History==

The force was formed on 1 October 1967, by the merger of the Worcestershire Constabulary, Herefordshire Constabulary, Shropshire Constabulary and Worcester City Police. It lost territory to West Midlands Police when that was constituted on 1 April 1974. It changed its name from &quot;West Mercia Constabulary&quot; to &quot;West Mercia Police&quot; on 5 May 2009.

===Merger plans===
In November 2005, the government announced major reforms of policing in England and Wales, including the possibility of mergers. Under final proposals made by the Home Secretary on 6 February 2006, it would merge with Staffordshire Police, Warwickshire Constabulary and West Midlands Police to form a single strategic force for the West Midlands region. The proposals were unpopular with many of the local authorities in the West Mercia area, but was criticised especially strongly by West Mercia Constabulary itself, especially as at the time it was rated the best force in the country. When John Reid became Home Secretary in 2006, he put all merger plans on hold. Subsequent governments have not made any indication of re-introducing such plans.

===Chief constables===
* 1967–1975: Sir John Willison
* 1975–1981: Alex Rennie
* 1981–1985: Bob Cozens
* 1985–1991: Anthony Mullett
* 1991–1999: David Cecil Blakey
* 1999–2003: Peter Hampson
* 2003–2011: Paul West
* 2011–2016: David Shaw
* 2016–2021: Anthony Bangham
*2021–2023: Pippa Mills
*2023-present: Alex Murray (temporary)

==Organisation==

West Mercia Police is overseen by an elected West Mercia Police and Crime Commissioner, which replaced the West Mercia Police Authority in 2012.

The force is organised into five Local Policing Units (LPAs), which are alphabetically coded (C, D, E, F, G) by geographical areas. Operating across three counties, West Mercia Police maintains many stations, with each LPA having an HQ Police station. The LPAs are further divided into 82 Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNT).

==PEEL inspection==
Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In its latest PEEL inspection report (2022), West Mercia Police was rated as follows:

==Volunteer police cadets scheme==

A volunteer cadet scheme had existed in the Telford division since the early 1990s and in September 2013, the scheme was expanded force-wide, creating a new detachment of police cadets in each Territorial Policing Unit area. Each detachment is headquartered in the respective TPU HQ, except the South Worcestershire detachment, which is based at Tudor Grange Academy.

In 2010, the Telford Cadets Detachment was awarded The Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service.

According to West Mercia Police&#x27;s website, &quot;The scheme is aimed at young people who wish to engage in a program that offers them an opportunity to gain a practical understanding of policing, develop their spirit of adventure and good citizenship, while supporting their local policing priorities through volunteering, working with partner agencies and positive participation in their communities.&quot;

A new intake of approximately 15 new cadets per detachment occurs annually. New recruits must be aged 16 or over and have finished secondary education. Young people can remain as cadets for up to two years. Cadets can then consider joining the force at age 18, becoming a cadet leader in their detachment, or leaving the scheme altogether.

Each detachment is led by several cadet leaders who are police officers, PCSOs and police volunteers from the force.

==Alliances==
West Mercia was a partner, alongside three other forces, in the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG). On 8 April 2018, West Mercia withdrew from the CMPG, with the 25 West Mercia police officers attached to the group returning to the in-force roads policing service.

In 2013, West Mercia Police and Warwickshire Police formed an alliance, sharing certain administrative functions in order to save both forces money. In October 2018, West Mercia announced its intention to withdraw from the alliance.

==Controversies==
A 2022 inquiry into the Telford child sexual exploitation scandal – in which all those who were convicted were British Pakistanis – found that &quot;in some cases the decisions of West Mercia Police officers about whether or not to investigate a particular piece of intelligence or complaint were influenced by assumptions about race. Whether because of ideas of difficulties investigating what was seen as a closed and hostile community, because of fear of complaint, or because of concern about the impact an investigation might have had on racial tensions, I cannot determine&quot;.
The inquiry, chaired by Tom Crowther QC, found that authorities were hesitant to investigate due to concerns about race, and teachers and youth workers were discouraged from reporting Child sexual abuse. This led to a lack of &quot;hard evidence&quot; and allowed offenders to operate with impunity. Despite Operation Chalice in 2013, which resulted in the conviction of seven men for child prostitution offenses, police and council scaled back specialist child sexual exploitation teams. The inquiry echoed findings from national reports on Child sexual abuse in the United Kingdom, highlighting the downplaying of the issue and the tendency to blame children for their abuse.

<doc id="600678" wikidata="Q7311155" url="?curid=600678" title="Religion in Argentina">
<text>Christianity is the most widely professed religion in Argentina, with Roman Catholicism being its largest denomination. This historical background is very much due to the Spanish influence brought about through the newly conquered territories. However, affiliation with Protestant churches is increasing and immigration throughout the 20th century has brought other religions from various regions to Argentina.

Argentina is a secular nation and its constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Good Friday and Christmas are recognised as national holidays.

==Christianity==
===Roman Catholicism===
In 2020, estimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from as low as 62.9% of the population, to as much as 92.12%. The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country as Catholic, but adds that less than 20% practice their faith regularly.

Argentina&#x27;s society, culture, and politics are deeply imbued with Roman Catholicism. The Church&#x27;s place in Argentine national identity, which spans across the ideological spectrum, stems from the perpetual ability of Argentines on different sides of political and social divides to find some level of support in the Church. The Church solidified its hold on the territory of modern-day Argentina during the period of Spanish colonial rule from the 16th to early 19th centuries. Church leaders variously supported and opposed the policies of Juan Perón and the violent tactics of the Dirty War. Although Roman Catholicism is not the official religion of the state, and freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, Catholic representatives take part in many state functions. Today, areas of Church-State contention include contraception, economic policies, and the disputed involvement of the Church in the Dirty War.

Catholic practices in Argentina (especially in indigenous areas) might be seen as incorporating a great deal of syncretism; for example, religious festivals in the north-western provinces feature Catholic icons in (or along with) ancient Andean indigenous ceremonies. The Pachamama worship is still widespread throughout Salta and Jujuy along with Catholic beliefs, without opposition from the Catholic bishops.

The church in Argentina is divided into dioceses and archdioceses. Buenos Aires, for example, is an archdiocese owing to is size and historical significance as the nation&#x27;s capital. Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral, the seat of the archbishop, houses the remains of General José de San Martín in a mausoleum.

There are nine Catholic universities in Argentina: the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (Buenos Aires), the Universidad del Salvador (Buenos Aires), the Universidad Católica de Córdoba, the Universidad de La Plata, the Universidad de Salta, the Universidad de Santa Fe, the Universidad de Cuyo, and the Universidad de Santiago del Estero. Religious orders run and sponsor hundreds of primary and secondary schools throughout the country, with and without government funding.

Cardinal Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina was elected to the papacy, as Pope Francis, on 13 March 2013.

===Other Christian denominations===
Protestant churches have been gaining ground since the 1980s. In Latin America, most Protestants are called &quot;Evangélicos&quot; (Evangelicals). One survey in 2008 found approximately 9% of the total population were Protestant; most of whom, 7.9% of the total population were Pentecostal. While Pentecostal churches originally attracted mostly the lower class, they show an increasing appeal to the urban middle class. Middle class congregations develop a distinctive style of Pentecostalism, more adapted to society.

In addition 1.2% of the population were Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and 0.9% The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This study also found that Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services. A 2013 survey found 15% Protestant (9% Pentecostal,4% refusing to say which Protestant denomination and 2% mainline ).

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims over 474,000 members with two temples and 726 congregations.

The very first Waldensian settlers from Italy arrived in South America in 1856 and today the Waldensian Church of the Río de La Plata (which forms a united church with the Waldensian Evangelical Church) has approximately 40 congregations and 15,000 members shared between Uruguay and Argentina.

The Argentine Catholic Apostolic Church is a derivative movement of the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (Igreja Católica Apostólica Brasileira) founded by the excommunicated Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Duarte Costa of Brazil in 1945. The Argentine Catholic Apostolic Church was founded, according to varying sources, in 1970 or 1971, in Buenos Aires by its first Archbishop–Primate Leonardo Morizio Dominguez.

The Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America represents the Anglican Communion in Argentina.

A 2015 study estimates some 2,200 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.

Orthodox Christianity is represented by Antiochian, Constantinople, Russian, Serbian, Romanian and Greek Orthodox Churches.

==Islam==

Argentina has the largest Muslim minority in Latin America. Although the national census does not ask about religious affiliation, precluding accurate statistics, Argentina&#x27;s Muslim community is estimated to number around 1% of the total population. Estimates in 2000 ranged around 400,000.

The 20th century saw an influx of immigrants from the Ottoman Empire, mostly Arabs from Syria and Lebanon. They are generically called &#x27;Turcos&#x27; (Turks) in Argentina, because when most arrived, Lebanon and Syria were territories of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. It is estimated that today there are about 3.5 million Argentines of Arab descent. The majority of these Arab immigrants were Arab Christians and some were Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews. Though accurate information is unavailable, it is likely that less than a quarter of Arab migrants were Muslim Arabs. The descendants of Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews are more likely to identify themselves as just Jews rather than Arab Jews today.

The King Fahd Islamic Cultural Center, the largest mosque in South America, was completed in 1996 with the help of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, on a piece of land measuring 20,000 m2. The total land area granted by the Argentine government measures 34,000 m2, and was offered by President Carlos Menem following his visit to Saudi Arabia in 1992. The project cost around US$30 million, includes a mosque, library, two schools, and a park, and is located in the middle-class district of Palermo, Buenos Aires.

The Islamic Organization of Latin America (IOLA), headquartered in Argentina, is considered the most active organization in Latin America in promoting Islamic-affiliated endeavors. The IOLA holds events to promote the unification of Muslims living in Latin America, as well as the propagation of Islam.

==Judaism==
Argentina has the largest Jewish population in Latin America and south of the Tropic of Cancer, with about 300,000 people. The community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel, and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave for Israel, Europe or the United States; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003.

One of the Jewish groups in Argentina includes the Sephardi Jews, composed of Spanish and Portuguese migrants to Argentina. Migration began in the 18th century and continued until a few years following the birth of Israel. A majority of Sephardi Jews migrated to Argentina because of both groups speaking the Spanish language. However, after the creation of Israel, Sephardi tensions amongst Muslims in Latin American countries began to rise resulting in the remaining Sephardi populations, found mainly in Morocco, migrating to Argentina. Buenos Aires holds almost the entire Sephardic Jewish population in Argentina, home to roughly 50,000. In Argentina, Sephardi Jews remained separate of Ashkenazi Jews, who in the later half of the 20th century, made up most of the Jewish population in Latin America. However, as an overwhelming amount of the Argentinian population became Ashkenazic, the Sephardic Jews began marrying outside of the Sephardi Jewish community.

Although Jews account for less than 1% of Argentina&#x27;s population, Buenos Aires has the largest population of Jews in the Americas, outside of the United States. It is the seventh largest Jewish community in the world.

==Buddhism==
Buddhism in Argentina has been practiced since the early 1980s.

Although Argentina is largely Catholic Christianity, Chinese immigrants established the first Chinese Buddhist temple in 1986, and Korean immigrants founded their own temple. Since then many groups have been giving teachings, some of them rooted in the best known Sōtō tradition from Japan, but also in many Tibetan institutes for the practice of meditation(Mahamudra, Dzog Chen, Lam Rim).

The XIV Dalai Lama visited Buenos Aires twice. The first time was in 2006, the second in 2011.

==Hinduism==
Argentina has 2,030 persons of Indian origin (PIOs) and 1,300 non-resident Indians (NRIs). Some of them still refer to ayurveda, practice yoga, enjoy Indian classical music and speak Hindustani dialects and languages. They have established an Indian Association in the northern provinces and organize social and cultural events to celebrate Indian festivals. Unfortunately, there is little interaction between them and those who have settled down in other parts of the extensive country. A large number of the Indian diaspora living in Buenos Aires are businessmen, doctors, financial or business executives, and employees of multinational corporations. Most of them have retained their Indian citizenship. Many Hindus are Indo-Caribbeans from Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname.

==Paganism==
According to a New York Times article there is a witch&#x27;s group with over 25,000 followers and possibly millions of practitioners of Argentine cábala (not to be confused with Kabballah from which one the term descends), a practice blending astrology, superstition, soccer, and paraphernalia associated with neopaganism.. There is also at least one organization active that insists Wicca is not a “secta” Spanish for cult since it is performed in solitary in its individual form.

== Legal status ==
The Constitution states that the federal government sustains the Apostolic Roman Catholic religion, but guarantees freedom of religion. In a 2023 study assessing nations&#x27; levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from 0-10 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution, Argentina received a score of 1.5 on Government Regulation of Religion, 4.7 on Social Regulation of Religion and 8.1 on Government Favoritism of Religion. In the same year, the country was scored 4 out of 4 for religious freedom by Freedom House, a US government funded think tank.

The law that regulates the acknowledgement of religions by the state dates from 1978, and makes it prohibitively bureaucratic for minority cults to attain official recognition, since it was passed by the dictatorial government of the time basically to search those cults for politically subversive elements.

===State-Catholic church relations===
The Constitution requires the government to support Roman Catholicism economically. Despite this, the Supreme Court ruled that the Roman Catholic Church was not granted the status of official religion by the constitution or any federal legislation.

The Constitution once stated that the president must be a Roman Catholic. This requirement was removed from the text in the 1994 constitutional reform, since the president no longer designates Argentine bishops. The old 1853 text also included a goal &quot;to keep a pacific relationship with the Indians and promote their conversion to Catholicism&quot;, which was deleted in the reform.

Each bishops receives a monthly salary from the state. Older seminarians and retired priests receive state pensions, and parishes in convective or near the border are subsidised. The state also subsidises catholic schools.

== Popular cults and other smaller religions in Argentina ==
Besides mainstream religious practices, there are also a number of unconventional practices, usually part of local folklore. One of the most famous is the veneration of &quot;La Difunta Correa&quot; (&quot;The Deceased Correa&quot;). Many other beliefs in advocations of the Virgin, saints and other religious characters exist throughout the country, which are locally or regionally popular and church-endorsed.

Another popular cult is that of the Gauchito Gil (&quot;the little gaucho Gil&quot;, Antonio Mamerto Gil Núñez), born in the province of Corrientes (allegedly in 1847). Gil was forced to enlist to fight in the civil war, but he deserted and became an outlaw &quot;à la&quot; Robin Hood.

From Río Negro Province, Ceferino Namuncurá, son of the Mapuche &quot;cacique&quot; Manuel Namuncurá, is also a source of veneration all over Patagonia. He died of tuberculosis with only 18 years of age, while in Italy during his catholic education, and was later named venerable by the Vatican.

There is also the popular cult of Miguel Ángel Gaitán, from Villa Unión, in La Rioja, known as &quot;El Angelito Milagroso&quot; (&quot;The Miraculous Little Angel&quot;), an infant who died of meningitis just short of his first birthday, who people recur to for requests and miracles.

The Iglesia Maradoniana is sport themed self-subscribed Parody religion founded by three fans at Christmas party for creating a new religion based around their favorite football player Diego Maradona. Since then it has gained between 120,000 and 200,000 followers since the &#x27;religion&#x27; was founded.

==Affiliation estimates==
Evangelical churches have been gaining a foothold since the 1980s with approximately 9% of the total population, Pentecostal churches and traditional Protestant denominations are present in most communities.

In 2023, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims 474,985 followers in Argentina (their seventh-largest congregation in the world).

According to the World Christian Database in 2022, Argentines are 88.77% Christian, 6.9% agnostic, 2% Muslim, 0.4% Jewish, and 0.9% atheist, with no other category exceeding 0.3%.

According to a 2008 CONICET survey on creeds, about 76.5% of Argentines are Roman Catholic, 11.3% religiously indifferent, 9% Protestant (with 7.9% in Pentecostal denominations), 1.2% Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and 0.9% Mormons.

A 2008 survey called America&#x27;s Barometer by the Vanderbilt University reported for Argentina, Catholic 77.1%, No religion 15.9%, Protestant, Evangelical and other Christian 4.8% (with Pentecostal 3.3%), Other 2.1%.

A 2019 survey made online by the Universidad de San Andrés showed that 59% of Argentines identify themselves as Catholics, 8% as Protestant, 9% follow other religions, 15% consider themselves not religious, 1% identified themselves as either Jewish or Muslim and a further 7% refused to answer. The same survey revealed that 76% of Argentines believe in God (a decrease from 91% in 2008), 44% believe in heaven, 32% believe in hell, around 29% pray daily, only 13% attend religious services weekly and about 24% consider religion to be very important in their lives.

<doc id="600693" wikidata="Q2944484" url="?curid=600693" title="You Stole the Sun from My Heart">
<text>&quot;You Stole the Sun from My Heart&quot; is a song by Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 8 March 1999 as the third single from their fifth studio album, &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; (1998). All three members of the band—James Dean Bradfield, Sean Moore and Nicky Wire—share the writing credits. The song reached number five on the UK Singles Chart.

==Background and content==
Wire has described the music as a mix of New Order and Nirvana: &quot;something you might be able to go along with if you really do the audio equivalent of squinting – and explained that the drum loop (yes, more drum machines) was sampled by Moore from the sound of a pinball machine, of all things&quot;. In allusion to the sound of &quot;You Stole the Sun from My Heart&quot;, Marc Burrows of &quot;Drowned In Sound&quot; proclaimed it &quot;the most straightforward rocker here&quot; and &quot;catchy to the point of irritating&quot;.

The lyric concerns Nicky Wire&#x27;s dislike of touring. He has said that, much as he enjoys being on stage, he hates the routine of travelling: soundchecks, hotels, and the homesickness it causes. The lyric &quot;but there&#x27;s no, no real truce with my fury&quot; is a reference to a poetry book by R. S. Thomas entitled &quot;No Truce with the Furies&quot;. The song title is namechecked in a later Manic Street Preachers single, &quot;Your Love Alone Is Not Enough&quot;. It was included on the 2002 compilation &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;.

==Release==
CD one contains a live version of the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Train in Vain&quot; and the B-side &quot;Socialist Serenade&quot;. The single was released on 8 March 1999 in the United Kingdom and reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, spending 12 weeks in the top 100. In Australia, &quot;You Stole the Sun from My Heart&quot; spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart in April 1999, peaking at number 97. The single also peaked at number two in Iceland, number 20 in Ireland, and number 94 in the Netherlands, achieving a peak of number 24 on the Eurochart Hot 100. At the 2000 Brit Awards, &quot;You Stole the Sun from My Heart&quot; was nominated for Best British Single but failed to win the prize.

==Music video==
The video presents a dark/light contrast where the band plays in a room in front of a huge ornate feature window. Outside the weather rapidly alternates between stormy and sunny. Rabbits and animated birds also make an appearance.

<doc id="600697" wikidata="Q80513" url="?curid=600697" title="Saint Cecilia">
<text>Saint Cecilia (), also spelled Cecelia, was a Roman Christian virgin martyr, who is venerated in Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, and some Lutheran churches, such as the Church of Sweden. She became the patroness of music and musicians, it being written that, as the musicians played at her wedding, Cecilia &quot;sang in her heart to the Lord&quot;. Musical compositions are dedicated to her, and her feast, on 22 November, is the occasion of concerts and musical festivals. She is also known as Cecilia of Rome.

Saint Cecilia is one of several virgin martyrs commemorated by name in the Canon of the Mass in the Latin Church. The church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, founded in the 3rd century by Pope Urban I, is believed to be on the site of the house where she lived and died.

==Life==

It is popularly supposed that Cecilia was a noble woman of Rome who, with her husband Valerian, his brother Tiburtius, and a Roman soldier named Maximus, suffered martyrdom about 230, under the Emperor Alexander Severus. Giovanni Battista de Rossi, however, argues that instead she perished in Sicily under the Emperor Marcus Aurelius between 176 and 180, citing the report of Venantius Fortunatus, Bishop of Poitiers (d. 600).

According to the story, despite her vow of virginity, her parents forced her to marry a pagan nobleman named Valerian. During the wedding, Cecilia sat apart singing to God in her heart, and for that, she was later declared the saint of musicians. When the time came for her marriage to be consummated, Cecilia told Valerian that watching over her was an angel of the Lord, who would punish him if he sexually violated her but would love him if he respected her virginity. When Valerian asked to see the angel, Cecilia replied that he could see the angel if he would go to the third milestone on the Via Appia and be baptized by Pope Urban I. After following Cecilia&#x27;s advice, he saw the angel standing beside her, crowning her with a chaplet of roses and lilies.

The martyrdom of Cecilia is said to have followed that of her husband Valerian and his brother at the hands of the prefect Turcius Almachius. The legend about Cecilia&#x27;s death says that after being struck three times on the neck with a sword, she lived for three days, and asked the pope to convert her home into a church.

St. Cecilia was buried in the Catacomb of Callixtus and later transferred to the Church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. In 1599, her body was found still incorrupt, seeming to be asleep.

Cecilia is one of the most famous Roman martyrs, although some elements of the stories recounted about her do not appear in the source material. According to Johann Peter Kirsch, the existence of the martyr is a historical fact. At the same time, some details bear the mark of a pious romance, like many other similar accounts compiled in the fifth and sixth centuries. The relation between Cecilia and Valerian, Tiburtius, and Maximus, mentioned in the Acts of the Martyrs, has some historical foundation. Her feast day has been celebrated since about the fourth century. There is no mention of Cecilia in the &quot;Depositio Martyrum&quot;, but there is a record of an early Roman church founded by a lady of this name, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere.

== Santa Cecilia in Trastevere ==

The church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere is reputedly built on the site of the house in which she lived. The original church was constructed in the fourth century; during the ninth century, Pope Paschal I had remains that were supposedly hers buried there. In 1599, while leading a renovation of the church, Cardinal Paolo Emilio Sfondrati had the remains, which he reported to be incorrupt, excavated and reburied.

==Name==

The name &quot;Cecilia&quot; applied generally to Roman women who belonged to the plebeian clan of the Caecilii. Legends and hagiographies, mistaking it for a personal name, suggest fanciful etymologies. Among those cited by Chaucer in &quot;The Second Nun&#x27;s Tale&quot; are: lily of heaven, the way for the blind, contemplation of heaven and the active life, as if lacking in blindness, and a heaven for people to gaze upon.

==Patroness of musicians==
The first record of a music festival in her honour was held at Évreux in Normandy in 1570.

The Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome is one of the oldest musical institutions in the world. It was founded by the papal bull, &quot;Ratione congruit&quot;, issued by Sixtus V in 1585, which invoked two saints prominent in Western musical history: Gregory the Great, after whom Gregorian chant is named, and Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music.

Her feast day became an occasion for musical concerts and festivals that occasioned well-known poems by John Dryden and Alexander Pope and music by Henry Purcell (&quot;Ode to St. Cecilia&quot;); 3 different oratorios by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, &quot;Caecilia virgo et martyr octo vocibus&quot; H.397, for soloists, double Chorus, double string orchestra and bc, &quot;Cecilia virgo et martyr&quot; H.413, for soloists, chorus, 2 treble instruments and bc, and &quot;Caecilia virgo et martyr&quot; H.415, for soloists, chorus, 2 treble instruments and bc, to libretti probably written by Philippe Goibaut); George Frideric Handel (&quot;Ode for St. Cecilia&#x27;s Day&quot;; &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot;); Charles Gounod (&quot;St. Cecilia Mass&quot;); as well as Benjamin Britten, who was born on her feast day (&quot;Hymn to St Cecilia&quot;, based on a poem by W. H. Auden). Herbert Howells&#x27; &quot;A Hymn to Saint Cecilia&quot; has words by Ursula Vaughan Williams; Gerald Finzi&#x27;s &quot;For Saint Cecilia&quot;, Op. 30, was set to verses written by Edmund Blunden; Michael Hurd&#x27;s 1966 composition &quot;A Hymn to Saint Cecilia&quot; sets John Dryden&#x27;s poem; and Frederik Magle&#x27;s &quot;Cantata to Saint Cecilia&quot; is based on the history of Cecilia. &quot;The Heavenly Life&quot;, a poem from &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; (which Gustav Mahler used in his &quot;Symphony No. 4&quot;) mentions that &quot;Cecilia and all her relations make excellent court musicians.&quot;

From the name of Cecilia comes &quot;Cecyliada&quot;, the name of the festival of sacred, choral, and contemporary music, held from 1994 in Police, Poland.

==Legacy==

Cecilia symbolizes the central role of music in the liturgy.

The Cistercian nuns of the convent nearby Santa Cecilia in Trastevere shear lambs&#x27; wool to be woven in the palliums of new metropolitan archbishops. The lambs are raised by the Trappists of the Abbey Tre Fontane in Rome. The Pope blesses the lambs every 21 January, the Feast of Saint Agnes. The pallia are given by the Pope to the new metropolitan archbishops on the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul, 29 June.

Located on the Isle of Wight, St. Cecilia&#x27;s Abbey, Ryde was founded in 1882. The nuns live a traditional monastic life of prayer, work, and study in accordance with the ancient Rule of Saint Benedict.

The famous luthier Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume produces a line of violin and viola under the name St. Cécile with a decal stamped on the upper back.

Cecilia is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 22 November. She is honored on the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar with Agnes of Rome on 21 January.

Croatian journal for church music &quot;Sveta Cecilija&quot; is named after her. It is published since 1877.

==Iconography==
Cecilia is frequently depicted playing the viola, a portative organ, or other musical instruments, evidently to express what was often attributed to her, namely that while the musicians played at her nuptials, she sang in her heart to God. The organ, however, may be misattributed to her as the result of a mistranslation, though this is denied by the Italian musicologist and organist Domenico Morgante.

A miniature Saint Cecilia beneath Worcester Cathedral was featured on the reverse side of the Sir Edward Elgar £20 banknote, which was withdrawn by the Bank of England in 2010.

<doc id="600698" wikidata="Q247019" url="?curid=600698" title="Erlang Shen">
<text>Erlang Shen, or simply Erlang, is a god in Chinese folk religion and Daoism, associated with water (flood control), justice, warriorhood, hunting, and demon subdual. He is commonly depicted as a young man with a third, truth-seeing eye in the middle of his forehead, wielding a three-pronged spear, and being accompanied by his loyal hunting dog, Xiaotian Quan.

The origin of Erlang is complex. He is most commonly believed to be the deification of Li Erlang, the second son of Li Bing, a hydraulic engineer of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). Later stories identify him as the deification of Yang Jian, the nephew of the legendary Jade Emperor. He is also identified with several other folk heroes associated with controlling floods.

In the Ming-era semi-mythical novels &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Erlang Shen is the nephew of the Jade Emperor. In the former novel, he assists the Zhou army in defeating the Shang. In the latter, he is the second son of a mortal and the Jade Emperor&#x27;s sister Yunhua, as well as an enemy-turned-ally of the Monkey King. In his legends he is known as the greatest warrior god of heaven, and was a disciple of Yuding Zhenren, who taught him fighting and magical skills such as the 72 Earthly Transformations.

== Names ==
&quot;Erlang&quot; () is an ancient given name for boys. This stems from Li Erlang, the primary historical figure that Erlang is thought to be based on. &quot;Shen&quot; () means &quot;God&quot;.

Since Li Erlang was from Guankou, Sichuan, the god Erlang is also known by the epithets Chuanzhu () and Guankou Erlang ().

Other bynames of the deity include:
*Guanjiang Shen ()
*Xiansheng Erlang Zhenjun (), or just Erlang Zhenjun ()
*Shenyong Dajiangjun (), a title bestowed onto Erlang by Emperor Taizong of Tang, and later elevated to Chicheng Wang () by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang dynasty
*Qingyuan Miaodao Zhenjun (), a title given by Emperor Zhenzong of the Northern Song dynasty
*Zhaohui Lingxian Wang ()

== Depiction and powers ==
Erlang is usually portrayed as a young, handsome man with a three-pointed spear, though in older paintings he is sometimes portrayed as an older man with a beard and sword. He has a third eye in the middle of the forehead, sometimes called &quot;Eye of Heaven&quot; (), which lets him see through deceptions, disguises, and transformations. In some stories, his third eye can also fire destructive blasts of light or divine fire.

As a god, Erlang is a noble and powerful warrior who vanquishes demons and monsters, and embodies justice and righteousness. He possesses vast, superhuman strength, being able to cleave through an entire mountain in one stroke. 

His main weapon is a spear called &quot;Sanjian Liangren Qiang&quot; (), usually depicted as a flat, broad spear with three tips like a trident, and the two cutting edges of a saber. This bladed polearm is powerful enough to penetrate and cleave through steel and stone like wool.

Erlang is almost always accompanied by his faithful hunting dog, the Xiaotian Quan (), which has the ability to viciously attack, maul, and subdue demons and evil spirits.

In some legends, Erlang possesses a unique ability known as the &quot;Jiuzhuan Xuangong&quot; (), which turns him nearly invincible against conventional weapons and most forms of magic. In the novel &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;, this ability turns him completely impervious to attacks from mystical weapons that have proven capable of injuring or even killing other immortals. Some stories state he is capable of 72 transformations (sometimes 73), meaning he can transform into virtually anything he wants.

In some folk beliefs, he was a filial son that entered Diyu, or hell, to save his deceased mother from torment. After being deified, he punishes unfilial children by striking them with thunder as a punishment, hence the traditional saying, &quot;being smitten by lightning for being unfilial and ungrateful&quot; towards unruly children.

== Origin ==

Erlang&#x27;s origin comes from a combination of historical and legendary figures. Generally, he is believed to be the deification of Li Erlang, the second son of Li Bing. However, he is also identified with several other folk heroes, which may have influenced his portrayal. He originated as a local god of Guankou, Sichuan, where Li Erlang was from. During the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127 CE), the cult of Erlang spread to the rest of China.

In later stories, Erlang is the deification of Yang Jian, son of the goddess Yunhua, and nephew of the legendary Jade Emperor. This portrayal as Yang Jian is most common in popular media.

=== As Li Erlang () ===
Li Erlang was the second son of Li Bing, a hydraulic engineer from the Qin dynasty.

According to the &quot;Story about Li Bing and His Son in Harnessing the Rivers&quot; in the &quot;Records of Guansian&quot;, Li Erlang assisted his father in the construction of the complex irrigation system that prevented the Min River from flooding and irrigated the Chengdu Plain. In thanks for the prosperity that this brought to them, the local people elevated the father and son to gods and dedicated the Two Kings Temple in their honor.

Legend states that Li Bing sent his son out to discover the source of the flooding. He spent a year exploring the county without success. One day whilst sheltering in a cave, he encountered a tiger which he slew and seven hunters who had witnessed this bravery agreed to join him in his quest.

The group finally came to a cottage on the outskirts of Guan County (modern Dujiangyan City). From within they heard the sound of an old woman crying. The woman was Grandma Wang and she told them that her grandson was to be sacrificed to an evil dragon who was the local river god. Li Erlang reported this to his father who devised a plan to capture the dragon.

The eight friends hid in the River God Temple and jumped out on the dragon when it arrived to claim its offering. The dragon fled to the river pursued by Li Erlang, who eventually captured it. Grandma Wang arrived with an iron chain and the dragon was secured in the pool below the Dragon-Taming Temple, freeing the region from floods.

Another legend tells of Li Erlang suppressing a fire dragon that lived in the mountains north of Dujiangyan by climbing to the top of Mount Yulei, turning into a giant and building a dam with 66 mountains then filling it with water from Dragon Pacifying Pool.

===As Li Bing ()===

Li Bing himself has been thought of as inspiration for Erlang. For stopping the floods of the Min River by constructing Dujiangyan, he was turned into a folk hero who defeated a river god in order to save his prefecture from being flooded. He was then portrayed as the new river god that protected the local people in the area from floods. However, a discrepancy comes up that even though Li Bing/Erlang was known as Guankou Shen, the river that he is associated with is in Qianwei and not Guankou. Another discrepancy is that Li Erlang had never appeared in any of the tales related to stopping the Min River. The first appearance of Li Erlang was in &quot;Zhishui ji&quot; () by Li Ying () of the Liang dynasty (502–557 CE).

Historically, Li Bing was conferred an official title until the Five Dynasties period under the rule of the Shu kingdom. He rose to political power when the great flood that occurred on the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month in 920 AD was reported to the emperor by Daoist Du Guangting.

===As Yang Jian ()===

Many legends and novels describe Erlang as Yang Jian, a nephew of the Jade Emperor. According to an ancient text, &quot;Erlang Baojuan&quot;, Yang Jian&#x27;s mother was Princess Yunhua, the Jade Emperor&#x27;s sister, who was imprisoned under Mount Tao because she violated the Heavenly Rules by marrying a human named Yang Tianyou. Many years later, her son Yang Jian cleaved Mount Tao using his axe, hoping to set his mother free. He did successfully rescue his mother after he chased away the sun by carrying a mountain on his back. 

In the Tang dynasty story &quot;The Magic Lotus Lantern&quot;, Erlang&#x27;s mother, Princess Yunhua, was the goddess of the realm of desire in heaven. Her job was to limit the gods&#x27; mortal urges such as love, affection, greed, and ambition. When she pursued an evil dragon who broke free of its heavenly prison into the mortal realm and was injured by it, she fell in love with Yang Tianyou, a mortal scholar, who saved her life by giving her his own heart to replace the one the dragon damaged. They had three children: Yang Jiao, Yang Jian (Erlang Shen), and Yang Chan (Holy Mother of Mount Hua). When the Jade Emperor discovered her marriage, he sent his armies to kill her family and capture her. Only Erlang and his sister Yang Chan survived.

In order to rescue his mother, Yang Jian became a disciple of Yuding Zhenren at Jinxia Cave in Yuquan Mountain. By the age of seventeen, he had cultivated powerful abilities that allowed him to stand proudly in the world. His martial skills progressed remarkably, especially after he obtained the Three-Pointed Two-Edged Blade. Driven by his deep desire to save his mother, he used his blade to split open Peach Mountain and rescued her. This legend has also become an important origin for the &quot;filial piety&quot; culture along the banks of the Guan River.

In the Ming dynasty novel &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot; (1605), it is mentioned that Princess Longji is the Jade Emperor&#x27;s daughter, making her Yang Jian&#x27;s cousin. The Golden Fleece Lads are his disciples.

===Other identifications===
Erlang Shen is also identified with Zhao Yu, a hermit who lived on Mount Qingcheng and was appointed by Emperor Yang of Sui as Governor of Jiazhou. Zhao Yu is said to have set forth with 1000 men to defeat a flood dragon that had been tormenting the area. Upon reaching the river, Zhao Yu dived into the water with his double-edged sword and emerged holding the dragon’s head. Following his death, according to the &quot;Chronicle of Changshu County&quot;, the region was once again plagued by flood and he was seen riding a white horse amidst the swirling currents. The locals built a temple enshrining Zhao Yu as the god Erlang and the floods were subdued.

Deng Xia is said to have been a general under Erlang who surpassed his predecessors in valor and defeated a flood dragon, receiving the title &quot;Erlang Shen&quot; and a temple in his honor at Zhongqingli in Hangzhou.

=== Zoroastrian influence theory ===
In the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms&quot;, it is recorded that the Emperor Wang Zongyan of Former Shu was present in a ceremonial procession wearing golden armor, pearl-decorated hat and holding a bow and an arrow. His appearance was compared to that of the (, Chinese term for &quot;Zoroastrian&quot;) god of Guankou by the crowd. According to the tradition, Erlang Shen was originally a river god in the Guankou district. Professor Li Guotao argued that this &quot;Xian god&quot; has his origins in Zoroastrianism. Furthermore, he also suggested that Emperor Wang Zongyan, as well as the rest of the royal family of the Former and Later Shu were Zoroastrians. He believed that there is great similarity between the appearance of Erlang Shen and that of the Sogdian-Zoroastrian deity Weshparkar, which is able to conclude that Erlang Shen is a localized deity originated in Persia or Zoroastrian Central Asia.

After a detailed comparison of Erlang Shen and the Zoroastrian rain deity Tishtrya in his article for &quot;Religious Studies&quot;, Professor Hou Hui suggested that Tishtrya is the archetype of the former: &quot;This folk tradition originated in the Sichuan region with a Zoroastrian cultural background, Erlang Shen shares many common features and characteristics with Tishtrya. Therefore, it is speculated that the cult of Erlang Shen should be derived from the worship of the Zoroastrian rain deity.&quot;

==Representation in Chinese culture as Yang Jian ()==

===Fengshen Yanyi===
In &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;, Yang Jian (Yang Bliss) is a disciple of Yuding Zhenren, and he learned fighting and magical skills including the 72 earthly transformations. He first appeared during the time of the Diablo Brothers&#x27; attack on the Western Foothills. After hearing of the situation, Yang personally took the offensive against the brothers. During his duel against all four brothers, Yang deliberately allowed himself to be consumed by Diablo Long Life&#x27;s flying mink (some sources say an elephant). Following the battle, Yang Jian suddenly reappeared before Jiang Ziya after killing the mink inside its stomach with his many transformations. To trick the Diablo Brothers, Yang Jian later transformed himself into Long Life&#x27;s flying mink and stole Diablo Red&#x27;s Havoc-Umbrella. Thus, Yang was renowned as the true reason for Jiang Ziya&#x27;s victory over the Diablo Brothers at an overall point.

===&quot;Journey to the West&quot;===
Erlang makes an appearance near the start of the classic &quot;Journey to the West&quot; by Wu Cheng&#x27;en. Erlang, who is titled as being either True Lord or Illustrious Sage, is the nephew of the Jade Emperor. Erlang made his first appearance when he had been ordered by the Jade Emperor (in which Erlang was also with his seven elite sages whom he called his brothers) to subdue Sun Wukong, who was to be punished for his havoc in heaven.

Throughout the course of Erlang&#x27;s duel between Sun Wukong, it was proven that they are equally matched. After many transformations that were performed in their duel (Sun Wukong fleeing as a fish; Erlang and Sun Wukong becoming larger birds, and so forth), near the conclusion of the battle, he managed to see through Sun Wukong&#x27;s disguise (as a temple) using his third eye and with the assistance of another God. It should be noted, however, that Wukong fleeing was for his monkeys&#x27; safety. Erlang eventually captured Wukong through teamwork with several other gods; Laozi personally had dropped his refined golden ring that had hit Sun Wukong on the head, giving Erlang a chance to bring him down, and Erlang&#x27;s dog bit him in the leg. After Sun Wukong had been captured (to which Sun Wukong retorts that they are cowards for attacking from behind), he and his heavenly soldiers would burn areas of Mount Huaguo. Erlang is seen again far later in the novel when he assists Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie through chance by fighting against an ancient Dragon King and his villainous son-in-law, a nine-headed bird demon. Wukong also mentions being sworn brothers with Erlang Shen. Erlang has six other sworn brothers from Plum Hill.

===Bao Lian Deng===
In the tale &quot;Lotus Lantern&quot; (&quot;Bao Lian Deng&quot;), Erlang had a sister known as the Holy Mother of Mount Hua (&quot;Hua Shan&quot;). She married a mortal man, Liu Yanchang, who was a scholar. Together, they had a son by the name of Chenxiang. Erlang had to seal her because she violated the laws of heaven by having a relationship with a mortal. When Chenxiang came of age, he defeated Erlang and split the mountain with an axe to free his mother, mirroring how Erlang has split Mount Tao to free his own mother.

==In popular culture==
Erlang is also introduced as a resplendent, powerful god in Kevin Hearne&#x27;s &quot;Scourged&quot;, book 9 of &quot;The Iron Druid Chronicles&quot;.

*Erlang is featured in a videogame Black Myth: Wukong as a boss known as &#x27;Erlang, the Sacred Divinity&#x27;.

<doc id="600706" wikidata="Q4823777" url="?curid=600706" title="Australian Indigenous sovereignty">
<text>Australian Indigenous sovereignty, also recently termed Blak sovereignty, encompasses the various rights claimed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within Australia. Such rights are said to derive from Indigenous peoples&#x27; occupation and ownership of Australia prior to colonisation and through their continuing spiritual connection to land. Indigenous sovereignty is not recognised in the Australian Constitution or under Australian law.

Political movements emerged in the 20th and 21st centuries around the cause of Indigenous sovereignty, seeking various political, economic and cultural rights both within and outside the Australian state. These have included land rights, the right for Indigenous peoples to be treated as a distinct polity with their own laws and institutions, and various cultural and intellectual property rights. These rights are not fixed, with the right to Indigenous data sovereignty emerging in the context of greater data collection by governments. According to some supporters, the recognition of the prior occupation and ownership of Australia means accepting the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples and paves the way for treaties between them and both Commonwealth and state and territory governments. 

Discussion of the concept was prominent in various campaigns around the failed referendum of 14 October 2023, which would have amended the Constitution to prescribe an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. Leaders of the Blak sovereignty movement such as Michael Mansell in Tasmania and Senator Lidia Thorpe in Victoria did not support the Voice, on the basis that it would affect sovereignty and that treaties are required first to engage in sovereign to sovereign discussions instead.

==Background==

Aboriginal peoples have occupied mainland Australia for at least 65,000 years. When the British began the colonisation of Australia with the arrival of Governor Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet, no formal treaty was signed with the Aboriginal peoples of Port Jackson at the time. However, the Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia of 1836 (unlike the &quot;South Australia Act 1834&quot;), included recognition of potential rights held by Aboriginal people of South Australia. By 1840, all governors in Australia and New Zealand were directed that all Aboriginal customary law was to be superseded by British law and subsequently little regard was given to existing Indigenous laws and customs.

==Meaning==
Today, Indigenous sovereignty generally relates to &quot;inherent rights deriving from spiritual and historical connections to land&quot;. Indigenous studies academic Aileen Moreton-Robinson has written that the first owners of the land were ancestral beings of Aboriginal peoples, and &quot;since spiritual belief is completely integrated into human daily activity, the powers that guide and direct the earth are believed to exist with all human life&quot;. The 2017 &quot;Uluru Statement from the Heart&quot; similarly expresses sovereignty as a &quot;spiritual notion&quot; that is &quot;the ancestral tie between the land, or &#x27;mother nature&#x27;, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were born therefrom&quot;. Moreton-Robinson says that for people like Captain Cook and Joseph Banks this concept of sovereignty was invisible, as it &quot;challenge[s] the philosophical premises of state sovereignty&quot;, not sharing the same ontology as Europeans. Other important components of this concept of sovereignty were Aboriginal kinship systems, and borders based on languages and customary agreements (the equivalent of treaties), were also integral components of First Nations sovereignties. This concept of sovereignty is said to not be extinguished by settlement or force.

However, this meaning of the term is not universal, with some Indigenous communities and individuals also emphasising elements of the traditional western conception of sovereignty, such as the absolute authority of a group over a particular area and the mutual recognition of equality between sovereign bodies. This emphasis is seen in Senator Lidia Thorpe&#x27;s conception of &quot;Blak sovereignty&quot;.

== Australian legal position ==
Indigenous sovereignty has not been recognised under Australian law, whether as sovereignty that existed before colonisation or that still exists. However, some early New South Wales Supreme Court cases recognised the distinct authority of Indigenous groups. In &quot;R v Bonjon&quot; (1841) Justice Willis held that the Aboriginal people were a &quot;distinct though dependent people, and entitled to be regarded as self-governing communities&quot; such that the accusation that Bonjon had killed another Aboriginal person could not be decided under English law. This and the earlier case of &quot;R v Ballard&quot; (1829) appeared to reference the Marshall trilogy of US cases that recognised Native American nations as &quot;domestic dependent nations&quot; of the US. However, the earlier case of &quot;R v Murrell&quot; (1836) held that while the &quot;Aboriginal natives of New Holland&quot; were &quot;entitled to be regarded by civilised nations as a free and independent people&quot; they tribes had not reached &quot;such a position in point of numbers and civilisation and to such a form of government and laws, as to be entitled to be recognised as so many sovereign states governed by laws of their own&quot;. Subsequently, the Privy Council case of &quot;Cooper v Stuart&quot; (1889) declared Australia to &quot;practically unoccupied, without settled inhabitants or settled law&quot;. 

More recently, in the case of &quot;Coe v Commonwealth&quot; (1979), the High Court of Australia rejected the notion that there existed an Aboriginal Nation that exercised sovereignty of an even limited kind. The court distinguished the US case of &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; (1831), which recognised Native American nations as &quot;domestic dependent nations&quot; of the US, by reasoning that the Aboriginal People of Australia are not organised as a &quot;distinct political society separated from others&quot; and that they have never been uniformly treated as a state. 

Later in &quot;Mabo v Queensland&quot; (No 2) (1992), the High Court recognised the pre-colonial land interests of Indigenous Australians within the common law of Australia in the form of native title. However, these rights did not arise due to continuing Indigenous sovereignty; the court merely held that existing rights to land held by Indigenous groups were not automatically extinguished on acquisition of sovereignty by the Crown. The court held that the validity of the acquisition of sovereignty by the Crown cannot be challenged in the courts. The case has also been interpreted by the High Court in later cases as &quot;at odds&quot; with the notion that any limited sovereignty exists in Indigenous groups, However, by also rejecting previous authorities that characterised Indigenous societies as &quot;without laws, without a sovereign and primitive in their social organization&quot; the Mabo judgment has also been taken to implicitly recognise the existence of Indigenous sovereignty prior to colonisation. 

More recently in &quot;Love v Commonwealth&quot; (2020), the court upheld previous rejections of continuing Indigenous sovereignty alongside its major finding that Indigenous Australians, whether citizens or not, were not subject to the &quot;aliens&quot; power of the Australian Constitution and therefore could not be deported.

However, despite this legal rejection of the western exclusive view of sovereignty, Robert French (writing extrajudicially) has argued that an agreement between Indigenous Australians and the Commonwealth that recognises their traditional rights and historical connection to country would be possible &quot;without compromising, symbolically or otherwise, Australia&#x27;s identity as a nation&quot; and that such an agreement may be made &quot;in terms of sovereignty&quot; where that sovereignty was &quot;under traditional law and custom&quot; and &quot;may have meaning in that universe of discourse&quot;.

The Australian legal position is not shared by other comparable ex-British colonies. The US recognises the continuing tribal sovereignty of native American nations and allows a certain level of self-governance and law making. Canada recognises a certain level of sovereignty with its Indigenous Peoples, with courts upholding treaties agreed to at colonisation (such as in the case of &quot;R v Sioui&quot;) and other treaty negotiations ongoing at different levels of government. Whilst Canadian courts have recognised the de facto &quot;assertion&quot; of sovereignty by the Canadian Crown, a ruling of de jure &quot;acquisition&quot; has been avoided, with treaties identified as a way &quot;to reconcile pre-existing Aboriginal sovereignty with assumed Crown sovereignty&quot;. In New Zealand, the Treaty of Waitangi recognised the sovereignty of the original Māori inhabitants, while also purported to transfer that sovereignty to the British Crown. While this is the established legal position in New Zealand, some have argued that the sovereignty of the Crown is limited to some extent by the treaty and that the transfer of sovereignty was ineffective due to misunderstandings and mistranslations between the English and Maori versions of the treaty.

==Activism==
===20th century===
The rights and political movements associated with Indigenous sovereignty vary significantly and there is no consensus as to what recognising Indigenous sovereignty would entail. Some earlier activists raised the possibility of full secession from Australia; however, most sought a different level of autonomy within the State. Others call for reparations, self-governance and the ability to live under traditional law unimpeded, with any future interactions between Australia and Indigenous nations to be at a minimum. The recognition of an Indigenous nation under the Commonwealth has been compared with the shared responsibility and sovereignty between the states and territories and the federal government.

From the 1920s until the 1967 referendum, the struggle for the rights of Indigenous Australians was expressed in terms of demands for full citizenship rights. The &quot;Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948&quot; (Cth) granted nominal citizenship to Indigenous Australians, however the vast array of discriminatory laws and practices meant that they were citizens in name only. Only following the civil rights movement in Australia along with the passage of the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot; (Cth) did explicit discriminatory laws end.

However, the use of the citizenship framework to agitate for rights was not uncontroversial as this framework implicitly recognised and affirmed the authority of the Australian state. There remained great suspicion that civil rights were granted as a part of a broader cultural assimilation project by the State.

Following the 1967 referendum, greater emphasis was placed on Indigenous sovereignty to call for greater self-autonomy and self-determination. New activists emerged, challenging the assumptions of the previous generation by conceptualising their struggle as that of an oppressed people rather than as minority group seeking inclusion.

In 1972, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was established on the steps of Old Parliament House in Canberra, the Australian capital, to demand recognition of the sovereignty of Aboriginal Australian peoples. Demands of the Tent Embassy have included land rights and mineral rights to Aboriginal lands, legal and political control of the Northern Territory, and compensation for land stolen.

In 1979 author and activist Kevin Gilbert led the &quot;National Aboriginal Government&quot; protest on Capital Hill, Canberra, calling for acceptance of Aboriginal sovereignty.

In 1988, the Australian Bicentenary, the &quot;Aboriginal Sovereign Treaty &#x27;88 Campaign&quot; called for recognition of Aboriginal sovereignty and for a treaty to be enacted between the Commonwealth of Australia and Aboriginal nations under international law. Gilbert became chair of the Treaty &#x27;88 campaign. He defined the legal argument for a treaty or treaties and Aboriginal sovereignty in his 1987 work &quot;Aboriginal Sovereignty, Justice, the Law and Land&quot;.

In 1990, Pakana lawyer and academic Michael Mansell co-founded the Aboriginal Provisional Government, based on the principle that Aboriginal people &quot;are and always have been a sovereign people&quot;. The APC has ever since been issuing its own passports, which have been officially stamped upon entry to several foreign countries as well as Indigenous territories.

===21st century ===
The Aboriginal Tent Embassy, still in place on its 50th anniversary , remains a symbol of Aboriginal protest relating to various Indigenous issues. Protests have been held there against Aboriginal deaths in custody, the Howard government&#x27;s 2007 Northern Territory Intervention, and cuts to services. In 2020, its most prominent issues are Aboriginal sovereignty and an acknowledgement of Indigenous right to self-determination. In 2012, there were seven tent embassies dotted around the nation.

In February 2012, barrister and 2009 Australian of the Year Mick Dodson addressed Parliament on the subject of &quot;Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians&quot;. He raised three issues: an acknowledgement in the Constitution that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were in Australia first and also in possession of the country, when the British Crown asserted its sovereignty over the whole continent, and it follows that the land was taken without consent; the second was about issues of Aboriginal identity being respected and protected within the Constitution and Australian law; and the third element related to equal citizenship under law.

In March 2013, the Murrawarri Republic, comprising parcels of land in New South Wales and Queensland, announced its independence from Australia, which is not recognised nor acknowledged by the Government of Australia.

In 2014, the Sovereign Yidindji Government, followed suit, comprising traditional land of the Yidindji nation in Queensland and the Northern Territory. They issue their own postage stamps and currency.

Aboriginal activist Michael Mansell argues for a seventh state, comprising Aboriginal native title lands, along with a structure similar to state governments.

====&quot;Uluru Statement&quot; and the Voice to Parliament====

In 2017, the &quot;Uluru Statement from the Heart&quot; was released which stated that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tribes were the original sovereign nations of the land of Australia. This sovereignty is of a spiritual nature and has never been ceded or extinguished, instead co-existing with the sovereignty of the Crown.

The document also calls for constitutional changes and reform such that &quot;this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia&#x27;s nationhood&quot;. The reforms sought are a constitutional amendment to provide for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, a Makarrata Commission to engage in agreement making between governments and First Nations, and a truth-telling process.

The Albanese Government held an unsuccessful referendum to establish the Voice to Parliament on 14 October 2023. As part of the debate over the Voice, Lidia Thorpe, an independent senator originally elected as a Green, expressed concerns that the Voice model would impact Indigenous sovereignty. However, government ministers, constitutional and international law scholars, and Voice advocates such as Megan Davis and Noel Pearson say that these concerns were baseless.

====Blak sovereignty====
After defecting from the Australian Greens in February 2023 ahead of the referendum, Lidia Thorpe said that she wished to lead the &quot;Blak sovereignty&quot; movement, and called for a treaty with First Nations to be signed before the implementation of the Voice. Her idea of Blak sovereignty includes the creation of a Blak Republic (as a replacement of the current constitutional monarchy) with shared sovereignty and equal power between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians as an ultimate goal. Her concept of sovereignty refers not just to the &quot;native title definition that our sovereignty is a spiritual notion&quot;, but also &quot;a position of power in this country that we&#x27;ve always had and that we will always have until we come to a peace agreement to be able to unite this country once and for all&quot;.

==Related issues==
===Treaties and constitutional recognition===

A treaty is a legal document defining the relationship between two sovereign entities. there are no treaties between the Australian Government and Indigenous peoples of Australia; There are ongoing negotiations in some states and territories of Australia on the possible crafting of treaties between Indigenous peoples and governments.

A treaty between the Australian government and the country&#x27;s First Peoples would at a minimum recognise symbolically Indigenous sovereignty through recognising them as independent actors not totally represented currently by the State of Australia.

There have also been moves towards constitutional changes both to recognise prior occupation and ownership (and thus sovereignty), and an Indigenous voice to parliament enshrined in the Constitution.

===Symbolic recognition of connection to land===
Many public events in Australia, including ceremonies, speeches, conferences and festivals, begin with a Welcome to Country or Acknowledgement of Country, intended to highlight the cultural significance of the surrounding area to a particular Aboriginal clan or language group. They are often made by elders of the nation on whose traditional lands each event is taking place. Since 2008, a Welcome to Country has been incorporated into the ceremonial opening of the Parliament of Australia, an event which occurs after each federal election.

<doc id="600707" wikidata="Q3355920" url="?curid=600707" title="List of wars involving Poland">
<text>This is a chronological list of wars in which Poland or its predecessor states of took an active part, extending from the reign of Mieszko I (960–992) to the present. This list does not include peacekeeping operations (such as UNPROFOR, UNTAES or UNMOP), humanitarian missions or training missions supported by the Polish Armed Forces.

The list gives the name, the date, the Polish allies and enemies, and the result of these conflicts following this legend:
:
:


== Piast Poland (960–1138) ==
During the Middle Ages, Poland sought to incorporate other fellow West Slavic peoples under the rule of the Polan dukes, such as Mieszko I, Boleslaw I Chrobry and their descendants, and then defend the lands conquered in the west from the Holy Roman Empire. In the east and south it struggled with Ruthenia, Bohemia and Tatar raiders. In the north-east, it encountered intermittent Lithuanian and Prussian raids.
== Feudal fragmentation (1138–1320) ==

In 1138, after the death of Bolesław III Wrymouth, Poland was divided into districts ruled by local princes. This began a period of feudal fragmentation that lasted for more than 187 years during which Poland was severely weakened due to incessant internal conflicts. The feudal fragmentation ended in 1320 during the reign of Władyslaw I Lokietek.
== Reunited Kingdom of Poland (1320–1385) ==

In 1320, after the end of the feudal fragmentation, during the reign of Władyslaw I Łokietek and his son Casimir III the Great, Poland experienced a period of strong economic development, this period also increased migration to Poland especially of Germans and Jews. The period ended after the death of Casimir the Great and the assumption of the Polish throne by Louis I.
== Jagiellon Poland (1385–1569) ==
For much of its early history as a Christian state, Poland had to contend with Pomeranians, Prussians, Lithuanians and other Baltic peoples in continuous border wars without clear results or end in sight. After the Teutonic Order conquered and assimilated the Prussians, it began incursions into both Polish and Lithuanian territories. This represented a far greater threat to both Poland and Lithuania, and the two countries united in a defensive alliance by the crowning of the Lithuanian Duke Jogaila as King of Poland (as Władysław II) which led to a major confrontation at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and subsequent wars until 1525, when the Order became a vassal to the Polish Crown.

== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795) ==
The 17th century saw fierce rivalry between the then major Eastern European powers – Sweden, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. At its heyday, the Commonwealth comprised the territories of present-day Poland, and large parts of Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Russia, and represented a major European power. However, by the end of the 18th century a series of internal conflicts and wars with foreign enemies led to the dissolution of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the partitioning of most of its dependent territories among other European powers.

During the 18th century, European powers (most frequently consisting of Russia, Sweden, Prussia and Saxony) fought several wars for the control of the territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. At the end of the 18th century, some Poles attempted to defend Poland from growing foreign influence in the country&#x27;s internal affairs. These late attempts to preserve independence eventually failed, ultimately ending in Poland&#x27;s partition and the final dissolution of the remains of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
== Napoleonic Wars (Duchy of Warsaw) ==

Poles unsuccessfully struggled to win back their independence throughout the 19th century. At first, they put their hopes in Napoleon. Later, they tried to ignite national uprisings every now and then – most of them bloodily repressed.
== Poland under partitions (1815–1918) ==

Poles unsuccessfully struggled to win back their independence throughout the 19th century. At first, they put their hopes in Napoleon. Later, they tried to ignite national uprisings every now and then – most of them bloodily repressed.
== Second Polish Republic (1918–1939) ==
In the turmoil of the First World War, Poles managed to regain independence and then to expand their territory in a series of local wars and uprisings; only to be occupied again during the next world war.
== Poland during World War II (1939–1945) ==
The history of Poland from 1939 to 1945 encompasses primarily the period from the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to the end of World War II. Following the German–Soviet non-aggression pact, Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany on 1 September 1939 and by the Soviet Union on 17 September. The campaigns ended in early October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland. After the Axis attack on the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, the entirety of Poland was occupied by Germany, which proceeded to advance its racial and genocidal policies across Poland.
== Communist Poland (1945–1989) ==
The second half of the 20th century was more peaceful, but still tense, as Poland was involved in the Cold War on the Soviet side.
== Third Polish Republic (1989–present) ==

At the beginning of the 21st century Poland is involved in the War against terrorism on the NATO side.

<doc id="600719" wikidata="Q606201" url="?curid=600719" title="Sergei Zubov">
<text>Sergei Alexandrovich Zubov (Russian: Сергей Александрович Зубов; born 22 July 1970) is a Russian professional ice hockey coach and former defenceman. He is currently the head coach for the HC Sochi of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

Zubov played for the Dallas Stars, New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League as well as SKA Saint Petersburg of the KHL. One of the best offensive defensemen in NHL history, he won the Stanley Cup twice: with the Rangers in 1994 and the Stars in 1999. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2019.

==Playing career==
===CSKA Moscow, New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins===
Zubov was drafted in the fifth round of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers. Prior to this, he played for the Red Army&#x27;s hockey team, HC CSKA Moscow, in Russia. He continued to play for the Red Army until 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Although Sergei spent some of his rookie season with New York&#x27;s AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Rangers, he played forty-nine games as a rookie for the Rangers, scoring 31 points, considered then to be above-average for a defenseman. Zubov&#x27;s high-scoring ways continued, as he scored 12 goals and earned 77 assists during the 1993–94 season, which led the team in regular season scoring. He contributed 19 points to the Rangers&#x27; playoff campaign, as he, along with Alexander Karpovtsev, Sergei Nemchinov, and Alexei Kovalev became the first Russians to have their names engraved on the Stanley Cup.

Zubov continued to play well for the Rangers, but on 31 August 1995, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins with Petr Nedvěd for Ulf Samuelsson and Luc Robitaille. Zubov only spent one season in Pittsburgh, it was rumored because he and team captain Mario Lemieux didn&#x27;t get along, especially on the powerplay where both men wanted to be in control. Ultimately, he was traded to the Dallas Stars on 22 June 1996 for Kevin Hatcher.

===Dallas Stars===

Although Zubov never again reached the scoring height of his 1993–94 season with the Rangers, due to a combination of Dallas&#x27;s more defensive system and decreased scoring in general, he has earned all three of his trips to the All-Star game with the Stars. He never again reached an 80+ point total, but had 11 consecutive years of 40+ point seasons and 30+ assists.

He was also excellent defensively and while he had a well-sized body, he was known more for his positioning and puck-dislodging abilities out of corners rather than his checking abilities. He had been a mainstay on the penalty killing squad for several years and had only recorded a negative plus/minus four times in his career, with two of them within his first three years in the league.

Zubov always played a solid game, but for years went under the radar and did not garner any nominations for the NHL awards or the NHL First/Second All-Star teams. However, in the 2005–06 season, Zubov posted 71 points for his highest outing in over a decade – and also received his first Norris Trophy nomination.

Zubov missed nearly half of the 2007–08 NHL season with a sports hernia injury and most of the 2008–09 NHL season with a hip injury.

===SKA Saint Petersburg===
On 30 July 2009, he decided to leave the NHL as he signed a contract with SKA Saint Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He was also selected as a reserve by Team Russia for the 2010 Winter Olympics should an injury occur during the tournament.

On 18 April 2011, it was reported that Zubov would officially retire due to hip-related injury problems.

==International play==




Zubov represented the Soviet Union where he won the gold and silver medals in 1989 and 1990 in the Junior Division.

Zubov won a gold medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics, playing for the Unified Team.

==Coaching career==
On 20 July 2015, Zubov was named to the coaching staff of the Russian national team as a defensive assistant.

Zubov served as the head coach of HC Sochi starting from the 2017–18 season. He was dismissed as head coach 16 games into the 2019–20 season following a 5–11 start.

He currently serves as Senior Consultant to Hockey Operations for the Dallas Stars.

==Legacy==
* In the 2009 book &quot;100 Ranger Greats&quot;, Zubov was ranked No. 72 all-time of the 901 New York Rangers who had played during the team&#x27;s first 82 seasons
* Zubov left the NHL as the league&#x27;s all-time scoring leader for Russian-born defensemen. He is now 2nd behind Sergei Gonchar.
* On 28 January 2022, the Dallas Stars retired Zubov&#x27;s number 56.

==Personal life==
Zubov and his wife, Irina, have two children.

<text>The City and the Stars is a science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke, published in 1956. This novel is a complete rewrite of Clarke&#x27;s earlier &quot;Against the Fall of Night&quot;, his first novel, which had been published in &quot;Startling Stories&quot; magazine in 1948 after being rejected by the editor of &quot;Astounding Science-Fiction&quot;, according to the author.

Several years later, Clarke revised his novel extensively and renamed it &quot;The City and the Stars&quot;. The new version was intended to showcase what he had learned about writing, and about information processing. The major differences are in individual scenes and in the details of his contrasting civilizations of Diaspar and Lys. &quot;Against the Fall of Night&quot; remained popular enough to stay in print after &quot;The City and the Stars&quot; had been published. In introductions to it Clarke has told the anecdote of a psychiatrist and patient who admitted that they had discussed it one day in therapy, without realizing at the time that one had read one novel and one the other.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
&quot;The City and the Stars&quot; takes place at least two and a half billion years from the present in the city of Diaspar. By this time, the Earth&#x27;s oceans have gone and humanity has all but departed. As far as the people of Diaspar know, theirs is the only city remaining on the planet. The city of Diaspar is completely enclosed. Nobody has entered or left the city for as long as anybody can remember, and everybody in Diaspar has an instinctive insular conservatism. The story behind this fear of venturing outside the city tells of a race of ruthless invaders which beat humanity back from the stars to Earth, and then made a deal that humanity may live—if they never leave the planet.

In Diaspar, the entire city is run by the Central Computer. The city is repaired by machines, and its people are created by them. The computer creates bodies for the people of Diaspar to live in and stores their minds in its memory at the end of their lives. At any time, only a small number of these people are actually living in Diaspar; the rest are retained in the computer&#x27;s memory banks.

All the people currently living in Diaspar have had past &quot;lives&quot; within Diaspar except one person—Alvin, the main character of this story. He is one of only a very small number of &quot;Uniques&quot;, different from everybody else in Diaspar, not only because he has no past lives to remember, but because instead of fearing the outside, he feels compelled to leave. Alvin has just come to the age where he is considered grown up, and is putting all his energies to trying to find a way out. Eventually, a character named Khedron the Jester helps Alvin use the central computer to find a way out of the city of Diaspar. This involves the discovery that in the remote past, Diaspar was linked to other cities by an underground transport system. This system still exists, although its terminal is covered over and sealed, with only a secret entrance left.

===Alvin&#x27;s quest===
Once out of Diaspar, Alvin discovers that another human habitation remains on Earth. In contrast to the technological Diaspar, Lys is a vast green oasis shielded by mountains from the worldwide desert. Its people are not stored and recreated technologically, but naturally conceive, are born, age, and die. They have rejected the hyper-advanced technology of Diaspar in favor of a largely agrarian existence, with machines used only for labor-saving purposes. The people of Lys have instead worked to perfect the arts of the mind; they are telepaths, capable of communicating with each other over great distances and without words.

Alvin continues his quest until he finds out the truth of why the people of Diaspar are so frightened of the external universe and why Lys is so scared of space travel and mechanical things. In Lys, he goes on a trip with a young man named Hilvar, who becomes his friend, and they see a signal light, which they decide to investigate. It leads them to Shalmirane, the remains of the fortress where the Invaders were fought off with unimaginable weapons, and there they encounter an extraterrestrial creature with a strange robot. The creature is the last survivor of a religious cult dating back to the days of the Galactic Empire. The robot was the companion of the founder, the &quot;Master&quot;, who came with his followers to Earth at the end of his life. Alvin and Hilvar are unable to understand the content of the religion except that it refers to &quot;Great Ones&quot; who have left, but will someday return. Alvin persuades the creature to lend him the robot, arguing that the Master would want it to see how things were developing in the world. The Master had, however, forbidden the robot to give out any information at all, so Alvin does not learn anything.

Alvin instructs the robot to ignore his entreaties to take him back to Lys, knowing the people of Lys would use their great telepathic powers to induce him to return—the previous 14 Uniques had stayed. They had originally told Alvin he would be free to choose whether to stay or return, but because the people of Lys had their own insular failure, just like Diaspar, this option was no longer available. Back in Diaspar, he seeks the help of the Central Computer, which overcomes the Master&#x27;s block on the robot by creating the illusion of an apocalyptic return of the Great Ones. This differs from the solution used in the original novel, which was to create a duplicate of the robot &quot;without&quot; the block.

===Discoveries===
Alvin learns that the Master&#x27;s ship is still functional, buried outside Diaspar. He manages to retrieve it, then fetches Hilvar from Lys, and they travel into deep space. They encounter Vanamonde, a being of pure intellect, with whom Hilvar—being telepathic like other Lys people—can communicate and bring him back to Earth. From him the truth of history finally emerges.

The fearsome Invaders, it turns out, were a myth: Shalmirane was actually used to destroy the Moon to prevent it from colliding with the Earth. Diaspar and Lys are the descendants of those humans who deliberately turned away from the universe in rejection of history&#x27;s greatest scientific project: the creation of a disembodied intellect. The first attempt had created a powerful but insane being, the Mad Mind. The Mad Mind had devastated the galaxy and its civilizations before being imprisoned in a &quot;strange artificial star&quot; called the Black Sun.

Vanamonde is the second, successful, experiment of the ancient empire: a being of pure intellect, immensely old, immensely powerful, able to move instantly to any point in space—but entirely childlike and unsophisticated. Vanamonde&#x27;s ultimate destiny, Hilvar realizes, is to battle the Mad Mind, when it escapes its prison at the end of time.

After this, most of the Galactic Empire had left our galaxy, leaving only a scattered few. This departure from the galaxy, leaving it to Vanamonde, was made because they had been contacted by a &quot;very strange and very great&quot; intelligent, extraterrestrial species, which called them urgently to the other side of the universe.

Alvin&#x27;s discoveries reunite Diaspar with Lys. He then sends the ship, under the command of the robot, to search for the long-lost people of the Empire. He has no wish to join the search—even if there are human remnants in the Galaxy, they are probably decadent—and he has work to do on Earth. Even the environment, he hopes, can be revived.

<doc id="600725" wikidata="Q7850146" url="?curid=600725" title="Tsunami (Manic Street Preachers song)">
<text>&quot;Tsunami&quot; is a song by Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers, released as a single on 5 July 1999 through Epic Records. It was the fourth and final single released from their fifth studio album, &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot; (1998). All three members of the band—James Dean Bradfield, Sean Moore and Nicky Wire—share the writing credits. The single peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Background==
&quot;Tsunami&quot; is the Japanese word for &quot;big wave&quot;. The song was inspired by The Silent Twins, June and Jennifer Gibbons, who gave up speaking when they were young, became involved in crime and ended up being sent to Broadmoor Hospital. The song is unique in the band&#x27;s catalogue in that it is largely built around an electric sitar and strings.

==Release==
The single peaked at number 11 in the United Kingdom, remaining on the UK Singles Chart for eight weeks. Of all four singles from &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot;, &quot;Tsunami&quot; spent the fewest weeks on the chart. In Finland, the song peaked in number 13, spending three weeks on Finnish Singles Chart.

The B-side &quot;Buildings for Dead People&quot; appears on the enhanced CD 1 along with the video for &quot;A Design for Life&quot;. CD 2 includes a remix of &quot;Tsunami&quot; by Cornelius and a mix by Electron Ray Tube. The cassette version includes a live recording of &quot;Motown Junk&quot; from the Tivoli in Utrecht in Holland on 29 March 1999. &quot;Tsunami&quot; was also included on the band&#x27;s &quot;Forever Delayed&quot; singles compilation.

Iquitos (; ) is the capital city of Peru&#x27;s Maynas Province and Loreto Region. It is the largest metropolis in the Peruvian Amazon, east of the Andes, as well as the ninth-most populous city in Peru. Iquitos is the largest city in the world that cannot be reached by road that is not on an island; it is only accessible by river and air.

It is known as the &quot;capital of the Peruvian Amazon&quot;. The city is located in the Great Plains of the Amazon Basin, fed by the Amazon, Nanay, and Itaya rivers. Overall, it constitutes the Iquitos metropolitan area, a conurbation of 471,993 inhabitants consisting of four districts: Iquitos, Punchana, Belén, and San Juan Bautista.

The area has long been inhabited by indigenous peoples. According to Spanish historical documents, Iquitos was established around 1757 as a Spanish Jesuit reduction on the banks of the Nanay River. The Jesuits gathered local Napeano (Yameo) and Iquito natives to live here, and they named it &quot;San Pablo de Napeanos&quot;.

In the late 19th century, during the Amazon rubber boom, the city became the center of export of rubber production from the Amazon Basin and was the headquarters of the Peruvian Amazon Company (PAC). The city&#x27;s economy was highly dependent on the PAC, controlled in the nation by Peruvian businessman Julio César Arana. PAC kept indigenous workers in near slavery conditions through use of force and harsh treatment, until an investigation caused a reaction against the company. In addition, rubber seedlings had been smuggled out of the country and cultivated on plantations in Southeast Asia, undercutting prices of the Peruvian product. With the decline of the rubber industry, many workers and merchants left Iquitos.

As one of the leading cities, along with Manaus, during the Amazon rubber boom (1880–1914), Iquitos was influenced by the numerous Europeans who flocked to it. Architecture and cultural institutions established during this period expressed their own traditions. An opera house and Jewish cemetery were among the institutions established.

Later in the 20th century, the city and region diversified its economy. The region exported timber, fish and its by-products, oil, minerals, and agricultural crops. It also derives revenue from tourism and related crafts. In 1999, the city consolidated its four municipalities.

== History ==

=== Early period ===
The area was inhabited for thousands of years by Amerindians. At the time of European encounter, the Napeano and Iquito peoples occupied the area. They had small seasonal settlements and were nomadic hunter-gatherers, living in close association with the rivers. The city name of Iquitos is derived from a group of native people called Iquitos by the Spaniards. They had previously inhabited areas along the rivers Pastaza, Arabela, Tigre, Nanay, and Curaray. Eventually, the native Iquito migrated to the area around the rivers Nanay, Amazonas, Itaya, and the Lake Moronacocha.

Between 1638 and 1769, the Iquitos and other native tribes of the Marañon rivers were obliged to settle down in various Missions (known as &quot;reducciones&quot; or reductions) founded and run by Jesuit missionaries from the Audiencia of Quito. The Jesuits settled in the major cities of the Audiencia of Quito, which was part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada at the time. During this period of nearly 130 years, 161 Jesuit missionaries worked to convert and educate the natives of the Amazon region. Among them were 63 criollos (white ethnic Spanish colonists born in the Audencia), 43 Spaniards, 32 Germans and Dutch, 20 Italians, 2 Portuguese, and 1 Frenchman. Their role in South America was to convert the natives of the Amazon Basin to Christianity. The Jesuits successfully gathered the natives living along the Marañon river into various Jesuit missions, where they were set to work at farming and other pursuits.

Commencing in 1730, the Jesuits took 37 years to found the Iquitos missions along the Marañon River, close to the mouth of the Napo and Amazon rivers. These were collectively known as Iquitos Missions, since all these settlements were mainly populated chiefly by the Iquitos natives of the region. The naming and foundation of all the Iquitos Missions were done by Jesuit Father José Bahamonde. He was born in Quito on 1 January 1710, accepted into the Jesuit order, and served as a missionary for decades. After Charles III of Spain suppressed and expelled the Society of Jesus from South America in 1767, Bahamonde was exiled to Italy, where he died in Ravenna, Italy on 11 May 1786.

The following is a chronological list of noted Iquitos Missions founded by Bahamonde and other Jesuits:
#1730, Santa Maria de la Luz de los Iquitos &quot;town,&quot; founded by Father Bahamonde – as recorded in the Archives of the Indies in Spain.
#1740, Juan Nepomuceno de Iquitos, founded by Father Bahamonde
#1741, Santa Bárbara de Iquitos, founded by Father Bahamonde
#1742, San Sebastián de Iquitos, founded by fathers Bahamonde and Bretano
#1748, Sagrado Corazón de Jesús de Maracanos (de Iquitos), founded by Father Bahamonde
#1754, Santa María de Iquitos, founded by Father Uriarte
#1757, San Pablo de los Napeanos, founded by Father Bahamonde
#1763 San Javier de Iquitos, founded by Father Palme
#1767 San José de Iquitos, founded by Father Uriarte. Later that year the Jesuits were expelled from South America by order of Charles III.

During the Spanish Colonial era, most of the Jesuit missions were under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audiencia of Quito. Created in 1563, it was a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, and was transferred briefly to the Viceroyalty of New Granada on 27 May 1717 known as the Cedula Real of 1717 (Royal Decree of 1717). Six and a half years later, on 5 November 1723, Philip V of Spain dissolved the Viceroyalty of New Granada and reincorporated the Audiencia of Quito into the Viceroyalty of Peru. Sixteen years later Philip V of Spain decided to re-create the Viceroyalty of New Granada and to re incorporate the Audiencia of Quito through the &quot;Cedula Real&quot; (Royal Decree) dated 20 August 1739. Charles III of Spain suppressed the Society of Jesus, believing them too powerful, and expelled them from South America by order dated 20 August 1767. Given the distance from Quito and the lack of roads connecting to that city, a political vacuum was developed in the area. The undefended Jesuit missions were attacked by the Brazilian Bandeirantes. In response the King of Spain on recommendation of Francisco Raquena created the Government and Commandancy General of Maynas in 1802 to halt the invasion into the Spanish Amazon of land-hungry mestizo Portuguese Bandeirantes. In general, this amounted to the religious administration and military command of all tributaries of the Amazon river in the Amazon Basin that belonged to the Royal Audiencia of Quito in the Viceroyalty of New Granada being transferred again to the Viceroyalty of Peru. The Portuguese advance was halted at Tabatinga.

=== 19th century: independence ===
In the early 19th century, following independence, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil had overlapping claims to the Northwestern Amazon Basin, based on each country&#x27;s interpretation of their colonial &quot;de jure&quot; titles. The disputed area was populated mostly by groups of nomadic Amerindian natives living in the Amazon jungle. In addition there were semi-assimilated sedentary Amerindians living with a handful of whites and mestizos, dedicated to trading in sparsely populated trading port villages that were found scattered along the river banks of the Amazon Basin. During the colonial era the disputed area known as Maynas had numerous missions administered by the Jesuits of Quito. After the Jesuits were expelled from South America, only a handful of missions survived in the 19th century as isolated trading villages. The Brazilians, by contrast, had a chain of villages along the Amazon River that stretched to its ports along the Atlantic Ocean.

Because Peru discovered that Ecuador and Colombia neglected to effectively control their Amazonian territories during their colonial era, Peru decided to back its de jure titles with de facto possession by setting up military posts in the relatively isolated trading villages and then flooding the disputed area with Peruvian colonists. The only problem lay with the expanding ambitions of Brazil, since it had slowly settled its part of the disputed area with colonists throughout its colonial era; it had a trading relationship with the Spanish-speaking trading posts and villages along the Marañon River. To neutralize Brazil from impeding Peru&#x27;s planned colonization project, on 23 October 1851, Peru peacefully settled its disputes with Brazil and both countries agreed to a bilateral free navigation and friendly trade along the Amazon River.

As a result of the Peruvian-Brazilian treaty, the Peruvian President Ramon Castilla created the Military and Political Department of Loreto on 7 January 1861 from the former Maynas territory. Castilla ordered that a fluvial port be constructed in a strategic spot on the Amazon River. After some debate, his staff chose the trading port Village of Iquitos. On 5 January 1864, three steamships of the Peruvian Navy: &quot;Pastaza,&quot; &quot;Próspero&quot; y &quot;Morona&quot;, arrived in the Village of Iquitos.

This date is marked as the founding of the first fluvial Peruvian port of Iquitos by the government of Peru. A dockyard and navy factorage imported from England was immediately constructed. In time Iquitos grew so much that it was designated as the capital of the Department of Loreto on 9 November 1897. Iquitos also became the seat of a Roman Catholic Apostolic vicariate. Peru was able to map out and assume &quot;de facto&quot; control of the majority of the area of the Amazon region under dispute with Ecuador and Colombia. After many skirmishes with Ecuadorian and Colombian outposts, that at times led to war, Peru settled its border with Colombia in 1922 and with Ecuador in 1942.

=== Rubber boom in the 20th century ===
Beginning in the 1900s, Iquitos became wealthy through its rubber industry throughout the rubber boom; it attracted thousands of immigrants from around the world, mostly young single men who hoped to make their fortunes in rubber. The rise of the automobile and related industries had dramatically increased the worldwide demand for rubber. Some men became merchants and bankers, and made their fortunes that way. Many of the European men married indigenous women and stayed in Iquitos the rest of their lives, founding ethnically mixed families. The immigrants brought European clothing styles, music, architecture and other cultural elements to Iquitos. They established an opera house that featured European classical music.

There were twenty-five different commercial houses dealing with rubber at Iquitos in the year 1900. These enterprises were founded by influential citizens of the city, some of the most prominent of these people include Julio César Arana, Cecilio Hernández, as well as Luis and Adolfo Morey. The rubber baron Carlos Fitzcarrald was also active in the city of Iquitos until he drowned in a steamship accident on the Urubamba River in 1897. Rubber entrepreneurs participated in regional politics, and directly as well as indirectly funded the development of the city. A number of successful rubber entrepreneurs held political offices, or had influence over politics in the city during this era. In 1901, Luis F. Morey became a senator for the department of Loreto, which Iquitos was the capital of. Enrique A. Llosa, who had a business relationship with Arana and Luis Morey, became the mayor of Iquitos in 1901. The following year, Arana became the city&#x27;s mayor, and in 1903 he assumed the office of President for Loreto&#x27;s chamber of commerce. Cecilio Hernández was also elected as the mayor, later in 1906. A census conducted in 1903 by Bentio Lores, the subprefect of the Bajo Amazonas at the time, documented that there were 9,438 inhabitants in Iquitos. 

In 1908, Hildebrando Fuentes, Prefect of Loreto between 1904–1906, published &quot;Loreto: Apuntes geográficos, históricos, esdisticos, politicos y sociales&quot; which was based on information he collected while in Iquitos. According to Cristóbal Cardemil-Krause, Fuentes writings &quot;make clear the existence of significant tensions between national and private interests. Entrepreneurs in Loreto controlled the area and appeared to create a state within the state, limiting the effects of Fuentes&#x27;s decisions.&quot; Fuentes also described the practice of &quot;Correrias&quot; which were slave raids carried out by rubber tappers that resulted in the killing of many indigenous people. Men and older indigenous women were typically killed by the rubber tappers, while children and young females were brought to rubber camps or nearby cities, including Iquitos. The captive children and young females were typically sold at these cities. Fuentes referred to these &quot;correrias&quot; as &quot;the great crime of the mountain&quot; and in regards to his inability to act against the rubber tappers, he claimed that &quot;[t]hey do all this significantly beyond the reach of authority.&quot;. Fuentes wrote that the majority of the indigenous servants at Iquitos consisted of indigenous people captured during &quot;correrias&quot;, and at times these people were sold in Iquitos for a price ranging between £30 and £50. Walter Ernest Hardenburg, an American engineer that had a prominent role in exposing the Putumayo genocide, also claimed that indigenous people were trafficked in Iquitos and sold in that city for prices ranging between £20 and £40.

In an effort to discourage human trafficking from Loreto to the Brazilian Amazon, government commissioner Joaquin Capello issued a decree in 1900 that required employers to provide a bond for any of their workers that were leaving Peru. This bond was initially set at 200 Peruvian soles and had the intention of attracting employers to transport their workers back into the country once their contracts expired. The bond amount was later increased by Capello&#x27;s successors. In 1903, subprefect Benito Lores denounced the continuance of human trafficking in Loreto, he stated that instances of human trafficking were covered up under the pretense of transferring debts from one employer to another. Lores claimed that many of the wealthy residents of Iquitos were transporting indigenous peons and transferring their debts to patrons on rivers in Brazil. Once under the custody of their new Brazilian patrons, these indigenous people were interred deep into the forest, far away from the influence of governmental authorities, &quot;where there is no law other than the whip or the bullet.&quot; Members of the local business class denied these allegations of trafficking reported by Lores: and in 1904 several rubber merchants signed a petition addressed to the new Prefect Hildebrando Fuentes which demanded the annulment of Capello&#x27;s decree from 1900. These merchants argued that the decree was unconstitutional due to it prohibiting the free movement of people. Another argument was that instead of benefitting the affected peons, the decree worsened their situation since patrons charged the bail amount against the peons debt. The petition suggested that local authorities and representatives from the chamber of commerce should establish legislation to regulate the removal of peons from the country.

The wealthiest Europeans built great mansions in the late 19th century, some of which survive. &quot;Casa de Fierro&quot; (Spanish for the Iron House) is said to have been designed by Gustave Eiffel, designer of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, but evidence supporting this claim is scant. After a Briton, Henry Wickham, smuggled rubber seeds out of the area to establish competing rubber plantations in British colonies in southeast Asia and Africa, the boom came to an end. In addition, a 1913 investigative report by Roger Casement, the British consul-general to Iquitos who had investigated labor conditions for natives in the Congo Free State when it was under King Leopold&#x27;s control, revealed the abuses committed against indigenous workers in the Putumayo River Basin by the Peruvian Amazon Company (PAC), owned by businessman Julio César Arana. Its several British board members and numerous stockholders in London were pressured into making changes in the operations of the company. Many of the British shareholders divested themselves of this company in an effort to force changes. While Arana was forced to liquidate the PAC, he retained access to most of its assets as well as territory and he continued to operate in the rubber industry through the rubber enterprise of Cecilio Hernández. Casement wrote that he was convinced that &quot;[t]he entire Indian population is enslaved in the montaña and whereupon the devil plant, the rubber tree, grows and can be tapped. The wilder the Indian the wickeder the slavery.&quot;

The army garrison at Iquitos was sent to the Caraparaná tributary of the Putumayo River in 1908 to assist Arana&#x27;s company in acquiring several Colombian rubber estates through force. This detachment was accompanied by the Peruvian warship &quot;Iquitos&quot;. According to Victor Macedo, this garrison force consisted of 120 men, 80 of which had perished by 1910, mostly on the Caraparaná River.

In 1911, more than 237 arrest warrants were issued by judges Carlos A. Valcárcel and Rómulo Paredes against employees of the PAC due to their perpetration of the Putumayo Genocide. Pablo Zumaeta, a brother-in-law of Arana and the general manager of PAC, had an arrest warrant issued against him by Valcárcel on July 29, however Zumaeta requested to appeal it and this warrant was annulled by the Superior Court of Iquitos before the end of 1911. Zumaeta was permitted by local authorities and the Prefect to remain in his residency in Iquitos while his arrest warrant was active. Once the arrest warrant was annulled, Zumaeta was allowed to return to public life, he was out of hiding by November 2 of 1911. Valcárcel left Iquitos in protest of the Superior Courts decision to annul Zumaeta&#x27;s warrant, Valcárcel was dismissed from his office for abandoning his post without permission.

Rómulo Paredes, Zumaeta and Gennaro Herrera, another prominent citizen of Iquitos, all ran for the mayoral election of Iquitos in 1911, which was held on November 5 and 6. Paredes emerged as the candidate with the most votes from the election, in response to these results the political faction backing Zumaeta filed an appeal with the &quot;Junta Escrutadora&quot;, which decided to annul the election. The &quot;Junta Escrutadora&quot; consisted of five members, two of which, Juan Bautista Vega and Victor Israel, were known associates of Julio Cesar Arana. In 1912, Zumaeta became the mayor of Iquitos, he served another term in this office in 1914. Valcárcel issued arrest warrants against Julio Arana and Juan Bautista Vega on December 10 of 1912 however these were also annulled by the Superior Court of Iquitos. Many of those under the employ of Arana that were issued arrest warrants evaded capture. Two of the most prominent criminals involved in the Putumayo Genocide that were arrested, Armando Normand and Aurelio Rodríguez, escaped from prison at Iquitos in May of 1915 prior to a verdict in their trial.

In 1912, Hardenburg published &quot;The Putumayo, the Devil&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, the editor of this book noted that the English consul-general in Iquitos, David Cazes, should have been aware of human trafficking occurring between the Putumayo River and Iquitos. Judge Rómulo Paredes implicated Cazes with &quot;aiding the guilty parties in keeping from the Peruvian Government an exact knowledge of what was taking place&quot;. The editor also wrote that the twenty-one constables employed by the Peruvian government on the Putumayo River &quot;had all been bribed by the English traders and shut their eyes to what was happening in the jungle.&quot; Hardenburg reported that he had witnessed one Peruvian comisario on the Putumayo River, César Lúrquin, travelling on a steamship with a young indigenous Huitoto girl, Hardenburg concluded that Lúrquin intended to sell this child in Iquitos. Regarding Lúrquin, Hardenburg wrote &quot;instead of stopping on the Putumayo, travelling about there and really making efforts to suppress crime by punishing the criminals, he contented himself with visiting the region four or five times a year—always on the company’s launches—stopping a week or so, collecting some children to sell, and then returning and making his “report.”&quot; 

Anthropologist Michael Taussig claimed that David Cazes enterprise, the Iquitos Trading Company, was dependent on Julio César Arana&#x27;s business. During Casement&#x27;s investigation in 1910, he found out that several Barbadian men employed by the PAC had complained to Cazes that they were physically abused by agents of Arana&#x27;s company: however Cazes did not relay this information to the British Foreign Office. Regarding Cazes, Casement wrote that &quot;[h]e knew a very great deal of the Putumayo and kept it quiet – like everyone else in Iquitos. The Arana influence was too strong – and he was a trader and sold to them.&quot; Cazes was also aware of the newspaper publications of Benjamin Saldaña Rocca, which publicly denounced Arana&#x27;s company for perpetrating atrocities against indigenous people, he did not forward this information to the British Foreign Office either. Prior to November of 1911, the &quot;Beatriz&quot; steamship, owned by Cazes&#x27;s company, was chartered by the Peruvian government to transport Peruvian soldiers and supplies to the Putumayo River as well as transport rubber from the Peruvian Amazon Company on that river to Iquitos. On November 27 of 1911, Roger Casement wrote that &quot;Beatriz&quot; arrived at Iquitos with 41 tons of rubber, he noted that no freight was charged by the government for the transportation of this rubber. Casement was informed by Cazes that this was in accordance with an agreement between Arana&#x27;s company and the Peruvian government. 

During the Peruvian Amazon Company&#x27;s perpetration of the Putumayo genocide, the company&#x27;s steamships occasionally trafficked indigenous people to Iquitos, where they were sold. Walter Ernest Hardenburg wrote that every steamship that left the Putumayo carried &quot;from five to fifteen little Indian boys and girls, who are torn, sobbing, from their mothers’ arms without the slightest compunction&quot; Casement implicated several other rubber businesses with trafficking indigenous people on their steamships for the slave trade in Iquitos, specifically Wesche &amp; Company and the Khan Polack Company, which were both operating on the Ucayali River. He emphasized that these companies were just as responsible for the propagation of a slave market in the region as the armed raiders carrying out slave raids against the indigenous people. The reason being that these two companies supplied the raiders and transported groups of enslaved indigenous people to Iquitos or towards rubber extraction camps. The head of Wesche &amp; Company, Emilio Strassberger, was elected as mayor of Iquitos between 1912–1913.

Rubber from plantations in Asia was soon produced at lower cost, undercutting that of South America, and rubber declined in importance in Peru. Iquitos continued to operate as an important trading port in the Amazon basin. It exploited its timber, oil and mineral resources for export and processing, along with agricultural and other products.

Among the unique communities formed by the 19th-century immigrants to the rubber boom was one of Sephardic Jews from Morocco. Many of the men married native women and made families in Iquitos. They established a synagogue and the Jewish cemetery. In the first generation, some of the women or children converted to Judaism, but by the end of the 20th century, four or five generations later, most descendants were no longer practicing Jews. Most were reared as Catholic.

In the 1990s, a descendant of a Jewish settler undertook serious study of Judaism. He began to revive the practice of Judaism among his family, friends, and other Sephardi descendants. After years of study, with the help of a sympathetic Conservative rabbi in Lima and another from Brooklyn, New York, eventually a few hundred people studied, practiced as Jews, and converted to Judaism. (Formal conversion was necessary according to &quot;Halakha&quot; as their mothers were not Jewish.) Many of the converts have emigrated to Israel under its Law of Return. A documentary was made about this community in 2010. Emigration of Peruvians from this Iquitos community has continued; about 150 emigrated in 2013 to 2014, see &quot;Peruvian Jews in Israel&quot; for more.

On 13 August 2012, a special plaque was placed in the plaza 28 de Julio of the city in a ceremony to commemorate the Amazon River and rainforest as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. The plaque was forged in Munich, Germany. Iguazu Falls in Argentina has also been recognized as one of these top natural wonders.

In 2021, it was announced that a large (100 MW/100 MWH) solar and storage power facility would be built at Iquitos by 2026, replacing as much as half the diesel burned to produce electricity in the city.

== Geography ==
Iquitos is located in northeastern Peru, northeastern Loreto Region, and in the extreme south of the Province of Maynas. Located on the Great Plains, the city has an area of , comprising the districts Belén, Punchana and San Juan Bautista. It is approximately at coordinates 03 ° 43&#x27;46 &quot;S 73 ° 14&#x27;18&quot; W to . It is the most northern Peruvian city.

It is surrounded by the Port of Iquitos, formed by the Amazon, Nanay and Itaya rivers. The city is situated on the left bank of the Amazon River, which provides a characteristic economic life, including trade and transport. The Itaya and Nanay rivers limit the physical expansion of the city in that direction; new development is growing toward the south and there is a slight population density in Downtown Iquitos. Close to Iquitos are a number of lagoons and lakes; Moronococha Lake is a boundary to the city on the west. These features make the city seem like a huge, faux river island.

Geologically, the city is settled in a Tertiary-Quaternary formation lithologically composed by little-consolidated lutites, with remains of flora or fauna, and numerous white-sand lenses of abundant silicon. The residual soils are sandy, almost clay-like and variably deep. Physiography, is a hazy landscape due to the undulations of the soil erosion caused by rain.

=== Climate ===
Iquitos experiences an equatorial climate that is a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and with no cyclones. There is constant rain throughout the year, without a distinct dry season, but a wetter summer. Because the seasons are not sensitive in the equatorial zone, Iquitos has only two seasons.

The rainy summer arrives in November and ends in May. March and April have the heaviest rains and humidity, with precipitation between , respectively. In May, the Amazon River, one of the rivers surrounding the city, reaches its highest levels. It falls around at its lowest point in October, and then steadily rises again cyclically according to rainfall.

Winter offers a drier, sunnier climate. Although July and August are the driest months, they have some periods of downpours. Sunny days and good weather are common. Rainfall is more abundant here than in Ayacucho, Cusco, or Lima.

Iquitos also has microclimates: rain or drizzle may be present in some areas of the districts, while other parts of the city are slightly cloudy or clear. The temperature may vary. The urban climate is slightly warmer than the natural climate, and would be reflected by the thermal sensation. It suffers from a phenomenon called urban heat island, when the city&#x27;s heat has difficulty dissipating during the night hours due to absorption by buildings and pavement.

=== Natural hazards ===
The main natural hazard is flooding. In 2012, major flooding occurred in Iquitos who alerted the population and affected coastal areas and several towns in the metropolitan area, which has a floodable, rainy geography. The floods of 2012 were regarded as the most historic natural disaster to Iquitos to date. Wet weather in Loreto took showers and drizzle, causing damage and flooding in the Loreto Region since November 2011. The rainy weather continued until early 2012, and increased the level of water in the Amazon river—wide stream that feeds most of the tributaries in Loreto – up to . Since February and March, several villages are affected (19,209 and 18,400 families affected), 26 000 hectares of farmland are flooded and the water level reached coastal streets of Iquitos. On 24 April 2012, the spate faded, and initiated the first stage of ebb.

Other natural hazards are heat waves where temperatures can reach over with a heat index of which is caused by the low humidity on clear days. Cold waves are also curious in Iquitos: cold air from the tip of the continent driven by the dynamics of the atmosphere, comes to town and causes a drop in temperature, moderate rainfall and thunderstorms. The trade winds also come to cause gales reaching . In October 2012, Iquitos experienced high temperatures and heavy thunderstorms.

Earthquakes in the city are very rare and very deep. Iquitos is located in Region 3 of Systematic Regionalization Map of Peru, which means that the city has a low coefficient seismic value, although the 2011 Peru earthquake, which occurred southeast of Contamana, was felt in the city as a small and unexpected jolt.

=== Ecology ===

Due to its location in the Peruvian Amazon, Iquitos has a green landscape with a vast variety of life. The flora is varied with great presence of 850 species, including 22 species of palms and orchids, who provide the attractive forest within the urban landscape of the city. Lilies are also present. The extensive forests seated within the metropolitan area host fauna including 130 species of mammals, 330 species of birds, 150 species of reptiles and amphibians, and 250 species of fish. Within the city, inhabiting the rock dove (&quot;Columba livia&quot;), especially in the Square 28 de Julio. Also recorded is the transient presence of bull sharks (&quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;) who come from the Atlantic Ocean, traveling 3,360 miles to reach Iquitos.

The floodplain forest of Iquitos is the peculiar ecoregion which surrounds the city, and is characterized by a várzea forest called Iquitos varzea. Its alluvial detail is the motive why intense rainy seasons easily reach these areas flood. In the natural cycle, the trees drop their leaves and other organic waste to the soil, and become humus. Rain washes these nutrients into rivers, which gives that blonde color, called tannin. Immediately, this cycle repeats.

The great biodiversity that the Iquitos Metropolitan Area houses and protects is paramount, and that is intrinsically related to its urban planning, which puts a limit action in areas where farms should not be built. Because of this, the appearance of informal settlements is seen as a risk.

=== Natural reserves and zoos ===
The importance of the existence of nature reserves is a priority in Iquitos for ecosystem protection.

The Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve is a protected area with soaring rates of biodiversity. The reserve is located from Iquitos, being reached by Route LO-103. The ecosystem is part of the Nanay River basin, specifically in an area called &quot;Ecoregion Napo&quot;, which contains unique Amazonian biodiversity, including its distinctive white sand forests. The Napo Ecoregion contains 112 species of amphibians, 17 species of primates, 1900 plant species and over 600 bird species. Some ecologically important animals valued for their rarity in the reserve are the supay pichico (&quot;Callimico goeldii&quot;), black stump (&quot;Callicebus torquatus&quot;), equatorial saki (&quot;Pithecia aequatorialis&quot;) ancient antwren (&quot;Herpsilochmus gentryi&quot;), Mishana tyrannulet (&quot;Zimmerius villarejoi&quot;), Allpahuayo antbird (&quot;Percnostola arenarum&quot;), chestnut-tailed ant (&quot;Myrmeciza centuculorum castanea&quot;), the pompadour cotinga (&quot;Xipholena punicea&quot;), saffron-crested tyrant-manakin (&quot;Neopelma chrysocephalum&quot;), among others. The Iquitos gnatcatcher (Polioptila clementsi) is an endemic species of the reserve and is considered a symbol of Iquitos.

Quistococha Tourist Complex is characterized by its variety. The place is located from Iquitos via Route AS-103, and with an extension of natural forest, has a small zoo, a serpentarium, an aquarium, a nursery and an artificial beach called Tunchi Beach.

The butterfly zoo Pilpintuwasi is located in Padre Cocha, Iquitos, and includes more than 40 species of insects, especially butterflies. Along the butterfly zoo, is the Amazon Animal Orphanage, commissioned in animal rescue.

== Demography ==

In 1808, Hipolito Sanchez Rangel, the bishop of Maynas, reported that the village of Iquitos had 171 inhabitants and on 8 June 1842, the date when the town was elevated to a district, it had just over 200 inhabitants.

In 1860, according to Paz Soldan, the town had only 300 inhabitants. Two years later, the population increased to about 431 inhabitants and in 1864, there were 648 people, predominantly mestizo due to the presence of families from Borja, Santiago, Santa Teresa, Barranca and others, who fled away from the attack on the Huambisas and Aguaruna native and destroyed the villages.

According to Genaro Herrera, in 1866, Iquitos had a population of 648 people. For 1876, again the same author reports a population of 1,475 inhabitants.

In 1903, in the middle of the rubber boom, Iquitos had 9,438 inhabitants (census of Benito Lords), of which 542 were foreigners, most of them from Spain (95) Brazil (80), China (74), Portugal (64) and as many from Italy, England, France, Ecuador, United States, Russia, Switzerland and Morocco.

Currently, Iquitos has emerged as the largest city in the Peruvian Amazon. Counted by the census of 2007 with 406,340 inhabitants.

== Government ==

Iquitos is a provincial municipality with a system of government headed by a Provincial Council, composed of the Mayor and fifteen aldermen. The Provincial Municipality of Maynas (MPM) is the main body that has jurisdiction in the Maynas Province and Iquitos District, and authorities are elected by popular vote. The municipal government is responsible for planning development and territorial order within its jurisdiction and promoting strategic coordinace
within the district order. It is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, urban planning, regulation of all types of transportation, municipal tax collection, maintenance of public roads (asphalt, cleaning, etc..) and gardens, promoting culture and preservation of architecture and public places, among others. The Municipal Manager is responsible &quot;to direct, coordinate, monitor and evaluate the technical, financial and administrative of the Municipality&quot;.

The MPM has support bodies formed by the General Secretariat, the Office of Institutional Image, Administrative Management, Revenue Management and the General Office of Information. The line agencies are bureaucratic managers with a distinct role and have the function of carrying out the institution&#x27;s mission, which includes the Territorial Conditioning, Sanitation and Environmental Health, Works and Infrastructure, Traffic and Public Transport, Social Development, Economic Development and Municipal Services. The MPM organizes the Municipal Ombudsman Service of Child and Adolescent.

The mayor was Adela Jimenez, an architect, chosen by the National Jury of Elections to fill temporarily to Charles Zevallos who was suspended for health reasons. Jimenez was the first woman to hold the office of mayor provincial and Iquitos. Current mayor is Francisco Sanjurjo Dávila.

The political geography of Iquitos consists of four districts or communes, each with a district municipality. Except for Iquitos District which does not have a district municipality and as such, the Provincial Municipality of Maynas also functions as its council district. The other districts are with a respective one: District Municipality of Punchna, the District Municipality of San Juan Bautista and the District Municipality of Belén. Each municipality has control in its own district, and each has a policy of urban planning that is created according to the state of its district.

== Metropolitan area ==
The city is the urban core of Iquitos Metropolitan Area. It is a conurbation consists of four districts that are heavily populated in the city, while rural areas become more so away from the downtown. The Iquitos District is the urban origin of the city and the metropolitan area. Moronacocha, which has 85,000 inhabitants, could become the fifth district of Iquitos.

Iquitos is composed of four districts.
*Iquitos (Iquitos District: 163,594 inhabitants) is the main district of the city, and is the most visited by tourists. The center of Iquitos, located in the heart of the district, is best known, and it has most of the activities of economy, culture, entertainment, art and commerce of the city. The Plaza de Armas is the tourist point of departure for most tourists, along with the Casa de Fierro, the Iglesia Matriz, the former Palace Hotel, the Boulevard de Iquitos, the Malecon Tarapaca and the Amazon Library.
*Belén (Municipality of Belen District: 74,551 inhabitants) is one of the districts of the city known mainly for its intense commercial activity and the Belen Neighborhood, called the &quot;Venice&quot; by &quot;iquiteños&quot;. It is located on the east side of Iquitos and was created on 5 November 1999.
*Punchana (Municipality of Punchana District: 85,179 inhabitants) is the northern district of Iquitos and was created on 17 December 1987, and is characterized more by its port activity and Bellavista-Nanay market. Punchana capital has a small district capital called Villa Punchana. 90% of the district is composed of urban land, while 10% is rural. In the history of Iquitos, Punchana started as a small hamlet and the name of the district is due to a kind of wild agouti, which was cared for in a breedingground at the beginning of the 20th century.
*San Juan Bautista (Municipality of San Juan Bautista District: 124,143 inhabitants), colloquially known as San Juan, is the largest district of Iquitos, and which is constantly expanding to the south of the city due to the arrival of new families to the city —also embraces remote areas beyond the urban Iquitos, such as the Quistococha Resort and Zoo. Before promoted as a populous district in the presidency of Fernando Belaunde in the 1960s, the district was a sparsely populated road. Currently, several human settlements are in the &quot;expansive&quot; border areas. In this district, there are several tourist spots such as the San Juan Craft Market, the beaches of Santa Clara and St. Thomas, and Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve (located in the Iquitos-Nauta Highway).

The metropolitan area of Iquitos is also organized by another system subdivisions, less known by the local colloquialism.

*Downtown Iquitos houses the historical extension of Iquitos, and its main shopping and entertainment movement. This includes closely eastern union between Iquitos and Belen districts.
*North Iquitos comprises Punchana and northern Iquitos.
*South Iquitos comprises mostly San Juan Bautista, sectors such as Terminal and much of its length south.
*West Iquitos comprises the western parts of the Iquitos District as Moronacocha.
*East Iquitos would be hosting in all the Belén District, and the eastern part of Belén.

== Economy ==


Iquitos is the main center of commerce, tourism and industry in the Amazon rainforest with the world. As gateway to the Peruvian Amazon, the economy of many parts of the region come to Iquitos for sustainable control. The Economic Development Management of the Provincial Municipality of Maynas is responsible for regulating and regulate trade, business development and employment, tourism and rural production both Iquitos District as whole Maynas Province. Meanwhile, the Chamber of Commerce of Iquitos is headed by economist Victor Manuel Valdivia Barberis.

The city is a major center for finance, sales, transportation, tourism, media, while major industries that work is the timber, petroleum, gas, flour milling, oil, rum, camu camu and bakery. The fishing industry is another big support for the economy of the city. The Belen Market has a frenetic commercial activity that is part of its economy. Iquitos has great financial backing has been able to help it progress now since its role in the rubber boom, although must be overcome with effort after the rubber was no longer produced in the city. The petroleum industry, despite being outside the urban area of Iquitos, has greatly influenced its evolution. In addition, trade has mainly helped the growth of the city. In San Juan Bautista, economic development is based on agriculture (sugar cane, pijuayo, caimito), fish, poultry, livestock (cattle, bubaline) and mining. The petroleum, one of the most precious resources, extracted mainly from the region northwest of Loreto and part of it is transported to the refinery in Iquitos. The timber transport is another important economic factor, however, due to the Free Trade Agreement between Peru and the United States, the gross exploitation of timber has decreased considerably.

According to Rolando Arellano, president of Arellano Marketing, describes the &quot;Iquiteño&quot; consumer to have greater preference for a &quot;Western model with a more modern orientation than the Peruvian-Andean lifestyle&quot;.

With projects of large malls, the city still has a trade-in retail stores and minimarkets throughout the metropolitan area, more strongly in main avenues such as Prospero, Arica, Grau and Alfonso Ugarte located in the center of Iquitos and the Belén District. Retail distribution of imported products has created regional and social stratification that goes from the merchant importer to urban retailer, which serves as a strong link between the urban and rural economy.

Companies located in Iquitos include Amazónica, Backus, Banco Continental, Banco de Crédito del Perú, Banco de la Nación, Banco Financiero, Bata Shoes, Claro Americas, CrediVargas, DHL Express, DirecTV, Electro Oriente, Galerías Quispe, Supermercado Pacific, Honda, Husqvarna AB, Inkafarma, Interbank, Los Portales, Mapfre, Motocorp, Multicines Star, Orvisa/Caterpillar, Persa, Petroperú, RadioShack, Scotiabank, Shambo, Special Book Services, Telefónica/Movistar, The Coca-Cola Company, Topitop, Western Union, Yamaha Corporation, among others.

In the coming years, companies like Ripley, Saga Falabella, Metro, Plaza Vea, Tottus, among others, will be available.

== Education ==
Iquitos is home to numerous research projects on ecology related to ornithology and herpetology. Cornell University owns a field station dubbed the Cornell University Esbaran Amazon Field Laboratory. Founded in July 2001 under the direction of Dr. Eloy Rodriguez, the facility is dedicated to education, conservation, and the discovery of novel medicinal compounds from applied field chemoecology.

The field lab strives to survey and catalog the biological diversity found along the Yarapa River Basin. It provides researchers with field experience in the broad range of disciplines necessary for this task. Another major goal is to explore value-added derivatives of biodiversity. This includes both tangible returns, in the form of new discoveries in the biomedical and related sciences, as well as less tangible goods, such as the promotion of ecotourism and an ecological ethic. They work to ensure benefits to the local communities, and to participating students and researchers.

=== Universities ===
Iquitos has four universities: Universidad Nacional de la Amazonía Peruana (UNAP), the local state university; Universidad Particular de Iquitos (UPI), Universidad Científica del Perú (UCP), Universidad Peruana del Oriente (UPO) three private institutions. It is also home to the &quot;Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana&quot; (IIAP), the Institute of Investigation of the Peruvian Amazon.

== Transport ==

Iquitos has a personality very different from the rest of Peru and even different from other South-American Amazonian cities. The streets of Iquitos are dominated by more than 25,000 auto rickshaws or motokars, known in the rest of Peru under the name of mototaxi, and for foreigners as auto rickshaw or tuk-tuk, providing taxi service. The buses are large vehicles made of wood with direct routes.

Iquitos is widely regarded as the largest inland city that is inaccessible by road. Air and river transport are the main means for entry or exit of people and goods to the city, since the cost of living in this city is generally higher than the Peruvian standard. It is considered that Iquitos is the second most expensive city in Peru after Cusco.

== Cityscape ==

=== Architecture ===

Iquitos has architecturally significant buildings in a particular range of structural remnants were built during the rubber boom of the 1880s. The buildings are mainly European/Amazonian-style with ceramic tiles imported from Italy and Portugal, and the city&#x27;s unique French architecture called Casa de Fierro built by Gustave Eiffel, who built the original house in Paris for an exhibition of 1878. However, the structure is not the only European urban appeal: the city is also characterized by the rustic architecture or conventional as the palafitte, malocas and huts that are located primarily in the areas of the city.

Historically, the first native inhabitants of the settlements built their houses of sticks and leaves and other natural resources, which were tailored to protect against the climate, wildlife and other hazards. The styles of housing in those settlements were huts and cocameras, used as large communal houses. Other notable conventional architectures are characterized by their firmness and isothermal conditions; they are categorized into three types of home: quincha —built with posts and giant cane—, rammed earth —resistant and isothermal—, and adobe —irm with the same isothermal condition.

The rubber boom of the 1880s caused a severe change in the architectural style of Iquitos. Foreign and rubber barons brought with them the influence of countries like Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, and descendants as Sephardim. Jose de Jesus Reategui and a young group built the main features of the urban city during the rubber boom, including the Iglesia Matriz de Iquitos. In the Iquitos popular belief of the 19th century, iron was considered less humane and aesthetic, but Gustave Eiffel got the Casa de Fierro became an attraction in the city, although historically the prefabricated building was not designed for Iquitos. Baroque and Rococo style also influenced the architecture of Iquitos, and defense against the rain was another prominent feature added to buildings. About 90 buildings are declared architectural heritage sites of Loreto.

== Culture and contemporary life ==

Iquitos has a vibrant, unique, complex and diverse culture, and is regarded as the cultural hub of the Peruvian Amazon, according to Lonely Planet. Many natives visit the city to showcase their dances or sell their crafts. The city also has a wealth of customs and traditions that have remained consistent over the years such as following the Iquitos calendar, celebrating cultural festivities, cuisine, Spanish accent and mythology. Currently, its culture is undergoing an impetuous transition to a contemporary level to preserve their traditions with innovative art movements.

One of the main factors of the traditional cultural energy of Iquitos is Amazonian mythology, which has a range of characters, identified by folklore in imaginary beings. Many of the legendary beings, with appearances motivated by local geography, have powers and influenced much in agriculture and worldview of Iquitos. The dance and music, a mix of indigenous and mestizo heritage are closely related to the meanings of mythology, and also with the life of the citizen and Amazonian villager.

The complex cultural life of Iquitos consists mainly of native iquiteños, Brazilians, Colombians, Chineses and settled expatriates ethnicities. The term &quot;charapa culture&quot; generally refers to social, cultural and artistic movements of Iquitos.

Iquitos has a unique culture that is strongly felt, as the following quotes says:


Contemporary cultural movements began in the city, such as the Amazonian pop art and Amazonian graffiti—with Pukuna 8990 being the most revolutionary graffiti movement—Iquiteño music subgenres of electronica, hip hop, rap, heavy metal, French jazz, punk, psytrance/full-on, next to traditional Amazonian music. The Children&#x27;s and Youthful Symphonic Orchestra of Iquitos is the main symphonic group in the city.

Iquitos has been benchmarked over the years in literature and film. The Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa wrote his work &quot;Captain Pantoja and the Special Service&quot; inspired by the city. Francisco Lombardi&#x27;s 2000 film, based on the novel by Vargas Llosa was filmed in this city. In Rómulo Gallegos-winning &quot;The Green House&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Dream of the Celt&quot; (2010), other novels of Mario Vargas Llosa, also part of the plot occurs in Iquitos.

=== Entertainment and arts ===
Iquitos has an intense tourist movement in the entertainment, which is based on specific points located throughout the city. With a growing organization of entertainment today, the city has always had groups concerned to project the Iquitos arts such as dance, music, film, painting, literature and theater.

In the visual arts, the city is the birthplace of Amazonian pop art (also known wild naive) which is a unique, self-taught, pop-art style of the city, and is notable for its &quot;sparkling&quot; chromaticism, and makes a reference to hallucinogenic ayahuasca experiences. Originally, it is a mural art that blends prominently the colorful amazonian culture, European motifs and commercial characters, which may be influenced by American pop art, especially MTV.

In several works of painters &quot;iquiteños&quot; (such as Christian Bendayan, Roldán Pinedo, Elena Valera, Rember Yahuarcani, Brus Rubio and Victor Churay), Amazonian pop art legacy has been a visual reference to create avant-garde works of contemporary life in the city and Amazonian culture.

The Dirección Regional de Cultura (formerly known as Instituto Nacional de Cultura del Perú), with headquarters in the city, mainly funded events and arts festivals in the city, although there are also small indie or underground groups that conduct their own cultural events. The city has many small festivals; the highlights are Estamos en la Calle, Iquitos Outfest, and other small annual events.

The city is known for having a remarkable celebration, called simply &quot;Carnaval&quot;. During this festival, mainly pagan, celebrants are dedicated to wetting people with &quot;cabaciñas&quot; or other instrument. Many choose to be more extravagant, wetting with various substances such as paint or other object as cause for celebration. The celebration is unique each year in February. The carnival is heavily influenced by myths and rich Amazonian culture. It also celebrates the Day of San Juan, referring to John the Baptist as patron saint in the Peruvian Amazon, whose feast is celebrated on 24 June. The main element is the juane and other own dances as shunto jump.

==== Cinema ====

A group of people brought technology, including projectors of the Lumiere brothers. The most important pioneer of cinema in Iquitos and the Loreto Region is Antonio Wong Rengifo; alongside this, other filmmakers such as Werner Herzog, Armando Robles Godoy, Nora Izcue, Federico García, and Dorian Fernández-Moris prolonged the cinematic presence in the city. Iquitos was and is used as a cultural scene, reference, and shelter for many filmmakers.

Major films filmed in Iquitos and its surroundings are: &quot;Frente del Putumayo&quot; (1932) and &quot;Bajo el sol de Loreto&quot; (1936) by Antonio Wong Rengifo; &quot;No Stars in the Jungle&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Green Wall&quot; (1969) by Armando Robles Godoy; &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; (1972) and &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; (1982) by Werner Herzog; &quot;Informe sobre los shipibos&quot; (1974), &quot;Los hombres del Ucayali&quot; and Captain Pantoja and the Special Services (2000) by Francisco Lombardi, and &quot;General Cemetery&quot; (2012) by Dorián Fernández-Moris.

Despite having a long filmography, the film industry promoted the city is not too hard in his only commercial film theater. However, there is cultural and &quot;underground&quot; groups concerned with projecting films at festivals or private cinematheque as a way of cultural development. There is also small groups of self-taught filmmakers who record their own stories. The film genres with more presence are documentary, nature, drama, art house and, recently, horror and found footage in &quot;General Cemetery&quot;. At first, with Wong Rengifo, was shot slice-of-life/documentary films

=== Tourism ===

Tourism is one of the most vital industries in Iquitos, which has a growing reputation as a honeypot due to its location on the banks of the Amazon River, one of the seven natural wonders of the world. Through the years, Iquitos receives a considerable number of foreigners; the tourist index grew by international flights offered by the city&#x27;s airport. Tourism in the city formed into European-style architecture, cuisine, drinks, art, culture, worldview, Spanish accent and historical references of Loreto. Iquitos has adequate infrastructure to accommodate tourists from all levels. It has a 5-star hotel, many of 3-, 2-, and 1-star rating.

The major tourist attractions include Barrio de Belén, Plaza de Armas, Casa de Fierro, Ex Hotel Palace, Iglesia Matriz de Iquitos, Allpahuayo Mishana; Embarcadero Bellavista-Nanay, ethnic communities located around the city, Quistococha Resort and Zoo; Mercado Artesanal of San Juan. iperú is the leading tourist guide service that is offered to tourists at the airport and the city center of the city.

The city is also home to unique tourist companies as Amazonia Expeditions, Maniti Camp Expeditions, Otorongo Expeditions, Amazon Golf Course, and Project Amazonas (dedicated to research and conservation). Special experiences outside the key tourist areas of the city include the Camiri —a floating hotel—, the Isla de los Monos, the Pilpintuwasi butterfly zoo, Iquitos-Sunkaruqucha Corrientillos-King Kong-Nina Rumi circuit, and adjoining districts such as Mazán, Indiana and Bellavista

In 2010, Iquitos received about 150 thousand tourists. The following year, in 2011, the index fell to 46,000 tourist foreigners, which expects 10% rise rapidly in 2013 with international flights opened in July 2012 and the Amazon River as a natural wonder.

====Spiritual tourism====

Ayahuasca is known as a major cultural landmark, and mystic tourism has increased in Iquitos in recent years. The drink, made from the vine &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot;, is investigated by the Western people with a medicinal purpose and study, and was named the nation&#x27;s cultural heritage.

Dangers, however, still exist when coming into contact with the drug. Shamans are not regulated and none have proof of credentials. While deaths in Iquitos are rare, they have been reported, including Frenchman Fabrice Champion and American Kyle Nolan.

Iquitos is home to the annual Amazonian Shamanism Conference. Here, like-minded individuals meet in Iquitos yearly to discuss Ayahuasca.

=== Amazon commemorative capital ===
Iquitos is home to the , bronze commemorative plaque of the Amazon River basin as one of the seven natural wonders of the world, which was granted on 13 August 2012 by Fernand Weber, founder of New7Wonders. The distinction is shared with Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Suriname, Colombia, Venezuela and French Guiana, however, recognition was given to Peru which originally ran for the Amazon through the Regional Government of Loreto based in Iquitos.

The awards show was held in Iquitos. It began with a massive parade along Avenida Quiñonez, and eventually culminated in the main day, 13 August, divided into two sessions throughout the day: the first in the confluence of the Itaya and Nanay in the afternoon, and the second on 28 July Square of the city at night. The event received intense international attention. Similar to Machu Picchu as a wonder of the world, Iquitos, as the main entrance to the Amazon, expects great tourist revenue.

The President of Peru Ollanta Humala, next to the First Lady Nadine Heredia and Loreto Regional President Ivan Vasquez received the award. Jean Paul de la Fuente, New7Wonders foundation director, said positively on the image of Iquitos:

However, despite the great satisfaction, the award caused polarized reactions indicating that the Regional Government of Loreto would be on duty to plan better urban development in Iquitos for the forecasted intense tourism. The negative scrutiny aimed at disorganized and massive sewer construction was damaging the city streets, causing discomfort and accidents in traffic and littering the aesthetic image of Iquitos. Several &quot;iquiteños&quot; citizens criticized it via Twitter.

=== Spanish accent ===
Iquitos is also attractive for its Amazonic Spanish, a dialect of Spanish spoken in the Amazon. The dialect is more noticeable in speech than it is in writing, such as [f] and [x] are allophones, (e.g., Juana is pronounced /fana/), especially when it is next to one or semivowel. (&quot;Los fríos de San Juan&quot;; &quot;Los fríos de San Fän&quot;), the double preposing and possessive genitive (De Antonio sus amigos; From Antonio his friends), and the preemption of articles against the names (&quot;Juana&quot;, &quot;Lä Fuana&quot;). There are also other languages spoken as Iquito, Yagua, Ese Ejja, or other native languages in Loreto, and foreign languages like English and French because of increasing globalization.

=== Cuisine ===
Juane is one of the main dishes of cuisine of the Peruvian jungle. It is widely consumed during the Catholic Feast of San Juan (St. John), held on 24 June each year. The dish was named in honor of San Juan Bautista. The dish could have a pre-Columbian origin. With the arrival of the Spanish, missionaries popularized the Biblical story of Salome, John, and Herodias. Some believe the dish&#x27;s name comes from the reference to the head of San Juan.

 Another popular dish is Tacacho, made from fried slices of plaintain mashed with chicharrones (fried pork fat). It is usually accompanied with chorizo (fried sausage) making it a savory combination. The dish is typical of Iquitos as well as the Peruvian Amazon. It is widespread in the rest of the country. The term &quot;tacacho&quot; derives from the Quechua term, &quot;taka chu&quot;, which means beaten. Tacacho consumption varies depending on the region where it is made. In Madre de Dios and San Martín, many people eat tacachos for breakfast, while in other regions, it is a dish served at lunch or dinner. In the San Martín region, tacacho is included in the Christmas dinner. In the Amazon region of Ecuador, the dish is known as &quot;bolon&quot;. It has a counterpart in the Caribbean islands, where it is called &quot;mofongo&quot;.

<text>Bonnie A. Nardi is an emeritus professor of the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, where she led the TechDec research lab in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction and computer-supported cooperative work. She is well known for her work on activity theory, interaction design, games, social media, and society and technology. She was elected to the ACM CHI academy in 2013. She retired in 2018.

==Work==

Prior to teaching at the University of California, Nardi worked at AT&amp;T Labs, Agilent, Hewlett-Packard and Apple labs. She is among anthropologists who have been employed by high-tech companies to examine consumers&#x27; behavior in their homes and offices.

Nardi collaborated with Victor Kaptelinin to write &quot;Acting with Technology: Activity Theory and Interaction Design&quot; (2009) and &quot;Activity Theory in HCI: Fundamentals and Reflections&quot; (2012). These works discuss activity theory and offer a basis for understanding our relationship with technology.

==Interests==

Her interests are in the areas of human-computer interaction, computer supported cooperative work, more specifically in activity theory, computer-mediated communication, and interaction design. Nardi has researched CSCW applications and blogging, and pioneered the study of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; in HCI. She has studied the use of technology in offices, hospitals, schools, libraries and laboratories. 

She is widely known among librarians – especially research, reference and digital librarians – for Chapter 7 of Information Ecologies, which focused on librarians as keystone species in information ecologies. Nardi&#x27;s book inspired the title of a UK conference &quot;Information Ecologies: the impact of new information &#x27;species&quot;&#x27; hosted, &quot;inter alia&quot;, by the UK Office of Library Networking, now known by its acronym UKOLN, and led to a keynote address by Nardi at a 1998 Library of Congress Institute on &quot;Reference Service in a Digital Age&quot;. She had written &quot;Information Ecologies&quot; while a researcher at ATT Labs Research.

Nardi&#x27;s self-described theoretical orientation is &quot;activity theory&quot; – aka Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) -, a philosophical framework developed by the Russian psychologists Vygotsky, Luria, Leont&#x27;ev, and their students. &quot;My interests are user interface design, collaborative work, computer-mediated communication, and theoretical approaches to technology design and evaluation.&quot;

According to Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn&#x27;s &quot;Wastebook 2010&quot;, Nardi received a $100,000 grant to &quot;analyze and understand the ways in which players of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, a popular multiplayer game, engage in creative collaboration&quot;. In Coburn&#x27;s list of 100 supposedly-wasteful federal spending projects, Nardi&#x27;s project came in at number 6, with Coburn&#x27;s report saying, &quot;Most people have to work for a living, others get to play video games.&quot;

Nardi&#x27;s &quot;My Life as a Night Elf Priest&quot; is one of the best known ethnographies of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

==Background==

Nardi received her undergraduate degree from University of California at Berkeley and her PhD from the School of Social Sciences at University of California, Irvine. Nardi also spent a year in Western Samoa doing postdoctoral research.

<doc id="600744" wikidata="Q371" url="?curid=600744" title="!!!">
<text>!!! ( ), also known as Chk Chk Chk, is an American band from Sacramento, California. 
Formed in 1996 by lead singer Nic Offer, members of !!! came from other local bands such as the Yah Mos, Black Liquorice and Pope Smashers. They are currently based in New York City. The band&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;Let It Be Blue&quot;, was released in May 2022.

==Background and history==
!!! was formed in the fall of 1996 by the merger of members of the groups Black Liquorice and Pope Smashers, while on tour. After a successful joint tour, the two bands decided to mix the disco-funk with more aggressive sounds and integrate the hardcore singer Nic Offer from the Yah Mos. Offer has cited Depeche Mode and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) as influences.

The band&#x27;s name was inspired by the subtitles of the movie &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, in which the clicking sounds of the San people&#x27;s Juǀʼhoan language were represented as &quot;!&quot;. However, as the bandmembers themselves say, !!! is pronounced by repeating thrice any monosyllabic sound. &quot;Chk Chk Chk&quot; is the most common pronunciation, and the URL of their official website and the title of their Myspace page suggest it is the preferred pronunciation.

The band&#x27;s full-length debut record came out in 2000 as a self-titled album on the label Gold Standard Laboratories. This was followed in 2003 by the single &quot;Me and Giuliani Down By the School Yard&quot;, a lengthy track combining house beats with sinewy basslines, psychedelic guitars, and simple lyrics which quote the title song of the musical &quot;Footloose&quot;.

A second full-length, &quot;Louden Up Now&quot;, was released on Touch and Go in America and on Warp Records in Europe in June 2004. In June 2005 !!! released a new EP covering &quot;Take Ecstasy with Me&quot; by The Magnetic Fields, and &quot;Get Up&quot; by Nate Dogg. The following December, the original drummer for the band, Mikel Gius, was struck and killed by a car while riding his bike.

They released their third album, &quot;Myth Takes&quot; in 2007.

!!! is composed of Mario Andreoni (guitar), Dan Gorman (horns/percussion/keys), Nic Offer (vocals), Rafael Cohen (bass/various electronic devices), Chris Egan (drums) and Meah Pace (vocals).

Vocalist and drummer John Pugh officially left the band in July 2007 to concentrate on his new band Free Blood.
Vocalist Shannon Funchess stood in for Pugh during much of their 2007 tour. The band also shared membership with the similar, defunct group Out Hud (including Tyler Pope, who has played with LCD Soundsystem and written music for Cake).

<doc id="600745" wikidata="Q696074" url="?curid=600745" title="Juliaca">
<text>Juliaca (; Quechua and ) is the capital of San Román Province in the Puno Region of southeastern Peru. It is the region&#x27;s largest city with a population of 276,110 inhabitants (2017). On the Altiplano, Juliaca is above sea level, is located on the Collao Plateau and is northwest of Lake Titicaca (45 km), nearChachas Lake, the Maravillas river, and near the ruins of Sillustani. It is the largest trade center in the Puno region.

The city hosts Carnaval Juliaca each year between February and March. During this very popular event participants, dressed in colorful costumes, gather on the streets to dance in the style of the Collao Plateau. Saint Sebastian&#x27;s feast is celebrated on 20 January of every year.

Juliaca&#x27;s citizens rely on cars, trains, and bicycles. It is a major transit point in the region and has strong ties with Peru&#x27;s southern cities, including Arequipa, Puno, Tacna, Cuzco, Ilo, and with La Rinconada and Bolivia.

Like Chicago, Illinois, it is nicknamed &quot;The Windy City&quot;, in its case, because of the city&#x27;s location on the windy Collao Plateau. It is also called the &quot;Sock City&quot; or &quot;Knitting City&quot; because Juliaca was a major center of sock, sweater, and handicraft production. Now the production of clothes, wool and fabrics are industrial processes.

==Etymology==
The historian Ramon Rios argues that Juliaca comes from the Quechua words &quot;Xullaskca kaipi&quot; (it had drizzled) in allusion that when the Inca troops arrived at this part of the Altiplano chasing the &quot;collas&quot;, they noticed that in the Huaynarroque hill it had drizzled.

However, Justo Ruelas affirms that Juliaca comes from the Quechua word &quot;Shulla Qaqa&quot; (roquedal dew), due to the fact that in the vicinity of the Huaynarroque and Santa Cruz hills, small quartz particles can be seen, which resembles the morning dew that falls on rocks.

==History==
===Pre-Spanish arrival===
The Altiplano was inhabited from around 4,000 BC by sedentary communities dedicated to agriculture and livestock (llamas and guinea pigs).

The Uros settled in the river towns, taking advantage of the benefits of the totora and the fish of Lake Titicaca, settled in the surrounding lakes: Chacas, Qoriwata, Cochapampa, and the Juliaca River, today Coata River.

The constitution of these settlers were registered as &quot;Uros de Coata&quot; and &quot;Uros de Desaguadero&quot;, from where the Uros of Coata would be better communicated and related to Juliaca, by the river that linked them, also these riverine settlers developed a sailing technique, on rafts made of totora, fastened with yarned ropes based on the ichus, which would serve as support for fishing, and at times, of transport from Lake Titicaca to the smaller lakes that were between the territories of Juliaca.

Between the years 1000 to 500 BC, Juliaca flourished under the influence of Qaluyo (ancient settlement), in the place of Qomer Moqo (Taparachi). Archaeologists discovered a small village dating back to this time, whose settlers were fed with potatoes, quinoa, kañiwa, carachi, guinea pig, among others. They were the first builders of waruwarus and developed a special textile industry.

In the years 200 BC to 200 AD, the domain of the Pukara culture expanded in this region of the highlands. Between the third and fourth centuries, the Huaynarroque tribe flourished. Subsequently, the hegemony of Tiahuanaco, Colla and Inka arises consecutively. The kollas and Inka were ruthless rivals and only under the military command of Pachacútec and his son Mayta Capac were able to subdue the brave Sapana, Chuchicápac and Huaynarroque tribes after bloody wars of conquest.

=== Viceroyalty ===
During the viceregal period, Juliaca was a Repartimiento. An important document is the one that organizes the Corregimiento del Collao (later the Corregimiento of Lampa or Cabana) and dates from June 23, 1565, signed by Lope García de Castro. There, Juliaca is recorded as a Repartimiento entrusted to Don Diego Hernández.

There is information about certain historical books found in the parish archive of the Santa Catalina Mother Church that testifies to the Spanish foundation of Juliaca, whose name was: Pueblo de Santa Catalina de Juliaca

During the events of Laykakota, which shook the stability of the Viceroyalty and led to the arrival of the Viceroy Count of Lemos in 1668, Juliaca was the headquarters of the rebels, the Salcedo brothers. Also during the liberation struggle of Túpac Amaru II, it is worth mentioning Colonel Juan Cahuapaza, who as chief of Juliaca fought in the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II.

=== Republican era ===

At the beginning of the republican period, Juliaca had a rural layout, until the railway station was installed in 1873, which revolutionized the economic and social panorama of the Altiplano, with the presence not only of technology, but of visionary people from Europe, and other cities of Peru.

At the end of the 19th century, Juliaca had a more urban profile. Thus, its citizens focused on elevating Juliaca to a higher category; urban, social and economic growth justified it.

===21st century===

Within the framework of the Peruvian protests (2022–2023) in the country against the Government of Dina Boluarte and on the sixth day of an indefinite strike, there is a fierce police repression against the protesters that left at least 17 dead and 73 injured according to reports from the MINSA. Most of the deaths occur in the vicinity of the Inca Manco Capac Airport, a place that has become a main point and objective during the last days of the strike. Two days later, there is a massive deployment of the Juliaqueña population carrying the coffins of the fallen on their shoulders while the population declares 3 days of mourning by raising black flags or at half-mast in their homes. This event has been known as the Juliaca massacre.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
The city of Juliaca is located in the northern part of the San Román province and on the northwest side of Lake Titicaca and 35 km from it. The geographical area of the Juliaca district occupies the central part of the department of Puno and the Collao plateau. Due to its geoeconomic importance, in 1926 Juliaca was integrated into the Province of San Román as its capital.

===Climate===
Juliaca has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb/Cwc&quot;) bordering on an alpine tundra climate (&quot;ETH&quot;) with cool to cold temperatures most of the year. The average annual precipitation is . Winters are dry with freezing nights and mornings, and pleasant afternoon temperatures.

==Economy==
Juliaca is a large trade center for goods and services, and is considered the financial capital of the Puno region. Trade is its principal economic activity, comprising 26.5% of the Labor force. In 2008, Juliaca had 15,439 commercial establishments, which amounts to 41% of trade done in the Puno region. It is the commercial hub for the La Rinconada high-altitude city of informal gold mining.

The city of Juliaca has become a center of capital investment. As a result, poverty has been reduced, and increased per capita income has come to some of its residents.

== Monuments and places of interest ==
The city of Juliaca and its surroundings have various natural and historical tourist attractions, among the most outstanding are: The Santa Catalina church, Waynaruqi hill, Chacas lagoon and the Kokan community.

=== Santa Catalina Church ===
Located in the Plaza de Armas, it has an indigenous baroque architectural style. The start of its construction dates back to 1649, started by the Jesuits; however it was not completed until 125 years later. Proof of this is its only bell tower, built entirely with ashlar brought from the quarries of Arequipa. It is currently under the command of the Franciscan Order.

=== La Merced Church ===
This church is a beautiful work of architecture from the time of the republic. It is located in the west wing of the Plaza Bolognesi in the city center. Carved out of red limestone (due to its characteristic color) and with a structure typical of the modern era (iron frame). Like the main Church of Santa Catalina, it only has a bell tower arranged symmetrically unlike the previous one, and it also features a clock with four circular faces. Its construction is due to a group of faithful devotees who commissioned the construction from Don Gregorio Layme. It was inaugurated in 1959 and renovated in 1995, where they included indigenous elements.

=== Franciscan Convent ===
Also called Convent of &quot; Santa Bárbara &quot;. It is a four-level building built on the hill &quot; Hatun Rumi &quot; or &quot; Santa Bárbara &quot; (Spanish name), 40 m from the Plaza de Armas de Juliaca, it presents a style essentially Romanesque

Due to its importance during the republican era, today it constitutes one of the main tourist attractions of the city.

=== Waynaruqi hill ===
Located in a southeast of the Plaza de Armas, on the top of the hill Waynaruqi. The White Christ, made entirely in concrete and fiberglass, stands out on the horizon of Juliaca. At the foot of the monument is a viewpoint, from which it is possible to see the urban and non-urban areas that comprise the city. The complex was built in just two and a half weeks, and was opened in 1987.

=== Las Calceteras Gallery ===
It is a three-floor building, located in the north wing of the Plaza Bolognesi. It is a shopping center for handicrafts, where all kinds of clothing are sold (socks, chullos, bootees, shawls, sweaters, rugs, gloves, etc.) woven or manufactured with native materials (llama, alpaca, vicuña ), the visitor can also visualize the handwork done by the artisan ladies with their typical clothing (called hosiery), in different types of wool and fiber, highly appreciated in the international market.

=== Chacas Lagoon ===
Located 10 km northwest of the city of Juliaca, in the area corresponding to the towns of Kokan and Chacas. It is a lagoon surrounded by vast hills, like the Iquinito (which is the highest in the area), the lagoon has a fusiform shape and an area of approximately 6.2 km 2 .

<text>The Straits of Mackinac ( ; ) are the short waterways between the U.S. state of Michigan&#x27;s Upper and Lower Peninsulas, traversed by the Mackinac Bridge. The main strait is wide with a maximum depth of , and connects the Great Lakes of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Given the large size and configuration of the straits, hydrologically, the two connected lakes are one body of water, studied as Lake Michigan–Huron. Historically, the native Odawa people called the region around the Straits Michilimackinac.

Three islands form the eastern edge of the Straits of Mackinac; two are populated—Bois Blanc Island and Mackinac Island, while the third, Round Island, is uninhabited and a designated wilderness area. The Straits of Mackinac are major shipping lanes, providing passage for raw materials and finished goods and connecting, for instance, the iron mines of Minnesota to the steel mills of Gary, Indiana. Before the railroads reached Chicago from the east, most immigrants arrived in the Midwest and Great Plains by ships on the Great Lakes. The straits are five miles (8 km) wide at their narrowest point, where they are spanned by the Mackinac Bridge. Before the bridge was built, car ferries transported vehicles across the straits. Today passenger-only ferries carry people to Mackinac Island, which does not permit cars. Visitors can take their vehicles on a car ferry to Bois Blanc Island.


The straits are shallow and narrow enough to freeze over in the winter. Navigation is ensured for year-round shipping to the Lower Great Lakes by the use of icebreakers.

The straits were an important Native American and fur trade route. The Straits of Mackinac are named after Mackinac Island. The local Ojibwe Native Americans in the Straits of Mackinac region likened the shape of the island to that of a turtle, so they named the island &quot;Mitchimakinak&quot;, meaning &quot;Big Turtle&quot;. When the British explored the area, they shortened the name to its present form: &quot;Mackinac.&quot;

Located on the southern side of the straits is the town of Mackinaw City, the site of Fort Michilimackinac, a reconstructed French fort founded in 1715, and on the northern side is St. Ignace, site of a French Catholic mission to the Indians, founded in 1671. The eastern end of the straits was controlled by Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island, a British colonial and early American military base and fur trade center, founded in 1781.

==History==

A French Catholic mission to the Indians was founded at St. Ignace in 1671. In 1715, Fort Michilimackinac was built by the French on the south end of the straits&#x27; narrow. Michilimackinac was replaced in 1781 by a British fort, Fort Mackinac, on Mackinac Island.

Enbridge Line 5 was built in 1953 as an extension of the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company line west of the iconic Mackinac Bridge, bringing oil from Alberta to Lake Superior. On December 12, 2018, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder signed a bill establishing the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority and appointed its first members.

==Today==

The straits are patrolled by a detachment of the United States Coast Guard based at Graham Point, St. Ignace. A shipping channel through the winter ice is maintained by the Coast Guard&#x27;s Great Lakes icebreaker, USCGC &quot;Mackinaw&quot;, based in Cheboygan near the eastern edge of the Straits. This vessel went into service during the 2005/06 ice season.
Two ferry companies operate out of Mackinaw City and St. Ignace, connecting tourists and commuters to Mackinac Island: Shepler&#x27;s Ferry and the Star Line Ferry.
Most of the Straits have been set aside by the state of Michigan as the Straits of Mackinac Shipwreck Preserve, a riparian public space dedicated to those personnel who were lost aboard the boats and ships that sank in these dangerous shipping lanes.

Lighthouses in the Straits of Mackinac include:
*The McGulpin Point Light, on McGulpin Point, west of Fort Michilimackinac.
*The Old Mackinac Point Light, in Mackinaw City, which is open to the public.
*The Round Island Light on Round Island, which is not open to the public but which can be viewed from the Mackinac Island ferry channel.


==Enbridge pipeline==

West of the iconic Mackinac Bridge is Enbridge&#x27;s pipeline, called Enbridge Line 5, which was built in 1953 as an extension of the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company line bringing oil from Alberta to Lake Superior. The 1953 pipeline enters the Straits of Mackinac water on the north shore at St. Ignace, Michigan and lies along the bottom of the Straits which is nearly in places. By 2013 Enbridge had increased the &quot;maximum capacity on the lines to per day&quot;. In selling the idea of the pipeline to residents living near the Straits, the pipeline developers claimed, it was &quot;essential to the defense of the United States and the whole North American continent&quot;. A University of Michigan study studied the risks of a leak, leading to experts and local governments calling for the shutdown of the pipeline.

In late June 2019, the state of Michigan filed a lawsuit asking the Ingham County Court to compel the decommissioning of the segment of Line 5 that runs under the Straits of Mackinac. A Reuters news report defined Line 5 as &quot;a critical part of Enbridge’s Mainline network, which delivers the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States&quot;. The basis of the suit is the claim that the pipeline is a public nuisance and violates the Michigan Environmental Protection Act since it may become the source of pollution. The news report adds that &quot;it is unclear if Line 5 could operate without the Straits segment&quot;.

==Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority==
On December 12, 2018, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder signed a bill establishing the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority, which is charged with overseeing the construction and operation of a tunnel to hold a new Enbridge Line 5 under the lake bed in the straits. Snyder also appointed its first members: Geno Alessandrini of Iron Mountain, Anthony England of Ypsilanti, and Michael Zimmer of Dimondale, who serve six-year terms.

<doc id="600765" wikidata="Q3080207" url="?curid=600765" title="Lockheed MC-130">
<text>The Lockheed MC-130 is the basic designation for a family of special mission aircraft operated by the United States Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), a wing of the Air Education and Training Command, and an AFSOC-gained wing of the Air Force Reserve Command. Based on the Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport, the MC-130s&#x27; missions are the infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply of special operations forces, and the air refueling of (primarily) special operations helicopter and tilt-rotor aircraft.

The first of the variants, the MC-130E, was developed to support clandestine special operations missions during the Vietnam War. Eighteen were created by modifying C-130E transports, and four lost through attrition, but the remainder served more than four decades after their initial modification. An update, the MC-130H Combat Talon II, was developed in the 1980s from the C-130H and went into service in the 1990s. Four of the original 24 H-series aircraft have been lost in operations.

The Combat Shadows were built during the Vietnam War for search and rescue operations and repurposed in the 1980s as AFSOC air-refueling tankers; the last of the 24 retired in 2015.

The Combat Spear was developed in 2006 as an inexpensive version of the Combat Talon II but was reconfigured and designated the AC-130W Stinger II in 2012.

The MC-130J, which became operational in 2011, is the new-production variant that is replacing the other special operations MC-130s. As of 2023, the Air Force has taken delivery of 57 MC-130J models. The final MC-130J produced was delivered to USAF in January 2025.

==MC-130E Combat Talon==

===Development===
The Combat Talon was developed between December 1964 and January 1967 by Lockheed Air Services (LAS) at Ontario, California, as the result of a study by &quot;Big Safari&quot;, the USAF&#x27;s program office that modifies and sustains special mission aircraft. Two highly classified testbed aircraft (originally serial no. &quot;64-0506&quot; and &quot;-0507&quot;, but with all numbers &quot;sanitized&quot; from the aircraft), were assigned to Project &quot;Thin Slice&quot; to develop a low-level clandestine penetration aircraft for Special Forces operations in Southeast Asia. In 1964, Lockheed was ordered to adapt the C-130Es after six C-123B Providers modified for &quot;unconventional warfare&quot; under Project &quot;Duck Hook&quot; proved inadequate for the new MACV-SOG. The modifications under &quot;Thin Slice&quot; and its August 1966 successor &quot;Heavy Chain&quot; were code-named &quot;Rivet Yard&quot;, and the four C-130Es came to be known as &quot;Yards&quot;. Discrete modification tests were conducted by the 1198th Operational Evaluation and Training Squadron, out of Area II of Norton AFB at San Bernardino, California, 30 miles east of Ontario.
As the &quot;Thin Slice&quot; aircraft were being developed, 14 C-130Es were purchased for SOG in 1965 for similar modification. The first aircraft were production C-130Es without specialized equipment that were produced at Lockheed&#x27;s facility in Marietta, Georgia. Three production airplanes per month were given the Fulton STARS (then ARS) system. While awaiting the ARS equipment, the C-130s were ferried to Greenville, Texas, for painting by Ling-Temco-Vought Electrosystems with a low-radar reflective paint that added 168 kg (370 lbs) to their weight. The velvet black-and-green scheme drew the nickname &quot;Blackbirds&quot;. As installation was completed, the Blackbirds were returned to Ontario for installation of the electronics package, code-named &quot;Rivet Clamp&quot;. The modified aircraft became known as &quot;Clamps&quot; (two of the original 14, &quot;64–0564&quot; and &quot;-0565&quot;, were diverted to &quot;Heavy Chain&quot; in August 1966). The aircraft collectively were assigned the designation &quot;Combat Talon&quot; in 1967.

The Fulton surface-to-air recovery system was used to extract personnel and materials via air. A large helium balloon raised a nylon lift line into the air, which was snagged by a large scissors-shaped yoke attached to the nose of the plane. The yoke snagged the line and released the balloon, yanking the attached cargo off the ground with a shock less than that of an opening parachute. A sky anchor secured the line and wires stretched from the nose to both leading wing tip edges protected the propellers from the line on missed snag attempts. Crew members hooked the snagged line as it trailed behind and attached it to the hydraulic winch, pulling the attached person or cargo into the plane through the rear cargo door.

Following a death on 26 April 1982, at CFB Lahr, Germany, the Fulton STARS system on the Clamp aircraft underwent intense maintenance scrutiny and employment of the system for live pickups was suspended. A major effort at upgrading the system, &quot;Project 46&quot;, was pursued from 1986 to 1989, but at its conclusion, use of the STARS system for live extractions remained suspended. The Fulton STARS equipment of all Combat Talons was removed during 1998.

&quot;Rivet Clamp&quot; installation began with four STARS-equipped C-130s completed by March 1966, followed by installations in eight further aircraft in July 1966 and January 1967. The &quot;Rivet Clamp&quot;s, originally designated C-130E(I)sp, were equipped with an electronic and infrared (IR) countermeasures suite; and the SPR2 later the AN/APQ-115 TF/TA multimode radar. This radar, adapted from the Texas Instruments AN/APQ-99 radar used in the RF-4C Phantom photo reconnaissance aircraft, featured terrain following/terrain-avoidance (TF/TA) and mapping radar modes, to enable it to operate at low altitudes at night and in all weather conditions and avoid known enemy radar and anti-aircraft weapons concentrations.

Beginning in 1970, Texas Instruments and Lockheed Air Service worked to adapt the existing AN/APQ-122 Adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System (AWADS) with terrain following/terrain avoidance modes to replace the original APQ-115, which suffered throughout its life with an unacceptably adverse mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) rate. In 1970 they succeeded, and coupled the APQ-122 with the Litton LN-15J Inertial Navigation System (INS). Known as MOD-70, the modified radar was installed in all 12 operational Combat Talons and the four &quot;Heavy Chain&quot; test beds between 1971 and 1973. The system proved so successful that it continued in service until the late 1980s. Following the completion of MOD-70, the Combat Talons were divided into three designations: C-130E(CT) for the &quot;Clamp&quot; aircraft, C-130E(Y) for the &quot;Yank&quot; (formerly &quot;Yard&quot;) Talons, and C-130E(S) for the &quot;Swap&quot;. The Combat Talon I designations were consolidated in 1977 as the MC-130 and have remained under that designation since. The Combat Talon became the &quot;Combat Talon I&quot; in 1984 with the authorization for the modification of 24 C-130Hs to Combat Talon II specifications.

The &quot;Yank&quot; Talons conducted top secret operations worldwide, under the project name &quot;Combat Sam&quot;, until late 1972. Two of the original &quot;Clamps&quot; were lost in combat in Southeast Asia and were replaced by two C-130Es (64-0571 and −0572). These remained as Combat Talons until 1972, when &quot;Heavy Chain&quot; was gradually discontinued and its four &quot;Yank&quot; aircraft were integrated into the Combat Talon force. The two original &quot;Thin Slice&quot; aircraft were given the serials of two destroyed C-130s, &quot;62-1843&quot; and &quot;63-7785&quot; respectively, to disguise their classified origins. The replacements had their modifications removed and returned to airlift duties, although known as &quot;Swaps&quot;, they remained available for future Combat Talon use. Both eventually became Combat Talons again after further losses in the Combat Talon inventory.

Capability to act as a Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) for helicopters on the ground was begun in 1980 in preparation for &quot;Operation Eagle Claw&quot; (see below), although only one system could be installed before the mission was executed. The refueling system consists of two palletized 6,800 L (1,800 gal) tanks (known as Benson tanks) mounted on rails within the Talon that tie into the C-130&#x27;s own pressurized fuel dumping pumps and require no further equipment.

A major modification between 1986 and 1994, MOD-90, modernized the capability and serviceability of the Talon I to extend its service life. All 14 Combat Talon Is were equipped with upgraded navigational radars, an enhanced electronic warfare suite and provided new outer wings. By 1995 all Combat Talon Is were equipped with helicopter-air refueling pods.

===Southeast Asia operations===
The aircraft received for modification as Combat Talons were assigned in July 1965 to the 464th Troop Carrier Wing at Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina. Because of a lack of ramp space caused by the buildup of forces for deployment to South Vietnam, they were temporarily housed at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee. The wing&#x27;s 779th TCS was designated as the training squadron for the modified C-130E(I)s, under Project &quot;Skyhook&quot;, in addition to its normal airlift function. Selected crew members received instructor training in their respective systems and returned to Pope by 1 May to begin crew training of six crews for deployment to Vietnam under Project &quot;Stray Goose&quot;.
The Combat Talon I first saw operational action in the Vietnam War, beginning 1 September 1966. The six &quot;Stray Goose&quot; crews deployed to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan, and forward deployed to Nha Trang Air Base, South Vietnam. The deployment, known as &quot;Combat Spear&quot;, preceded operational deployment of other Combat Talons to Europe (&quot;Combat Arrow&quot;) and the United States (&quot;Combat Knife&quot;).

&quot;Combat Spear&quot; was administratively assigned as Detachment 1, 314th Troop Carrier Wing, but was operationally controlled by MACV-SOG. On 9 October 2009, Detachment 1, 314th Troop Carrier Wing received the Presidential Unit Citation for its support of MACV-SOG activities. Chief of Staff of the Air Force General Norton A. Schwartz presented the award to the unit during a ceremony at Hurlburt Field, culminating a six-year campaign by former &quot;Stray Goose&quot; member Richard H. Sell to achieve the recognition after the unit was not included in a PUC awarded 4 April 2001, to MACV-SOG for the same period.

On 15 March 1968, the detachment was designated the 15th Air Commando Squadron, and then the 15th Special Operations Squadron on 1 August 1968, and made part of the 14th Special Operations Wing. In Vietnam, the aircraft was used to drop leaflets over North Vietnamese positions, and to insert and resupply special forces and indigenous units into hostile territory throughout Southeast Asia. Combat Talon crews operated unescorted at low altitudes and at night.

By 1970 twelve Combat Talons were operational in three units of four aircraft each:
* 7th Special Operations Squadron, Ramstein Air Base, Germany;
* 15th Special Operations Squadron, Nha Trang Air Base, South Vietnam; and
* Detachment 2, 1st Special Operations Wing, Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, (redesignated 318th SOS in 1971 and 8th SOS in 1974).

The 15th SOS was redesignated the 90th SOS on 23 October 1970, relocated to Cam Ranh Bay Air Base, then moved to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, in April 1972 as part of the drawdown of U.S. forces in Vietnam. It was again redesignated, becoming the 1st SOS on 15 December 1972, and began transition from the &quot;Clamp&quot; to the &quot;Yank&quot; variant.

====Kingpin====

Two Combat Talons were employed as navigation escorts and for airborne control during &quot;Operation Kingpin&quot;, the operational phase of the attempted rescue of prisoners of war from Son Tay prison camp in North Vietnam on 21 November 1970. 64-0523 was drawn from the 15th SOS at Nha Trang and 64-0558 from Det. 2, 1st SOW at Pope AFB. The aircraft were modified at LAS Ontario with installation of FL-2B FLIR sets borrowed from the &quot;Heavy Chain&quot; project to compensate for difficulties in terrain-following created by the slow speeds necessitated by the mixed aircraft force.

24 primary and five backup crew personnel, all &quot;Stray Goose&quot;/&quot;Combat Spear&quot; veterans detached from 7th SOS (&quot;Combat Arrow&quot;) and 1st SOW (&quot;Combat Knife&quot;), developed helicopter-fixed wing formation procedures for low level night missions and jointly trained with selected Special Forces volunteers at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Between the end of August and 28 September 1970, Talon, helicopter, and A-1 Skyraider crews supervised by Combat Talon Program Manager Lt. Col. Benjamin N. Kraljev rehearsed the flight profile in terrain-following missions over southern Alabama, flying 368 sorties that totalled more than 1,000 hours. A month of intensive joint training with the Special Forces rescue force followed at a replica of the prison camp.

In early November the task force deployed to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The 24 primary crew members, a 7th SOS crew (&quot;Cherry 01&quot;) under Major Irl L. &quot;Leon&quot; Franklin and a 1st SOW crew (&quot;Cherry 02&quot;) commanded by Lt Col Albert P. &quot;Friday&quot; Blosch, conducted the mission, which was successfully executed without loss of any personnel. However the operation failed when the prison was found not to contain any prisoners.

===Post-Vietnam developments===
In 1974 the Combat Talon program was nearly dismantled as the Air Force sought to reverse its Vietnam emphasis on special operations. The 1st Special Operations Wing was redesignated the 834th Tactical Composite Wing and its Combat Talons of the 8th SOS became a TAC asset. However the use of 1st SOS &quot;Yank&quot; Talons in a sea surveillance role off North Korea in 1975 revived interest in the Combat Talon, as did the Israeli hostage rescue at Entebbe Airport. The same year, a Combat Talon of the 1st Special Operations Wing was deployed in support of US Marines forces on Koh Tang island during the Mayaguez incident, dropping a single BLU-82 6,800 kg (15,000 lb) bomb to enable their extraction. However, as late as 1978–79, Air Force Special Operations Forces was still disregarded by many staff planners, who saw it as a drain on resources and not a force enabler, and wanted the entire Talon force transferred to the Air National Guard. In early 1977 the Combat Talon was redesignated &quot;MC-130E&quot; by Headquarters Air Force for all three variants of the aircraft.

By November 1979, the Combat Talon force of 14 MC-130Es was divided among three squadrons, the first two of which were operationally deployed, and the third at Hurlburt essentially the force training squadron:
* 1st Special Operations Squadron, Kadena Air Base, Okinawa – (four MC-130 Yanks);
* 7th Special Operations Squadron, Ramstein Air Base, Germany – (four MC-130 Clamps); and
* 8th Special Operations Squadron, Hurlburt Field, Florida – (six MC-130 Clamps).

====Eagle Claw====

Following the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran, on 4 November 1979, training operations for a rescue mission of the 53 hostages began as early as 7 November by Talon crews at Kadena AB, and 26 November by crews at Hurlburt. At that time only seven Combat Talons had the in-flight refueling capability necessary for the mission, which was to be mounted out of either Egypt or Diego Garcia (Masirah Island did not become available as a base until April 1980). All were assigned to the operation, a complex two-night plan called &quot;Eagle Claw&quot;. Talon crews using night vision goggles practiced blacked-out landings to insert Delta Force operators and U.S. Army Rangers deep into Iran, and developed several methods for delivering extra fuel for the US Navy RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopters chosen to carry out the rescued hostages. Four transcontinental, all-component, two-night rehearsals were held between December 1979 and March 1980, including a full-scale rehearsal 25–26 March that involved every element of the final plan except three EC-130s chosen to fly in fuel for the helicopters.

The four Talons (including a spare) of the 1st SOS staged to Masirah Island off the coast of Oman on 19 April 1980, to lead the Night One infiltration phase, while the three of the 8th SOS deployed to Wadi Qena, Egypt, on 21 April to lead the Night Two exfiltration phase. To establish a &quot;normal&quot; C-130 presence in Egypt, Talons of the 7th SOS (none of which had aerial refueling capability) conducted regular flights using Military Airlift Command call signs in and out of Wadi Qena between 2 January and 8 April 1980. They also used the deception to discreetly pre-position needed equipment, including ammunition for AC-130 gunships, at the staging base. The Talon crews also manned three borrowed EC-130E ABCCC aircraft configured to carry 68,100 L (18,000 U.S. gal) of jet fuel in six collapsible bladders for refueling the helicopters. After returning to Masirah, three of the 8th SOS Night One crews would be flown to Wadi Qena to carry out the Night Two mission.

The first phase of the rescue mission began the evening of 24 April, led by Lt Col Robert L. Brenci of the 8th SOS in Talon 64-0565, &quot;Dragon 1&quot;. The 1st SOS Talons successfully secured the forward operating location (&quot;Desert One&quot;) in the Iranian Desert, but the helicopter portion of the mission ended in disaster. Although the mission was an embarrassing failure costing eight lives, seven helicopters, and an EC-130E aircraft in a ground accident, the MC-130s performed nearly flawlessly. Planning initiatives for a second rescue attempt, under the project name &quot;Honey Badger&quot;, began two weeks after the failed raid and continued through November. Combat Talon participation in &quot;Honey Badger&quot; amounted largely to tactics development, but ECM improvements included chaff and flare dispensers and new ALR-69 threat receivers that improved its defensive countermeasures capability well beyond that existing prior to &quot;Eagle Claw&quot;.

====Urgent Fury====

Five Combat Talons of the 8th Special Operations Squadron participated in &quot;Operation Urgent Fury&quot;, the United States invasion of Grenada between 25 and 31 October 1983. Unlike previous operations that involved months of planning, training, and reconnaissance, the 8th SOS prepared in less than 72 hours after being alerted. Its assignment was to insert Rangers of the 1st and 2nd Ranger Battalions at night to capture Point Salines International Airport, defended by both Cuban and Grenadan troops, in the opening moments of the operation. The five Talons divided into three elements, two of them leading formations of Special Operations Low Level-equipped (SOLL) C-130 transports.

In clouds at above the sea and west of its objective, the lead Talon (64-0562) experienced a complete failure of its APQ-122 radar. Reorganization of the mission formations delayed the operation for 30 minutes, during which U.S. Marines made their amphibious landing. To compound the lack of surprise, the U.S. Department of State, apparently in a good faith but inept diplomatic gesture, contacted Cuban authorities and compromised the mission, further alerting the defenses, including a dozen ZU-23-2 antiaircraft guns. An AC-130 Spectre gunship, directed to observe the main runway for obstructions, reported it blocked by construction equipment and barricades. Loadmasters aboard the inbound Combat Talons reconfigured them for a parachute drop in less than thirty minutes.

Talon 64-0568, flown as &quot;Foxtrot 35&quot; by 8th SOS commander Lt Col James L. Hobson and with the commander of the Twenty-Third Air Force, Maj Gen William J. Mall, Jr., aboard as a passenger, combat-dropped runway clearing teams from the Ranger Battalions on the airport, despite being targeted by a searchlight and under heavy AAA fire. Two Spectre gunships suppressed the AAA so that the other Combat Talons and the SOLL C-130s could complete the parachute drop of the Rangers, with the only damage to the Talons being three hits by small arms fire to 64–0572. For his actions, Hobson was awarded the MacKay Trophy in 1984.

===Other Combat Talon operations===

====Just Cause====

Talons supported &quot;Operation Just Cause&quot;, the United States invasion of Panama in December 1989 and January 1990. Three MC-130Es of the 1st Special Operations Wing deployed to Hunter Army Air Field, Georgia within 48 hours of being alerted, then airlanded Rangers of the 2nd Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment into Rio Hato Military Airfield on 18 December 1989. The operation was conducted under total blackout conditions, using night vision goggles, 35 minutes after the opening parachute assault. One of the MC-130s had an engine disabled by a ground obstruction while taxiing, then made an NVG takeoff on three engines under intense ground fire, earning its pilot the Distinguished Flying Cross. The lead Talon, the only MC-130E equipped with the Benson tank refueling system, remained on the airfield as a Forward Area Refueling and Rearming Point (FARRP) for U.S. Army OH-6 helicopters. When Panamanian General Manuel Noriega surrendered on 3 January, he was immediately flown to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, by a Combat Talon.

====Desert Storm====

The 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq resulted in the deployment of four Combat Talons and six crews of the 8th SOS in August 1990 to King Fahd International Airport in Saudi Arabia as a component of &quot;Operation Desert Shield&quot;. During &quot;Operation Desert Storm&quot;, the combat phase of the Gulf War in January and February 1991, the Combat Talon performed one-third of all airdrops during the campaign, and participated in psychological operations, flying 15 leaflet-drop missions before and throughout the war. Combat Talon crews also conducted five BLU-82B &quot;Daisy Cutter&quot; missions during the two weeks preceding the onset of the ground campaign, dropping 11 bombs on Iraqi positions at night from altitudes between and , once in concert with a bombardment by the battleship USS &quot;Wisconsin&quot;.

Two 7th SOS Talons deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, as part of &quot;Operation Proven Force&quot;. They supported the first Joint Search and Rescue mission over Iraq, attempting to recover the crew of &quot;Corvette 03&quot;, a downed F-15E Strike Eagle. However permission from the Turkish government to fly the mission was delayed for 24 hours, and the crew was not recovered.

===Air Force Reserve Command===
On 6 October 1995, the Air Force began shifting the Combat Talon I force with the transfer of MC-130E, AF Ser. No. 64-0571, to the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 919th Special Operations Wing, 711th Special Operations Squadron, based at Duke Field (Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #3), Florida. The 919th had previously flown the AC-130A Spectre in the gunship / close air support mission, and the increasing age of the AC-130A aircraft necessitated their retirement.

Six MC-130E aircraft went to the 711th SOS over the next year for crew training, and the squadron became operational on 1 March 1997. On 5 March 1999, the 8th Special Operations Squadron became the first active force squadron to become an Associate Unit to an Air Reserve Component organization, co-located with the 711th SOS, but without aircraft of its own, flying those of the reserve unit. Ten of the Combat Talon Is were primary assigned aircraft (PAA), two were assigned to crew training, and two were placed in backup inventory aircraft (BIA) storage.

A Combat Talon I was the first aircraft to land at New Orleans International Airport after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. On 14 July 2006, the 8th SOS flew its last Combat Talon I mission and began conversion to the CV-22 Osprey, ending 41 years of active service for the MC-130E Combat Talon I. Although retired from the Regular Air Force, the MC-130E continued to remain in service with the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 919th Special Operations Wing.

===Retirement===
The MC-130E Combat Talon I has been replaced by the MC-130J Commando II, which has the capability to complete missions faster and more efficiently than its MC-130H Combat Talon II and MC-130P Combat Shadow counterparts. Recapitalization was a stated priority of Lt Gen Donald C. Wurster, former commander of Air Force Special Operations Command. Only eight MC-130E aircraft were still active in 2009, and four in 2013. On 15 April 2013, the four MC-130Es took off on their final mission. The MC-130E Combat Talon I was finally retired on 25 April 2013 in ceremonies at Duke Field. Three of the aircraft were then flown to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, while the fourth aircraft, AF Ser. No. 64-0523 (nicknamed &quot;Godfather&quot;) was flown to Cannon AFB, New Mexico on 22 June 2012, for eventual display at that base&#x27;s airpark. The retirement date marked the 33rd anniversary of the Desert One, the mission to free American hostages in Iran, of which several MC-130Es were a part.

==MC-130H Combat Talon II==

===Combat Talon II Development===

====Credible Sport====

One of the measures considered for a second hostage rescue attempt in Iran was a project to develop a &quot;Super STOL&quot; aircraft, to be flown by Combat Talon crews, that would use a soccer stadium near the US Embassy as an improvised landing field. Called &quot;Credible Sport&quot;, the project acquired three C-130H transports from an airlift unit in late August 1980, one as a test bed and two for the mission, and quickly modified them.

Designated the XFC-130H, the aircraft were fitted with 30 maneuvering rockets in five sets: eight firing forward to stop the aircraft, eight downward to slow its descent, eight rearward for takeoff assist, four on the wings to stabilize them during takeoff transition, and two at the rear of the tail to prevent it from striking the ground because of over-rotation. Other STOL features included a dorsal and two ventral fins on the rear fuselage, double-slotted flaps and extended ailerons, a new radome, a tailhook for landing aboard an aircraft carrier, and Combat Talon avionics, including a TF/TA radar, a defensive countermeasures suite, and a Doppler radar/GPS tie-in to the aircraft&#x27;s inertial navigation system.

Of the three aircraft, only one received full modification. The program abruptly ended when one crashed during testing on 29 October 1980; international events soon rendered another rescue attempt moot.

====Testing and delivery====

One of the two surviving &quot;Credible Sport&quot; airframes, 74-1686, became the &quot;YMC-130H&quot; test bed for the next generation of Combat Talons, under the project name &quot;Credible Sport II&quot;. Phase I testing, conducted between 24 August and 11 November 1981, identified design deficiencies in the airframe and determined that the &quot;Credible Sport&quot; configuration did not have the safety margins necessary for peacetime operations. Phase II testing began 15 June 1982, continued through October 1982, and determined that the final Combat Talon II configuration, with significant improvements in design, avionics, and equipment, was ready for production.

The initial purchase was authorized in 1982 at 12 aircraft, even though war-fighting requirements were estimated at more than 100, but was cut from funding until 1984. In 1983, USAF Special Operations Forces were transferred to the Military Airlift Command, seen as another move by USAF to divest itself of its special operations role. Creation of the 23rd Air Force reinforced that perception; SOF represented less than 35% of its personnel and virtually none of its headquarters staff, dominated by the &quot;rescue community&quot;. However, the moves did remove the Combat Talon program from three fighter-oriented commands to a single command where promotion cycles were more favorable.

In 1983, MAC established a Special Operations Force Master Plan that called for 21 Combat Talon IIs, including two attrition backups, with initial operational capability in the third quarter of 1987 and full delivery by 1991. The first Combat Talon II, 83-1212, was delivered in June 1984, but an earlier decision by USAF not to equip it with the navigational radar suite of the MC-130E slowed its development for years. In the meantime, Initiative 17, part of the &quot;31 Initiatives&quot; agreement between the Army and Air Force in May 1984, was deferred later that year (and eventually killed) after objections from members of Congress who saw it as a divestiture of the SOF role by the Air Force. As a result, the Air Force cut procurement of new HH-60D Nighthawk combat rescue aircraft from its budget requests—further delaying the Combat Talon II program, whose glass cockpit and integrated avionics systems were tied, for cost reasons, to those of the HH-60D.

Five Combat Talon IIs were delivered in 1985 but the problem of acquiring a navigation radar had not been resolved (the APQ-122 was no longer being built). IBM was contracted to develop a new terrain following/avoidance radar, who then subcontracted the task to Emerson Electric Company. The resulting radar performed so poorly that the Combat Talon II was nearly cancelled, but special operations advocates in Congress kept the program alive. Ultimately the AN/APQ-170(V)8 radar was developed into a system that exceeded specifications, but at a large cost overrun and with a further three-year delay in the Combat Talon II becoming operational. Deliveries in 1987, 1988, and 1989 brought the inventory to 18 aircraft, but all were still in modification, testing, or long term storage.

===Operations 1993–2000===
The first fully operational MC-130H Combat Talon II (87-0024) was received by the 8th SOS on 29 June 1991, with three others delivered over the summer. The official acceptance ceremony for the Talon II was held at Hurlburt in October, and by December 1991 the 8th SOS was equipped with six. The Combat Talon II features a stronger airframe and modifications to the rear and aft cargo doors. The electronics suite has been upgraded, and includes Global Positioning System navigation, special radars for navigating in adverse weather, and night vision goggles (NVG) capability. These new technologies allow the Combat Talon II to fly as low as above ground level (AGL) in inclement weather, and make faster, more accurate airdrops. The MC-130H Combat Talon II, like the MC-130E Combat Talon I, can perform a variety of mission profiles, from daytime mid-level overwater flight and Jumpmaster Directed (JMD) personnel airdrop to night-time adverse weather terrain-following flight in mountainous terrain supporting airdrop and airland to covert and clandestine objectives. Increases in automation reduced the aircrew by two and allowed the Combat Talon II to carry an additional pallet of cargo when compared to the Combat Talon I. Initial Operational capability was reached on 30 June 1993.

Three MC-130H Combat Talon IIs of the 7th SOS were deployed in December 1995 to deliver peacekeeping forces to Tuzla and Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of &quot;Operation Joint Endeavor&quot;, during which one Talon was hit by ground fire. The first combat deployment of a Combat Talon II was on 8 April 1996, during &quot;Operation Assured Response&quot;. Special operations forces were deployed to Liberia to assist in the evacuation of 2000 civilians from the American embassy when the country broke down into civil war. However orders to combat drop an 18-man SEAL team off Monrovia were rescinded and the mission landed in Sierra Leone. Similar circumstances brought the Combat Talon II to Zaire in 1997.

Talon II deployments for joint exercises in 1997 included Australia, Guam, Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand. In July 1997, three Talon IIs deployed to Thailand as part of &quot;Operation Bevel Edge&quot;, a proposed rescue of 1000 American citizens trapped in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, by a possible civil war, but the crisis ended when the Cambodian government allowed all non-citizens who desired so to leave by commercial air. A 7th SOS Combat Talon II aircrew, &quot;Whiskey 05&quot;, earned the Mackay Trophy for an embassy evacuation mission in the Republic of the Congo in June 1997. The crew rescued thirty Americans and twenty-six foreign nationals, and logged twenty-one hours of flight time.

Full Operational Capability for the Talon II was reached in February 2000. At that time 24 MC-130Hs were deployed to four squadrons:
* 15th Special Operations Squadron, eleven at Hurlburt Field, Florida;
* 1st Special Operations Squadron, five at Kadena AB, Okinawa;
* 7th Special Operations Squadron, five at RAF Mildenhall, U.K.; and
* 550th Special Operations Squadron, three at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico.

===Operations in Southwest Asia===

====Afghanistan====
On the night of 19–20 October 2001, four Combat Talon IIs infiltrated a task force of 199 Rangers of the 3rd Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment and tactical PSYOP teams 658 miles inside Taliban-held Afghanistan. The force dropped onto &quot;Objective Rhino&quot; (), an unused airfield in Kandahar Province southwest of Kandahar, to secure a landing zone as a temporary operating base for Special Forces units conducting raids in the vicinity.

A month later, two MC-130Hs, flying from Masirah Island, inserted a platoon of U.S. Navy SEAL Team Three and four Humvee vehicles to within ten miles of the same airfield on the night of 20–21 November. The SEAL platoon was inserted to establish an observation post at the airstrip, then assist two USAF combat controllers inserted by military free fall in preparing a landing zone for the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The 15th MEU landed in CH-53 helicopters on 25 November 2001, and established Camp Rhino, the first forward operating base in Afghanistan for United States forces.

Combat Talon IIs of the 7th SOS, augmented by crews from the 15th and 550th SOSs, flew 13- to 15-hour airdrop and airlanding night resupply missions from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, to Special Forces Operational Detachments-Alpha (ODAs) in Afghanistan during the opening phase of &quot;Operation Enduring Freedom&quot; in December 2001. Operating in mountainous terrain, they innovated an airdrop tactic by replicating maximum-effort landing techniques to rapidly descend from to AGL to ensure accurate gravity drops after clearing high ridgelines into deep valleys.

====Iraq====

The 7th SOS, commanded by Lt Col Mark B. Alsid and part of the 352d Special Operations Group, received the Gallant Unit Citation in 2006 for operations conducted during Operation Iraqi Freedom between 12 February and 12 May 2003. The 7th SOS was tasked to Joint Special Operations Task Force – North, known as Task Force Viking, whose objective was to hold 13 Iraqi Army divisions along the &quot;Green Line&quot; in northeastern Iraq to prevent those divisions from reinforcing other Iraqi operations against United States forces invading from Kuwait. Forward-based at Constanţa, Romania, its primary mission was to infiltrate the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Army&#x27;s 10th Special Forces Group and the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Special Forces Group into Kurdish-held territory in preparation for Operation Northern Delay. Denied permission by Turkey to fly into Iraq from its airspace, the 7th SOS flew the first 280 troops on a circuitous path around Turkey to a base in Jordan on 20–21 March 2003.

On 22 March, six Combat Talon IIs (four from the 7th SOS) infiltrated 16 ODAs, four ODBs, battalion command elements, and Air Force Combat Control Teams to complete the fifteen-hour mission, the longest in U.S. Special Operations history. The insertion profile consisted of a four and one-half-hour low level flight at night through western and northern Iraq to Bashur and Sulaymaniyah airfields, often taking heavy ground fire from the integrated air defenses. The Talon IIs, at emergency gross weight limits, operated blacked-out, employed chaff and electronic countermeasures, flew as low as AGL, and carried their troops tethered to the floor of the cargo holds. Three of the Talons were battle-damaged, with one forced to seek permission to land at Incirlik Air Base. The operation became known informally as &quot;Operation Ugly Baby&quot;. Major Jason L. Hanover was individually honored for commanding a mission that seized two austere airstrips during the operation. After airlanding their troops, the Talon IIs then had to fly back through the alerted defenses to recover to their launching point.

Overflight permission was granted by Turkey on 23 March, and the Combat Talon IIs delivered a total of 50 ODAs into Iraq. The Talon IIs then resupplied Task Force Viking, assisted in operations to capture Kirkuk and Mosul, airlanded supplies at remote outposts using Internal Airlift Slingable Container Units (ISUs), and acted as pathfinders for conventional C-130 airlift missions.

=== MC-130H Retirement ===
On April 2, 2023, the United States Air Force retired its last MC-130H Combat Talon II, tail number 89-0280, after delivering the aircraft to the &quot;Boneyard&quot; at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The retirement of the aircraft was witnessed by members of the Talon community, including former crew members and their families, who gathered at Hurlburt Field to see the plane take off for the last time.

The MC-130H was a special operations aircraft that had been in service for more than three decades, performing a variety of missions including infiltration, exfiltration, resupply of special operations forces and equipment, and air refueling operations. The aircraft had played a vital role in AFSOC operations since its arrival in Hurlburt Field in 1992. Its highlights included evacuations of non-combatant Americans and other civilians from conflicts in Liberia in 1996 and the Republic of Congo in 1997. It also participated in combat operations in the Balkans during Operation Allied Force and was used extensively in combat and humanitarian operations worldwide, including operations Enduring Freedom and Inherent Resolve, Resolute Support, Tomodachi in Japan, Unified Response in Haiti, and Sahayogi Haat in Nepal.

The MC-130H was replaced by the MC-130J Commando II. Lt. Gen. Tony Bauernfeind, commander of Air Force Special Operations Command, a former commander of the 15th SOS and MC-130H pilot, was on board the aircraft to help deliver it to its final destination and made it a priority to take part in the final flight. After the six-hour flight to Davis-Monthan, the aircrew, including Bauernfeind and 15th SOS Commander Lt. Col. Adam Schmidt, took photos with the aircraft and signed their names on the aircraft&#x27;s nose.

==MC-130P Combat Shadow==


The MC-130P series of aircraft entered service in 1965 during the Vietnam War as HC-130H CROWN airborne controllers to locate downed aircrew and direct Combat Search and Rescue operations over North Vietnam. After tanker equipment was added to 11 HC-130Hs, they entered service as HC-130P SAR command and control/helicopter aerial refueling aircraft in November 1966. Combat Shadows have been part of the Air Force special operations force since 1986. In February 1996, AFSOC&#x27;s 28-aircraft tanker fleet was redesignated the MC-130P, aligning the variant with other M-series special operations mission aircraft.

Combat Shadows provided air refueling support in Panama to Army and Air Force helicopters during &quot;Operation Just Cause&quot;. In 1990, four Combat Shadows of the 9th Special Operations Squadron deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia for &quot;Desert Storm&quot;, and three of the 67th Special Operations Squadron to Batman Air Base, Turkey for &quot;Proven Force&quot;. Since the Gulf War, the MC-130P has been involved in numerous operations, including &quot;Northern Watch&quot; and &quot;Southern Watch&quot; (Iraq), &quot;Deny Flight&quot; (Yugoslavia), &quot;Restore Democracy&quot; and &quot;Uphold Democracy&quot; (Haiti), &quot;Deliberate Force&quot; and &quot;Joint Endeavor&quot; (Bosnia), &quot;Assured Response&quot; (Liberia), &quot;Guardian Retrieval&quot; (Zaire), &quot;Enduring Freedom&quot; (Afghanistan) and &quot;Iraqi Freedom&quot;.

The Combat Shadow flew single or multi-ship low-level air refueling missions for special operations helicopters conducting infiltration, exfiltration, and supply missions, with command and control capability in limited situations. The primary emphasis for Combat Shadows was on night operations using NVGs, to reduce probability of visual acquisition and intercept by airborne threats.

The last two AFSOC MC-130Ps were retired on 15 May 2015. However, four MC-130P aircraft continue to be flown by the 129th Rescue Wing (129 RQW) of the California Air National Guard. Although the MC-130P was ostensibly an AFSOC aircraft, the examples still flown by the 129 RQW are part of a rescue squadron assigned to a combat search and rescue/personnel recovery (CSAR / PR) mission and are therefore operationally-gained by the Air Combat Command (ACC) versus AFSOC. These MC-130P aircraft will eventually be replaced by the HC-130J Combat King II.

==MC-130W Combat Spear==

The MC-130W Combat Spear, unofficially and facetiously nicknamed the &quot;Combat Wombat&quot;, performed clandestine or low visibility missions into denied areas to provide aerial refueling to SOF helicopters or to air drop small SOF teams and supply bundles.

The first of 12 MC-130Ws, AF Ser. No. 87-9286, was presented to Air Force Special Operations Command on 28 June 2006. The aircraft was developed to supplement the MC-130 Combat Talon and Combat Shadow forces as an interim measure after several training accidents and contingency losses in supporting the Global War on Terrorism. The program modified C-130H-2 airframes from the 1987–1990 production run, acquired from airlift units in the Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard. Use of the H-2 airframe allowed installation of SOF systems already configured for Combat Talons without expensive and time-consuming development that would be required of new production C-130J aircraft, reducing the flyaway cost of the Spear to $60 million per aircraft. The Combat Spears, however, do not have a Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance capability.

A standard system of special forces avionics equips the MC-130W: a fully integrated Global Positioning System and Inertial Navigation System, an AN/APN-241 Low Power Color weather/navigation radar; interior and exterior NVG-compatible lighting; advanced threat detection and automated countermeasures, including active infrared countermeasures as well as chaff and flares; upgraded communication suites, including dual satellite communications using data burst transmission to make trackback difficult; aerial refueling capability; and the ability to act as an aerial tanker for helicopters and CV-22 Osprey aircraft using Mk 32B-902E refueling pods.

The MC-130Ws were assigned to the 73rd Special Operations Squadron at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, with all twelve operational by 2010. Initially nicknamed the &quot;Whiskey&quot; (NATO phonetic for the &quot;W&quot; modifier), the MC-130W was officially dubbed the Combat Spear in May 2007 to honor the historical legacy of the Combat Talons in Vietnam.

===MC-130W Dragon Spear===
Operational demands on aging AC-130s led the Air Force to seek a replacement until new AC-130Js could enter the fleet. A first idea—acquire and develop an AC-27J Stinger II—fell through, so in May 2009, the Air Force began looking at converting MC-130Ws into interim gunships. On 17 November 2009, a contract was awarded to Alliant Techsystems to produce 30 mm ammunition for the Dragon Spear.

In September 2010, the Air Force awarded a $61 million contract to L-3 Communications to give a gunship-like attack capability to eight MC-130W Combat Spear special-mission aircraft. Under the deal, L-3 added the weapons kits, called &quot;precision strike packages&quot;. MC-130Ws fitted with the weapons were renamed &quot;Dragon Spears&quot;. Air Force Special Operations Command eventually converted all 12 MC-130W aircraft to Dragon Spears.

The Dragon Spears were equipped with a Bushmaster II GAU-23/A 30mm gun (an improved version of the MK44 MOD0 30mm gun), sensors, communications systems, and the Gunslinger precision-guided munitions system: a launch tube designed to fire up to 10 GBU-44/B Viper Strike or AGM-176 Griffin small standoff munitions in quick succession. Initial supplemental funds to the 2010 Defense Authorization Bill were for two kits to be installed in 2010.

The MC-130W Dragon Spear went from concept to flying with a minimum capability in less than 90 days, and from concept to deployment in 18 months. Its success won its program the William J. Perry Award, and it became the model for the AC-130J gunship program.

The first partially converted MC-130W arrived in Afghanistan in late 2010. It fired its first weapon one month after arriving, killing five enemy combatants with a Hellfire missile. In May 2012 the Dragon Spear was redesignated the AC-130W Stinger II. By September 2013, 14 aircraft had been converted into gunships. The conversion added a sensor package consisting of day/night video cameras with magnification capability.

==MC-130J Commando II==

Beginning in 1997, studies of the vulnerability of the non-stealthy MC-130 force reflected concerns about its viability in modern high-threat environments, including the prevalence of man-portable air-defense systems in asymmetric conflicts. At least two studies were conducted or proposed to explore the prospect of a replacement aircraft (known variously as &quot;MC-X&quot; or &quot;M-X&quot;), with USAF at that time hoping for an Initial Operating Capability date of 2018. One analyst questioned the survivability of slow non-stealthy platforms such as the MC-130 in future threat environments in a 2007 presentation to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and stated his opinion that development of a stealthy replacement for the MC-130 is a &quot;strategic priority&quot;. The U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s &quot;2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report&quot; also recognized the concern, asserting DoD&#x27;s intention to &quot;enhance capabilities to support SOF insertion and extraction into denied areas from strategic distances.&quot;

Despite these concerns, the USAF decided to proceed with modernization of the current force. The Air Force stated it is to build 37 MC-130Js to replace its MC-130Es and MC-130Ps, both of which were 40 years old. Based on the KC-130J tanker operated by the United States Marine Corps, the new MC-130J has added features for both combat search and rescue and special operations missions, introducing major modifications to the Block 6.5 KC-130J. The MC-130J adds an Enhanced Service Life Wing, an Enhanced Cargo Handling System, a Universal Aerial Refueling Receptacle Slipway Installation (UARRSI) boom refueling receptacle, more powerful electrical generators, an electro-optical/infrared sensor, a combat systems officer (CSO) station on the flight deck, provisions for the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures System, and armor.

Production of the first MC-130J aircraft was started at Lockheed Martin’s facility in Marietta, Georgia, on 5 October 2009. Lockheed Martin also contracted to build an HC-130J tanker variant for Air Force Special Operations Command on its standard C-130J production line. The MC-130J is the first C-130 specifically built for special operations, making it lighter and more efficient. Most special operations aircraft are modified after production to accommodate special operations missions. The MC-130J was initially called the Combat Shadow II to honor the service of the aging MC-130P platform that it was replacing but was officially named the Commando II in March 2012.

The Air Force Special Operations Training Center conducted the initial MC-130J training program in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Air National Guard&#x27;s 193rd Special Operations Wing, using its four EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft to develop the training syllabus for MC-130J aircrew members. The MC-130J operates with a 5-member crew, eliminating the CSO navigator and the enlisted flight engineer positions that had been in the Combat Shadow&#x27;s crew, with the remaining CSO handling electronic warfare as well as the navigation and aerial refueling duties formerly conducted by the navigator and flight engineer. The 415th Special Operations Squadron, a unit of the 58th Operations Group at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, was reactivated on 22 September 2011 as the main training unit for both MC-130J and HC-130J Combat King II crews.

The 522nd Special Operations Squadron was the first unit to operate the MC-130J Commando II, and achieved Initial Operational Capability in 2012. The first MC-130J, AF Ser. No. 09-6207, undertook its initial test flight on 22 April 2011. The 522nd Special Operations Squadron received its first MC-130J in late September 2011.

A total of 37 MC-130J aircraft are programmed to replace all other MC-130 variants by the end of the fiscal year 2017. MC-130Js completely replaced Combat Talons at RAF Mildenhall in 2014 and began replacing those at Kadena AB in 2015. 20 were in service in FY 2015 with seven additional airframes in production. On 26 October 2019, MC-130J Commando II special mission aircraft accompanied Joint Special Operations Command 160th SOAR MH-60 and MH-47s, which carried 1st SFOD-D and 75th Ranger RRC operators, into Idlib province during the Barisha raid.

As part of AFSOC’s multimission fleet consolidation the MC-130J Commando II is replacing both EC-130J Commando Solo and Super-J.

==Operational losses==
Between 1967 and 2005, nine MC-130 special operations aircraft have been destroyed in operations, two of them in combat in the Vietnam War, resulting in the deaths of 68 crewmen and passengers:
* C-130E(I) / MC-130E Combat Talon I – four
* MC-130H Combat Talon II – four
* MC-130P Combat Shadow – one

===Combat Talon I losses===
Two of the four aircraft assigned to Project &quot;Stray Goose&quot; were lost in combat: 64-0563 was destroyed on 25 November 1967, by a direct hit of a mortar round while parked on the Nha Trang flightline. The aircraft had been scheduled for a mission and had just completed preflight of the exterior when the mission was cancelled. Soon after the crew left the ramp, the aircraft was hit and destroyed by fire.

64-0547 was missing-in-action with its entire 11-man crew on 29 December 1967, on a mission to drop leaflets inside North Vietnam. The Blackbird had completed its leaflet drop leg of the mission at and begun its descent to its terrain-following exit altitude. Communication was lost without the Blackbird reporting any threats detected. SOF commanders at the time discounted the possibility of its being shot down because the flight, conducted by an inexperienced aircraft commander under new moon conditions, was not claimed as such by North Vietnam. In November 1992, the wreckage was located near the peak of a mountain northeast of Dien Bien Phu, and it was surmised that its descent was too steep for its TF/TA radar to stabilize. 64-0547 was the only special operations MC-130 lost on a combat mission over hostile terrain in the history of the program.

64-0558 was lost in a mid-air collision during a night training exercise 15 miles north of Conway, South Carolina on 5 December 1972. An F-102 Delta Dagger of the South Carolina Air National Guard, attempting a night intercept of the Talon, flew into the fuel drop tank on its right wing, with the loss of both aircraft, killing all 12 aboard the C-130E(I). 64-0558 had been one of the two Talons assigned to the Son Tay POW camp rescue mission.

Former &quot;Heavy Chain&quot; and Desert One veteran 64-0564 crashed into the ocean shortly after a pre-dawn takeoff from NAS Cubi Point, Philippines, on 26 February 1981, killing 15 passengers and eight of nine crewmen. The Talon was taking part in &quot;Special Warfare Exercise 81&quot; and had flown 12 missions in the preceding 16 days. Following an administrative flight the day before, the crew was scheduled for its last mission, a night exercise that was set back from 01:00 local time to 04:30. The flight profile consisted of a normal takeoff, a tactical landing a half-hour later to onload 15 Navy SEALs, followed by a tactical takeoff. The Talon reported normal flight conditions six minutes after the tactical takeoff, but crashed nine minutes later. No cause was determined, but investigators found that the likely causes were either crew fatigue from operations tempo, or failure of the terrain following radar to enter &quot;override&quot; mode while over water.

===Combat Shadow/Talon II losses===
Combat Shadow 66-0213 (&quot;Ditka 03&quot;) was lost when it flew into a mountain top in eastern Afghanistan on 13 February 2002. Assigned to the 9th SOS, the aircraft was refueling an MH-47E helicopter on a CSAR mission when it was forced to make an emergency climb in poor visibility to escape a box canyon in the mountainous terrain. The MC-130P ran out of climb performance and crash-landed wheels-up in deep snow. The aircraft was a total loss but the crew of eight survived with relatively minor injuries.

Combat Talon II 84-0475, assigned to the 15th SOS, was lost in a takeoff crash on 12 June 2002, near Gardez, Afghanistan. During a night exfiltration mission of two Special Forces soldiers from a landing strip at the Sardeh Band dam, the Talon crashed less than three miles from the airstrip shortly after takeoff. Conflicting reports point to overweight cargo and windshear as possible causes. The Talon&#x27;s two loadmasters and a passenger were killed.

Combat Talon II 90-0161, also of the 15th SOS, crashed into Monte Perucho, south of Caguas, Puerto Rico, during a training mission on 7 August 2002, killing all ten aboard. The Talon was flying a terrain-following night mission in blowing rain and fog, along a low level route commonly used by the Puerto Rico Air National Guard. The crew misinterpreted and disregarded terrain obstacle warnings.

Combat Talon II 85-0012 was severely damaged during a landing accident at Qayyarah-West Air Base, south of Mosul, Iraq, on 29 December 2004. The 15th SOS aircraft was on a resupply mission and struck an open trench that was part of repairs to the runway while still at 80 knots, shearing off its landing gear and much of its lower fuselage, and partially separating its left wing from the fuselage. The trench was part of a U.S. Army project to repair damage to the runway from prior bombing by allied forces. A Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) warning had not been filed by the airfield or disseminated to the aircrew, despite a safety hazard report filed in the week previous by another aircrew. No fatalities occurred and classified equipment was salvaged before the aircraft was destroyed by explosive demolition due to the airframe being unrepairable.

A Combat Talon II of the 7th SOS, 87-0127 (&quot;Wrath 11&quot;), crashed during a terrain-following-and-avoidance night training exercise on 31 March 2005, near Rovie, in the Drizez Mountains in southeast Albania, 60 miles southeast of Tirana. The Talon had taken off from Tirana-Rinas Airport 20 minutes before and was one of two flying at AGL at a reduced power setting. An investigation revealed that the plane stalled attempting to clear terrain following the crew&#x27;s &quot;loss of situational awareness.&quot; All nine crew members aboard were killed.

<doc id="600774" wikidata="Q188117" url="?curid=600774" title="Walter Mosley">
<text>Walter Ellis Mosley (born January 12, 1952) is an American novelist, most widely recognized for his crime fiction. He has written a series of best-selling historical mysteries featuring the hard-boiled detective Easy Rawlins, a black private investigator living in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. They are, perhaps, his most popular works. In 2020, Mosley received the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, making him the first Black man to receive the honor.

==Personal life==
Mosley was born in Los Angeles, California. His mother, Ella (), was Jewish and worked as a personnel clerk. Her ancestors had immigrated from Russia. His father, Leroy Mosley (1924–1993), was an African American from Louisiana who was a supervising custodian at a Los Angeles public school. He had worked as a clerk in the segregated US army, during the Second World War. His parents tried to marry in 1951, and while the union was legal in California, where they were living, no one would give them a marriage license.

Mosley was an only child, and he ascribes his writing imagination to &quot;an emptiness in my childhood that I filled up with fantasies.” For $9.50 a week, he attended the Victory Baptist day school, a private African-American elementary school that held pioneering classes in black history. When he was 12, his parents moved from South Central to the more comfortable, working-class west LA. He graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School, in 1970. Mosley describes his father as a deep thinker and storyteller, a &quot;black Socrates.” His mother encouraged him to read European classics, from Dickens and Zola to Camus. He also loves Langston Hughes and Gabriel García Márquez. He was largely raised in a non-political family culture, although there were racial conflicts flaring throughout L.A., at the time. He later became more highly politicized and outspoken about racial inequalities in the US, which are a context of much of his fiction.

Mosley went through a &quot;long-haired hippie&quot; phase, drifting around Santa Cruz and Europe. He dropped out of Goddard College, a liberal arts college in Plainfield, Vermont, and then, he earned a political science degree at Johnson State College. Abandoning a doctorate in political theory, he started work programming computers. He moved to New York, in 1981, and he met the dancer and choreographer, Joy Kellman, whom he married in 1987. Kellman, like Mosley&#x27;s mother, was Jewish. They separated, ten years later, and were divorced in 2001. While working for Mobil Oil, Mosley took a writing course at City College in Harlem, after being inspired by Alice Walker&#x27;s book &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. One of his tutors, there, Irish writer Edna O&#x27;Brien, became a mentor and encouraged him, saying: &quot;You&#x27;re Black, Jewish, with a poor upbringing; there are riches, therein.&quot;

Mosley still resides in New York City.

He says that he identifies as both African-American and Jewish, with strong feelings for both groups.

==Career==
Mosley started writing at 34 and claims to have written every day, since, penning more than forty books and often publishing two books a year. He has written in a variety of fiction categories, including mystery and afrofuturist science fiction, as well as nonfiction politics. His work has been translated into 21 languages. His direct inspirations include the detective fiction of Dashiell Hammett, Graham Greene and Raymond Chandler. Mosley&#x27;s fame increased in 1992 when presidential candidate Bill Clinton, a fan of murder mysteries, named Mosley as one of his favorite authors. Mosley made publishing history, in 1997, by forgoing an advance to give the manuscript of &quot;Gone Fishin&#x27; &quot; to a small, independent publisher, Black Classic Press in Baltimore, run by former Black Panther Paul Coates.

Mosley&#x27;s first published book, &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;, was the basis of a 1995 movie starring Denzel Washington, and the following year, a 10-part abridgement of the novel by Margaret Busby, read by Paul Winfield, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. The world premiere of Mosley&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Fall of Heaven&quot;, was staged at the Playhouse in the Park, Cincinnati, Ohio, in January 2010.

Mosley has served on the board of directors of the National Book Awards. He is on the board of the TransAfrica Forum.

Former literature professor Harold Heft argued for Mosley&#x27;s inclusion in the literary canon of Jewish-American writers. In &quot;Moment&quot; magazine, Johanna Neuman writes that black literary circles questioned whether Mosley should be considered a &quot;black author&quot;. Mosley has said that he prefers to be called a novelist. He explains his desire to write about &quot;black male heroes&quot;, saying &quot;hardly anybody in America has written about black male heroes. There are black male protagonists and black male supporting characters, but nobody else writes about black male heroes.&quot;

In 2019, after working in the writers room for the television series &quot;Snowfall&quot;, Mosley was hired, by Alex Kurtzman, for a similar role on the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. After working on the series for three weeks, Mosley was notified by CBS of a complaint made against him by another member of the writers room for Mosley&#x27;s use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, while telling a story about his experience with a police officer who had used the slur. CBS told Mosley this was usually a fireable offence but said no further action would be taken and asked that he not use the word, again, outside of a script. Mosley chose to leave the series, quitting without informing Kurtzman, and he explained his decision in an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in September 2019. He did not identify &quot;Discovery&quot; as the series he was working on in the op-ed, but this was confirmed, in reports on the op-ed, shortly after its release.

<text>In the Scottish secondary education system, the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies (CSYS) was the highest level of qualification available to pupils from 1968 until circa 2000.

Overseen by the Scottish Examination Board (SEB), it was taken by students in their sixth year (final year) of secondary education (ages 16–18) and was available for a range of different subjects. Examinations were administered by the SEB (and latterly by its successor, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which absorbed and replaced it eventually). Unlike the Standard and Higher Grade examinations, it was not a part of the Scottish Certificate of Education.

The CSYS followed on from Higher Grade examinations and was considered broadly equivalent to the English A-Level qualification. However, it never quite gained the same level of universal recognition as the Higher or A-Level. In particular, universities (at least in Scotland) rarely used it when considering potential students. The academic demands placed on students by these examinations were the highest of the Scottish secondary school examination system at that time. One important and distinguishing feature of the CSYS examinations (for some subjects) was the inclusion of a dissertation and/or viva examination conducted by a visiting external examiner.

The CSYS was replaced by the Advanced Higher examinations in 2000.

<doc id="600780" wikidata="Q7916987" url="?curid=600780" title="Vast right-wing conspiracy">
<text>&quot;Vast right-wing [[conspiracy]]&quot; is a phrase popularized by a 1995 memo by political opposition researcher Chris Lehane and then referenced in 1998 by the then First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton, in defense of her husband, President Bill Clinton, characterizing the continued allegations of scandal against her and her husband, including the Lewinsky scandal, as part of a conspiracy by Clinton&#x27;s political enemies. The term has been used since, including in a question posed to Bill Clinton in 2009 to describe verbal attacks on Barack Obama during his early presidency. Hillary Clinton mentioned it again during her 2016 presidential campaign.

==Earlier uses==
While popularized by Hillary Clinton in her 1998 &quot;The Today Show&quot; interview, the phrase did not originate with her. In 1991, the &quot;Detroit News&quot; wrote:

An &quot;Associated Press&quot; story in 1995 also used the phrase, relating an official&#x27;s guess that the Oklahoma City bombing was the work of &quot;maybe five malcontents&quot; and not &quot;some kind of vast right-wing conspiracy.&quot;

== Popularization ==

=== 1995 memo ===
A 332-page memo titled &quot;Communication Stream of Conspiracy Commerce&quot; was commissioned by Mark Fabiani and written by Chris Lehane in 1995. It was the first document to describe the conspiracies surrounding the Clintons. It described how conservative media outlets such as &quot;The American Spectator&quot; spread conspiracy theories about the suicide of Vince Foster, the Whitewater controversy, and other events. According to the memo, these conspiracies spread from conservative think tanks to British tabloids, and then to the mainstream press.

=== &quot;The Today Show&quot; interview ===

In response to ongoing accusations surrounding the Clintons&#x27; investment in a real estate development known as Whitewater in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Attorney General Janet Reno had appointed an independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, to investigate those accusations in 1994. Starr&#x27;s investigation began to branch out into other issues, from Filegate, to Travelgate, to Bill Clinton&#x27;s actions in the civil case of his alleged sexual harassment of Paula Jones prior to his presidency. In the course of the last of these, White House intern Monica Lewinsky signed an affidavit that she had not had a relationship with Clinton, but Lewinsky&#x27;s confidant Linda Tripp had been recording their phone conversations and offered Starr tapes of Lewinsky describing her feelings for, and alleging intimate encounters with, the president. Clinton was asked to give a deposition, and accusations that he lied about an affair under oath first made national headlines on January 17, 1998, when the story was picked up by the conservative-right e-mail newsletter &quot;The Drudge Report&quot;. Despite swift denials from Bill, the media attention grew.

On January 27, 1998, Hillary appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;, in an interview with Matt Lauer.

Clinton elaborated by decrying the tactics &quot;and the kind of intense political agenda at work here.&quot; Bob Woodward recounts in his book &quot;The Agenda&quot; (1994) that the first lady claimed that when her husband was making his decision to run for the presidency in 1991, he reported receiving &quot;a direct threat from someone in the Bush White House, warning that if he ran, the Republicans would go after him. &#x27;We will do everything we can to destroy you personally,&#x27; she recalled that the Bush White House man had said.&quot;

==Later uses==
David Brock, a conservative-turned-liberal author, has said he was once a part of an effort to dredge up a scandal against Clinton. In 1993 Brock, then of the &quot;American Spectator&quot;, was the first to report Paula Jones&#x27; claims. As Brock explained in &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot;, after learning more about the events and conservative payments surrounding Paula Jones, he personally apologized to the Clintons. He documented his experience in &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot;, wherein he alleged that Arkansas State Police troopers had taken money in exchange for testimony against Clinton which Brock had published in a previous book. Adam Curtis also discusses the concept in his documentary series &quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot;. Brock has agreed with Clinton&#x27;s claim that there was a &quot;right wing conspiracy&quot; to smear her husband, quibbling only with the characterization of it as &quot;vast ,&quot; since Brock contends that it was orchestrated mainly by a few powerful people. MSNBC also described the comment as once-ridiculed but now taken more seriously by &quot;many Democrats&quot; who point &quot;to the well-documented efforts by conservative financier Richard Mellon Scaife to fund a network of anti-Clinton investigations.&quot;

Specific claims of such funding have been made against conservative Republican supporter and billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife. Scaife played a major role in funding the Arkansas Project investigating President Clinton; former Clinton White House Counsel Lanny Davis claimed Scaife was using his money &quot;to destroy a president of the United States.&quot; Scaife claims to be public about his political spending (q.v.). CNN stated in a study the news outlet conducted on Scaife, &quot;If it&#x27;s a conspiracy, it&#x27;s a pretty open one.&quot;

Hillary wrote in her 2003 autobiography, &quot;Looking back, I see that I might have phrased my point more artfully, but I stand by the characterization of Starr&#x27;s investigation [regardless of the truth about Lewinsky].&quot; By 2007, her experiences caused her to say in presidential campaign appearances that the &quot;vast right-wing conspiracy&quot; was back, citing such cases as the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal. On the stump for Al Franken&#x27;s 2008 Senate campaign, Bill acknowledged his Air America Radio show by quipping that he had been taking on the &quot;vast right wing conspiracy before others even acknowledged that it existed.&quot;

Bill, when asked on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; (September 27, 2009) whether the &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot; was involved in the attacks on President Barack Obama, said &quot;Oh, you bet. Sure it is. It&#x27;s not as strong as it was, because America&#x27;s changed demographically, but it&#x27;s as virulent as it was … when they accused me of murder and all that stuff.&quot;

Two other figures who have used the phrase are Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman and journalist Joe Conason. Conason, in an article called &quot;The vast right-wing conspiracy is back,&quot; referring to the National Republican Trust PAC and Newsmax, which are run by former foes of president Clinton, and who made attacks on then-President Barack Obama. The National Republican Trust PAC sponsored a campaign commercials against Obama in 2008 which FactCheck.org described as &quot;one of the sleaziest false TV ads of the campaign.&quot; One of Newsmax&#x27;s owners &quot;was among the most insistent endorsers of the Obama birth certificate myth&quot; and a popularizer of the canard that Clinton&#x27;s White House counsel Vince Foster did not commit suicide—as determined by five official investigations—but was murdered.

In some of his books, Krugman has used the phrase (&quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a vast right-wing conspiracy&quot;) to refer not to a conservative Republican-leaning campaign against Clinton (or Obama), but more generally to &quot;an interlocking set of institutions ultimately answering to a small group of people that collectively reward loyalists and punish dissenters&quot; in the service of &quot;movement conservatism.&quot; The network of institutions provide

obedient politicians with the resources to win elections, safe havens in the event of defeat, and lucrative career opportunities after they leave office. They guarantee favorable news coverage to politicians who follow the party line, while harassing and undermining opponents. And they support a large standing army of party intellectuals and activists.

In Krugman&#x27;s view, the network of foundations that fund conservative scholarship, the national and regional think tanks and advocacy groups, talk radio media outlets, and conservative law firms through which they pushed their agenda to move the Republican Party to the right, far surpass in funding, size, inter-connectedness or influence anything the Democratic Party or the American political left/liberal movement have at their disposal.

=== 2014 reemergence ===
In April 2014, the Clinton Presidential Center published the original 1995 memo on the alleged conspiracy. The memo&#x27;s author, Chris Lehane, wrote, &quot;As for the premise of the memo, I absolutely stand by it. Not only was it right about the right wing then, it is more accurate than ever today.&quot;

=== 2016 reemergence ===
In 2016, Hillary said she still believed in the &quot;vast right-wing conspiracy ,&quot; adding that it was &quot;even better funded&quot; 18 years later. However, she opined, &quot;At this point it&#x27;s probably not correct to say it&#x27;s a conspiracy because it&#x27;s out in the open.&quot;

In October, after footage of Donald Trump &quot;boasting&quot; about his sexual exploits emerged and multiple women accused Trump of sexual misconduct, Melania Trump defended her husband and said, &quot;This was all organized from the opposition.&quot; Writers for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that Melania&#x27;s response &quot;echoed&quot; Hillary&#x27;s original use of the phrase &quot;vast right-wing conspiracy.&quot;

==Use in popular culture==
After the release of a deposition Bill had given to the Independent Counsel, in which he perjured himself, some conservatives began to adopt the VRWC phrasing ironically. In 2004, conservative lawyer Mark W. Smith wrote the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller &quot;Official Handbook of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy&quot;, which came with a &quot;membership card&quot; that made its owner an &quot;official member of the VRWC.&quot; Similarly, a number of newspaper, magazine, and website articles have used the phrase to report on left-wing politics. 

Eugene Volokh&#x27;s blog The Volokh Conspiracy is said to have derived its name from as a reference to the &quot;Vast right-wing conspiracy&quot; statement.

The term &quot;Vast Right Wing Conspiracy&quot; continues to be mocked by conservatives.

<doc id="600782" wikidata="Q6555028" url="?curid=600782" title="LinuxChix">
<text>LinuxChix is a women-oriented Linux community. It was formed to provide both technical and social support for women Linux users, although men are encouraged to contribute. Members of the community are referred to as &quot;a Linux chick&quot; (singular) and &quot;LinuxChix&quot; or &quot;Linux Chix&quot; (plural) regardless of gender.

== History ==
LinuxChix was founded in 1999 by Deb Richardson, who was a technical writer and web-master at an open source consulting firm. Her reason for founding LinuxChix was to create an alternative to the &quot;locker room mentality&quot; of some other Linux User Groups and forums. There are two core rules: &quot;be polite and be helpful.&quot;

LinuxChix started as an electronic mailing list called &quot;grrltalk&quot;. The growth of this mailing list led to the establishment of other mailing lists, beginning with &quot;techtalk&quot; for technical discussions and &quot;issues&quot; for discussion of women&#x27;s political issues. LinuxChix received attention when ZDNet published an article on it, which was subsequently cross-posted on Slashdot.

== Leadership and structure ==
Deb Richardson oversaw the activities of LinuxChix until 2001, when she handed over global coordination and hosting to Melbourne programmer and writer Jenn Vesperman. Jenn Vesperman led the community in a mostly hands-off fashion, delegating almost all tasks, including mailing list administration and website maintenance, to a group of volunteers. During Jenn Vesperman&#x27;s tenure, the number of mailing lists tripled with the &quot;newchix&quot; mailing list for those new to Linux, the &quot;courses&quot; mailing list used by LinuxChix to teach each other specific topics, and the &quot;grrls-only&quot; mailing list (the only list closed to male subscribers) founded by Val Henson in 2002. At around the same time, a LinuxChix IRC server was created.

The term &quot;LinuxChix&quot; refers to the organisation centered on the official website, the mailing lists and the IRC channels. The organisation has no official status, and the name is used by other loosely affiliated groups, including several local, continental, and national chapters which operate independently.

In March 2007, Jenn Vesperman announced that she was retiring as the coordinator and invited nominations for a new leader. Mary Gardiner was announced as the new coordinator In April 2007, planning to serve as coordinator until 2009, however she resigned in June 2007. Currently the organization is led by three lead volunteers known as the &quot;Tres Chix&quot; who are elected by popular vote. In August 2007, Sulamita Garcia, Akkana Peck and Carla Schroder were elected to these positions.

== Regional chapters ==

LinuxChix has over 15 regional chapters around the world. In 2004, a chapter was founded in Africa. In March 2007, on the International Women&#x27;s Day, Australia&#x27;s two LinuxChix chapters united to form a nationwide chapter called &quot;AussieChix&quot;. The New Zealand chapter was established in February 2007.

== Events ==
Some local LinuxChix chapters hold regular meetings. Others only meet up on special occasions, such as visits from non-local members or in conjunction with technical conferences. In 2007, members of the Sydney chapter organized a LinuxChix miniconf at linux.conf.au at the University of New South Wales. Events are held on other special occasions; in 2005, for example, LinuxChix Africa organized an event to celebrate Software Freedom Day at Wits University.

===LinuxChix labs===
The Indian chapter of LinuxChix (aka IndiChix) led an initiative to establish Linux labs in a number of cities in India. These labs provide spaces equipped with PCs and internet connections where women can learn more about Linux and collaborate on contributions to the Libre software community. Labs have gone live in Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune.

<doc id="600788" wikidata="Q123045" url="?curid=600788" title="Brain-derived neurotrophic factor">
<text>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or abrineurin, is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the &quot;BDNF&quot; gene. BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are related to the canonical nerve growth factor (NGF), a family which also includes NT-3 and NT-4/NT-5. Neurotrophic factors are found in the brain and the periphery. BDNF was first isolated from a pig brain in 1982 by Yves-Alain Barde and Hans Thoenen.

BDNF activates the TrkB tyrosine kinase receptor.

== Function ==

BDNF acts on certain neurons of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system expressing TrkB, helping to support survival of existing neurons, and encouraging growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. In the brain it is active in the hippocampus, cortex, and basal forebrain—areas vital to learning, memory, and higher thinking. BDNF is also expressed in the retina, kidneys, prostate, motor neurons, and skeletal muscle, and is also found in saliva.

BDNF itself is important for long-term memory.
Although the vast majority of neurons in the mammalian brain are formed prenatally, parts of the adult brain retain the ability to grow new neurons from neural stem cells in a process known as neurogenesis. Neurotrophins are proteins that help to stimulate and control neurogenesis, BDNF being one of the most active. Mice born without the ability to make BDNF have developmental defects in the brain and sensory nervous system, and usually die soon after birth, suggesting that BDNF plays an important role in normal neural development. Other important neurotrophins structurally related to BDNF include NT-3, NT-4, and NGF.

BDNF is made in the endoplasmic reticulum and secreted from dense-core vesicles. It binds carboxypeptidase E (CPE), and disruption of this binding has been proposed to cause the loss of sorting BDNF into dense-core vesicles. The phenotype for BDNF knockout mice can be severe, including postnatal lethality. Other traits include sensory neuron losses that affect coordination, balance, hearing, taste, and breathing. Knockout mice also exhibit cerebellar abnormalities and an increase in the number of sympathetic neurons.

Certain types of physical exercise have been shown to markedly (threefold) increase BDNF synthesis in the human brain, a phenomenon which is partly responsible for exercise-induced neurogenesis and improvements in cognitive function. Niacin appears to upregulate BDNF and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression as well.

== Mechanism of action ==

BDNF binds at least two receptors on the surface of cells that are capable of responding to this growth factor, TrkB (pronounced &quot;Track B&quot;) and the LNGFR (for &quot;low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor&quot;, also known as p75). It may also modulate the activity of various neurotransmitter receptors, including the Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor. BDNF has also been shown to interact with the reelin signaling chain. The expression of reelin by Cajal–Retzius cells goes down during development under the influence of BDNF. The latter also decreases reelin expression in neuronal culture.

=== TrkB ===

The TrkB receptor is encoded by the NTRK2 gene and is member of a receptor family of tyrosine kinases that includes TrkA and TrkC. TrkB autophosphorylation is dependent upon its ligand-specific association with BDNF, a widely expressed activity-dependent neurotrophic factor that regulates plasticity and is dysregulated following hypoxic injury. The activation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway is important in the development of short-term memory and the growth of neurons.

=== LNGFR ===

The role of the other BDNF receptor, p75, is less clear. While the TrkB receptor interacts with BDNF in a ligand-specific manner, all neurotrophins can interact with the p75 receptor. When the p75 receptor is activated, it leads to activation of NFkB receptor. Thus, neurotrophic signaling may trigger apoptosis rather than survival pathways in cells expressing the p75 receptor in the absence of Trk receptors. Recent studies have revealed a truncated isoform of the TrkB receptor (t-TrkB) may act as a dominant negative to the p75 neurotrophin receptor, inhibiting the activity of p75, and preventing BDNF-mediated cell death.

== Expression ==

The BDNF protein is encoded by a gene that is also called BDNF, found in humans on chromosome 11. Structurally, BDNF transcription is controlled by eight different promoters, each leading to different transcripts containing one of eight untranslated 5&#x27; exons (I to VIII) spliced to the 3&#x27; encoding exon. Promoter IV activity, leading to the translation of exon IV-containing mRNA, is strongly stimulated by calcium and is primarily under the control of a Cre regulatory component, suggesting a putative role for the transcription factor CREB and the source of BDNF&#x27;s activity-dependent effects .
There are multiple mechanisms through neuronal activity that can increase BDNF exon IV specific expression. Stimulus-mediated neuronal excitation can lead to NMDA receptor activation, triggering a calcium influx. Through a protein signaling cascade requiring Erk, CaM KII/IV, PI3K, and PLC, NMDA receptor activation is capable of triggering BDNF exon IV transcription. BDNF exon IV expression also seems capable of further stimulating its own expression through TrkB activation. BDNF is released from the post-synaptic membrane in an activity-dependent manner, allowing it to act on local TrkB receptors and mediate effects that can lead to signaling cascades also involving Erk and CaM KII/IV. Both of these pathways probably involve calcium-mediated phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133, thus allowing it to interact with BDNF&#x27;s Cre regulatory domain and upregulate transcription. However, NMDA-mediated receptor signaling is probably necessary to trigger the upregulation of BDNF exon IV expression because normally CREB interaction with CRE and the subsequent translation of the BDNF transcript is blocked by of the basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor protein 2 (BHLHB2). NMDA receptor activation triggers the release of the regulatory inhibitor, allowing for BDNF exon IV upregulation to take place in response to the activity-initiated calcium influx. Activation of dopamine receptor D5 also promotes expression of BDNF in prefrontal cortex neurons.

== BDNF-AS ==

The genomic locus encoding BDNF is structurally complex and also encodes BDNF-antisense (BDNF-AS; also known as BDNFOS or ANTI-BDNF). BDNF-AS is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from the opposite strand of the BDNF gene. This lncRNA was identified in 2005 through searches in expressed sequence tag (EST) databases and subsequent RT-PCR experiments. The gene encoding BDNF-AS is located on chromosome 11p14.1. BDNF mRNA and BDNF-AS share a common overlapping region and form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) duplexes. 

BDNF-AS regulates BDNF expression and can suppress BDNF mRNA. In the human neocortex, regions with increased activity and BDNF expression exhibit reduced BDNF-AS expression.Elevated BDNF-AS levels are associated with reduced BDNF expression and have been shown to promote neurotoxicity, increase apoptosis, and decrease cell viability. Conversely, inhibiting BDNF-AS upregulates BDNF mRNA, activates BDNF-mediated signaling pathways, increases BDNF protein levels, suppresses neuronal apoptosis, and promotes neuronal outgrowth and differentiation.

The BDNF-AS gene consists of 10 exons and a functional promoter upstream of exon 1. The BDNF-AS gene generates numerous distinct non-coding RNAs through alternative splicing. This diversity of spliced isoforms is a common feature of eukaryotic organisms, particularly in the nervous system. Notably, BDNF-AS is absent in rodents, although highly homologous sequences are present in the genomes of chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys, suggesting a primate/hominid evolutionary origin of BDNF-AS.

Variations in both the BDNF and BDNF-AS genes are important factors to consider, given their potential to alter BDNF function and contribute to multiple human phenotypes influencing disease susceptibility and treatment outcomes.

== Common SNPs in BDNF gene ==
BDNF has several known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), including, but not limited to, rs6265, C270T, rs7103411, rs2030324, rs2203877, rs2049045 and rs7124442. rs6265 is the most studied SNP in the &quot;BDNF&quot; gene.

=== Val66Met ===
A common SNP in the BDNF gene is rs6265. This point mutation in the coding sequence, a guanine to adenine switch at position 196, results in an amino acid switch: valine to methionine exchange at codon 66, Val66Met, which is in the prodomain of BDNF. Val66Met is unique to humans.

The mutation interferes with normal translation and intracellular trafficking of BDNF mRNA, as it destabilizes the mRNA and renders it prone to degradation. The proteins resulting from mRNA that does get translated, are not trafficked and secreted normally, as the amino acid change occurs on the portion of the prodomain where sortilin binds; and sortilin is essential for normal trafficking.

The Val66Met mutation results in a reduction of hippocampal tissue and has since been reported in a high number of individuals with learning and memory disorders, anxiety disorders, major depression, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s.

A meta-analysis indicates that the BDNF Val66Met variant is not associated with serum BDNF.

== Role in synaptic transmission ==

=== Glutamatergic signaling ===

Glutamate is the brain&#x27;s major excitatory neurotransmitter and its release can trigger the depolarization of postsynaptic neurons. AMPA and NMDA receptors are two ionotropic glutamate receptors involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission and essential to learning and memory via long-term potentiation. While AMPA receptor activation leads to depolarization via sodium influx, NMDA receptor activation by rapid successive firing allows calcium influx in addition to sodium. The calcium influx triggered through NMDA receptors can lead to expression of BDNF, as well as other genes thought to be involved in LTP, dendritogenesis, and synaptic stabilization.

==== NMDA receptor activity ====

NMDA receptor activation is essential to producing the activity-dependent molecular changes involved in the formation of new memories. Following exposure to an enriched environment, BDNF and NR1 phosphorylation levels are upregulated simultaneously, probably because BDNF is capable of phosphorylating NR1 subunits, in addition to its many other effects. One of the primary ways BDNF can modulate NMDA receptor activity is through phosphorylation and activation of the NMDA receptor one subunit, particularly at the PKC Ser-897 site. The mechanism underlying this activity is dependent upon both ERK and PKC signaling pathways, each acting individually, and all NR1 phosphorylation activity is lost if the TrKB receptor is blocked. PI3 kinase and Akt are also essential in BDNF-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor function and inhibition of either molecule eliminated receptor BDNF can also increase NMDA receptor activity through phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit. BDNF signaling leads to the autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the TrkB receptor (ICD-TrkB). Upon autophosphorylation, Fyn associates with the pICD-TrkB through its Src homology domain 2 (SH2) and is phosphorylated at its Y416 site. Once activated, Fyn can bind to NR2B through its SH2 domain and mediate phosphorylation of its Tyr-1472 site. Similar studies have suggested Fyn is also capable of activating NR2A although this was not found in the hippocampus. Thus, BDNF can increase NMDA receptor activity through Fyn activation. This has been shown to be important for processes such as spatial memory in the hippocampus, demonstrating the therapeutic and functional relevance of BDNF-mediated NMDA receptor activation.

==== Synapse stability ====

In addition to mediating transient effects on NMDAR activation to promote memory-related molecular changes, BDNF should also initiate more stable effects that could be maintained in its absence and not depend on its expression for long term synaptic support.
It was previously mentioned that AMPA receptor expression is essential to learning and memory formation, as these are the components of the synapse that will communicate regularly and maintain the synapse structure and function long after the initial activation of NMDA channels. BDNF is capable of increasing the mRNA expression of GluR1 and GluR2 through its interaction with the TrkB receptor and promoting the synaptic localization of GluR1 via PKC- and CaMKII-mediated Ser-831 phosphorylation. It also appears that BDNF is able to influence Gl1 activity through its effects on NMDA receptor activity. BDNF significantly enhanced the activation of GluR1 through phosphorylation of tyrosine830, an effect that was abolished in either the presence of a specific NR2B antagonist or a trk receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Thus, it appears BDNF can upregulate the expression and synaptic localization of AMPA receptors, as well as enhance their activity through its postsynaptic interactions with the NR2B subunit. This suggests BDNF is not only capable of initiating synapse formation through its effects on NMDA receptor activity, but it can also support the regular every-day signaling necessary for stable memory function.

=== GABAergic signaling ===

One mechanism through which BDNF appears to maintain elevated levels of neuronal excitation is through preventing GABAergic signaling activities. While glutamate is the brain&#x27;s major excitatory neurotransmitter and phosphorylation normally activates receptors, GABA is the brain&#x27;s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter and phosphorylation of GABAA receptors tend to reduce their activity. Blockading BDNF signaling with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or a PKC inhibitor in wild type mice produced significant reductions in spontaneous action potential frequencies that were mediated by an increase in the amplitude of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC). Similar effects could be obtained in BDNF knockout mice, but these effects were reversed by local application of BDNF. 
This suggests BDNF increases excitatory synaptic signaling partly through the post-synaptic suppression of GABAergic signaling by activating PKC through its association with TrkB. Once activated, PKC can reduce the amplitude of IPSCs through to GABAA receptor phosphorylation and inhibition. In support of this putative mechanism, activation of PKCε leads to phosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) at serine 460 and threonine 461, increasing its ATPase activity which downregulates GABAA receptor surface expression and subsequently attenuates inhibitory currents.

=== Synaptogenesis ===

BDNF also enhances synaptogenesis. Synaptogenesis is dependent upon the assembly of new synapses and the disassembly of old synapses by β-adducin. Adducins are membrane-skeletal proteins that cap the growing ends of actin filaments and promote their association with spectrin, another cytoskeletal protein, to create stable and integrated cytoskeletal networks. Actins have a variety of roles in synaptic functioning. In pre-synaptic neurons, actins are involved in synaptic vesicle recruitment and vesicle recovery following neurotransmitter release. In post-synaptic neurons they can influence dendritic spine formation and retraction as well as AMPA receptor insertion and removal. At their C-terminus, adducins possess a myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) domain which regulates their capping activity. BDNF can reduce capping activities by upregulating PKC, which can bind to the adducing MRCKS domain, inhibit capping activity, and promote synaptogenesis through dendritic spine growth and disassembly and other activities.

=== Dendritogenesis ===

Local interaction of BDNF with the TrkB receptor on a single dendritic segment is able to stimulate an increase in PSD-95 trafficking to other separate dendrites as well as to the synapses of locally stimulated neurons. PSD-95 localizes the actin-remodeling GTPases, Rac and Rho, to synapses through the binding of its PDZ domain to kalirin, increasing the number and size of spines. Thus, BDNF-induced trafficking of PSD-95 to dendrites stimulates actin remodeling and causes dendritic growth in response to BDNF.

== Neurogenesis ==

Laboratory studies indicate that BDNF may play a role in neurogenesis. BDNF can promote protective pathways and inhibit damaging pathways in the NSCs and NPCs that contribute to the brain&#x27;s neurogenic response by enhancing cell survival. This becomes especially evident following suppression of TrkB activity. TrkB inhibition results in a 2–3 fold increase in cortical precursors displaying EGFP-positive condensed apoptotic nuclei and a 2–4 fold increase in cortical precursors that stained immunopositive for cleaved caspase-3. BDNF can also promote NSC and NPC proliferation through Akt activation and PTEN inactivation. Some studies suggest that BDNF may promote neuronal differentiation.

== Research ==
Preliminary research has focused on the possible links between BDNF and clinical conditions, such as depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

=== Schizophrenia ===

Preliminary studies have assessed a possible relationship between schizophrenia and BDNF. It has been shown that BDNF mRNA levels are decreased in cortical layers IV and V of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients, an area associated with working memory.

=== Depression ===

The neurotrophic hypothesis of depression states that depression is associated with a decrease in the levels of BDNF.

=== Epilepsy ===
Levels of both BDNF mRNA and BDNF protein are known to be up-regulated in epilepsy.
