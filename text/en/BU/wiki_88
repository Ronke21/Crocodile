<text>Bergama is a municipality and district of İzmir Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,544 km2, and its population is 105,754 (2022). By excluding İzmir&#x27;s metropolitan area, it is one of the prominent districts of the province in terms of population and is largely urbanized at the rate of 53.6%. Bergama center is situated at a distance of to the north from the point of departure of the traditional center of İzmir (Konak Square in Konak, İzmir) and lies at a distance of inland from the nearest seacoast at the town of Dikili to its west. Bergama district area neighbors the areas of three districts of Balıkesir Province to its north, namely Ayvalık, Burhaniye and İvrindi, İzmir Province district of Kınık and Manisa Province district of Soma to its east, while to the south it is bordered by Yunusemre district of Manisa Province and two other İzmir Province districts along the coast that are Aliağa and Dikili from its south towards its west. The district area&#x27;s physical features are determined by the alluvial plain of Bakırçay River.

==Name==
The name Bergama, as well as its ancient predecessor Pergamon, are thought to be connected with the even more ancient Luwian language adjective &quot;parrai&quot; (Hittite language equivalent; &quot;parku&quot;), meaning &quot;high&quot; in the same vein as being the etymological root of a number of other ancient cities across Anatolia. The ancient and modern Greek language form of the name is . In Turkish language, it has been adapted to Bergama. The name of Pergamos derives from Perga (as keramos from kera=earth, clay), although a Turkish author Özhan Öztürk claims that &quot;Bergama&quot; means &quot;high settlement/base&quot; in Hittite language, while Argoma (modern Suluova) in Amasya means &quot;border settlement&quot; at the Hittite-Kaskian border.

==General features==
Currently, known for its cotton, gold, and fine carpets, the city was the ancient Greek and Roman cultural center of Pergamon; its wealth of ancient ruins continues to attract considerable tourist interest today, although its famous Temple has been moved to the Pergamon Museum, in Berlin, Germany.

Located on a promontory north of the Bakırçay river, inland from the Aegean Sea, Bergama has a population of about 102,000. The ruins of the ancient city of Pergamon lie to the north and west of the modern city; Roman Pergamon is believed to have sustained a population of approximately 150,000 at its height in the 1st century AD.

Among Bergama&#x27;s notable ruins are the Sanctuary of Asclepius (or &quot;Asclepeion&quot;), a temple dedicated to an ancient Greek god of healing, a Greek Theater, and the Red Basilica complex (&quot;Kızıl Avlu&quot; in Turkish) that straddles the Selinus River, a 2nd-century AD construction likely built by Hadrian. The town also features an archaeological museum.

== History==

The city of Pergamon was the capital of the Attalid kingdom from 281 BC to 133 BC and then became part of the Roman province of Asia. It remained under Eastern Roman rule in the Middle Ages except for Sassanid invasion in 620s, Umayyad invasion in 715 and Sultanate of Rum rule between 1074 and 1097. It was conquered by Karasids and then Aydinids in 1302. It was part of Ottoman Empire in 1337. During Ottoman rule, it was part of the Sanjak of Karesi between 1337 and 1868, in Saruhan one (Its centre was Manisa) between 1868 and 1877 and finally in İzmir one. From 1867 until 1922, Bergama was part of Aidin Vilayet and had a mixed population of Turks, Greeks, Armenians and Jews. Many Greeks were expelled by Turks in 1914. During the Turkish War of Independence, it was occupied by Greece on June 19, 1919, but came under Turkish control again on September 14, 1922. The Greek Army burnt down the city while retreating in 1922. The remaining Greek inhabitants were expelled in the population exchange and founded new communities in Lesvos and Gallikos in Greece.

==Climate==
Bergama has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), with very hot, dry summers, and cool to mild, moderately wet winters.

===Historic bridges===
As an ancient settlement at the northern edge of the Bakırçay River valley, with tributary streams flowing down from the Madra Mountains, Bergama retains many historic bridges. 

The area next to the River Selinus (Bergama Çayı) at the base of the Pergamon Massif was developed extensively in Roman times, and the Selinus was canalized to allow construction along the river&#x27;s course. By the reign of Hadrian (AD 117–138), development was so extensive that the Selinus was enclosed in two long tunnels where it runs in front of the Red Basilica, allowing a huge sacred precinct or &quot;temenos&quot;, to be built on top. The resulting structure, the Pergamon Bridge (sometimes known as Musluk Köprusu, survives to this day. Each of the tunnels spans ; the northern one has a length of and the southern . The entrance to the structure is at approximately and the exit at .

Other ancient bridges in Bergama include:

* The Ulucami Bridge, with two unequal spans. 
* The Tabak Bridge, with two roughly equal spans. 
* The Üçkemer Bridge, whose name means &quot;three arches&quot;, a longer bridge approached on the south end by a ramp parallel to the river. 

==Allianoi==

Allianoi is an ancient spa settlement, with remains dating predominantly from the Roman Empire period (2nd century AD) located near the city of Bergama (ancient Pergamon) in Turkey&#x27;s İzmir Province. The site is at a distance of to the northeast of Bergama, on the road to the neighboring town of İvrindi.

One particularity of Allianoi is its being a very recent historical discovery. It was mentioned only once in the 2nd century by the orator and medicinal writer Aelius Aristides in his &quot;Hieroi Logoi&quot; (&quot;Sacred Tales&quot;) (III.1), one of the key sources for the knowledge on the science of healing as it was understood at that time. No other writer of antiquity nor any epigraphic finding known had referred to Allianoi.

==Kozak Plateau==

Kozak Plateau (&quot;Kozak Yaylası&quot;) is a high plain at an altitude varying between and starting at a distance of from Bergama center in the northern direction. The plain is a favorite regional excursion area, famed for its hand-made textile products and pine forests whose pine nut is also extensively exported.

==Ovacık gold mine==
Recently, Bergama also made headlines in the context of controversies based on environmental concerns over the gold mine in Ovacık village.

== Wind turbine manufacturing ==
LM Wind Power, a division of GE Renewable Energy, opened a wind turbine blade manufacturing facility in Bergama in 2017. The first blades it produced were used at the Bodangora Wind Farm in New South Wales, Australia.

==Bergama Carpets==
Bergama is also renowned for its high quality carpets. There are approximately eighty villages that still weave Bergama carpets. The history of carpet weaving in Bergama dates back to the 11th century - when Turkish migration started to the area. Bergama carpets have almost always been woven with wool - an attestation to the pastoral life style of the Yörük clans populating the area at the time.

Although the history of carpet weaving in Bergama dates back to the 11th century, most surviving carpets do not age more than 200 years - mainly due to their wool content. The oldest surviving Bergama carpets can be found in mosques in and around Bergama, as well as the archaeological museum in Bergama.

==Bergama Festival==
Between June 18–24, Bergama celebrates its annual festival &quot;Bergama Kermesi&quot;, which is already running into its seventy-second anniversary. Bergama Kermesi is a major local event, generally celebrated with the attendance of Turkish celebrities, singers, players, poets, and writers.

<text>Cerdanya (; , ; , ) is a &quot;comarca&quot; in northern Catalonia, in the Pyrenees, on the border of Catalonia with France and Andorra. Within Catalonia, Cerdanya is divided between Catalan provinces of Girona and Lleida. Cerdanya&#x27;s neighbouring comarques are Alt Urgell, Berguedà, and Ripollès.

Cerdanya is in the &quot;vegueria&quot; of Alt Pirineu, according to &quot;Vegueries of Catalonia law&quot;.

The area is sometimes called Baixa Cerdanya (; literally &quot;Lower Cerdanya&quot;) to distinguish it from &quot;Alta Cerdanya&quot; (&quot;Upper Cerdanya&quot;) which was ceded to France by the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, dividing the wider Cerdanya.

&quot;Subcomarques&quot; include la Batllia or petita Cerdanya, and el Baridà.

Llívia is a Catalan exclave in Cerdanya, completely surrounded by French territory.

<text>[[Excise tax]] in the United States is an indirect tax on listed items. Excise taxes can be and are made by federal, state, and local governments and are not uniform throughout the United States. Certain goods, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, alcohol, and tobacco products, are taxed by multiple governments simultaneously. Some excise taxes are collected from the producer or retailer and not paid directly by the consumer, and as such, often remain &quot;hidden&quot; in the price of a product or service rather than being listed separately.

==Federal excise taxes and revenues==

Federal excise taxes raised $86.8 billion in fiscal year 2020 or 2.5% of total federal tax revenue.

===Fuel===

Federal excise taxes have been stable at 18.4¢ per gallon for gasoline and 24.4¢ per gallon for diesel fuel since 1993. This raised $37.4 billion in fiscal year 2015. These fuel taxes raised 90% of the Highway Trust Fund. The average of state taxes on fuel was 31.02¢ per gallon for gasoline and 32.66¢ per gallon for diesel fuel in 2021. However, most states exempt gasoline from general sales taxes. The total state and federal taxes are relatively low compared to other industrialized countries, already without consideration of the sales tax rebate.

===Airport &amp; airway trust fund===
Excise taxes dedicated to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund raised $9.0 billion in fiscal year 2020, down from $16.0 billion in fiscal year 2019. 90% of the excise tax revenue comes from taxing passenger air fares, and the remaining 10% comes from air cargo and aviation fuel taxes.

===Affordable Care Act excise taxes===
Excise taxes for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) raised $16.3 billion in fiscal year 2015. $11.3 billion was an excise tax placed directly on health insurers based on their market share. The ACA was going to impose a 40% &quot;Cadillac tax&quot; on expensive Employer-sponsored health insurance, but that was postponed until 2018, and later further postponed and eventually repealed before its rollout on December 20, 2019. Annual excise taxes totaling $3 billion were levied on importers and manufacturers of prescription drugs. An excise tax of 2.32% on medical devices and a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services are applied as well. The same budget bill that repealed the Cadillac tax also repealed the medical device tax for all sales occurring after December 31.

===Tobacco===
Excise taxes on tobacco raised $12.4 billion in fiscal year 2020. The tax equals $1.01 per pack of 20 of cigarettes. Federal excise tax revenue from tobacco products peaked in fiscal year 2010 at $17.2 billion after the increase in tobacco product tax rates in the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009. This tax increase, which took effect in April 2009, was the most recent time federal tobacco tax rates were changed. The federal tobacco product excise tax does not apply to certain products, including electronic cigarettes.

===Alcohol===
Excise taxes on alcoholic beverages raised $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2020.

===Cannabis===
In 2020, state and local governments earned over $3 billion in tax revenue from cannabis taxes.

==Constitutional law==
The U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1789, gave the federal government authority to tax, stating that Congress has the power to
... lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States;

Tariffs between states are prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, and all domestically made products can be imported or shipped to another state tax-free. In the U.S. constitutional law sense, an excise tax is usually an &quot;event&quot; tax (as opposed to a &quot;state of being&quot; tax). A recent exception to this &quot;state of being&quot; principle is the &quot;minimum essential coverage&quot; tax under Internal Revenue Code section 5000A as enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148), whereby a tax penalty is imposed as an indirect tax on the condition of not having health insurance coverage; as reasoned by Chief Justice John Roberts in &quot;National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius&quot;: &quot;it is triggered by specific circumstances.&quot;

Federal excise taxes are also required by the U.S. Constitution (Article 1, Section 8) to be uniform throughout the United States:
...all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.

==Historical background==
Federal excise taxes have a storied background in the United States. Responding to an urgent need for revenue following the American Revolutionary War, after the ninth state ratified the U.S. Constitution in 1788 the newly elected First United States Congress passed, and President George Washington, signed the Tariff Act of July 4, 1789, which authorized the collection of tariff duties (customs) on imported goods. Tariffs and excise taxes were authorized by the United States Constitution and recommended by the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, in 1789, to tax foreign imports. Hamilton thought it was important to start the U.S. federal government out on a sound financial basis with good credit and a regular, easily collected source of revenue. Customs duties (tariffs) on imported goods, as set by tariff rates, were the source of about 80–95% of all federal revenue up to 1860. Having just fought a war over taxation (among other things), the U.S. Congress wanted a reliable source of income that was relatively unobtrusive, brought in enough money to pay off the debt and pay for the relatively low-cost federal government (at the time) and be relatively easy to collect. Tariffs met all these criteria.

In addition to tariffs, low excise taxes were imposed to provide the federal government with some additional money to pay part of its operating expenses and to help redeem at full value U.S. federal debts and the debts the states had accumulated during the American Revolutionary War.

The first federal budget was about $4.6 million, and the population in the 1790 U.S. Census was about four million, so the average federal tax was about $1/person per year. At that time, tradespeople earned about $0.25 a day for a 10- to 12-hour day so that federal taxes could be paid with about four days of work. Paying even this was usually optional, as taxed imports listed on the tariff lists could usually be avoided by buying domestic products if desired.

Congress set low excise taxes on only a few goods, such as whiskey, rum, tobacco, snuff and refined sugar. These low excise taxes accounted for only a small percentage of the federal income (see table on U.S. Historical Taxes). Tariffs (custom duties) were initially by far the largest source of federal revenue. The excise tax on whiskey was so despised by western farmers who had no easy way to transport their bulky grain harvests to market without converting them into alcohol that it led to the Whiskey Rebellion, which had to be quelled by President Washington calling up the militia and suppressing the rebellious farmers, all of whom were later pardoned. In the days before steamboats, canals, railroads, etc., bulky cargo could not economically be shipped far. The whiskey excise tax collected so little and was so despised that it was abolished by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802.

In the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812, the imports and tariff taxes in the United States plummeted, and Congress in 1812 brought back the excise tax on whiskey to partially compensate for the loss of customs/tariff revenue. Within a few years, customs duties brought in enough federal income to abolish nearly all federal taxes except tariffs again. When the United States public debt was finally paid off in 1834, President Andrew Jackson abolished the excise taxes and reduced the customs duties (tariffs) in half.

Excise taxes stayed essentially zero until the American Civil War brought a need for much more federal revenue. Excise taxes were reintroduced on a wider range of items, and income taxes were introduced. Progressive activists, including the temperance movement, successfully lobbied for the 16th Amendment establishing a federal income tax to reduce the government&#x27;s dependence on alcohol taxes for revenue.

By about 1916, the loans taken out during the Civil War were all paid off, and the excise taxes were again set very low. On January 16, 1919, the 18th Amendment was passed, and alcohol production, sale, and transport were prohibited. Taxing alcohol products would have produced almost no income, given that alcohol sales and production had gone underground. All federal excise taxes remained practically zero for the next ten years.

During the Great Depression (1929–1939), President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress started reintroducing excise taxes to increase federal income, which had dropped because of the much lower incomes and the resulting lower income tax collections. On December 5, 1933, the 21st Amendment was ratified, and alcohol production became legal again. The healthy excise tax on now-legal alcoholic beverages paid about one-third of all federal taxes during the Great Depression.

Excise taxes have become an established part of the general budget and the source of funds for various trusts. The U.S. has expanded the definition of items on the excise tax lists as trusts for highways, airports, vaccines, black lung, oil spills, etc. have been set up. Excise taxes on fuels, tickets, vaccines, coal, oil, etc. finance these.

==Excise tax types==
For purposes of the U.S. Constitution, an excise tax can be broadly defined as any indirect tax (usually, a tax on an event). In this sense, an excise means any tax &quot;other than&quot;: (1) a property tax or ad valorem tax because of its ownership; (2) a tax per head tax or capitation tax by being present (very rare in the United States).

In this broad sense, income taxes, value added taxes (VATs), sales taxes, and transfer taxes are examples of other excise taxes but are typically not called excise taxes (in the United States) because of the different ways they are imposed. In the United States, the only excise taxes are the taxes on quantities of enumerated items (whiskey, wine, tobacco, gasoline, tires, etc.). Other taxes on specific events may technically be considered excise taxes in the broad sense but may or may not be collected under the name &quot;excise tax&quot;, where the term is used in a different, more narrow sense.

In the more narrow sense, taxes denominated as &quot;excise&quot; taxes are usually taxes on events, such as the purchase of a quantity of a particular item like gasoline, diesel fuel, beer, liquor, wine, cigarettes, airline tickets, tires, trucks, etc. These taxes are usually included in the item&#x27;s price, not listed separately like sales taxes usually are. To minimize tax accounting complications, the excise tax is generally imposed on quantities like gallons of fuel, wine or drinking alcohol, packets of cigarettes, etc. It is usually paid initially by the manufacturer or retailer.

The burdens of excise taxes are often passed on to the consumer, who eventually &quot;consumes&quot; the product. The price for which the item is ultimately sold is not generally considered in calculating the excise tax amount.

An example of a &quot;state of being&quot; tax is an ad valorem property tax—which is not an excise. Customs or tariffs are based on the property (usually imported goods) as a &quot;state of being&quot; or ad valorem taxes and are also typically not called excise taxes. Excise taxes are collected by producers and retailers and paid to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other state or local government tax collection agency. Historical federal excise tax collections to 1945 are listed in the &quot;Historical Statistics of the United States&quot; and more recent federal excise tax data is listed in the White House historical tables.

An excise is imposed on listed specific taxable events or products and is usually not collected or paid directly by the consumer. Excise taxes are collected by the producer or retailer and delivered to the IRS, state or local tax agency. The producer can usually pass at least some of the excise tax burden to the consumer, the amount of which is added to the price of the product when it is sold. The degree to which consumers and producers will share the burden, called tax incidence, depends upon the price elasticities of supply and demand. Often, sales taxes are collected as a percentage of the cost of the product, including its excise tax—a tax on a tax.

Traditionally, the federal government has left property and sales taxes to the states and local governments for their revenue. Tariffs or customs duties on imported goods are essentially the only property taxes imposed by the U.S. federal government. Tariffs can be set only by the federal government, not by any state or local jurisdiction. A customs duty or tariff is nominally separate from an excise tax for U.S. constitutional law purposes. Excise taxes can be (and are) set by federal, state, and local jurisdictions.

Many taxes are called an excise tax in the statute imposing that tax (an excise in the &quot;statutory law&quot; sense) even though they could more accurately be called some other kind of tax. Different taxes have accumulated over the years under the excise tax classification.

Often, trust funds do not collect enough taxes because the legislators assume setting the excise tax rates and allowable trust fund projects results in underfunding. Changing consumer purchases have wronged the original assumptions, which may result in underfunding. Because many funds are allocated to repay bonds and other long-term projects, they often require an infusion of general funds to stay solvent. Long-term adjustments of tax rates or a less extensive list of allowable trust fund projects to keep the funds solvent require bi-partisan agreements, which are rare.

The excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and firearms are administered under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in the United States Department of the Treasury. The total excise taxes on gasoline, diesel etc. for each state have been calculated.

Federal Trust Fund excise tax collections are often remitted to each state by complicated allocation plans. The Highway Trust Fund revenue is split between highways and transit systems. The Highway Account normally receives about 85% of all highway trust fund taxes, and the Mass Transit Account receives about 15% of all Highway Trust Fund excise tax collections.

The Highway Trust Fund may well require tax rate adjustments to stay solvent and make up for increasing fuel economy standards dictated by the Environmental Protection Agency or the increased use of untaxed plug-in electric vehicles. As fuel prices rise, there is a slight decrease in gallons of fuel bought as vehicles are made more efficient and/or travel shorter distances, all of which reduce Highway Trust Fund collections. Federal funding of the Highway Trust Fund is restricted for capital expenditures, such as constructing and reconstructing roads, bridges, or tunnels or paying bonds sold to finance the work.

The bulk of funding is for specific programs set up to channel aid to the states for various uses, such as providing capital for the nation&#x27;s most heavily used roads, maintaining interstates, and fixing bridges. Regular maintenance on non-interstate roads, including pothole patching and snowplowing, must be funded through other sources. Funding often requires a partial dollar match by the states. The Mass Transit Account, which gets its funding from a fraction of the excise taxes imposed on fuels, etc., has similar restrictions.

==Statutory law==
The term &quot;excise&quot; also has a statutory law meaning. Generally, any statute that imposes a tax denominated explicitly as an &quot;excise&quot; in the United States is an excise tax law. U.S. federal statutory excises are (or have been) imposed under Subtitle D (&quot;miscellaneous excise taxes&quot;) and Subtitle E (&quot;Alcohol, Tobacco, and Certain Other Excise Taxes&quot;) of the Internal Revenue Code, through , relating to such things as luxury passenger automobiles, heavy trucks and trailers, &quot;gas guzzler&quot; vehicles, tires, petroleum products, coal, vaccines, recreational equipment, firearms (see National Firearms Act), communications services (see telephone federal excise tax), air transportation, policies issued by foreign insurance companies, wagering, water transportation, removal of hard mineral resources from deep seabeds, chemicals, certain imported substances, non-deductible contributions to certain employer plans, and many other subjects. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts charges what it calls an &quot;excise tax&quot; on all vehicles, even though this is, in fact, an ad valorem tax.

Excise duties usually have one or two purposes: to raise revenue and to discourage particular behavior or purchase of specific items. Taxes such as those on sales of fuel, alcohol, and tobacco are often &quot;justified&quot; on both grounds. Some economists suggest that the optimal revenue-raising taxes should be levied on sales of items having an inelastic demand; in contrast, behavior-altering taxes should be assessed where demand is elastic. Most items on the excise tax lists are relatively inelastic &quot;addictions&quot; with only long-term elasticity.

One of the most common excises in the United States is the cigarette tax imposed by the federal and state governments. This tax is simply an excise tax applied to each pack of cigarettes. Specifically, the federal government uniformly charges an excise tax of $1.01 for a standard pack of 20 cigarettes. On top of the federal tax, all 50 states levy a different cigarette tax that ranges from $0.17 per pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in New York. Overall, the excise taxes constitute most of the retail cost of cigarettes. Cigarette taxes can be avoided in some jurisdictions if consumers purchase loose tobacco and cigarette paper separately or by purchasing cigarettes from lower-taxing states.

Excise taxes can be imposed and collected at the point of production or importation or the point of sale and then remitted to the Internal Revenue Service or state or local taxing agency. The federal government often collects some excise taxes. Then, it remits to the states on a partially matching basis to pay for items like interstate highway construction, airport construction, or bridge repairs. Excise taxes are usually waived or refunded on goods being exported to encourage exports. Smugglers and other tax evaders will often seek to obtain items at a point where they are not taxed or taxed much lower and then later sell or use them at a price lower than the post-tax price in their jurisdiction.

For similar items, excise duties are the same for imported and domestically produced goods; if the tax differs, there is an explicit or implicit customs duty or tariff.

An unusual example of a state &quot;excise&quot; tax is found in the State of Hawaii. Instead of a sales tax, the State of Hawaii imposes a General Excise Tax, or GET, on all business activity in the State. The GET is charged at a rate of 4% for most businesses and 0.5% for wholesalers. The tax is imposed on all business entities, so the tax is collected at every level of production (material supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer.) The GET is also charged on all business service activity, such as real estate agent commissions, lawyer fees, etc. A more accurate tax term would be a value added tax or VAT.

With Hawaii&#x27;s industry heavily dependent on tourism and tourist spending, the state regularly raises nearly half its government revenues through the imposition of the GET. Hawaii&#x27;s GET has been criticized for having a disproportionate impact on low-income families because of the fact it is charged on intermediary transactions (such as those between wholesaler and retailer) as well as services, resulting in a pyramiding effect as costs rise with final retail prices.

==Excise tax enforcement==
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), formed in 1886, is a federal law enforcement organization within the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). Its responsibilities include the investigation and prevention of federal offenses involving the unlawful use, manufacture, and possession of firearms and explosives; acts of arson and bombings; and illegal manufacturing and trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products that avoid paying the federal excise taxes on these products.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) within the United States Department of the Treasury is responsible for collecting over one million excise tax returns that contain almost $70 billion in excise taxes. IRS Publication 510 lists all the forms, rates, rules, etc. on federal excise tax collection. The IRS is authorized to sue people who violate the excise tax rules and have them incarcerated.

==Commentary on excises==
Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; defined &quot;excise&quot; in 1755 as &quot;A hateful tax levied upon commodities, and adjudged not by the common judges of property, but wretches hired by those to whom excise is paid.&quot;

<text>John Buford Jr. (March 4, 1826 – December 16, 1863) was a United States Army cavalry officer. He fought for the Union during the American Civil War, rising to the rank of brigadier general. Buford is best known for his actions in the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, by identifying Cemetery Hill and Cemetery Ridge as high ground that would be crucial in the impending battle, and by placing vedettes (the cavalry equivalent of &quot;picket lines&quot;) to the west and north that delayed the enemy long enough for the Union Army to arrive.

Born in the divided border state of Kentucky, Buford graduated from West Point in 1848. He remained loyal to the United States when the Civil War broke out and fought against the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia as part of the Army of the Potomac. His first command was a cavalry brigade under Major General John Pope. He distinguished himself at Second Bull Run in August 1862, where he was wounded. He also saw action at Antietam in September and during Stoneman&#x27;s Raid in spring 1863.

Buford&#x27;s cavalry division played a crucial role in the Gettysburg Campaign that summer. Arriving at the small town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on June 30, before the Confederate troops, Buford set up defensive positions. On the morning of July 1, Buford&#x27;s division was attacked by a Confederate division under the command of Major General Henry Heth. His men held just long enough for Union reinforcements to arrive. After a massive three-day battle, the Union troops emerged victorious. Later, Buford rendered valuable service to the Army, both in the pursuit of Robert E. Lee after the Battle of Gettysburg, and in the Bristoe Campaign that autumn, but his health started to fail, possibly from typhoid. Just before his death at age 37, he received a personal message from President Abraham Lincoln, promoting him to major general of volunteers in recognition of his tactical skill and leadership displayed on the first day of Gettysburg.

==Early years==
Buford was born in Woodford County, Kentucky, but was raised in Rock Island, Illinois, at the age of eight. John, his father, was a prominent Democratic politician in Illinois and a political opponent of Abraham Lincoln. Buford was of English descent. His family had a long military tradition. John Jr.&#x27;s grandfather, Simeon Buford, served in the cavalry during the American Revolutionary War under Henry &quot;Lighthorse&quot; Lee, the father of Robert E. Lee. His great-uncle, Colonel Abraham Buford (of the Battle of Waxhaws), also served in a Virginia regiment. His half-brother, Napoleon Bonaparte Buford, would become a major general in the Union Army, while his cousin, Abraham Buford, would become a cavalry brigadier general in the Confederate States Army.
After attending Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, for one year, Buford was accepted into the Class of 1848 at the United States Military Academy (West Point). Upperclassmen during Buford&#x27;s time at West Point included Fitz-John Porter (Class of 1845), George B. McClellan (1846), Thomas J. Jackson (1846), George Pickett (1846), and two future commanders and friends, George Stoneman (1846) and Ambrose Burnside (1847). The Class of 1847 also included A. P. Hill and Henry Heth, two men Buford would face at Gettysburg on the morning of July 1, 1863. Buford and Heth fought together in the U.S. Army in 1855 during the Battle of Ash Hollow in the First Sioux War.

Buford graduated 16th of 38 cadets and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Dragoons, transferring the next year to the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. He served in Texas and against the Sioux, including in the Battle of Ash Hollow (also known as the Harney Massacre), on peacekeeping duty in Bleeding Kansas, and in the Utah War in 1858. He was stationed at Fort Crittenden, Utah, from 1859 to 1861. He studied the works of General John Watts de Peyster, who urged that the skirmish line become the new line of battle.

==Civil War==
Throughout 1860, Buford and his fellow soldiers had lived with talk of secession and the possibility of civil war, until the Pony Express brought word that Fort Sumter had been fired upon in April 1861, confirming secession as fact. As was the case with many West Pointers, Buford had to choose between North and South. Based on his background, Buford had ample reason to join the Confederacy. He was a native Kentuckian, the son of a slave-owning father, and the husband of a woman whose relatives would fight for the South, as would a number of his own. On the other hand, Buford had been educated in the North and come to maturity within the Army. His two most influential professional role models, Colonels William S. Harney and Philip St. George Cooke, were Southerners who elected to remain with the Union and the U.S. Army. He loved his profession and his time on the frontier had snapped the ties that drew other Southerners home.

John Gibbon, a North Carolinian facing the same dilemma, recalled in a post-war memoir the evening that John Buford committed himself to the Union:

In November 1861, Buford was appointed Assistant Inspector General with the rank of major, and, in July 1862, after having served for several months in the defense of Washington, was raised to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers. In 1862, he was given his first position, under Major General John Pope, as commander of the II Corps Cavalry Brigade of the Union Army of Virginia, which fought with distinction at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Buford personally led a charge late in the battle, but was wounded in the knee by a spent bullet. The injury was painful, but not serious, although some Union newspapers reported that he had been killed. He returned to active service, and served as chief of cavalry to Major Generals George B. McClellan and Ambrose E. Burnside in the Army of the Potomac. Unfortunately, this assignment was nothing more than a staff position, and he chafed for a field command. In McClellan&#x27;s Maryland Campaign, Buford was in the battles of South Mountain and Antietam, replacing Brigadier General George Stoneman on McClellan&#x27;s staff. Under Major General Joseph Hooker in 1863, however, Buford was given the Reserve Brigade of regular cavalry in the 1st Division, Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. 

After the Battle of Chancellorsville, Major General Alfred Pleasonton was given command of the Cavalry Corps, although Hooker later agreed that Buford would have been the better choice. Buford first led his new division at the Battle of Brandy Station, which was virtually an all-cavalry engagement, and then again at the Battle of Upperville.

In the Gettysburg Campaign, Buford, who had been promoted to command of the 1st Division, is credited with selecting the field of battle at Gettysburg. On June 30, Buford&#x27;s command rode into the small town of Gettysburg. Very soon, Buford realized that he was facing a superior force of Confederates to his front and set about creating a defense against the advance. He was acutely aware of the tactical importance of holding the high ground south of Gettysburg, and so he did, beginning one of the most important battles in American military history. His skillful defensive troop dispositions, coupled with the bravery and tenacity of his dismounted men, allowed the I Corps, under Major General John F. Reynolds, time to come up in support and thus maintain a Union foothold in tactically important positions. Despite Lee&#x27;s barrage attack of 140 cannons and a final infantry attack on the third day of the battle, the Union army won a strategic victory. The importance of Buford&#x27;s leadership and tactical foresight on July 1 cannot be overstated in its contribution to this victory. Afterwards, Buford&#x27;s troopers were sent by Pleasonton to Emmitsburg, Maryland, to resupply and refit, an ill-advised decision that uncovered the Union left flank.

In the Retreat from Gettysburg, Buford pursued the Confederates to Warrenton, Virginia, and was afterwards engaged in many operations in central Virginia, rendering particularly valuable service in covering Major General George Meade&#x27;s retrograde movement in the October 1863 Bristoe Campaign.

==Death and legacy==
By mid-December, it was obvious that Buford was sick, possibly from contracting typhoid, and he took respite at the Washington home of his good friend, General George Stoneman. On December 16, Stoneman initiated the proposal that Buford be promoted to major general, and President Abraham Lincoln assented, writing as follows: &quot;I am informed that General Buford will not survive the day. It suggests itself to me that he will be made Major General for distinguished and meritorious service at the Battle of Gettysburg.&quot; Informed of the promotion, Buford inquired doubtfully, &quot;Does he mean it?&quot; When assured the promotion was genuine, he replied simply, &quot;It is too late, now I wish I could live.&quot;

In the last hours, Buford was attended by his aide, future Battle of the Little Big Horn officer, Captain Myles Keogh, and by Edward, his black servant. Also present were Lieutenant Colonel A. J. Alexander and General Stoneman. His wife Pattie was traveling from Rock Island, Illinois, but would not arrive in time. Near the end, he became delirious and began admonishing Edward, but then, in a moment of clarity, called for the man and apologized: &quot;Edward, I hear that I have been scolding you. I did not know what I was doing. You have been a faithful servant, Edward.&quot;

John Buford died at 2 p.m., December 16, 1863, while Myles Keogh held him in his arms. His final reported words were &quot;Put guards on all the roads, and don&#x27;t let the men run to the rear.&quot;

On December 20, memorial services were held at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, a church on the corner of H. Street and New York Avenue in Washington, D.C. President Lincoln was among the mourners. Buford&#x27;s wife was unable to attend due to illness. The pallbearers included Generals Casey, Heintzelman, Sickles, Schofield, Hancock, Doubleday, and Warren. General Stoneman commanded the escort in a procession that included &quot;Grey Eagle,&quot; Buford&#x27;s old white horse that he rode at Gettysburg.

After the service, two of Buford&#x27;s staff, Captains Keogh and Wadsworth, escorted his body to West Point, where he was buried alongside fellow Gettysburg hero Lieutenant Alonzo Cushing, who had died defending the &quot;high ground&quot; (Cemetery Ridge) that Buford had chosen. In 1865, a 25-foot obelisk style monument was erected over his grave, financed by members of his old division. The officers of his staff published a resolution that set forth the esteem in which he was held by those in his command:

In 1866, a military fort established on the Missouri-Yellowstone confluence in what is now North Dakota, was named Fort Buford after the general. The community of Buford, Wyoming, was renamed in the general&#x27;s honor. The town, nearly uninhabited, was sold at auction for $900,000 on April 5, 2012, to an unnamed Vietnamese buyer by its owner, who had served in the U.S. military in 1968–1969.

In 1895, a bronze statue of Buford designed by artist James E. Kelly was dedicated on the Gettysburg Battlefield.

The M8 Armored Gun System, an American light tank canceled in 1996, is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Buford&quot; in his honor.

==In popular media==
Buford was portrayed by Sam Elliott in the 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, based on Michael Shaara&#x27;s novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;.

Buford is a character in the alternate history novel &quot;&quot;, written by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen.

<text>Number 10 Squadron is a Royal Air Force squadron. The squadron has served in a variety of roles (observation, bombing, transport and aerial refuelling) over its 90-year history. It currently flies the Airbus Voyager KC2/KC3 in the transport/tanker role from RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire.

==History==

===First World War===

No. 10 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed from a nucleus provided by No. 1 Reserve Aircraft Squadron on 1 January 1915 at Farnborough Airfield, Hampshire. It initially acted as a training squadron until 27 July 1915 when it relocated to Saint-Omer on Western Front in France. No. 10 Squadron&#x27;s first major engagement was providing spotting for the Indian Corps during the Battle of Loos in September 1915 with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2. The squadron also participated in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. In April 1917, No. 10 Squadron carried out spotting and bombing duties during the Second Battle of Arras. The squadron re-equipped with the Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8 in September 1917.

In June 1918, No. 10 Squadron began to receive the Bristol F.2b. The squadron participated in the Second Battle of the Somme between August and September 1918. The squadron briefly spent time in Germany as part of the army of occupation after the armistice. On 8 February 1919, the squadron was reduced to a cadre and returned to the UK. It was disbanded on 31 December 1919 following the end of the First World War, like many other squadrons.

===Interwar===
On 3 January 1928, No. 10 Squadron was reformed as a night bomber unit at RAF Upper Heyford with the Handley Page Hyderabad. The unit relocated to RAF Boscombe Down in April 1931 and re-equipped with the Handley Page Hinaidi. These soon gave way to the Vickers Virginia in September 1932 before being replaced by the Handley Page Heyford in 1934. On 16 September 1935, the unit helped provide the nucleus to form No. 97 Squadron and later helped form No. 78 Squadron on 1 November 1936. No. 10 Squadron moved to RAF Dishforth on 25 January 1937 to form part of the newly created No. 4 Group of RAF Bomber Command (which they would remain a part of throughout the Second World War), converting to the monoplane Armstrong Whitworth Whitley Mk.I.

===Second World War===

On 8 September 1939, No. 10 Squadron began its first operation of the Second World War when it flew a leaflet dropping mission over Germany with the Whitley Mk.IV. On the night of 11/12 June 1940, Whitleys from No. 10 Squadron launched a raid on the Italian cities of Turin and Genoa. On 8 July 1940, the unit moved to RAF Leeming, Yorkshire. On 23 September 1940, the squadron launched a raid on the Boulogne docks in occupied-France.

In December 1941, the squadron converted to the Handley Page Halifax Mk.I/Mk.II. In July 1942, the squadron was split in two when a detachment was sent to RAF Aqir, British Mandate, which went on to form No. 462 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force. On 19 August 1942, No. 10 Squadron relocated to RAF Melbourne, Yorkshire, where it would remain until the end of the war in Europe.

On 7 May 1945, No. 10 Squadron was transferred to Transport Command and converted over to the Douglas Dakota. The squadron relocated to RAF Broadwell, Oxfordshire, on 6 August 1945.

===Post-War===
====Transport Command (1945–1950)====
Following the end of the war, No. 10 Squadron relocated to India in October 1945 where it carried out transport duties until it disbanded on 20 December 1947. The squadron was reformed once more on 4 October 1948 when No. 238 Squadron was renumbered to No. 10 Squadron at RAF Oakington, Cambridgeshire. Between 1948 and 1949, the squadron took part in the Berlin Airlift, operating from RAF Lübeck. No. 10 Squadron disbanded once more on 20 February 1950.

====Bomber Command (1953–1964)====
On 15 January 1953, No. 10 Squadron reverted to its original bomber role upon its reformation at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, with the English Electric Canberra B.2. In April 1955, the squadron moved to RAF Honington, Suffolk, while Scampton was closed for runway works. Between October and November 1956, No. 10 Squadron deployed to RAF Nicosia, Cyprus, during the Suez Crisis. From RAF Nicosia, Canberra B.2 &quot;WH853&quot; of No. 10 Squadron dropped the first RAF bombs on Egypt during a raid on Almaza Air Base on 31 October 1956. The squadron disbanded on 15 January 1957.

No. 10 Squadron reformed at RAF Cottesmore on 15 April 1958 flying the Handley Page Victor B.1 until disbandment on 1 March 1964.

====Vickers VC10 (1966–2005)====

The squadron&#x27;s numberplate was transferred back from Bomber Command to Transport Command in 1965, and on 1 July 1966 the squadron reformed at RAF Brize Norton as the first operators to receive the new Vickers VC10 C.1.

Fourteen VC10 C.1s were delivered to 10 Squadron between 1966 and 1967. The C.1 was a variant of the civil &#x27;Standard VC10&#x27; fitted with the wing and more powerful engines of the &#x27;Super VC10&#x27;. The C.1 could carry 139 passengers in rear-facing seats, eight standard pallets or up to 78 medical evacuation stretchers. These VC10s were named after airmen who had been awarded the Victoria Cross.

The most visible role No. 10 Squadron&#x27;s VC10s played was that of VIP transport and aeromedical evacuations. In the VIP role the C1s flew the British Royal Family, government ministers and Prime Ministers around the world. Later the VC10 VIP role was phased out, VIP transport being carried out by chartered British Airways 767s and the RAF BAe 146 fleet. However, former Prime Minister Tony Blair reverted to the VC10 for more sensitive flights, notably during his diplomacy to Pakistan and the Middle East after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The rationalisation of the VC10 force led to No. 10 Squadron being disbanded on 14 October 2005, with their C.1(K) aircraft transferred to No. 101 Squadron.

===Airbus Voyager (2011–present)===

In 2011, with the closure of RAF Lyneham and the transfer of the RAF&#x27;s Hercules force to Brize Norton, it was announced that No. 10 Squadron would be reformed as the first operator of the new Airbus Voyager. The squadron was officially reformed on 1 July 2011. The first Voyager (&quot;ZZ330&quot;) was delivered to Brize Norton on 5 April 2012. Operations began with the Voyager on 12 May 2012, with a sortie flown from RAF Brize Norton to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus. The first air-to-air refuelling flight with the Voyager took place on 20 May 2013, when No. 10 Squadron refuelled Panavia Tornado GR4s. No. 10 Squadron has helped support Operation Shader since September 2014.

<text>Fudbalski klub Borac Banja Luka (Serbian Cyrillic: Фудбалски клуб Бopaц Бања Лука, ) is a Bosnian professional football club, based in the city of Banja Luka, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is the major part of the Borac Banja Luka Sports Society. Borac Banja Luka is one of the most popular football clubs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The name &quot;Borac&quot; means &quot;Fighter&quot;.

Currently, Borac is a part of the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina and plays its home matches at the Banja Luka City Stadium, which has a capacity of 10,030 seats.

==History==

===Early years (1926–1953)===

The football club Borac Banja Luka was founded on 4 July 1926. Originally it was named &quot;Radnički sportski klub Borac&quot;, which means Labour Sports Club Borac, Borac meaning &quot;Fighter&quot;, and its roots come from the relation the club had with local labour movements during the first half of the 20th century. The club was founded by a group of football enthusiasts including the writer, activist and People&#x27;s Hero of Yugoslavia Veselin Masleša, Rudolf &quot;Rudi&quot; Hiter, Savo Novaković, Nikola Pucar, Brane Pucar, Mustafa Softić, Nikola Kuković, Žarko Vranješević, Mile Stefanović and Brane Stefanović among others. They financed the club believing that by backing and supporting it, they would directly help promote the labour movements struggle that was underway. The name &quot;Borac&quot; was given by Masleša who said: &quot;If you are going to fight for workers&#x27; rights, why don&#x27;t you give the club name Borac?&quot;.

The club&#x27;s first president was Rudolf Hiter, and Savo Novaković was named vice president, with a supervisory board headed by Đoko Jovanović. As football attracted more and more attention in the city on the Vrbas river, Banja Luka got the right to organise its own sub-association gathering the clubs of the entire Krajina region, a new, bigger and modern stadium was built. The opening ceremony took place on September 5, 1937, on the ground of the present-day Banja Luka City Stadium.

The club&#x27;s first success in this early period came in 1928 when RSK Borac won a tournament played in Sarajevo. Before World War II, the major club in Banja Luka was ŠK Krajišnik, however, after 1945, it was disbanded, and Borac replaced Krajišnik as the city&#x27;s main club. Borac played conference leagues in order to qualify for the re-established Yugoslav First League were defeated Sloboda Novi Grad 14–3 on aggregate, FK Kozara from Banja Luka with 8–4 on aggregate and Borac Kozarska Dubica 7–0 on aggregate and became Banja Luka district champions. In 1945, RSK Borac has renamed FK Borac Banja Luka and played for two years in the Yugoslav Third League, before it was promoted to the Yugoslav Second League in 1948.

===Decades of success in the first and second league (1960–1992)===
In 1961, Borac was promoted to the Yugoslav First League for the first time but was instantly dropped back down at the end of the season. The club had to wait for almost a decade to the return to the top flight. It was in the 1970–71 season, and the club stayed in the top league for four consecutive seasons. In this period, precisely in 1974, Borac achieved the Yugoslav Cup final. They were defeated by Hajduk Split in Belgrade, and as the runner-up, they have provided placement for the 1975–76 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup season. In the first round of Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Borac played against US Rumelange from Luxembourg. The first leg was played in Banja Luka where Borac recorded a record win in European competitions by a 9–0.

The second leg was won by Borac by 1–5, meaning 14–1 on aggregate, and played in the second round against R.S.C. Anderlecht. The &quot;Red-Blues&quot; won the home match but it was 1–3 on aggregate at the end for the Belgians, who became winners of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup that season. Borac Banja Luka was the only team who beat R.S.C Anderlecht in one match (at home by 1–0) during the cup season. In the 1974–75 season, Borac played in the second league, but the club achieved a quick promotion and thus ensured the beginning of a new 5-year first league period that lasted until 1980. The following nine seasons, Borac spent in the second League, before a final top league period between 1989 and 1992. Borac&#x27;s best placement in the first League was in 1992, when it finished the season as 4th. In total, Borac played 487 matches in Yugoslav First League during a 46 years long period.

===Memorable years (1988–1992)===

====Yugoslav Cup winner (1988)====
From 1988 to 1992, Borac enjoyed the best period in its long history. In 1988, Borac achieved its biggest success. Under coach Husnija Fazlić Borac won the Yugoslav Cup, the second major football competition in former Yugoslav football and became the only second league club that ever achieved this. In the final, Borac defeated Yugoslav football giant Red Star by 0–1 at JNA stadium in Belgrade. The historic goal was scored by Senad Lupić, one of the Borac&#x27;s legends. At the ceremony, the president of Yugoslav Football Association Antun Čilić gave the golden plaques to Borac players and the head coach. The next day, tens of thousands of Borac supporters gathered at Krajina square in Banja Luka and gave their team a hero&#x27;s welcome.




====First European title (1992)====
In 1992, Borac won its first international trophy, the Mitropa Cup.
The club won the cup in the Italian city Foggia.

At that time there was an ongoing civil war in Yugoslavia, but despite that, they travelled to Italy in the hope to write history. After the elimination of U.S. Foggia in front of 30,000 spectators, Borac met in the final BVSC Budapest at Pino Zaccheria Stadium. Filipović scored but gave only a temporary advantage to Borac because the Hungarians were equalized by Tuboly. That was the result of regular time, so the winner was decided by penalties. Borac won 5–3 from the white spot and got the trophy. Sašivarević, Stavljanin, Filipović, Bilbija, and Simeunović scored for Borac, and goalkeeper Simeunović saved his goal twice. Borac head coach was Smilevski, who was recently named the member of Borac&#x27;s &quot;Best Eleven&quot; squad in its history. Borac played a total of twelve games in UEFA competitions and has never lost a European match at its home ground. Also, seven Borac players have participated in the Yugoslav national football team in its history.
===Recent years (2001–present)===
The First League of the Republika Srpska was the top flight of the Republika Srpska before 2002.
Borac won the Republika Srpska championship three times (2001, 2006 and 2008). Their 2008 title was won dominantly with 14 points ahead of Sloga Doboj. Borac has won five Republika Srpska Cups, in 1995 against Rudar Prijedor, 1996 against Jedinstvo Brčko, 2009 against Radnik Bijeljina, 2011 again against the club from Bijeljina and in 2012 against Sloboda Mrkonjić Grad. In 2002, the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina was created as three national competitions were merged in one.

It became the country&#x27;s most prestigious level of football competition. Also, since 2002, the clubs from the entire country are competing in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup. In 2010, Borac won the Bosnia and Herzegovina Cup and finished third in the national championship. During the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League season, they played in the second round against FC Lausanne-Sport but were knocked out in front of sold-out Banja Luka City Stadium with 1–2 on aggregate for the Swiss club. In 2011, Borac became the football champion of Bosnia and Herzegovina with only 4 defeats and 15 conceded goals during 30 matches. The club won also the Republika Srpska Cup. In the following 2011–12 UEFA Champions League season, Borac began its qualifying with a match against Maccabi Haifa, which they lost by 5–1. In the second leg, Borac showed great performance and won 3–2 by two goals from Krunić and one from Vidaković, however, they were eliminated. In 2012, Borac finished the national championship third and qualified for the European football competition season. Borac got Čelik Nikšić from Montenegro as their opponent. Borac was knocked out by the away goal rule (3–3a).

On 15 August 2024, Borac achieved its first-ever participation in a European club competition by defeating Faroese KÍ Klaksvík 4–3 on aggregate, thereby qualifying for at least the League phase of the third tier of continental club football in Europe. This made them only the second club from Bosnia and Herzegovina to compete in the group or league phase of a European competition. They then became the first Bosnian club to progress from this phase of a European competition and host European matches in the second half of their season - after finishing 20th in the table with eight points from six games, they won a subsequent two-legged playoff against NK Olimpija Ljubljana of Slovenia to reach the last 16 of the 2024–25 UEFA Conference League.

==Colours and crest==
===Colours===
Borac Banja Luka&#x27;s traditional home colours are red and blue with white socks (colours that are contained on the Yugoslav flag). Borac has maintained the red-blue shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. Its traditional away colours are all blue or all red. The club&#x27;s kit is after long-standing Serbian sports clothing company NAAI, currently, new manufactured by Diadora, an Italian sports clothing company.

===Crest===
Borac Banja Luka&#x27;s present crest contains the name of the club and the name of the City of Banja Luka in the background formed from the sections that are coloured as the Serbian flag. On the top of the crest, the year of the club foundation is located. In addition, the whole crest is framed in gold colour.

==Stadium==
The home stadium of Borac is the Banja Luka City Stadium. It has 10,030 seats and is one of the most modern stadiums in the country. The stadium was built in 1937 and its main donator was Bogoljub Kujundžić, the ban of the Vrbas banovina. Since then, the stadium underwent several expansions and reconstructions in the years 1973, 1981, 2010 and 2012. In 2010, the stadium underwent a complete reconstruction. New seats were installed on east and west stands, locker rooms were renovated, a completely new VIP lounge and room for media was built, new lighting, sound systems and video surveillance were installed, and trophy and technical rooms were renovated. In 2012, the new north stand was built with a capacity of 2,492 seats, which increased the total capacity of the stadium to 9,730. According to recent plans, the east stand will be covered by a roof in the upcoming years. The construction of the south stand began, which will increase the total capacity to approximately 13,000 seats.

===New stadium===
In 2008, an expert committee has chosen the concept of building a new stadium. The new stadium will have 30,000 seats, and the whole complex will cover 205,000 square meters. It will include two additional football fields, tennis, basketball and volleyball courts. The cost of the whole project is estimated to be €50 million and it will meet the highest FIFA and UEFA demands.

==Supporters==
As one of the most successful football clubs in the country, Borac always had a considerable number of supporters.
The organized supporters of FK Borac are known as Lešinari (Serbian Cyrillic: Лешинари) and they are the oldest organized supporter group in Republika Srpska. They were established in 1987.
The gathering point of the club&#x27;s most loyal and passionate fans was the East stand of Banja Luka City Stadium until 2017 when it was changed to the North stand.
Borac has big strong and loyal brotherhood with Vojvodina fans Firma and friendship with fans of Genoa.

==Rivalries==

===Željezničar-Borac Banja Luka rivalry===
Since the season 2008–09, the time when Borac started to be standard in the Bosnian Premier League once again, a great rivalry started to develop between them and FK Željezničar. Starting from the 2009–10 season the two teams mainly competed against each other for one of the titles (the league title or national cup) and even the attendance almost got on pair with the acclaimed Sarajevo derby. The rivalry also has a root in the fact that Sarajevo and Banja Luka are, by a good margin, the two biggest cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first being also the capital of the whole country while the second takes the role as the de facto capital of Republika Srpska entity. Since the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the teams met each other 22 times (6 of which are in a national cup), although they played the first time against each other in 1947 Yugoslav Cup. In those 22 matches, Željezničar won 12 times, while Borac managed to win 7 times, with 3 matches ending in a draw. The goal difference is 31:19 in favour of Željezničar (Not including results from the 2015 to 2016 season).

<text>Batouala is a small village in Gabon halfway along the dirt road from Makokou to Mékambo, in the north-eastern province of Ogooué-Ivindo. A 2014 report noted that &quot;pre-electrification&quot; of the Batouala area was underway.

The climate is equatorial, with annual median temperatures between 23.9 and 23.7 °C (reference points for these data are Makouko and Mekambo, respectively), average rainfall between 1725 and 1612 mm, relative humidity of 81%, with an average 160 days of rainfall annually.

The area features caves, one of which, the &quot;Grotte de Batouala&quot;, is at a 3-4km drive and then a 1h45m walk from the village. The cave has three species of bats, and its entrance is made difficult by a thick layer of guano. Its main gallery, according to the report of a 1966 expedition to caves in the Makokou area, contains a thigh-deep lake of liquid guano.

<text>The Naismith College Player of the Year is an annual basketball award given by the Atlanta Tipoff Club to the top men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s collegiate basketball players. It is named in honor of James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.

==History and selection==
First awarded exclusively to male players in 1969, the award was expanded to include female players in 1983. Annually before the college season begins in November, a &quot;watchlist&quot; consisting of 50 players is chosen by the Atlanta Tipoff Club board of selectors, comprising head coaches, administrators and media members from across the United States. By February, the list of nominees is narrowed down to 30 players based on performance. In March, four out of the 30 players are selected as finalists and are placed in the final ballot. The final winners are selected in April by both the board of selectors and fan voting via text messaging. The winners receive the Naismith Trophy.

Since its beginning in 1969, the trophy has been awarded to 44 male players and 24 female players. Lew Alcindor of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Anne Donovan of Old Dominion University were the first winners, respectively. Bill Walton of UCLA, Ralph Sampson of the University of Virginia, and Zach Edey of Purdue have been the only men to win this award multiple times, with the former two players winning three times and Edey winning it twice. Ten women in all have won this award multiple times. Cheryl Miller of the University of Southern California and Breanna Stewart of the University of Connecticut (UConn) are the only three-time winners, while eight others have won it twice: Clarissa Davis of the University of Texas, Dawn Staley of the University of Virginia, Chamique Holdsclaw of the University of Tennessee, Diana Taurasi and Maya Moore of UConn, Seimone Augustus of Louisiana State University, Brittney Griner of Baylor University, and Caitlin Clark of the University of Iowa. Davis and Moore are the only players of either sex to have won multiple times in non-consecutive years.

Three award winners, two men and one woman, were born in United States territories:
* Alfred &quot;Butch&quot; Lee, who was born in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and
* Tim Duncan and Aliyah Boston, both born in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The only award winners who have been born outside the jurisdiction of the United States were:
* Andrew Bogut, born in Melbourne, Australia.
* Patrick Ewing, born in Kingston, Jamaica.
* Buddy Hield, born in Freeport, Bahamas.

Six of these players were developed at least partially in the U.S. proper—Lee was raised in Harlem from early childhood; Ewing immigrated to the Boston area at age 12; Boston moved to Worcester, Massachusetts at the same age; Hield attended high school in suburban Wichita, Kansas; Tshiebwe attended high schools in southwestern Virginia and western Pennsylvania; and Edey spent his last two high school years in Florida. Duncan did not move to the U.S. proper until he arrived at Wake Forest University, and Bogut lived in Australia until his arrival at the University of Utah. 

Duke has had the most male winners with eight, while UConn has had the most female winners, with eleven awards won by seven individuals. The award has been won by a freshman four times: Kevin Durant playing for Texas in 2007, in 2012 by Anthony Davis of Kentucky, Zion Williamson of Duke in 2019, and Paige Bueckers of UConn in 2021.

<text>The Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO; ) is an art museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located in the Grange Park neighbourhood of downtown Toronto, on Dundas Street West. The building complex takes up of physical space, making it one of the largest art museums in North America and the second-largest art museum in Toronto, after the Royal Ontario Museum. In addition to exhibition spaces, the museum also houses an artist-in-residence office and studio, dining facilities, event spaces, gift shop, library and archives, theatre and lecture hall, research centre, and a workshop.

Established in 1900 as the Art Museum of Toronto and formally incorporated in 1903, the museum was renamed the Art Gallery of Toronto in 1919, before adopting its present name, the Art Gallery of Ontario, in 1966. The museum acquired the Grange in 1911 and later undertook several expansions to the north and west of the structure. The first series of expansions occurred in 1918, 1924, and 1935, designed by Darling and Pearson. Since 1974, the gallery has undergone four major expansions and renovations. These expansions occurred in 1974 and 1977 by John C. Parkin, and 1993 by Barton Myers and KPMB Architects. From 2004 to 2008, the museum underwent another expansion by Frank Gehry. The museum complex saw further renovations in the 2010s by KPMB and Hariri Pontarini Architects.

The museum&#x27;s permanent collection includes over 120,000 works spanning the first century to the present day. The museum collection includes a number works from Canadian, First Nations, Inuit, African, European, and Oceanic artists. In addition to exhibits for its collection, the museum has organized and hosted many travelling art exhibitions.

==History==

The museum was founded in 1900 as the Art Museum of Toronto by a group of private citizens and members of the Toronto Society of Arts. The institution&#x27;s founders included George A. Cox, Lady Eaton, Sir Joseph W. Flavelle, J. W. L. Forster, E. F. B. Johnston, Sir William Mackenzie, Hart A. Massey, Professor James Mavor, F. Nicholls, Sir Edmund Osler, Sir Henry M. Pellatt, George Agnew Reid, Byron Edmund Walker, Mrs. H. D. Warren, E.R. Wood, and Frank P. Wood.

The museum&#x27;s incorporation was confirmed by the Government of Ontario three years later by legislation, in &quot;An Act respecting the Art Museum of Toronto&quot; in 1903. The legislation provided the museum with expropriation powers in order to acquire land for the museum. Before the museum moved into a permanent location, it held exhibitions in rented spaces belonging to the Toronto Public Library near the intersection of Brunswick Avenue and College Street.

The museum acquired the property it presently occupies shortly after the death of Harriet Boulton Smith in 1909, when she bequeathed her historic 1817 Georgian manor, The Grange, to the gallery upon her death. However, exhibitions continued to be held in the rented spaces at the Toronto Public Library branch until June 1913, when The Grange was formally opened as the art museum. In 1911, ownership of The Grange, and the surrounding property was formally transferred to the museum. Shortly afterwards, the museum signed an agreement with the municipal government of Toronto to maintain the grounds south of The Grange as a municipal park.

In 1916, the museum drafted plans to construct a small portion of a new gallery building designed by Darling and Pearson in the Beaux-Arts style. Excavation of the new facility began in 1916. The first galleries adjacent to The Grange were opened in 1918. In the next year, the museum was renamed the Art Gallery of Toronto, in an effort to avoid confusion with the Royal Ontario Museum, itself also an art museum. In 1920, the museum also allowed the Ontario College of Art to construct a building on the grounds. The museum was expanded again in 1924, with the opening of the museum&#x27;s sculpture court, its two adjacent galleries, and its main entrance on Dundas Street. The museum was expanded again in 1935 with the construction of two additional galleries. Portions of the 1935 expansions were financed by department store chain Eaton&#x27;s.

In 1965, the museum saw its collection of European and Canadian artworks expand, with the acquisition of 340 works from the Canadian National Exhibition. During the mid-1960s, the director of the museum, William J. Withrow, pushed to have the museum designated as a provincial museum, in an effort to gain further provincial funding for the institution. In 1966, the museum changed its name to the Art Gallery of Ontario, in order to reflect its new mandate to serve as the provincial art museum.

In the 1970s, the museum embarked on another expansion of its gallery space, with its first phase completed with the opening of the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre on October 26, 1974. Although the museum planned on expanding its Canadian exhibits in its second phase of expansions, the creation of a centre dedicated to non-Canadian artists drew criticism from Canadian Artists&#x27; Representation, who threatened to protest the opening of the centre.

The museum was expanded again in 1993, creating of new space and of renovated space, increasing the preexisting floorspace by 30 per cent. The expansion saw the renovation of 20 galleries and the construction of 30 galleries. In 1978, the museum&#x27;s staff unionized under the Ontario Public Service Employees Union.

During the 1990s, the museum drafted plans that would have seen the development of a pedestrian mall from University Avenue to the art gallery. However, conflicting developments on adjacent properties, lack of support from the City of Toronto government, and the eventual development of another renovation plan by architect Frank Gehry saw the museum&#x27;s plans for a pedestrian mall abandoned in the early 2000s.

In 1996, Canadian multi-media artist Jubal Brown vandalized Raoul Dufy&#x27;s &quot;Harbor at le Havre&quot; in the Art Gallery of Ontario by deliberately vomiting primary colours on it.

Under the direction of then-CEO Matthew Teitelbaum, the museum embarked on a (later increased to ) redevelopment plan by Frank Gehry in 2004, called &quot;Transformation AGO&quot;. Although Gehry was born in Toronto, the redevelopment of the museum complex would be his first work in Canada. The project initially drew some criticism. As an expansion, rather than a new creation, concerns were raised that the structure would not look like a Gehry signature building, and that the opportunity to build an entirely new gallery, perhaps on Toronto&#x27;s waterfront, was being squandered. During the course of the redevelopment planning, board member and patron Joey Tanenbaum temporarily resigned his position over concerns about donor recognition, design issues surrounding the new building, as well as the cost of the project. The public rift was subsequently healed.

Kenneth Thomson was a major benefactor of Transformation AGO, donating much of his art collection to the gallery (providing large contributions to the European and Canadian collections), in addition to providing towards the renovation, as well as a endowment. Thomson died in 2006, two years before the project was complete.

In 2015, the &quot;Canadian Jewish News&quot; reported 46 paintings and sculptures in the museum&#x27;s possession held &quot;a gap in provenance,&quot; with the history of their ownership from the years 1933 and 1945 having disappeared, coinciding with the Third Reich&#x27;s existence. The museum publishes spoliation research on its public website.

In 2018, the museum formally changed the name of Emily Carr&#x27;s 1929 &quot;The Indian Church&quot; painting to &quot;Church at Yuquot Village&quot; in an effort to remove culturally insensitive language from the title of works in its collection. A note next to the painting provides the original name of the piece and explains Carr&#x27;s use of the term was in keeping with &quot;the language of her era&quot;. The museum has also reviewed the titles of several other works on a case-by-case basis, as items from the Canadian collection are rotated from storage to exhibition or vice versa.

In May 2019, the museum revised its admission model, offering free entry to visitors 25 years of age and under and a pass for all others, which provides admission to the museum for the entire year.

The painting, &quot;Still Life with Flowers&quot; by Jan van Kessel the Elder, was restituted to the heirs of Dagobert and Martha David in 2020, after the museum confirmed the item&#x27;s provenance and that the David family was forced to sell the item during the Second World War. Following its forced sale, the painting was resold to a Canadian, who later donated the piece to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1995.

==Museum complex==

The museum&#x27;s property was acquired in 1911 when The Grange and the surrounding property south of Dundas Street were bequeathed to the institution by Harriet Boulton Smith. The Grange manor was reopened to serve as the museum&#x27;s building in 1913. Since its opening, the museum underwent several expansions to the north, and west of The Grange. Expansions to the museum were opened in 1918, 1926, 1935, 1974, 1977, 1993, and 2008.

The museum complex takes up of physical space, and is made up of two buildings, The Grange, and the main building expansion, built to the north, and west of The Grange. After the main building&#x27;s redevelopment in 2008, the museum complex has of dedicated gallery space.

In addition to the complex, the museum also owns the land directly south of The Grange, Grange Park. The land is maintained as a municipal park in perpetuity by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division, as a result of an agreement between the museum and the City of Toronto.

===The Grange===
The Grange is a historic manor built in 1817 and is the oldest portion of the museum complex. The building is two-and-a-half storeys tall, and built from stone, brick-on-brick cladding, and wood and glass detailing. Although it was designed in a Neoclassical style, it retains the symmetrical features of Georgian-styled buildings, found in Upper Canada before the War of 1812. The building was initially used as a private residence, with its previous owners having altered the property several times before its re-purposing into an art museum. This includes the addition of a west wing in the 1840s and another wing to the west in 1885. Although the museum expanded the complex in the decades after acquiring the property, The Grange itself saw little work done to it for the next half-century. As a part of its 1967–1973 expansion project, the museum restored The Grange to its 1830s configuration and repurposed the building into a historic house. The Grange was operated as a historic house until it was later repurposed by the museum as an exhibition space and members&#x27; lounge.

The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1970. The building was later designated by the City of Toronto government as &quot;The Grange and Grange Park&quot; in 1991 under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;. In 2005, the City of Toronto government, and the museum entered a heritage easement agreement, which requires designated interior and exterior elements of The Grange to be retained for perpetuity.

===Main building===
Situated directly north and west of The Grange, the main building was opened to the public in 1918 and has undergone several expansions and renovations since opening. Plans for the &quot;main building&quot; to the north of The Grange originated in 1912 when the architectural firm Darling and Pearson submitted their expansion plans for the north of The Grange. Due to The Grange&#x27;s location, and historic value, the expansion plans were limited along the southern portions of the museum&#x27;s property; as the museum wanted to preserve The Grange&#x27;s southern façade and the municipal park south of the building.

The expanded plan featured 30 viewing halls, all of which would surround one of three open courtyards, an English landscape garden, an Italian garden, and a sculpture courtyard. The design was largely modelled after another building designed by Darling and Pearson, the Royal Ontario Museum. The designs by Darling and Pearson were intended to be implemented in three phases, although the plans for the final design phase were abandoned by the mid-20th century.
Construction for the first phase began in 1916 and was completed in 1918. The first phase featured an expansion wing adjacent to The Grange, that had three galleries.

The second phase of the design was opened in 1926. It included half of the sculpture court (later named Walker Court) to the north of the 1918 wing, two additional galleries flanking the sculpture court, and an entrance to the north. The exterior façade of the 1926 expansion was only made of bricks and stucco. No serious designs were planned for the exterior façade of the 1926 expansion, as the museum envisioned that the exterior facade would eventually be enclosed in stone by future expansions. Further expansions to the east and the west of the building was completed in 1935. However, as the third phase of expansion was never embarked on, the &quot;temporary façade&quot; to the north remained the same until the early 1990s.

====Late-20th century expansions====

Another series of expansion was undertaken by the museum during the 1970s, as a part of a new three-phased expansion plan; with its first two phases designed by John C. Parkin. The first phase of the expansion was completed in 1974, which saw the restoration of the Grange, and the opening of the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre, a centre which Moore helped design. Moore choose the dimensions for the centre, the colour of the floor and the walls, and saw the installation of a skylight in the centre, in order to allow more natural light into the gallery. The centre saw little alteration to its design during the museum&#x27;s expansion in the early 2000s, with the exception of a opening, providing access to the Galleria Italia.

The second phase saw the opening of several new galleries adjacent to Beverley Street in 1977. The third phase of expansion planned by the museum was delayed until August 1986, when it announced a competition for Ontario-based architects to design the museum&#x27;s southwest, and northern extension on Dundas Street to cover the &quot;temporary façade&quot;. A seven-member panel eventually selected a design by Barton Myers. The architectural firm KPMB Architects was contracted to complete the expansion, which opened in 1993. The expansion in 1993 saw of new space built, and the construction of 30 new galleries. After the expansion and renovations in 1993, the museum complex had approximately of interior space.

====2004–2008 redevelopment====

From 2004 to 2008, the museum&#x27;s building underwent a redevelopment, led by Canadian-born architect Frank Gehry with local associate architect Adamson Associates Architects. Gehry was commissioned to expand and revitalize the museum, not to design a new building; as such, one of the challenges he faced was to unite the disparate areas of the building that had become &quot;a bit of a hodgepodge&quot; after six previous expansions dating back to the 1920s. The redevelopment plans was the first design by Gehry to not feature a highly contorted structural steel frame for the building&#x27;s support system.

The exterior fronting on Dundas Street was changed as a part of the redevelopment; with the front entrance moved to the north, aligning with Walker Court, and the installation of a glass and wood projecting canopy known as the &quot;Galleria Italia&quot;. The roof of Walker&#x27;s Court was also redeveloped, with steel truss girders installed, and glued laminated timber used to support the glass-panelled roof, which provides of skylight for the courtyard. The southern portion of the museum building also saw redevelopment, with the construction of a five-storey South Gallery block, and a protruding spiral staircase that connects the fourth and fifth levels of the block. The exterior facade of the South Gallery Block includes glass and custom-made titanium panels, and like the Dundas Street fronting, is supported by glued laminated timber. The new addition required the demolition of the postmodernist wing by Myers and KPMB Architects.

Wood was used extensively during the redevelopment, with woodwork needing to be done for the museum&#x27;s hardwood floor, information kiosk, ticket booth, security booth, and the stairs inside the building, including a spiral staircase in Walker Court. The facings of the booths, staircases, and the hardwood floor is made from Douglas fir wood.

The redeveloped building opened in November 2008, with the transformation increasing the museum&#x27;s total floor area by 20 per cent for a total of ; as well as increasing the art viewing space by 47 per cent. An event space called Baillie Court occupies the entirety of the third floor of the south tower block.

=====Galleria Italia=====
The Galleria Italia is a glass, steel, and wood projecting canopy at the fronting of Dundas Street, also acting as a viewing hall on the second level of the building. The galleria was named in recognition of a $13 million contribution by 26 Italian-Canadian families of Toronto, a funding consortium led by Tony Gagliano, a past President of the museum&#x27;s Board of Trustees.

Both ends of the glass and wood canopy extend past the building forming &quot;tears&quot;, providing the appearance that the building&#x27;s façade has been pulled off the building. The Galleria Italia is made out of glued laminated timber and glass gallery space atop the Dundas Street walkway. Approximately 1,800 glued laminated timber pieces were used on the facade of the Galleria Italia; and 2,500 timber connectors.

The galleria is composed of two layers, with the inner layer formed by 47 vertical radial arches, each of which increases in spacing between one another as it approaches the main entrance. The radials provide lateral support against the wind for the outer layer, a glued laminated timber mullion grid, as it transfers the weight to the floor. Both of these sit on a steel frame, which supports the galleria. The mullion grid itself is attached to sliding bearings that allow its curtain wall to adjust to changes in temperature, without compromising the integrity of the wood. Most of the timber was made of Douglas fir trees, from a manufacturer based in Penticton, British Columbia. Each piece of timber is unique, given that the galleria&#x27;s design featured slants that increased in width incrementally, and whose curvatures were changing throughout its length.

The galleria uses 128 steel horizontal beams to prevent the radials from contorting. Given that the museum is typically maintained at 50 per cent relative humidity, the steel used to support the glued laminated timber required a galvanized finish to prevent corrosion.

=====Reception for 2000s redevelopment=====

The completed expansion received wide acclaim, notably for the restraint of its design. An editorial in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called it a &quot;restrained masterpiece&quot;, noting: &quot;The proof of Mr. Gehry&#x27;s genius lies in his deft adaptation to unusual circumstances. By his standards, it was to be done on the cheap, for a mere $276 million. The museum&#x27;s administrators and neighbours were adamant that the architect, who is used to being handed whole city blocks for over-the-top titanium confections, produce a lower-key design, sensitive to its context and the gallery&#x27;s long history.&quot; The &quot;Toronto Star&quot;&#x27;s Christopher Hume called it &quot;the easiest, most effortless and relaxed architectural masterpiece this city has seen&quot;.

Critics also noted Gehry&#x27;s ability to reinvigorate older structures, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commenting &quot;Gehry&#x27;s real accomplishment in Toronto is the reprogramming of a complicated amalgam of old spaces. That&#x27;s not sexy, like titanium curves, but it&#x27;s essential to the project.&quot; The architecture critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Rather than a tumultuous creation, this may be one of Mr. Gehry&#x27;s most gentle and self-possessed designs. It is not a perfect building, yet its billowing glass facade, which evokes a crystal ship drifting through the city, is a masterly example of how to breathe life into a staid old structure. And its interiors underscore one of the most underrated dimensions of Mr. Gehry&#x27;s immense talent: a supple feel for context and an ability to balance exuberance with delicious moments of restraint. Instead of tearing apart the old museum, Mr. Gehry carefully threaded new ramps, walkways and stairs through the original.&quot;

====2010s and 2020s renovations and expansions====

The museum opened the Weston Family Learning Centre in October 2011, designed by Hariri Pontarini Architects with executive architect Adamson Associates. The space is an exploration art centre, featuring a hands-on centre for children, a youth centre, and an art workshop and studio. Several months later, in April 2012, the museum opened the David Milne Study Centre, which was designed by KPMB Architects. The cost to build the David Milne Study Centre cost the museum approximately C$1 million. The South Entrance and lounge outside the library, also designed by Hariri Pontarini Architects, was opened in July 2017. The renovated and renamed J. S. McLean Centre for Indigenous &amp; Canadian Art opened in July 2018.

In 2022, Selldorf Architects, Diamond Schmitt Architects and Two Row Architects were contracted by the museum to design a new gallery space for contemporary art. The proposed expansion, later named the Dani Reiss Modern and Contemporary Gallery, would add to the building, and would be the building&#x27;s seventh major expansion.

==Permanent collection==

AGO&#x27;s permanent collection saw significant growth in the late 20th and early 21st century. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection grew from 3,400 works in 1960 to 10,700 in 1985. As of March 2021, the AGO&#x27;s permanent collection holds over 120,000 pieces, representing many artistic movements and eras of art history. The museum&#x27;s collection is organized into several &quot;collection areas,&quot; which typically encompass works from a specific art form, artist, benefactor, chronological era, or geographic locale. Until the early 1980s, works collected for the museum&#x27;s collection were primarily Canadian or European artists. Its collection has since expanded to include artworks from the Indigenous peoples in Canada, and other cultures from around the world.

The museum&#x27;s African collection includes 95 artworks, most of which originate from the 19th century Sahara. Exhibited at a permanent gallery on the second floor of the museum, most of the pieces in the African collection were gifted to the museum by Murray Frum, with the first pieces donated to the museum in 1972. The museum also has several Ethiopian Orthodox manuscripts and artworks, although these works form a part Thomson Collection of boxwoods and ivories.

In 2002, the museum was bequeathed 1,000 works by Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islanders artists. Some of these items are exhibited at a gallery on the second floor of the museum. In 2004, Kenneth Thomson donated over 2,000 works from his collection to the museum. Although the majority of the Thomson collection is made up of works by Canadian or European artists, the collection also includes works created by artists in other parts of the world.

===Canadian===
The museum includes an extensive collection of Canadian art, from pre-Confederation to the 1990s. Most of the museum&#x27;s Canadian art is exhibited on the second floor, with 39 viewing halls dedicated to exhibiting 1,447 pieces from the museum&#x27;s Canadian collection. The wing includes the 23 viewing halls of the Thomson Collection of Canadian Art, and the 14 viewing halls of J.S. Mclean Centre for Indigenous &amp; Canadian Art. Canadian works are also exhibited in the David Milne Centre and the visible storage area in the museum&#x27;s concourse.

The galleries of the Thomson Collection of Canadian Art provide an in-depth look at the works of individual artists, whereas the other viewing halls of organized around later thematic issues. The Thomson Collection was donated to the museum by Kenneth Thomson in January 2004. The collections features nearly 650 paintings and works by Canadian artists; 250 of which were created by Tom Thomson; 145 works by Cornelius Krieghoff; 168 works by David Milne, and others by the Group of Seven. Nearly two-thirds of the collection was re-framed in preparation for their installation into the viewing halls.

In addition to the Thomson Collection of Canadian Art, works by David Milne are also housed in the David Milne Study Centre. The centre was opened in 2012, and features computer terminals linked to the Milne Digital Archives and televisions which play films on Milne&#x27;s life. The centre houses works and 230 other artifacts belonging to Milne, including diaries, journal, and paint boxes. Most of the Milne artifacts were gifted to the museum by Milne&#x27;s son in 2009.

The J.S. McLean Centre for Indigenous &amp; Canadian Art exhibits 132 from Canadian and indigenous artists. Approximately 40 percent of works presented in the centre were created by Indigenous artists. The McLean Centre for Indigenous and Canadian Art is , with 14 viewing halls. Three of these galleries are dedicated to exhibiting Inuit art, whereas one is dedicated to exhibiting contemporary First Nations art.

Works in the Mclean Centre are organized around larger thematic issues relating to Canadian history, as opposed to chronologically. As a result, works from indigenous and Canadian artists are presented together to showcase the reciprocal influences and conflict between the two. An example of such thematic presentation is evident in how the museum exhibits Tom Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The West Wind&quot;. When the painting was exhibited at the Mclean Centre, it was presented with Anishinaabe pouches adjacent to it, showcasing how two peoples viewed northern Ontario at that time. Text that accompanies works in the centre are presented in three languages, English, French, and either Anishinaabemowin or Inuktitut. The walls along the primary entry point into the McLean Centre are marked by small projectile points from arrows, spears, and knives from 9,000 BCE to 1,000 CE. The projectiles form a part of an art installation instead of an ethnographic or archeological display.

Landscape paintings from Canadian artists were among the first to be acquired for the museum&#x27;s collection. The museum&#x27;s Canadian collection has works from several Canadian artists, including Jack Bush, Paul-Émile Borduas, Kazuo Nakamura, and members of the Group of Seven. The museum has more than 300 works by David Milne; 168 of which were donated to the museum as a part of the Thomson Collection of Canadian Art. The museum also has nearly 150 works from A. Y. Jackson, although most of it is in storage. The collection also features works from Canadian sculptors Frances Loring, Esmaa Mohamoud, and Florence Wyle.

The museum also has a large collection of Inuit artworks. The 1970s saw the first Inuit artwork added to the museum&#x27;s collection; with the Art Gallery of Ontario acquiring the Sarick Collection, the Isaacs Reference Collection, and the Klamer Collection during the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1988, the museum formed the Inuit Collections Committee to maintain and grow the collection. The collection includes 2,800 sculptures, 1,300 prints, 700 drawings and wall hangings from Inuit artists. 500 of these works are exhibited at the Inuit Visible Storage Gallery, opened in 2013.

Conversely, the museum did not acquire its first First Nations artwork until 1979, acquiring a piece by Norval Morrisseau for its contemporary collection. The Art Gallery of Ontario did not acquire First Nations art until the late 1970s, to prevent overlap between the AGO&#x27;s permanent collection and the permanent collections of the Royal Ontario Museum, which already had a collection of First Nations art. The early 21st century saw the museum increase the representation of First Nations art in its Canadian-centred galleries, including the R. Samuel McLaughlin Gallery. First Nations artists whose works are featured in the museum&#x27;s collection include Charles Edenshaw and Shelley Niro.

===Contemporary===

The museum&#x27;s contemporary art collection contains works from international artists from the 1960s to the present and Canadians from the 1990s to the present. The collection also extends to installations, photography, graphic art (such as concert, film, and historic posters), film and video art, and even minimal music. Works from these collections are exhibited in several centres and galleries throughout the museum, including the Vivian &amp; David Campbell Centre for Contemporary Art, which comprise the upper three levels of the south gallery block, and the Galleria Italia.

The museum&#x27;s contemporary collection includes several works by Canadian artists, General Idea, Brian Jungen, Liz Magor, Michael Snow, and Jeff Wall. The museum&#x27;s contemporary collection also has works by international artists in the Arte Povera, conceptualism minimalism, neo-expressionism, pop art, and postminimalism movements. Artists from these movements whose works are included in the museum&#x27;s collection include Jim Dine, Donald Judd, Mona Hatoum, Pierre Huyghe, John McCracken, Claes Oldenburg, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Gerhard Richter, Richard Serra, Robert Smithson, Andy Warhol, and Lawrence Weiner.

The museum also features a permanent exhibition of Yayoi Kusama&#x27;s &quot;Infinity Mirror Room – Let&#x27;s Survive Forever&quot; in one of the viewing halls of the Signy Eaton Gallery. The permanent &quot;Infinity Room&quot; was purchased in 2018 for C$2 million and opened in May 2019 due to popular demand, after the success of a larger multi-room Kusama and &quot;Infinity Mirror Room&quot; travelling exhibit held in the same year.

===European===

The museum has a large collection of European art ranging from 1000 CE to 1900 CE, Items from the museum&#x27;s European collection are exhibited in several viewing halls throughout the museum. The Tannenbaum Centre for European Art and its viewing halls are located on the ground floor. Paintings and sculptures from the Thomson Collection of European Art are exhibited on the ground floor, while the ship models from the Thomson collection are exhibited in the museum&#x27;s concourse.

The European Collection includes the Margaret and Ian Ross Collection, which features several bronze sculptures and medals, with a particular emphasis on Baroque art from Italy. The museum&#x27;s collection of European paintings and sculptures was further bolstered in January 2004, after the museum acquired the Thomson Collection of European Art. The Thomson Collection of European Art includes over 900 objects, including 130 ship models. 

The Thomson Collection of European Art includes the world&#x27;s largest holding of the Gothic boxwood miniatures, featuring 10 carved beads and two altarpieces. Other works featured in the Thomson Collection for European Art includes &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; by Peter Paul Rubens. The painting was acquired by Ken Thomson in 2002 for C$115 million, at the time the most expensive Old Master work sold at an art auction. Thomson intended for the work to serve as the centrepiece for the collections he donated to the museum in 2004. When the museum reopened in 2008, the painting was installed in a blood-red, low-lit room in the Thomson Collection for European Art. The room featured no other paintings, with the only lighting in the room directed towards the work. The painting remained at that location until 2017 when it was placed in a gallery with other works from the European collection.

In 2019, the museum acquired the painting &quot;Iris Bleus, Jardin du Petit Gennevilliers&quot; by Gustave Caillebotte for more than C$1 million. The painting is the second work by Caillebotte to enter the permanent collections of a Canadian art museum. The museum&#x27;s European collection also includes major works by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Giovanni del Biondo, Edgar Degas, Thomas Gainsborough, Paul Gauguin, Frans Hals, Claude Monet, Angelo Piò, Nino Pisano, Rembrandt, Auguste Rodin, and James Tissot.

===Modern===

The museum&#x27;s modern art collection includes works from Americans, and Europeans from the 1900s to the 1960s, Works by Canadian artists during that period are typically exhibited as a part of its Canadian collection, as opposed to the museum&#x27;s modern art collection. Works from the modern art collection are exhibited in several centres and galleries throughout the museum, including the Joey &amp; Toby Tanenbaum Sculpture Atrium, the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre, and several other galleries on the ground floor of the museum.

The museum is home to the largest public collection of works by English sculptor Henry Moore, most of which is held in the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre. The museum dedicated approximately of space to the sculptor, which includes the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre, and related galleries including the Irina Moore Gallery. Moore donated 300 pieces, nearly his entire personal collection, to the museum in 1974. The donation originated from a commitment made by Moore on December 9, 1968, to donate a significant portion of his work to the Art Gallery of Ontario, contingent that the museum builds a dedicated gallery to exhibit his works. In addition to the works donated by Moore, the museum also purchased another piece, &quot;Two Large Forms&quot;, from the sculptor in 1973. The sculpture was originally placed at the museum&#x27;s northeast façade, near the intersection of Dundas and McCaul streets. However, the museum later relocated the sculpture to Grange Park nearby in 2017 as part of the park&#x27;s renovation.

The museum&#x27;s modern collection also includes works by Pierre Bonnard, Constantin Brâncuși, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Jean Dubuffet, Jacob Epstein, Helen Frankenthaler, Alberto Giacometti, Natalia Goncharova, Arshile Gorky, Barbara Hepworth, Hans Hofmann, Franz Kline, Henri Matisse, Fernand Léger, Joan Miró, Amedeo Modigliani, Claude Monet, Ben Nicholson, Pablo Picasso, Gino Severini, and Yves Tanguy.

===Photography===

In 2019, the Art Gallery of Ontario had a photography collection of 70,000 photographs dating from the 1840s to the present. The photograph collection includes 495 photo albums from the First World War. Items from this collection are exhibited in two viewing halls on the ground floor.

In 2017, the museum acquired 522 photographs by Diane Arbus, providing the museum with the largest collection of Arbus&#x27;s photographs outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In June 2019, the museum acquired the Montgomery Collection of Caribbean Photos, which includes 3,500 historic photographs of the Caribbean from the 1840s to 1940s. The collection was acquired by the museum for $300,000, most if which was provided by 27 donors from Toronto&#x27;s Caribbean community. The Montgomery Collection is the largest collection of its kind outside the Caribbean. Other photographers whose works are featured in the collection include Edward Burtynsky, Alfred Eisenstaedt, Robert J. Flaherty, Suzy Lake, Arnold Newman, Henryk Ross, Josef Sudek, Linnaeus Tripe, and Garry Winogrand.

===Prints and drawings===

The museum&#x27;s prints and drawings collection includes more than 20,000 prints, drawings, and other works on paper, from the 1400s to the present day. This collection usually is displayed little at a time with revolving exhibitions. However, the collection is viewable by appointment at the museum&#x27;s Marvin Gelber Print and Drawing Study Centre.

The collection includes the largest and most significant body of works from Betty Goodwin, with a bulk of the works given to the gallery by the artist. In 2015, the museum was bequeathed 170 drawings, prints, and sculptures by Käthe Kollwitz. The prints and drawings collection also includes drawings by David Blackwood, François Boucher, John Constable, Greg Curnoe, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Thomas Gainsborough, Paul Gauguin, Wassily Kandinsky, Michelangelo, David Milne, Pablo Picasso, Egon Schiele, Michael Snow, Walter Trier, Vincent van Gogh, and Frederick Varley; and prints by Ernst Barlach, James Gillray, Francisco Goya, Käthe Kollwitz, Henry Moore, Robert Motherwell, Rembrandt, Thomas Rowlandson, Stanley Spencer, James Tissot, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and James McNeill Whistler.

==Library and archives==
The Art Gallery of Ontario also houses the Edward P. Taylor Library &amp; Archives. The library and archives are open to the public and require no entrance fee. However, access to the museum&#x27;s archives, and its special collections requires a scheduled appointment. The library also serves as the adjunct art history library for OCAD University.

===Library===

The general collections of the library reflect the permanent collection of works of art and the public programs of the Art Gallery of Ontario, containing over 300,000 volumes for general art information and academic research in the history of art. The library serves as a reference library; materials in the collections do not circulate. Holdings encompass Western art in all media from the medieval period to the 21st century; the art of Canada&#x27;s indigenous peoples including Inuit art; and African and Oceanian art.

The library additionally comprises Canadian, American and European art journals and newspapers; over 50,000 art sales and auction catalogues (late 18th century to current); 40,000 documentation files on Canadian art and artists, and international contemporary artists; and multimedia, digital and microform collections. Materials may be searched on the online catalogue. The Library &amp; Archives also produces pathfinders and bibliographies for collections research, such as the Thomson Collection Resource Guide to the large collection of works of art donated by benefactor and collector Kenneth Thomson.

The library&#x27;s rare books collection includes art historical sourcebooks from the 17th century to the present; British Neoclassical folios of the 18th century; catalogues raisonnés; British and Canadian illustrated books and magazines; travel guides, particularly Baedekers, Murrays, and Blue Guides; French art sales catalogues from the late 18th century to the mid-20th century; and artists&#x27; books.

===Archives===
The museum&#x27;s archives document the history of the institution since its establishment in 1900, as well as The Grange since 1820. Series include exhibition files, publicity scrapbooks (documenting Gallery exhibitions and all other activity), architectural plans, photographs, records of the Gallery School, and correspondence (with art dealers, artists, collectors, and scholars). Because of the regularity with which artists&#x27; groups held exhibitions at the Gallery, the archives are a resource for research into the activities of the Group of Seven, the Canadian Group of Painters, the Ontario Society of Artists, and others.

The Art Gallery of Ontario&#x27;s special collections are one of the most important concentrations of archival material on the visual arts in Canada. In over 150 individual fonds and collections, ranging in date from the early 19th century to the present day, the Special Collections document with primary source material artists, art dealers and collectors, artist-run galleries, and other people and organizations that have shaped the Canadian art world, as well as the Tom Thomson Catalogue Raisonné files.

==Programs==

<doc id="607055" wikidata="Q4358034" url="?curid=607055" title="Kota people (Gabon)">
<text>The Bakota (or Kota) are a Bantu ethnic group from the northeastern region of Gabon and Congo. The language they speak is called iKota, but is sometimes referred to as Bakota, ikuta, Kota, and among the Fang, they are known as Mekora. The language has several dialects, which include: Ndambomo, Mahongwe, Ikota-la-hua, Sake, Menzambi, Bougom. Some of these dialects themselves include regional variations of some kind.

==Culture==
The Kota are traditionally a patriarchal society, however some of the sub-groups such as the Mahongwe have over time adopted a matrilineal system of lineage (Mahongwe means, &quot;from your father&quot;). Another key feature of the Kota people is the originality of its circumcision and widow-purification rituals, which are generally kept secret.

The true meaning of Bakota is unclear, however it may be derived from the word kota, which means to bind/to attach/to link, hereby suggesting they view themselves as a united people bound by a common fate.

Most Kota people are Roman Catholic. The area of Gabon they live in is home of the Apostolic Vicariate of Makokou.

==Population==
Estimates indicate that there are at least 43,500 Kota speakers in the world, of whom 34,442 people (79%) live in the Ogouee-Ivindo province of northeastern Gabon, and 9055 people (21%) in neighboring Congo-Brazzaville. They make up the majority of the population of the regional capital city Makokou.

Politically, the Kota have been classified under the disputed &quot;stateless societies&quot; category. They have a strong egalitarian background, which in some instances cuts across age and gender lines. Kota children are taught to value tradition, respect for the elderly, and the concept of &quot;Ewele&quot; (loosely translated as &#x27;pride&#x27;).

==Mbulu Ngulu Reliquary Figures==

They are noted for their copper and brass reliquary guardian figures, which are part of a powerful religious and mystical order known as Bwete. However, it is unclear if these figures were made by the Kota people themselves, of other people living in the same area of Gabon. In the iKota language these figures are called mbulu ngulu. As the people of Gabon began to convert to Christianity in the 18th and 19th centuries, missionaries and colonial officials began to collect these figures. Today, most reliquary figures are found in museums in Europe and North America.

==Influential Kota People==
The Kota are not considered big players in Gabonese politics, however some Kota have been appointed to key positions in the Government. Alexandre Sambat, a long-time ambassador to the United States who later ran for president in 1993, was of Kota origin. Pascal Desire Misongo, another Kota, has served as minister of Justice in Gabon. Emmanuel Issoze-Ngondet was an established representative in the United Nations and served as Prime Minister of Gabon as well.

<doc id="607062" wikidata="Q1455581" url="?curid=607062" title="Frequency compensation">
<text>In electronics engineering, frequency compensation is a technique used in amplifiers, and especially in amplifiers employing negative feedback. It usually has two primary goals: To avoid the unintentional creation of positive feedback, which will cause the amplifier to oscillate, and to control overshoot and ringing in the amplifier&#x27;s step response. It is also used extensively to improve the bandwidth of single pole systems.

==Explanation==

Most amplifiers use negative feedback to trade gain for other desirable properties, such as decreased distortion, improved noise reduction or increased invariance to variation of parameters such as temperature. Ideally, the phase characteristic of an amplifier&#x27;s frequency response would be linear; however, device limitations make this goal physically unattainable. More particularly, capacitances within the amplifier&#x27;s gain stages cause the output signal to lag behind the input signal by up to 90° for each pole they create. If the sum of these phase lags reaches 180°, the output signal will be the negative of the input signal. Feeding back any portion of this output signal to the inverting (negative) input when the gain of the amplifier is sufficient will cause the amplifier to oscillate. This is because the feedback signal will reinforce the input signal. That is, the feedback is then positive rather than negative.

Frequency compensation is implemented to avoid this result.

Another goal of frequency compensation is to control the step response of an amplifier circuit as shown in Figure 1. For example, if a step in voltage is input to a voltage amplifier, ideally a step in output voltage would occur. However, the output is not ideal because of the frequency response of the amplifier, and ringing occurs. Several figures of merit to describe the adequacy of step response are in common use. One is the rise time of the output, which ideally would be short. A second is the time for the output to lock into its final value, which again should be short. The success in reaching this lock-in at final value is described by overshoot (how far the response exceeds final value) and settling time (how long the output swings back and forth about its final value). These various measures of the step response usually conflict with one another, requiring optimization methods.

Frequency compensation is implemented to optimize step response, one method being pole splitting.A

==Use in operational amplifiers==

Because operational amplifiers are so ubiquitous and are designed to be used with feedback, the following discussion will be limited to frequency compensation of these devices.

It should be expected that the outputs of even the simplest operational amplifiers will have at least two poles. A consequence of this is that at some critical frequency, the phase of the amplifier&#x27;s output = −180° compared to the phase of its input signal. The amplifier will oscillate if it has a gain of one or more at this critical frequency. This is because (a) the feedback is implemented through the use of an inverting input that adds an additional −180° to the output phase making the total phase shift −360° and (b) the gain is sufficient to induce oscillation.

A more precise statement of this is the following: An operational amplifier will oscillate at the frequency at which its open loop gain equals its closed loop gain if, at that frequency, 

:# The open loop gain of the amplifier is ≥ 1 and
:# The difference between the phase of the open loop signal and phase response of the network creating the closed loop output = −180°. Mathematically: formula_1

=== Practice ===
Frequency compensation is implemented by modifying the gain and phase characteristics of the amplifier&#x27;s open loop output or of its feedback network, or both, in such a way as to avoid the conditions leading to oscillation. This is usually done by the internal or external use of resistance-capacitance networks.

=== Dominant-pole compensation ===
The method most commonly used is called dominant-pole compensation, which is a form of lag compensation. It is an external compensation technique and is used for relatively low closed loop gain. A pole placed at an appropriate low frequency in the open-loop response reduces the gain of the amplifier to one (0 dB) for a frequency at or just below the location of the next highest frequency pole. The lowest frequency pole is called the dominant pole because it dominates the effect of all of the higher frequency poles. The result is that the difference between the open loop output phase and the phase response of a feedback network having no reactive elements never falls below −180° while the amplifier has a gain of one or more, ensuring stability. 

Dominant-pole compensation can be implemented for general purpose operational amplifiers by adding an integrating capacitance to the stage that provides the bulk of the amplifier&#x27;s gain. This capacitor creates a pole that is set at a frequency low enough to reduce the gain to one (0 dB) at or just below the frequency where the pole next highest in frequency is located. The result is a phase margin of ≈ 45°, depending on the proximity of still higher poles. This margin is sufficient to prevent oscillation in the most commonly used feedback configurations. In addition, dominant-pole compensation allows control of overshoot and ringing in the amplifier step response, which can be a more demanding requirement than the simple need for stability.

This compensation method is described below:
Let formula_2 be the uncompensated transfer function of op amp in open-loop configuration which is given by:

formula_3

where formula_4 is the open-loop gain of the Op-Amp and formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7 are the angular frequencies at which the gain function formula_8 rolls off by -20dB, -40dB, and -60dB respectively.

Thus, for compensation, introduce a dominant pole by adding an RC network in series with the Op-Amp as shown in the figure.
The Transfer function of the compensated open loop Op-Amp circuit is given by:

 where fd &lt; f1 &lt; f2 &lt; f3

The compensation capacitance C is chosen such that fd &lt; f1. Hence, the frequency response of a dominant pole compensated open loop Op-Amp circuit shows uniform gain roll off from fd and becomes 0 at f1 as shown in the graph.
The advantages of dominant pole compensation are:
1. It is simple and effective.
2. Noise immunity is improved since noise frequency components outside the bandwidth are eliminated.

Though simple and effective, this kind of conservative dominant pole compensation has two drawbacks:
# It reduces the bandwidth of the amplifier, thereby reducing available open loop gain at higher frequencies. This, in turn, reduces the amount of feedback available for distortion correction, etc. at higher frequencies.
# It reduces the amplifier&#x27;s slew rate. This reduction results from the time it takes the finite current driving the compensated stage to charge the compensating capacitor. The result is the inability of the amplifier to reproduce high amplitude, rapidly changing signals accurately.

Often, the implementation of dominant-pole compensation results in the phenomenon of &quot;Pole splitting&quot;. This results in the lowest frequency pole of the uncompensated amplifier &quot;moving&quot; to an even lower frequency to become the dominant pole, and the higher-frequency pole of the uncompensated amplifier &quot;moving&quot; to a higher frequency. To overcome these disadvantages, pole zero compensation is used.

=== Other methods ===
Some other compensation methods are: lead compensation, lead–lag compensation and feed-forward compensation.

:Lead compensation. Whereas dominant pole compensation places or moves poles in the open loop response, lead compensation places a zero in the open loop response to cancel one of the existing poles.

:Lead–lag compensation places both a zero and a pole in the open loop response, with the pole usually being at an open loop gain of less than one.

:Feed-forward or Miller compensation uses a capacitor to bypass a stage in the amplifier at high frequencies, thereby eliminating the pole that stage creates.

The purpose of these three methods is to allow greater open loop bandwidth while still maintaining amplifier closed loop stability. They are often used to compensate high gain, wide bandwidth amplifiers.

<doc id="607070" wikidata="Q1983841" url="?curid=607070" title="Viral hepatitis">
<text>Viral hepatitis is liver inflammation due to a viral infection. It may present in acute form as a recent infection with relatively rapid onset, or in chronic form, typically progressing from a long-lasting asymptomatic condition up to a decompensated hepatic disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
The most common causes of viral hepatitis are the five unrelated hepatotropic viruses hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Other viruses can also cause liver inflammation, including cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and yellow fever. There also have been scores of recorded cases of viral hepatitis caused by herpes simplex virus.

== Mode of transmission ==
Viral hepatitis is either transmitted through contaminated food or water (A, E) or via blood and body fluids (B, C). The viruses transmitted through water and food are mostly self-limited, resulting in acute illness with full resolution. The blood borne viruses (B, C) can cause both acute and chronic liver disease and can be transmitted from mother to child during birth, through contact with body fluids during sex, unsafe injections and through unscreened blood transfusions.
The most common types of hepatitis can be prevented or treated. Hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination. Effective treatments for hepatitis C are available but costly.
In 2013, about 1.5 million people died from viral hepatitis, most commonly due to hepatitis B and C. East Asia, in particular Mongolia, is the region most affected.

== Hepatitis viruses ==
The most common cause of hepatitis is viral. Although the effects of various viruses are all classified under the disease hepatitis, these viruses are not all related.

==Viral hepatitis types==

=== Hepatitis A ===

&quot;Hepatitis A&quot; or infectious jaundice is caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV), a picornavirus transmitted by the fecal-oral route often associated with ingestion of contaminated food. It causes an acute form of hepatitis and does not have a chronic stage. A patient&#x27;s immune system makes antibodies against HAV that confer immunity against future infection. People with hepatitis A are advised to rest, stay hydrated and avoid alcohol. A vaccine is available that will prevent HAV infection for up to 10 years. Hepatitis A can be spread through personal contact, consumption of raw sea food, or drinking contaminated water. This occurs primarily in third world countries. Strict personal hygiene and the avoidance of raw and unpeeled foods can help prevent an infection. Infected people excrete HAV with their feces two weeks before and one week after the appearance of jaundice. The time between the infection and the start of the illness averages 28 days. (ranging from 15 to 50 days), Most patients recover fully within 2 months, although approximately 15% of affected people may experience continuous or relapsing symptoms from six months to a year following initial diagnosis.

=== Hepatitis B ===

&quot;Hepatitis B&quot; is caused by the hepatitis B virus, a hepadnavirus that can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis develops in the 15% of adults who are unable to eliminate the virus after an initial infection. Identified methods of transmission include contact with blood, blood transfusion (now rare), unsanitary tattoos, sex (through sexual intercourse or contact with bodily fluids), or mother-to-child by breast feeding; there is minimal evidence of transplacental crossing. However, in about half of cases the source of infection cannot be determined. Blood contact can occur by sharing syringes in intravenous drug use, shaving accessories such as razor blades, or touching wounds on infected persons. Needle-exchange programmes have been created in many countries as a form of prevention.

Patients with chronic hepatitis B have antibodies against the virus, but not enough to clear the infected liver cells. The continued production of virus and countervailing antibodies is a likely cause of the immune complex disease seen in these patients. A vaccine is available to prevent infection for life. Hepatitis B infections result in 500,000 to 1,200,000 deaths per year worldwide due to the complications of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B is endemic in a number of (mainly South-East Asian) countries, making cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma big killers. There are eight treatment options approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) available for persons with a chronic hepatitis B infection: alpha-interferon, pegylated interferon, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir alafenamide with a 65% rate of sustained response.

=== Hepatitis C ===

&quot;Hepatitis C&quot; (originally &quot;non-A non-B hepatitis&quot;) is caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV), an RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. HCV can be transmitted through contact with blood (including through sexual contact if the two parties&#x27; blood is mixed) and can also cross the placenta. Hepatitis C usually leads to chronic hepatitis, culminating in cirrhosis in some people. It usually remains asymptomatic for decades. Patients with hepatitis C are susceptible to severe hepatitis if they contract either hepatitis A or B, so all persons with hepatitis C should be immunized against hepatitis A and hepatitis B if they are not already immune, and avoid alcohol. HCV can lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, however, only a minority of HCV-infected individuals develop cancer (1–4% annually), suggesting a complex interplay between viral gene expression and host and environmental factors to promote carcinogenesis. The risk is increased two-fold with active HBV coinfection and a 21% increase in mortality compared to those with latent HBV and HCV. HCV viral levels can be reduced to undetectable levels by a combination of interferon and the antiviral drug ribavirin. The genotype of the virus is the primary determinant of the rate of response to this treatment regimen, with genotype 1 being the most resistant.

Hepatitis C is the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States, and the leading cause of liver tranplants.

=== Hepatitis D ===

&quot;Hepatitis D&quot; is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), or hepatitis delta virus; it belongs to the genus &quot;Deltavirus&quot;. HDV is similar to a satellite virus as it can only propagate in the presence of the hepatitis B virus, depending on the helper function of HBV for its replication and expression. It has no independent life cycle, but can survive and replicate as long as HBV infection persists in the host body. It can only cause infection when encapsulated by hepatitis B virus surface antigens. The vaccine for hepatitis B protects against hepatitis D virus because of the latter&#x27;s dependence on the presence of hepatitis B virus for it to replicate.

=== Hepatitis E ===

&quot;Hepatitis E&quot; is caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV), from the family Hepeviridae. It produces symptoms similar to hepatitis A, although it can take a fulminant course in some patients, particularly pregnant women (mortality rate about 20%); chronic infections may occur in immune-compromised patients. It is more prevalent in the Indian subcontinent. The virus is feco-orally transmitted and is usually self-limited.

=== Hepatitis F virus ===

&quot;Hepatitis F virus&quot; (HFV) is a hypothetical virus linked to certain cases of hepatitis. Several hepatitis F virus candidates emerged in the 1990s, but none of these reports have been substantiated.

=== GB virus C ===

The &quot;GB virus C&quot; is a virus that is probably spread by blood and sexual contact. It was initially identified as Hepatitis G virus. There is very little evidence that this virus causes hepatitis, as it does not appear to replicate primarily in the liver. It is now classified as GB virus C.

===2022 hepatitis of unknown origin===
In 2022, several hundred cases of acute hepatitis of probable infectious origin were reported worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECDC/WHO13may2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2023, the virus causing these cases has not been identified, but an adenovirus is suspected.

== Relationship between hepatitis C virus and liver cancer ==
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause acute and chronic infections that are a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), advanced hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.

HCC is a major cause of death in patients with chronic HCV infection. Regarding the pathogenesis of HCC associated with HCV, that virus may play direct or indirect roles.

A major risk for the development of HCC is persistent infection with HCV, and the highest risk for HCC development is associated with co-infection of HBV with HDV, HCV or HIV.

Risk factors that can lead to the development of HCC in those with chronic HCV include synchronous liver diseases, viral genotype, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Lifestyle factors such as liver steatosis, smoking, and alcohol use can accelerate progression to HCC and liver decompensation in patients with HCV.

The purpose of HCV treatment is to eliminate the infection, reduce the transmission to other people and decrease the risk of HCC development.

== Other viruses ==

The virus first known to cause hepatitis was the yellow fever virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus. Other viruses than can cause hepatitis include:
* Adenoviruses
* Arenaviruses: Guanarito virus, Junín virus, Lassa fever virus, Lujo virus, Machupo virus, and Sabiá virus
* Bunyaviruses: Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Dobrava virus, Hantaan virus, Puumala virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Seoul virus
* Coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome virus
* Erythrovirus: Parvovirus B19
* Filoviruses: Ebola virus and Marburg virus
* Flaviviruses: dengue, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, and yellow fever virus
* Herpesviruses: cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, human herpesvirus 7, and human herpesvirus 8
* Orthomyxoviruses: influenza
* Picornaviruses: echovirus
* Reovirus: Colorado tick fever virus, reovirus 3

Additionally, a casual role between the virus KIs-V and hepatitis is suspected based on a 2011 study that isolated KIs-V from four patients with raised serum alanine transferases without other known cause.

<text>Monica Proietti (; February 25, 1940 – September 19, 1967) was a Canadian bank robber and folk hero from Montreal, better known as &quot;Machine Gun Molly&quot; (in French: &quot;Monica la Mitraille&quot;).

Proietti came from a poor Montreal family, and many of her relatives were involved in crime; her grandmother served time in jail for receiving stolen goods, and reportedly ran a school for crime for the neighbourhood children in the Red-Light District. In 1956, at the age of 17, Proietti married Anthony Smith, a Scottish gangster (he was 33). The couple had two children. Smith was deported from Canada in 1962. She then became romantically involved with Viateur Tessier, but he was jailed in 1966 for armed robbery.

When she was 19 four of her seven siblings perished in a fire in downtown Montreal. The area had been purchased by the City of Montreal for future demolition for the Jeanne Mance public housing projects.

The members of her crew included Gérald Lelièvre and his brother Robert, who made headlines in 1984 when he and three others were killed when a bomb was detonated in a downtown Montreal apartment building. The victims had been suspected in the murder of West End Gang kingpin Frank &quot;Dunie&quot; Ryan.

Proietti and her accomplices held up more than 20 banks, stealing over an estimated $100,000. On September 19, 1967 she died after crashing into a bus and being shot twice by an undercover police officer following a high-speed chase through the north-end of the city. Reportedly, this was to have been her last bank robbery, intended to fund a new life in Florida.

Mort Künstler painted the artwork &quot;Machine Gun Molly&quot; for &quot;Stag magazine&#x27;s&quot; January 1965 issue.

A 2004 Quebec film &quot;Machine Gun Molly (Monica la mitraille)&quot; was loosely based on her life. The film was adapted from the book &quot;Souvenirs de Monica&quot; by ..

<text>Charles Foster Bass (born January 8, 1952) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for from 1995 to 2007 and 2011 to 2013. He is the son of Perkins Bass, who also represented the same New Hampshire district from 1955 to 1963.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Bass was born in Boston to Katharine and Perkins Bass. His father served as a Republican U.S. Congressman from New Hampshire in the 1950s and 1960s. Bass&#x27;s grandfather Robert Bass served as Republican governor of New Hampshire from 1911 to 1912, founded the Progressive Republican movement, and was a friend/confidant of President Teddy Roosevelt.

Charles Bass attended the Holderness School in Holderness, New Hampshire, where he was elected President of the school in his senior year. Bass graduated from Dartmouth College in 1974.

During 1974 Bass worked for Maine Republican U.S. Congressman William Cohen. From 1975 to 1979 Bass worked for Maine Republican U.S. Congressman David F. Emery. Bass served in the New Hampshire General Court from 1982 to 1988.

==New Hampshire Senate==
In 1988, he ran for the New Hampshire Senate and defeated incumbent Jean White in the Republican primary. He served there until 1992. While in the State Senate, he represented Peterborough. He was a supporter of tort reform and some abortion rights.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1980
After incumbent Republican Congressman James Colgate Cleveland of New Hampshire&#x27;s 2nd congressional district decided to retire, Bass entered the race to succeed him. Then-Executive Councillor Judd Gregg won the Republican primary with 34% of the vote. State Senator Susan McLane, the mother of future Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster, came second with 25%, Bass came third with 22% and former deputy executive director of the Domestic Policy Council Robert W. Sweet came fourth with 7%. Five other candidates took the remaining 12%. Gregg went on to win the general election.

;Intervening years
In 1988, Gregg did not run for re-election, instead running successfully for Governor of New Hampshire. Bass, however, did not run to succeed him. Charles Douglas III won the election but was defeated in 1990 by Democrat Richard Swett, who was comfortably re-elected in 1992.

;1994
Bass ran for the 2nd District again, winning the Republican primary with 29% of the vote. Mike Hammond came second with 24%, Ward Scott was third with 20%, attorney and future New Hampshire Supreme Court Justice James P. Bassett was fourth with 14% and businessman Theo de Winter came fifth with 5%. Eight others split the remaining 8% of the vote. In the general election, he rode the Republican Revolution to defeat incumbent Richard Swett by 51% to 46%.

;1996
In the Republican primary, he was challenged by Mike Hammond, who had finished second two years previously. Bass easily defeated him, taking 66% of the vote to Hammond&#x27;s 27%. Dana Albert came third with 3%, Robert J. Kulak came fourth with 2% and future State Representative Tom Alciere came fifth with 1%. Write-in candidates took the remaining 1%. In the general election, Bass was re-elected to a second term against former State Senator and 1992 gubernatorial nominee Deborah Arnie Arnesen by 51% to 44%.

;1998–2004
Between 1998 and 2004, Bass was re-elected by ever increasing margins. In 1998, he beat Mary Rauh by 53% to 45%. In 2000, he was re-elected to a fourth term against attorney Barney Brannen by 56% to 41%. In 2002, Rep. Bass defeated Richard Swett&#x27;s wife, Katrina Swett, by 57% to 41%. In 2004, he was challenged in the Republican primary by State Representative Mark Brady, whom Bass defeated by 71% to 29%. In the general election, he defeated attorney Paul Hodes by 59% to 38%, which remains the best election performance of his career.

;2006

In the Republican primary, Bass won 75% to Berlin Mayor Bob Danderson&#x27;s 13% and Mary Maxwell&#x27;s 11%. In the general election, Hodes ran against Bass in a rematch. In late September, a top Bass staffer resigned after news broke that a U.S. government computer from Bass&#x27; D.C. office had been posting anonymous concern troll messages to New Hampshire blogs. In these messages, &quot;IndyNH&quot; claimed to be a supporter of Paul Hodes who was discouraged by Bass&#x27; unbeatable lead and urged other Hodes supporters to turn their efforts to other, more winnable races. Hodes out-raised Bass and the race was predicted to be more competitive than two years previously. Initially, Bass maintained early leads over Hodes in most polls, ranging from just seven points in one poll to twenty-seven in another. However, as the election drew nearer, polls indicated either a slight Hodes lead or a general tossup. Just before election day, Hodes pulled in front of Bass in numerous polls. On election day at 10:30 pm, Bass conceded defeat to Hodes, who garnered 53% of the vote as opposed to 45% for Bass.

;2010

In 2010, Hodes declined to seek re-election to run for the U.S. Senate. Bass ran for his old seat and won the Republican primary with 42%. Jennifer Horn, the nominee for the seat in 2008, came second with 35% and State Representative Bob Giuda came third with 17%. Two other candidates took the remaining 5% of the vote. In the general election, Bass faced Ann McLane Kuster, daughter of Susan McLane, who had finished ahead of Bass in the Republican primary in 1980. Polls initially showed Bass with a wide lead but the race narrowed and Kuster pulled ahead in the final polls. Ultimately, despite the Republicans making widespread gains, Bass defeated Kuster by just 3,550 votes – 48% to 47%.

;2012

Bass ran for re-election in 2012, winning the Republican primary with 81% of the vote. Dennis Lamare came second with 9%, Will Dean came third with 4%, Miroslaw Dziedzic came fourth with 3% and Gerard Beloin came fifth with 2%. In the general election, Bass faced a rematch with Ann McLane Kuster. Early polling predicted another tight race but by September, Kuster had opened up a lead, which she did not relinquish for the rest of the race. On November 6, Bass lost to Kuster by 50% to 45%.

===Tenure (1995–2007; 2011–2013)===
Bass was elected to Congress in 1994, where he served for twelve years. As part of the 1994 Republican Revolution, he signed Newt Gingrich&#x27;s Contract With America.

Bass was among the first and most vocal congressmen to demand that Tom DeLay step aside as House Majority Leader in 2005 and led the petition that resulted in DeLay&#x27;s removal from House leadership. 

Bass is a member of the Republican Majority For Choice, Republicans For Choice PAC, and Republicans for Environmental Protection. He is a director and former head of The Republican Main Street Partnership, a coalition of centrist Republicans.

;Abortion
Bass believes that abortion should be legal and supports the Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade. He receives strong ratings from pro-choice interest groups and relatively low ratings from anti-abortion groups. In 2005, NARAL Pro-Choice America reported that his voting record aligned with the group&#x27;s interests 100% of the time, and in 2006, Planned Parenthood reported an 82% rating for the same statistic. From 2003 to 2004, the National Right to Life Committee reported that he supported the group&#x27;s interests in 27% of his votes.

Although Bass supports the continued legalization of abortion, he does not support federal funding for abortion, or the legalization of partial-birth abortions. In 2010, he stated, &quot;I support the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision; however, I oppose federal funding of abortions (Hyde Amendment) and support banning of so-called partial-birth abortions.&quot; He consistently voted for bills banning the practice of late term or partial- birth abortion, including H.R. 3660 [106th]: Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2000 and H.R. 760 [108th]: Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.

;Environment
Bass supports environmental protection regulations and alternative energy sources. He voted against Republican amendments of the FY 2011 spending bill, which would defund many environmental protection measures, such as the modification of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the designation of fossil fuel combustion waste as hazardous material, and the enforcement of mining regulations from the EPA. He states on his official website that he supports the promotion of &quot;clean, alternative energies that will lessen our dependence on foreign sources of oil,&quot; a position he has upheld by voting for the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which appropriates large amounts of funding for the pursuit of renewable energy. He defines his position on climate change, stating, &quot;The overwhelming scientific evidence points to the existence of global climate change.&quot;

;Publicly Administered Health Insurance
Although Congressman Bass recognizes a need for health care reform, he opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and supports its repeal. He believes that the act will saddle &quot;future generations of Americans with mountains of unsustainable debt&quot; and, instead, advocates creating an interstate health insurance market to increase competition and form a larger risk pool. Congressman Bass voted for H.R. 1217 – To repeal the Prevention and Public Health Fund in 2011, a bill that would end funding to the Prevention and Public Health Fund of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

;Gay Rights
After losing re-election in 2012, Bass came out in favor of same-sex marriage as a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.

<text>Lawrence Robert Bowa (born December 6, 1945) is an American former professional baseball shortstop, manager, and coach in Major League Baseball (MLB), who played for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, and New York Mets. Bowa went on to manage the San Diego Padres and Phillies, and is currently a senior advisor to the general manager of the Phillies.

==Early life==
Bowa was born in Sacramento, California, the son of Paul Bowa, a former minor-league infielder and manager in the St. Louis Cardinals farm system. While at C. K. McClatchy High School, Bowa tried out but never made the school&#x27;s baseball team. After graduation, Bowa went to Sacramento City College where he started, and was expected to go in the MLB Draft, but didn&#x27;t. The Philadelphia Phillies were the only Major League team interested in Bowa. They sent a local scout, Eddie Bockman to watch Bowa play in a doubleheader, only for Bowa to be thrown out of both games for arguing. Bockman had a winter league team in the area and offered Bowa a chance to play. Bowa played well and signed with the Phillies for a $2,000 bonus. After 4 years in the minors, he made the Phillies&#x27; roster at the age of 24 in 1970.

==Professional career==
Bowa won two Gold Glove Awards and led the National League (NL) in fielding percentage six times, then a league record. He retired with the NL record for career games at shortstop (2222) and was also among the career leaders in assists (sixth, 6857) and double plays (fourth, 1265); Bowa&#x27;s records have since been broken, though he retains the NL mark for career fielding percentage. Apart from his fielding achievements, Bowa was a switch-hitter, batting .280 or better four times (.305 in 1975); he also had nine seasons with 20 or more stolen bases.

===Philadelphia Phillies (1970-1981)===

From his 1970 rookie season through 1981, Bowa provided solid reliability in the Phillies&#x27; infield, along with third baseman Mike Schmidt; from 1976 to 1981, the Phillies reached the postseason five times, ending a drought dating back a quarter of a century. In 1978, Bowa had one of his most productive seasons, hitting .294 and leading NL shortstops with a .986 fielding percentage while finishing third in NL MVP voting. He batted .333 in a losing cause in the 1978 NLCS, but played an even greater role in 1980, hitting .316 in the NLCS and .375 in the World Series, as the Phillies captured the first title in franchise history. In 1979, Bowa set a Major League record for shortstops with a .991 fielding average; Tony Fernández broke the record with a .992 mark in , and Rey Ordóñez broke the NL record with a .994 average in . Bowa tied Ozzie Smith for the most post-1930 seasons with at least 400 at-bats and no home runs, with six.

===Chicago Cubs (1982-1985)===

By the end of the 1981 season, Bowa had worn out his welcome with the Phillies&#x27; front office, and let it be known he was available. The Chicago Cubs, who had just hired former Phillies manager Dallas Green as general manager, quickly expressed interest. However, Green, who had managed the 1980 world champions, knew that Bowa didn&#x27;t have many years left and demanded a young rookie third baseman named Ryne Sandberg as a part of the trade. In return, the Phillies received shortstop Iván DeJesús. The trade paid off tremendously for the Cubs, as Bowa&#x27;s veteran leadership and Sandberg&#x27;s outstanding all-around play (en route to a Hall of Fame career) brought the Cubs to the postseason in for the first time in 39 years.

At the beginning of the 1985 season, Bowa lost the Cubs&#x27; starting shortstop job to veteran journeyman Chris Speier and eventually to their 1982 first-round draft pick, Shawon Dunston, mainly because he couldn&#x27;t get the ball all the way from shortstop to first base, which left the 39-year-old Bowa discontented with the Cubs&#x27; organization. After becoming the San Diego Padres&#x27; manager in 1987, Bowa vented his frustrations with the Cubs in an autobiography, titled &quot;Bleep!&quot;

===New York Mets (1985)===
After being released by the Cubs in August 1985, he played the last month of the season with the New York Mets, before retiring.

Bowa was a .260 career hitter with 15 home runs, 525 RBI, 2,191 hits, 987 runs, 262 doubles, 99 triples, and 318 stolen bases in 2,247 games. His NL records for career games at shortstop and most years leading the league in fielding were later broken by Ozzie Smith; Bowa&#x27;s Major League record for career fielding average has been broken by Omar Vizquel.

==Managerial and coaching career==

===San Diego Padres (1987-1988)===
After retiring, Bowa was named manager of the Las Vegas Stars, the Triple-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres, for the 1986 season. In Bowa&#x27;s only season at the helm, the Stars went 80–62 en route to the Pacific Coast League championship.

Bowa was hired to manage the Padres on October 28, 1986, a little over a year after playing in his final MLB game. His aggressive and often angry style combined with an extremely young and inexperienced roster led to a down 1987 season in San Diego, and when higher expectations for the 1988 team (mainly engendered by those young players showing greatly improved performances in the 2nd half of the 1987 season and the 1988 spring training slate) were not met, he was fired on May 28, 1988, with an overall record of 81–127 as the club&#x27;s skipper.

===First stint with the Philadelphia Phillies (1989-1996)===

Bowa returned to the Phillies as the team&#x27;s third base coach on August 11, and remained there through the season. In 1993, he and John Vukovich became the first two Phillies in franchise history to go to the World Series with the club as both a player and coach (Vukovich was Bowa&#x27;s teammate on the 1980 World Champions and was the bench coach for the &#x27;93 National League champs. Milt Thompson, an outfielder for the 1993 club, would become the third member of this group when he served as hitting coach for the 2008 World Champions and 2009 National League Champions).

When Jim Fregosi was fired as Phillies manager following the 1996 season, Bowa was one of the candidates to interview for the vacant position, which ultimately went to Terry Francona.

===Anaheim Angels (1997-1999) and Seattle Mariners (2000)===
Bowa then joined the Anaheim Angels as their third base coach, where he served from to before spending the season in the same capacity with the Seattle Mariners.

===Second stint with the Philadelphia Phillies (2001-2004)===
After being passed over for the job four years earlier, Bowa was named manager of the Phillies on November 1, 2000. Taking over a team that had gone 65–97 in , Bowa led the club to a surprising 86–76 mark in , two games behind the National League East Champion Atlanta Braves. Bowa was honored as National League Manager of the Year and also received the &quot;Sporting News&quot; NL Manager of the Year Award that year. In addition, he was voted the &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot; Internet Baseball Awards NL Manager of the Year in 2001.

Despite a promising first season at the helm, Bowa&#x27;s Phillies could never quite build off the 2001 club&#x27;s surprising success. A disappointing 80–81 campaign in would be the franchise&#x27;s last losing season until . The and seasons saw the Phillies finish with similar records of 86–76, and the former season was marked by considerable turmoil with Bowa having clashes with such players as Tyler Houston and Pat Burrell. Though respectable, much more was expected from the club in those latter two campaigns and Bowa was fired with two games remaining in the 2004 season after failing to reach the postseason or finish within 10 games of first place in his last three years. Bowa&#x27;s managerial record with the Phillies was 337–308.

===New York Yankees (2006-2007) and Los Angeles Dodgers (2008-2010)===

After a one-year absence, Bowa returned to the field as third base coach for the New York Yankees in , a position he held for two seasons.

On November 5, 2007, the Los Angeles Dodgers hired Bowa to be the team&#x27;s third base coach, following the hire of new manager Joe Torre, under whom Bowa had served with the Yankees. Torre became the seventh manager to have Bowa on his staff as third base coach, following Lee Elia, John Vukovich, Nick Leyva, Jim Fregosi, Terry Collins, and Lou Piniella. The Dodgers won consecutive National League West titles in 2008 and 2009, but in both seasons were eliminated in five games in the NLCS by the Phillies, managed by Bowa&#x27;s permanent successor in Philadelphia, Charlie Manuel.

The conclusion of Bowa&#x27;s tenure with the Dodgers coincided with Torre&#x27;s retirement at the end of the season.

===Third stint with the Philadelphia Phillies (2014-2017)===
Bowa reunited with Joe Torre and served as his bench coach for the USA team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

Bowa returned to Major League Baseball and the Phillies by joining Ryne Sandberg&#x27;s staff as bench coach for the season. Bowa remained with the Phillies as bench coach under Pete Mackanin, who took over after Sandberg resigned during the season.

Bowa was relieved of his coaching duties on October 13, 2017, and accepted the role as Matt Klentak&#x27;s senior advisor to the general manager.

==Broadcasting career==

===ESPN and XM radio===
Bowa spent the season as an analyst for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; and co-hosted a baseball talk show on XM Radio.

After leaving the Dodgers, Bowa was a studio analyst for the MLB Network from 2011 to 2013, regularly appearing on the network&#x27;s daily studio show &quot;MLB Tonight.&quot; He also hosted a weekly show during the baseball season with Chris Russo on Sirius XM while occasionally providing postgame analysis for Phillies games on WPHL.

<text>Ogooué-Ivindo Province is the northeasternmost of Gabon&#x27;s nine provinces, though its Lopé Department is in the very center of the country. It gets its name from two rivers, the Ogooué and the Ivindo. This province, containing thousands of square kilometres of rainforest, is the largest and most sparsely populated and much less developed than the rest of the country. As of 2013 it had a population of 63,293 people. The principal town is Makokou.

==History==
In 1873–4, Antoine-Alfred Marche and Victor de Compiègne (the Marquis de Compiegné) explored the Ogooué River region. They arrived in Lopé in 1874 but encountered hostility from the Fang-Meke people at the mouth of the Ivindo. Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza similarly made excursion to the region in November 1875 and between 1879 and 1882.

In January 1995, a bout of the Ebola virus broke out in the forests of Ogooué-Ivindo. Nine out of 19 people died in the cases registered out of a population of 350 people.
In 2010 it was reported that yellow fever continued to affect the province.

==Population==
The largest ethnic groups living in this province are the Fang, Kota, and the Kwele.

==Geography and wildlife==
The province spans part of the centre to the northeast of Gabon, covering an area of . Ogooué-Ivindo borders the Sangha and Cuvette-Ouest departments of the Republic of the Congo to the south and southeast, Haut-Ogooué to the southeast, Ogooué-Lolo to the south, Ngounié to the southwest (at a quadripoint), Moyen-Ogooué to the west, and Woleu-Ntem to the north-northwest. The southern part of the province is crossed by the Equator, with the Lopé Department lying mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. The regional capital is Makokou, by road east of the national capital of Libreville and southwest of Mékambo.

The principal rivers of the province are the Ogooué and the Ivindo. In the southwest is Ivindo National Park, established in 2002, which contains the Koungou, Mingouli and Djidji waterfalls. Lopé National Park, also in the southwest of the province, covering an area of , lies to the north of the Chaillu Mountains and east of the Mingoué River. It is highly biologically rich, with over 1500 recorded plant species, 412 out of 700 species of bird found in Gabon, and large populations of mandrills, gorillas and chimpanzees. The Station D&#x27;Etudes des Gorilles et Chimpanzes, co-managed by the CIRMF and CWS, is a monitoring facility at Lopé. In the eastern part of the province is Mwagna National Park, which contains dense rainforest and is virtually uninhabited by humans but is biologically rich. The Lodié and the Louayé rivers flow through Mwagna National Park. Mount Bélinga contains resources of iron in the vicinity, which the government are planning on exploiting.

The lowland forests in the basin of the Ivindo River are home to one of the most diverse lowland forest avifaunas in all of Africa. Ipassa Research Station is an Important Bird Area near the provincial capital of Makokou, here 190 species of bird restricted to the Guinea-Congo Forest biome have been recorded, this is the highest total for any IBA within the biome.

===Departments===
Administratively, Ogooué-Ivindo is divided into 4 departments:
*Ivindo Department (Makokou) 
*Lope Department (Booué)
*Mvoung Department (Ovan) 
*Zadie Department (Mekambo)

==Landmarks==
Makokou contains the Cathedral of Our Lady of Victories.

==Transport==
The main roads passing through the province are the RN3 and RN4 roads. Makokou is home to Makokou Airport.

<text>David Harold Yost (; born January 7, 1969) is an American actor and producer. He is best known for portraying Billy Cranston in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers Cosmic Fury&quot;.

==Early life==
Yost was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa. He moved around the United States while winning many national gymnastics competitions, most notably the state championships in Iowa and Montana. In 1987, he graduated from Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, California. In 1991, he graduated from Graceland University in Lamoni, Iowa with a Bachelor of Arts in communication and dramatic arts.

==Career==
Yost moved to California with hopes of becoming an actor, and won the part of Billy Cranston (Blue Power Ranger) in the television series &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; three months after arriving. He starred in almost 200 episodes of the show&#x27;s first four seasons. He was the only cast member to appear in every single episode of the original series; his character never changed his colors or passed on his power coins to successors like the rest of the original cast. Yost&#x27;s most high-profile work was his appearance in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot; (1995), which took in over $60 million at the box office. The film served as a non-canonical alternate opening for the third season.

After the show ended and &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; began in the fourth season, Yost stayed on as Billy, but Billy&#x27;s role within the show changed. Instead of his previous role as a Power Ranger, he became a technical advisor to the others. When asked about the change in a 2010 interview, Yost was evasive about how he&#x27;d personally felt about this but said he understood why the production team did it; he stated that Haim Saban was interested in the cast turnover of &quot;Super Sentai&quot; and believes that this was part of it. Yost left the show toward the end of the &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; season. His character&#x27;s final episode employed footage from previous episodes and voice work from an uncredited actor to conceal the fact that Yost was not present during the taping. A tribute to his character was seen in the closing credits of this episode.

While it was originally believed that he had left the series due to insufficient pay, Yost later revealed in a 2010 interview that he left because he could no longer handle harassment by members of the production crew who targeted him over his sexual orientation. According to Yost, he was often called a &quot;faggot&quot;, and the producers frequently questioned other cast members in private about his sexuality. Yost left late in the fourth season after a week of contemplation and thoughts of suicide instead of continuing work another six months into the . He stated that the co-workers involved with writing, filming, and producing the show considered him &quot;not worthy&quot; to be where he was and that he &quot;could not be a superhero&quot; because of his homosexuality.

Scott Page-Pagter, a producer of the show starting with &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, responded through TMZ that Yost actually left over a pay bonus being dropped but did not elaborate further or dispute any of Yost&#x27;s claims about the outside reasons for leaving the show. Saban Entertainment made no official statement regarding the subject. After Yost left the show, he attempted to change his sexual orientation with conversion therapy for two years. Eventually, he had a nervous breakdown that resulted in his psychiatric hospitalization for five weeks. After he checked out, he moved to Mexico for a year and eventually accepted his sexuality.

Yost starred as Josh White in the film &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; (1996). He portrayed a Playboy photographer in the television film &quot;After Diff&#x27;rent Strokes: When the Laughter Stopped&quot; (2000). He was an associate producer for another television film, &quot;The Mary Kay Letourneau Story&quot; (2000). He first tried producing in 2001, working on the series &quot;Alien Hunter&quot; and &quot;Temptation Island&quot;. He worked as the director of production for &quot;Sci-Fi Lab&quot;, headed by the Sci-Fi Channel. He then became the manager of licensing for Geneon, where he sold television shows and films to such networks as Showtime, Starz, Encore, and Cartoon Network.

In 2002, Yost performed in a play called &quot;Fallen Guardian Angels&quot; in Los Angeles for AIDS Project Los Angeles. The play was about six actors dealing with HIV in various situations. The proceeds went to benefit The Children&#x27;s Hospitals AIDS Center. The entire production raised over $25,000 and Yost himself raised $5,000 for the hospital, as well as receiving good reviews from &quot;LA Weekly Theater&quot;. In 2004, he worked as a field producer for the English documentary series &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;. He appeared at the Anime Festival Orlando in Florida in August 2010. He has participated in the NOH8 Campaign. He appeared at Power Morphicon 2012 and 2014 in Pasadena, California along with his former co-stars. Yost appeared alongside his friend and former Power Rangers co-star, Amy Jo Johnson in one of Johnson&#x27;s Stageit webcast shows in 2014. As of 2015, Yost remains on the convention circuit.

In 2016, Yost became co-owner of Affirmative Clothing along with Harlingen, Texas entrepreneurs Mason and Cris Andrade. Named after one of Billy&#x27;s catch phrases, Affirmative has apparel with designs mostly inspired by &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, which Yost and the Andrade brothers first sold on conventions they attended.

In 2017, he starred in the short film &quot;The Order&quot; alongside other former &quot;Power Rangers&quot; co-stars.

In May 2018, shortly after Hasbro acquired the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, Yost (via Twitter) expressed his desire to help produce a &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; reunion film for Netflix. In September 2022, it was announced that Yost was returning to the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise for a 30th-anniversary special, accompanied by original Black Ranger actor Walter Emanuel Jones as well as former co-stars Steve Cardenas, Johnny Yong Bosch, Karan Ashley, and Catherine Sutherland. The special titled &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot; was released on April 19, 2023.

<doc id="607114" wikidata="Q7334469" url="?curid=607114" title="Rimington Trophy">
<text>The Dave Rimington Trophy is awarded to the player considered to be the best center in college football. Dave Rimington was a center who played at the University of Nebraska from 1979 to 1982.

A member of the National College Football Awards Association, the Rimington Trophy serves as a fundraiser for the Boomer Esiason Foundation&#x27;s fight against cystic fibrosis. The sculptor of the Dave Rimington Trophy is Marc Mellon, also the sculptor of the NBA MVP Trophy.

==Selection process==
The winner of the Rimington Trophy is selected by determining the consensus All-American center pick from four existing All-America teams. While more than a dozen All-America football teams are selected annually, the Rimington Trophy committee uses these four prestigious teams to determine a winner:

• American Football Coaches Association 
• Walter Camp Foundation 
• &quot;The Sporting News&quot; 
• Football Writers Association of America 

Because the selectors of these four All-America teams can place centers in a &quot;mix&quot; of offensive linemen that includes guards and tackles, their 11-man first teams can often have two centers. The Rimington Trophy committee&#x27;s policy is to count all players who play primarily the center position for their respective teams as centers, though they may be listed as guards or tackles on the four All-American teams. The center with the most first-team votes is determined to be the winner. If a tie occurs with first-team votes, then the center with most second-team votes wins. If a tie still exists, the winner is determined by a majority vote from the Rimington Trophy committee.

==Winners==

==Gerald R. Ford Legends Award==
Since 2005, the Rimington Trophy also recognizes legendary centers from the past by presenting the President Gerald R. Ford Legendary Center Award, which is named after Gerald Ford. The award is presented annually to a former collegiate or professional center who was either a legend on or off the field by making extraordinary contributions through business, civic, or philanthropic endeavors.

<text>The Ivindo River (French: &quot;Rivière Ivindo&quot;) is the most important tributary of the Ogooué River, which flows in Gabon.

== Course ==
The Ivindo River flows from northeast Gabon to the southwest, eventually emptying into the Ogooué River. It flows through some of the wildest and most attractive rainforest in Africa. The upper stretch of the river is fairly gentle, draining the gentle plateau of eastern Gabon. Below the town of Makokou, the only significant town on the river, it drops off the plateau in a series of spectacular waterfalls and gorges.

== Tributaries ==
* Djoua, which is also a natural border between Gabon and Congo
* Djadie, also written Zadia, which flows across Mekambo
* Liboumba, whose main tributary is the Lodié River
* Mvoung, which flows across Ovan and main tributary is the Kuye River
* Oua
* Bouinandjé
* Karangoua

== Exploration ==
The Ivindo below Makokou was first traversed by a whitewater expedition in 1998. This was a group from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, consisting of Chris Guier, Bruce Hayse, Louise Lasley, Marilyn Olsen, Rick Sievers and Howie Wolke. The group encountered four impressive falls: Kongue, Mingouli, Tsengue Leledei, and an unnamed and undescribed falls between Mingouli and Tsengue Leledei which was perhaps the most beautiful of all. There were many stretches of whitewater and the banks were remarkable for groups of unafraid elephants and occasional other mammals.

== Trivia ==
* The Trans-Gabon Railway has two bridges over the confluence between the Ivindo and the Ogowe Rivers.
* Much of the area around the Ivindo has received National Park status.

<text>John Kay (1742 – 21 February 1826) was a Scottish caricaturist and engraver.

==Life==

John Kay was born in April 1742 in Gibraltar Cottage just south of Dalkeith, Scotland, where his father, John Kay, worked as a mason. His mother, Helen Alexander, owned several properties in Edinburgh and the Canongate and was relatively wealthy. When his father died in 1748, John was sent to live in Leith, the harbour area of Edinburgh, with some of her relatives, who treated him very badly. At age 13 he returned to Dalkeith where he was apprenticed to George Heriot, a barber in the town, whom he served for six years.

In 1761 he went to Edinburgh, where he served 7 years as a journeyman but not being an Edinburgh citizen had to purchase the freedom to trade as a barber from the Society of Surgeon-Barbers, which he eventually did in December 1771 at age 29, on payment of £40. He then set up business on the High Street in Edinburgh. He had several high ranking clients and made friends with several, notably William Nisbet of Dirleton who became a constant companion.

In 1784 he began engraving his drawings and published his first caricature: James Robertson of Kincraigie, &quot;the daft highland laird&quot;. In 1785, induced by the favour which greeted certain attempts of his to etch in aquafortis, he took down his barber&#x27;s pole and opened a small print shop in Parliament Close. There he continued to flourish, painting miniatures, and publishing at short intervals his sketches and caricatures of local celebrities and oddities, who abounded at that period in Edinburgh society. From 1785 he abandoned his business as barber to concentrate on drawing. This was facilitated by annuities paid to him by Sir Henry Jardine and the estate of William Nisbet.

Kay&#x27;s portraits were collected by Hugh Paton and published under the title &quot;A series of original portraits and caricature etchings by the late John Kay, with biographical sketches and illustrative anecdotes&quot; (Edinburgh, 2 vols. 4to, 1838; 8vo ed., 4 vols., 1842; new 4to ed., with additional plates, 2 vols., 1877), forming a unique record of the social life and popular habits of Edinburgh at its most interesting epoch. Kay&#x27;s famous shop on the Royal Mile was destroyed during the Great Edinburgh Fire of November 1824. 

He died at 227 High Street in Edinburgh and was buried at the north-west corner of Greyfriars Kirkyard. The British Museum has extensive holdings of his works, including two albums apparently assembled by Kay, both described in the Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum

==Family==

In 1762 he married Lilly Steven by whom he had ten children all of which died young except for one son, William Kay. Lilly died in 1785 and in 1787 Kay married Margaret Scott (d.1835).

<text>Joseph Edmund &quot;Jeb&quot; Bradley III (born October 20, 1952) is an American politician and member of the Republican Party who served in New Hampshire’s State Senate from 2009 to 2024. He was a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 1990 to 2000, and then served as the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2007. He was Majority Leader of the New Hampshire Senate from 2010 to 2018 and again from 2020 to 2022.

==Early life and education==
Bradley was born in Rumford, Maine, to Helen Jockers Bradley and Joseph Edmund Bradley, Jr. After graduating from Governor Dummer Academy, he attended Tufts University, graduating in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts with a major in sociology.

== Career ==
Bradley lived in Switzerland and worked as a street magician, returning in 1981 to New Hampshire, where he later opened an organic grocery called Evergrain Natural Foods. He and his wife sold the natural foods store in 1997. He also ran a painting business, and managed real estate.

Bradley was elected to the Wolfeboro Planning Board in 1986; three years later, he was named to the Budget Committee. He was a registered Democrat until 1989, when he switched to the Republican party.

Bradley won a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives in November 1990 and was re-elected five times. In the legislature, he sponsored the Clean Power Act, which set limits on power plant emissions. He was chairman of the Science, Technology and Energy Committee, as well as the Joint Committee on Ethics.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2002
Bradley was first elected to Congress in 2002, winning the Republican nomination in a field of eight candidates,
for the seat left vacant when Republican incumbent John E. Sununu ran for the Senate. He defeated Democrat Martha Fuller Clark in the general election, winning with 58 percent of the vote.

;2004
In 2004, Bradley defeated political newcomer Justin Nadeau of Portsmouth to win a second term, receiving 63% of the vote. Bradley outspent Nadeau 3 to 1.

Bradley&#x27;s chief of staff, Debra J. Vanderbeek, ran his 2004 campaign. Tom Anfinson, the financial administrator in Bradley&#x27;s government office, said that Vanderbeek was paid 100 percent of her salary until the end of May 2004, 80 percent between June and September, and 50 percent between October and early November. Bradley&#x27;s re-election committee paid her $13,561 in salary for the campaign, which she failed to report as outside income to the Clerk of the House, plus $3,317 in reimbursements for un-itemized campaign expenses.

;2006

Bradley sought a third term in 2006. He defeated Michael Callis in the Republican primary on September 12, 2006, winning 87% of the vote. Bradley faced Democrat Carol Shea-Porter and Libertarian party candidate Dan Belforti in the November 2006 general election. In what was considered an upset, Bradley lost his bid for re-election to Shea-Porter.

Bradley and Shea-Porter met October 24 for a debate sponsored by WMUR-TV and the New Hampshire Union Leader, and debated again on October 31.

;2008

In January 2007, Bradley announced his intention to reclaim his former seat. He said he&#x27;d made up his mind a few days after his loss. He lost the general election to incumbent Carol Shea-Porter, 52%–46%.

===Tenure===

Members of the media, colleagues and opponents described Bradley as a moderate in the Republican Party when he was elected in 2002. He sided with his party by supporting the war in Iraq, the reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act, the prohibition of federal funding of overseas abortion, the $5 billion subsidy for the Chinese nuclear program. However, he opposed President Bush&#x27;s energy bill and supported the Medicare Part D prescription drug subsidy. He has cosponsored bills to loosen regulations on embryonic stem cell research.

Bradley served on the Armed Services, Budget, Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Small Business committees.

Bradley has belonged to Christine Todd Whitman&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s My Party Too!&quot;, The Republican Main Street Partnership, The Republican Majority For Choice, Republicans For Choice and Republicans for Environmental Protection.

Bradley voted in favor of the 2006 &quot;Same Sex Marriage Resolution&quot;, which would have amended the Constitution, requiring that marriage &quot;shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman.&quot;

Bradley opposed an increase in the national minimum wage during his time in Congress.

Bradley, who has visited Iraq three times, has been a supporter of the Iraq War. In January 2006 he said &quot;It is not possible to predict exactly when stability in Iraq will occur, but the progress is significant.&quot; In June 2006 he said that he did not support a specific timetable for withdrawing American troops from the country, but that he saw signs of progress that the United States would be able to leave &quot;sooner rather than later&quot;. In August 2006 he said that Iraq needed a stable government and more security forces before the United States could set a withdrawal date. In October 2006 he said &quot;I look at the fact that Iraq has become central to the war on terror&quot;, and &quot;We have got to achieve stability in Iraq and prevent it from becoming a launching pad for terrorists.&quot;

He lost his seat in 2006 to an outspokenly antiwar candidate, Carol Shea-Porter. That year (and in 2008), the Democrats swept the state legislature and both U.S. House seats.

==State Senate==

===Elections===
;2009
A few weeks into the new legislative session, Bradley&#x27;s local State Senator, Bill Denley, resigned the seat after being charged with drunk driving for the third time. Bradley won a special election over Willard &quot;Bud&quot; Martin, who had lost to Denley in 2008.

;2010
Bradley successfully ran for re-election as a State Senator during the 2010 election cycle. He was unopposed in the September 14 Republican state primary, and faced Democratic candidate Beverly Woods in the November 2 general election.

===Tenure===
After the elections, in which the Republican party regained the majority in the State Senate, Bradley was appointed Senate Majority Leader.

Bradley&#x27;s former Congressional aide, Frank Guinta (also a former mayor of Manchester and former state representative), ran as a Republican for Bradley&#x27;s old Congressional seat. Bradley did not endorse his former aide in the primary. In mid-August 2010, a month before the primary, Bradley stated that Guinta should consider dropping out of the race if he was unable to explain some possible irregularities in his campaign finance reports. Guinta did not drop out of the race and was elected to Congress.

Bradley has been categorized as anti-choice by NH Choice Tracker, which notes that he &quot;voted to pass a bill that repeals the right of reproductive centers to create protest-free &#x27;buffer zones&#x27; outside their clinics,&quot; a bill which would greatly impede the ability of members of the public to access reproductive care. He also supported the controversial Education Freedom Account program, which since 2021 has funneled nearly $45 million of public funds toward private schools with no oversight.

In 2024 Bradley fought to radically amend the Senate’s version of HB1163, which would have legalized cannabis and regulated it similarly to alcohol, though he later voted against it anyway. His and others’ edits to the bill were widely blamed for the bill’s ultimate failure in the House, a vote which was decried by ACLU Executive Director Devon Chaffee as a sign “that lawmakers are willing to ignore the will of their own constituents and are okay with continuing to needlessly ensnare over a thousand people – disproportionately Black people – in New Hampshire’s criminal justice system every year.” Ahead of the Senate vote on the bill, Bradley admitted, “I don’t want to see it get out of the Senate, period.”

==Personal life==
Bradley lives in Wolfeboro. He and his former wife Barbara have four children: Jan, Ramona, Urs and Sebastian. An avid hiker, Bradley has ascended all of New Hampshire&#x27;s 48 4,000-foot peaks and is a member of the Appalachian Mountain Club&#x27;s Four Thousand Footer Club. Bradley has completed the GRID which is when every 4,000-foot peak in New Hampshire is ascended in every month of the year. He completed the GRID on Mount Madison on January 14, 2015.

Bradley has a portfolio of stocks and bonds worth over $5 million. In October 2006, he said that putting his personal investments in a blind trust may be a &quot;good idea&quot;, and that he was going to look into that option. The point became moot in January 2007, when he became a private citizen again.

Bradley remarried in 2018.

<doc id="607130" wikidata="Q3049292" url="?curid=607130" title="Constrictive pericarditis">
<text>Constrictive pericarditis is a condition characterized by a thickened, fibrotic pericardium, limiting the heart&#x27;s ability to function normally. In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a heart attack.

==Causes==
The cause of constrictive pericarditis in the developing world are idiopathic in origin, though likely infectious in nature. In regions where tuberculosis is common, it is the cause in a large portion of cases.
Causes of constrictive pericarditis include:
* Tuberculosis
* Incomplete drainage of purulent pericarditis
* Fungal and parasitic infections
* Chronic pericarditis
* Postviral pericarditis
* Postsurgical
* Following MI, post-myocardial infarction
* In association with pulmonary asbestos

== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the heart. This shell prevents the heart from expanding when blood enters it. As pressure on the heart increases, the stroke volume decreases as a result of a reduction in the diastolic expansion in the chambers. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the heart.

During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs.

During expiration, the amount of blood entering the left ventricle will increase, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, decreasing the right heart ventricular filing.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often difficult to make. In particular, restrictive cardiomyopathy has many similar clinical features to constrictive pericarditis, and differentiating them in a particular individual is often a diagnostic dilemma.
* Chest X-Ray - pericardial calcification (common but not specific), pleural effusions are common findings.
* Echocardiography - the principal echographic finding is changes in cardiac chamber volume.
* CT and MRI - CT scan is useful in assessing the thickness of pericardium, calcification, and ventricular contour. Cardiac MRI may find pericardial thickening and pericardial-myocardial adherence. Ventricular septum shift during breathing can also be found using cardiac MRI. Late gadolinium enhancement can show enhancement of the pericardium due to fibroblast proliferation and neovascularization.
* BNP blood test - tests for the existence of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide, which is only present in restrictive cardiomyopathy but not in constrictive pericarditis
* Conventional cardiac catheterization
* Physical examination - can reveal clinical features including Kussmaul&#x27;s sign and a pericardial knock.

== Treatment ==
The definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis is pericardial stripping, which is a surgical procedure where the entire pericardium is peeled away from the heart. This procedure has significant risk involved, with mortality rates of 6% or higher in major referral centers.

A poor outcome is almost always the result after a pericardiectomy is performed for constrictive pericarditis whose origin was radiation-induced, further some patients may develop heart failure post-operatively.

<doc id="607133" wikidata="Q5169280" url="?curid=607133" title="Copyright misuse">
<text>Copyright misuse is an equitable defence to copyright infringement in the United States based upon the doctrine of unclean hands. The misuse doctrine provides that the copyright holder engaged in abusive or improper conduct in exploiting or enforcing the copyright will be precluded from enforcing his rights against the infringer. Copyright misuse is often comparable to and draws from the older and more established doctrine of patent misuse, which bars a patentee from obtaining relief for infringement when he extends his patent rights beyond the limited monopoly conferred by the law.

The doctrine forbids the copyright holder from attempting to extend the effect or operation of copyright beyond the scope of the statutory right, for example, by engaging in restrictive licensing practices that are contrary to the public policy underlying copyright law. In fact, the misuse doctrine is said to have evolved to tackle such aggressive licensing practices.

==Requirements==
Although the doctrine of copyright misuse has not yet been delineated, several circuits have upheld the defence on the following policy grounds –

# The plaintiff has violated antitrust laws
# The plaintiff used the copyright in a manner violative of the public policy of copyright law

==Difference from fair use==
Fair use defence to copyright infringement allows unauthorised use of copyrighted work in a reasonable manner under certain circumstances. The following are some of the facets that distinguish the misuse doctrine from fair use –

# Fair use is statutorily recognised in 17 USC § 107, whereas copyright misuse is yet to receive statutory support; and 
# The defendant must prove that his unauthorised use of copyrighted work qualifies for a fair use exception, whereas the defendant need not suffer directly from the misuse to successfully claim an exception to copyright infringement.

==In the United States==
Although the misuse doctrine was a well-known defence in patent infringement cases, it was extended to copyright law in &quot;M. Witmark &amp; Sons v Jensen&quot; for the first time. Consequently, copyright misuse was adopted by various circuit courts in recent years. However, the contours of the doctrine remain uncertain as it is yet to be explicitly recognised by the United States Supreme Court. Some scholars have even advocated for the codification of the misuse doctrine.

=== &quot;Lasercomb America, Inc. v Reynolds&quot; ===
In &quot;Lasercomb America, Inc. v Reynolds,&quot; the Fourth Circuit became the first appellate court to uphold a copyright misuse defence as analogous to the patent misuse defence. In this case, Lasercomb had sued Reynolds for making unauthorised copies of its die-making software, which was subject to copyright protection. Reynolds alleged that Lasercomb had misused its copyright by imposing unreasonable non-compete clause that restricted creating a competing product for a period of one hundred years in its standard licensing agreement. The Court ruled that although the inclusion of such a provision did not constitute an antitrust violation, it did violate the public policy underlying copyright and rendered Lasercomb’s copyright unenforceable. The Court also held that the defendant need not be subjected to the purported misuse in order to set up a valid defence as Reynolds had not signed the standard licensing agreement. Lastly, the Court clarified that Lasercomb was free to initiate a suit for infringement once it has purged itself of the misuse and its copyright was not invalidated.

=== &quot;Practice Management Information Corp. v American Medical Association&quot; ===
The Ninth Circuit was the next circuit to adopt the copyright misuse doctrine in &quot;Practice Management Information Corp. v American Medical Association&quot;. In this case, American Medical Association granted Health Care Financing Administration (now known as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) a non-exclusive, royalty-free perpetual license to use its coding system for medical procedures. However, the license was restricted, as no other coding system could be used. Practice Management, a publisher and distributor of medical books, filed for declaratory relief to have the copyright invalidated when it failed to procure the volume discount it requested. The Court refused to invalidate the copyright but ruled that the licensing provision requiring exclusive use of the coding system constituted copyright misuse.

=== &quot;Alcatel USA Inc. v DGI Technologies Inc.&quot; ===
The Fifth Circuit upheld the defence of copyright misuse in &quot;Alcatel USA, Inc. v DGI Technologies, Inc&quot;. Alcatel licensed the use of its software only along with its manufactured equipment. The terms of the license banned downloading or copying Alcatel’s software. However, DGI downloaded and copied Alcatel’s software in violation of the licensing agreement in order to ensure compatibility with its product. In a suit for infringement of copyright, DGI claimed misuse of copyright by Alcatel. The Court found Alcatel to have exceeded the scope of the copyright grant to gain an extended monopoly, which effectively constituted a copyright misuse.

=== &quot;Assessment Technologies of WI, LLC v WIREdata Inc.&quot; ===
The doctrine of copyright misuse was upheld by the Seventh Circuit in &quot;Assessment Technologies of WI, LLC v WIREdata Inc&quot;, which is another case involving computer software. In this case, WIREdata sought public information about a number of properties from the Wisconsin municipalities. The information was collected by the municipalities and compiled using the plaintiff’s software for tax assessment purposes. Hence, some municipalities refused to furnish the information for fear of infringing Assessment Technologies’ copyright. WIREdata, the defendants in this case, sued in state court for the release of information and Assessment Technologies sued in federal court, claiming that the release would violate its copyright. The Court held that the conduct of the plaintiff amounted to copyright misuse as the information withheld by the municipalities were beyond the purview of the said copyright.

=== &quot;Video Pipeline, Inc. v Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc.&quot; ===
In &quot;Video Pipeline, Inc. v Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc.&quot;, the Third Circuit stated that a copyright holder might commit misuse in trying to enforce a license that prohibits criticism of copyright-protected works. Video Pipeline had an agreement with Disney, which allowed it to compile more than 500 movie trailers. When Video Pipeline started to post the trailers online, Disney asked Video Pipeline to remove the trailers, as they were not covered by the terms of the license. Although Video Pipeline complied with Disney’s request, it sought a declaratory relief that its use of trailers online did not in any manner violate Disney’s copyright. Additionally, Video Pipeline amended the complaint to seek declaratory relief to use a two-minute video clip review it created out of sixty-two movies. Disney, which owned Buena Vista, filed a counterclaim for copyright infringement in response to the suit. The Court observed that the doctrine is yet to be affirmatively expressed by the United States Supreme Court and that the licensing terms were reasonable. Accordingly, the Court ultimately ruled that the doctrine was inapplicable to the factual matrix of this case.

This case has assumed significance because it was decided in a circuit wherein Redbox sued three major studios, namely Universal, Walter and Fox.

==In India==
India has incorporated fair dealing provisions into its domestic law, which provides important limitations to copyright holders’ rights. The doctrine of copyright misuse has not received any statutory support much like in the United States.

=== &quot;Tekla Corporation v Survo Ghosh&quot; ===
In &quot;Tekla Corporation and Ors. v Survo Ghosh and Ors.&quot;, the Delhi High Court ruled that the defence of copyright misuse was not available to the defendants either in a suit for permanent injunction from infringing a plaintiff’s copyright or in an action for damages for copyright infringement. In 2011, the plaintiffs had initiated a suit for copyright infringement against the defendants for unauthorized usage of its software. Instead of invoking any of the exemptions under Section 52 of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, the defendants contested that the plaintiffs were precluded from claiming remedies for infringement as their conduct constituted copyright misuse. It was alleged that the plaintiffs had been charging an exorbitant fee alongside imposing ‘unreasonable&#x27; conditions as a part of their licensing agreements. However, the Court was not persuaded by the American jurisprudence on this subject and refused to recognize the doctrine of copyright misuse, as it would amount to adding more grounds than what the statute already provided. The Court was also concerned about the implications of the doctrine on judicial delays in enforcement of copyright if it were to be adopted in India. Nonetheless, the Court is said to have missed an opportunity to engage with copyright policy prevalent in India.

<text>Shadowland are a British progressive rock band formed in the 1990s. The band&#x27;s music tends towards the pop side of progressive rock, while retaining its melodic and emotional intensity.

Shadowland took a lengthy break from recording and performing between 1996 and 2009. During this time Nolan was writing and performing in Arena, which has a heavier musical style. Nolan has also been Pendragon&#x27;s regular keyboardist since 1986 and, more recently, has written and toured a rock opera entitled &quot;She&quot; in a partnership with Agnieszka Swita under the band name Caamora.

Late in 2008, Nolan announced that Shadowland would be reforming for a tour in early 2009. The tour promoted a best of album, &quot;A Matter of Perspective&quot;, featuring the band&#x27;s favourite tracks from the three previous albums as well as some new material, which was released in 2009.

During the tour Shadowland filmed a DVD, &quot;Edge of Night&quot;, released by Metal Mind Productions. At the same time, Metal Mind also released an individually numbered box set, &quot;Cautionary Tales&quot; containing all the earlier albums with bonus tracks, the &quot;Edge of Night&quot; DVD, and a two disc concert recording called &quot;Live in Poland&quot; which comprises the audio from the DVD.

Mark Westwood (Caamora, Neo) has replaced Ian Salmon on bass in the 2009 incarnation, but the rest of the original 1990s line-up is unchanged.

<text>Charles Hamilton Houston (September 3, 1895 – April 22, 1950) was an American lawyer. He was the dean of Howard University Law School and NAACP first special counsel. A graduate of Amherst College and Harvard Law School, Houston played a significant role in dismantling Jim Crow laws, especially attacking segregation in schools and racial housing covenants. He earned the title &quot;The Man Who Killed Jim Crow&quot;.

Houston is also well known for having trained and mentored a generation of black attorneys, including Thurgood Marshall, future founder and director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the first Black Supreme Court Justice. He recruited young lawyers to work on the NAACP&#x27;s litigation campaigns, building connections between Howard&#x27;s and Harvard&#x27;s university law schools.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Houston was born in Washington, D.C., to a middle-class family who lived in the Strivers&#x27; section. His father William Le Pré Houston, the son of a former slave, had become an attorney and practiced in the capital for more than four decades. Charles&#x27; mother, Mary (born Hamilton) Houston, worked as a seamstress. Houston attended segregated local schools, entering M Street High School (now Dunbar) at the age of 12 and graduating at age 15. He studied at Amherst College beginning in 1911, was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, and graduated as valedictorian in 1915 at the age of 20, the only black student in his class. He returned to D.C. and taught English at Howard University, a historically black college.

As the U.S. entered World War I, Houston joined the U.S. Army as an officer. The military was racially segregated. From 1917 to 1919, he served as a First Lieutenant in the United States Infantry, based in Fort Meade, Maryland, with service in France. After being chastised for, during a brief detail as a Judge Advocate, finding a Black sergeant not worthy of prosecution, Houston wrote later:

The hate and scorn showered on us Negro officers by our fellow Americans convinced me that there was no sense in my dying for a world ruled by them. I made up my mind that if I got through this war I would study law and use my time fighting for men who could not strike back.

After his return to the U.S. in 1919, he entered Harvard Law School. He was the first black student elected to the editorial board of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot;. Houston was also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s of law in 1922 and a DJS from Harvard in 1923. That same year he was awarded a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship to study at the University of Madrid. After his return, he was admitted to the Washington, DC bar in 1924 and joined his father&#x27;s practice.

== Personal life ==
In 1924 Houston married Gladys Moran. They divorced in 1937. He next married Henrietta Williams. They had Houston&#x27;s only child in 1940, Charles Hamilton Houston, Jr. Houston was a founding member of the affiliated Washington Bar Association.

He was recruited to the Howard University faculty by the school&#x27;s first African-American president, Mordecai Johnson. From 1929 to 1935, Houston served as Vice-Dean and Dean of the Howard University School of Law. He developed the school, beginning its years as a major national center for training black lawyers. He extended its part-time program to a full-time curriculum and gained accreditation by the Association of American Law Schools and the American Bar Association. Bringing prominent attorneys to the school as speakers and to build a law network for his students, Houston served as a mentor to a generation. He influenced nearly one-quarter of all the black lawyers in the United States at the time, including former student Thurgood Marshall, who became a United States Supreme Court justice. Houston believed that the law could be used to fight racial discrimination and encouraged his students to work for such social purpose.

Houston left Howard in 1935 to serve as the first special counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), serving in this role until 1940. In this capacity he created litigation strategies to attack racial housing covenants and segregated schools, arguing several important civil rights cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Through his work at the NAACP, Houston played a role in nearly every civil rights case that reached the US Supreme Court between 1930 and &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954).

Houston worked to bring an end to the exclusion of African Americans from juries across the South. He defended African-American George Crawford on charges of murder in Loudoun County, Virginia, in 1933, and saved him from the electric chair.

In the related &quot;Hollins v. State of Oklahoma&quot; (1935), Houston led an all-black legal team before the US Supreme Court to appeal another murder case in which the defendant was convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. The defense team had challenged the all-white jury during the trial, but the conviction was upheld by the appeals court. Hearing the case &quot;a certiorari&quot;, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court&#x27;s decision and ordered a new trial. Hollins was tried a third time, again before an all-white jury, and was convicted in 1936. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 1950. At the time, Oklahoma and southern states systematically excluded blacks from juries, in part because they were not on the voter rolls, having been disenfranchised across the South since the turn of the century by state barriers to voter registration. In the 21st century, attorneys continue to have to challenge prosecutorial strategies that exclude blacks from juries.

Houston&#x27;s strategy on public education was to attack segregation by demonstrating the inequality resulting from the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine dating from the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1897). He orchestrated a campaign to force southern districts to build facilities for blacks equal to those for whites, or to integrate their facilities. He focused on law schools because, at the time, mostly males attended them. He believed this would obviate the fears whites expressed that integrated schools would lead to interracial dating and marriage. In &quot;Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada&quot; (1939), Houston argued that it was unconstitutional for Missouri to exclude blacks from the state&#x27;s university law school when, under the &quot;separate but equal&quot; provision, no comparable facility for blacks existed within the state.

In the documentary &quot;The Road to Brown&quot;, Hon. Juanita Kidd Stout described Houston&#x27;s strategy related to segregated schools:

When he attacked the &quot;separate but equal&quot; theory his real thought behind it was that &quot;All right, if you want it separate but equal, I will make it so expensive for it to be separate that you will have to abandon your separateness.&quot; And so that was the reason he started demanding equalization of salaries for teachers, equal facilities in the schools and all of that.

Houston founded a law firm, Houston &amp; Gardner, with Wendell P. Gardner, Sr. It later included, as name partners, William H. Hastie, William B. Bryant, Emmet G. Sullivan, and Joseph C. Waddy, each of whom were later appointed as federal judges. The firm was prestigious but their work not well-compensated. In all, ten members of the firm advanced to become judges, including Theodore Newman and Wendell Gardner, Jr., the son of Wendell Gardner.

Houston&#x27;s efforts to dismantle the legal theory of &quot;separate but equal&quot; were completed after his death in 1950 with the historic &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) ruling, which prohibited segregation in public schools. At one point Houston had carried a movie camera as he traveled across South Carolina, in order to document the inequalities of facilities, materials and teachers&#x27; salaries between African-American and white education. As Special Counsel to the NAACP, Houston dispatched Thurgood Marshall, Oliver Hill and other young attorneys to work a litigation campaign of court challenges to equalize teachers&#x27; salaries.

Houston also directed the NAACP&#x27;s campaign to end restrictive housing covenants. In the early 20th century, the organization had won a United States Supreme Court case, &quot;Buchanan v. Warley&quot; (1917), which prohibited state and local jurisdictions from establishing restrictive housing. Real estate developers and agents developed restrictive covenants and deeds. The Court ruled in &quot;Corrigan v. Buckley&quot; (1926) that such restrictions were the acts of individuals and beyond the reach of the constitutional protections. As the NAACP continued with its campaign in the 1940s, Houston drew from contemporary sociological and other studies to demonstrate that such covenants and resulting segregation produced conditions of overcrowding, poor health, and increased crime that adversely affected African-American communities. Following Corrigan, Houston contributed to what was a 22-year campaign, in concert with lawyers he had trained, in order to overturn the constitutionality of restrictive covenants. This was achieved in the US Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; (1948). The court ruled that &quot;judicial enforcement of private right constitutes state action for the purpose of the fourteenth amendment.&quot; Houston&#x27;s use of sociological materials in these cases lay the groundwork for the approach and ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954).

===Death===

Houston died from a heart attack on April 22, 1950, at the age of 54.

<text>Barefoot in the Park is a romantic comedy stage play by Neil Simon. The play premiered on Broadway in 1963, starring Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley. It was made into a film in 1967, which starred Redford and Jane Fonda.

==Productions==
&quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; had a pre-Broadway production under the title &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot; at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, PA.

The play opened on Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre on October 23, 1963, and closed on June 25, 1967, after 1,530 performances. It was Neil Simon&#x27;s longest-running hit, and the tenth-longest running non-musical play in Broadway history. The cast included Elizabeth Ashley (Corie), Robert Redford (Paul), Mildred Natwick (Mrs. Banks), and Kurt Kasznar (Victor Velasco); the director was Mike Nichols. Scenic design was by Oliver Smith, costumes by Donald Brooks, and lighting by Jean Rosenthal. The play was nominated for four 1964 Tony Awards, with Nichols winning the award for Best Direction of a Play.

Myrna Loy starred as Mrs. Banks opposite Joan Van Ark as Corie and Richard Benjamin as Paul in the national tour during the time the play was still on Broadway. Virginia Mayo and Margaret O&#x27;Brien co-starred in a 1968 national tour of the play. Beginning in 1978, Dorothy Lamour spent three years playing Mrs. Banks in dinner theatres around the country.

A revival opened on Broadway at the Cort Theater on February 16, 2006, and closed on May 21, 2006, after 109 performances. The cast included Amanda Peet (Corie), Patrick Wilson (Paul), Jill Clayburgh (Mrs. Banks), and Tony Roberts (Victor). The revival was directed by Scott Elliott.

A revival production toured the United Kingdom in 2012. The cast included Maureen Lipman, Faye Castelow, Dominic Tighe, and Oliver Cotton. The play was directed by Lipman in partnership with Peter Cregeen.

==Plot==
Corie and Paul Bratter are a newlywed couple. For their first home, they live in an apartment on the top floor of a brownstone in New York City. Corie is optimistic about their future together, while Paul, the more anxious and grounded half of the couple, worries about the various flaws in the apartment, such as a hole in the skylight, their leaky closet, and the lack of a bathtub. Shortly after moving in, Corie attempts to set her mother up with their eccentric neighbor Mr. Velasco. During the course of four days, the couple learns to live together while facing the usual daily ups-and-downs. Corie wants Paul to become more easy-going: for example, to run &quot;barefoot in the park&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
According to theatre historian Jordan Schildcrout, &quot;Most critics noted that &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; has &#x27;a dime-a-dozen premise [and] virtually no plot&#x27; (&quot;Variety&quot;) and &#x27;is about nothing at all&#x27; (&quot;Herald Tribune&quot;). But they also praised Simon as a &#x27;highly skilled professional writer&#x27; (&quot;New York Times&quot;) who used this simple dramatic situation to create &#x27;one of the funniest comedies ever&#x27; (&quot;Life&quot;).&quot; Some critics credited director Mike Nichols for making the play &quot;consistently funnier than its modest dialogue seemed to entitle it to be&quot; (&quot;New York Times&quot;). On the basis of strong reviews and even stronger word of mouth, the Broadway production became a sold-out hit, causing the Biltmore Theatre to double the number of staff in its box-office to deal with the demand for tickets.

==Adaptations==
Simon adapted his play for a 1967 feature film, starring Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, Mildred Natwick and Charles Boyer, with Gene Saks, director.

A television series based on the play began on ABC in September 1970. It was an African American situation comedy which ran for twelve weeks. The show featured Scoey Mitchell and Tracy Reed as a &quot;young middle-class couple living in a New York City apartment and struggling through the first years of marriage.&quot; This was one of two television series based on Neil Simon plays to debut on the network that month, the other being &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;.

A production of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; ran at the Moore Theater in Seattle for one week in late 1981; it was taped for a made-for-TV movie by HBO. The play—and movie—starred Richard Thomas as Paul, Bess Armstrong as Corie, Barbara Barrie as Mrs. Banks, and Hans Conried as Velasco. It was initially telecast in March 1982. The reviewer for &quot;UPI&quot; wrote: &quot;Richard Thomas—light years removed from the &quot;John Boy&quot; image of his youth—is superb as Paul Bratter, the buttoned-down young lawyer struggling to come to terms with the elfin free spirit with whom he finds himself honeymooning. Bess Armstrong glows in the role of his wife, Corie, but Barbara Barrie virtually walks away with the show as her bemused mother.&quot;

<text>John Norvell (December 21, 1789April 24, 1850) was a newspaper editor and one of the first U.S. Senators from Michigan. He is known as one of two co-founders of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the third-longest continually operating daily newspaper in the United States of America.

==History==
Norvell was born in Danville, Kentucky, then still a part of Virginia, where he attended the common schools. His parents were Lieutenant Lipscomb Norvell, an officer of the Virginia Line in the American Revolutionary War, and Mary Hendrick. Lipscomb Norvell was taken prisoner by the Revolutionary War when they captured Charleston, South Carolina, in 1781, and later was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati. Lipscomb is buried in the Nashville City Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

Lipscomb descended from Captain Hugh Norvell (1666–1719), one of the original trustees of Williamsburg, Virginia in the 17th century and a Vestryman at Bruton Parish Church. Mary Norvell, Lipscomb&#x27;s daughter, married James Walker, the father of William Walker (1824–1860) a soldier of fortune or filibusterer in Nicaragua in 1857.

In 1807, Norvell wrote to U.S. President Thomas Jefferson:

He received a reply in which Jefferson first recommended authors to read on government and history, then issued a scathing critique of newspapers:

Despite Jefferson&#x27;s highly skeptical appraisal, Norvell apparently took his words as a challenge to reform newspapers and decided to learn the printing trade. Norvell did not publish this letter until after Jefferson&#x27;s death in 1826, the original letter is now lost, but was in his son&#x27;s possession as late as 1880.

Norvell edited the &quot;Baltimore Whig&quot; 1813–1814. He also studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1814, and began a private practice in Baltimore. He enlisted as a private in the War of 1812, serving in the Battle of Bladensburg.

Norvell&#x27;s adventures during the War of 1812 were chronicled in the &quot;Some Account of the Life of Spencer Houghton Cone, A Baptist Preacher in America&quot;. Norvell and his brother in law Spencer Cone were partners in Baltimore and together at the Battle of Bladensburg. After the battle, they returned to Washington to rescue their wives, who had been left there.

In Washington, D.C., a scene of terror greeted Norvell and Cone. Catherine Cone Norvell was eight months pregnant and could only travel by wagon. They attempted to walk out of the city, but Cone&#x27;s feet were badly blistered and he found it impossible to move. Norvell found a pony in a neighboring field and caught him. Cone mounted him and they were once again on their way. Stopping at the White House, they asked one of the slaves for a drink. They then crossed the Potomac River and proceeded out of the city for three miles. They were so exhausted that they fell asleep even before they had finished their meager meal, sleeping on the bag of clothes spread out on the floor. While the men slept, Amelia, Cone&#x27;s wife, awoke and went out into the garden—in the distance she could see the burning White House and Capitol building.

After the conclusion of the War of 1812, Norvell worked at various newspapers in several cities, including: the &quot;Baltimore Patriot&quot; 1815–1817. Norvell stayed with &quot;The Patriot&quot; almost two years before abruptly moving back to Kentucky, possibly with the encouragement of Henry Clay, where he took over the state&#x27;s oldest newspaper, the &quot;Lexington Kentucky Gazette&quot; in 1817. For nearly the next two years, he maintained Clay&#x27;s support at home, which earned Norvell apparently no great pecuniary rewards. Early that year, he was again applying for clerkships in Washington, and soon moved east to Philadelphia, where he became editor of an anti-Federalist newspaper. By 1819, he joined the Franklin Gazette, which he published with Richard Bache Jr., the brother of Benjamin Franklin Bache, and grandson of Benjamin Franklin. The &quot;Franklin Gazette&quot;, which supported Jefferson politically, was published in offices &quot;at 180 the first door on the left hand side of Carpenter&#x27;s lane, leading from the Post Office to the Bank of the United States.&quot;

In June 1829, Norvell and John R. Walker co-founded the &quot;Pennsylvania Inquirer&quot;, which later was renamed &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, although they had to sell the paper in November to Jesper Harding. Norvell continued to work in newspapers when he was appointed to an office in the U.S. Department of the Treasury by his friend Alexander J. Dallas, who was then Treasury Secretary in the James Madison administration.

===Michigan===

In 1831, Norvell moved to Michigan Territory after being appointed postmaster of Detroit by Andrew Jackson. Norvell was awarded the post because of his support of U.S. President Andrew Jackson, as were many other printers who had supported the Republican (democratic) party. He served as postmaster until 1836. The people in the Michigan Territory had approved a constitution and elected state officials in 1835, although it was not admitted as a state until 1837 because of a conflict known as the Toledo War with neighboring Ohio. Norvell was selected to be Senator in 1835. However, because the state of Michigan had not been recognized, he was only granted &quot;spectator&quot; status.

Norvell was an influential and active participant in the first constitutional convention in 1835. He was a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan from 1837 to 1839.

Upon the admission of Michigan as a state into the Union, Norvell entered the U.S. Senate with the Jacksonian wing of the Democratic-Republican Party. He served one term in the 24th, 25th, and 26th congresses from January 26, 1837, to March 3, 1841. He did not seek reelection and resumed the practice of law in Detroit.

Norvell was a member of the Michigan State Senate in 1841 and of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1842. He served as United States district attorney in Michigan from 1846 to 1849.

==Personal==
Norvell had ten sons by three wives. His third wife, Isabella Hodgkiss Freeman (1804–1873) was the adopted daughter of Tristram B. Freeman, a noted Philadelphia printer and founder of the Freeman auction house. Her parents were Michael Hodgkiss and Sarah DeWeese. With Isabella, Norvell fathered two daughters and eight sons, one of whom fought in the Mexican–American War and six of whom fought in the American Civil War. They all survived the war. Colonel Freeman Norvell was a Marine lieutenant who fought at the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847 and in the Civil War at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Freeman&#x27;s younger brother Lt. Dallas Norvell served on the staff of General George Custer. Another son, Colonel Stevens Thompson Norvell, was an officer with the 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers after the war and at the Battle of San Juan Hill with Theodore Roosevelt during the Spanish American War. Norvell&#x27;s older daughter Isabella Gibson Norvell married Capt. Angus Keith, a Great Lakes boat captain, and the younger daughter Emily Virginia Norvell married Henry Nelson Walker, a newspaper owner, lawyer, and attorney general of Michigan.

Norvell died in Detroit on April 24, 1850, the day that news came from Washington that he had been appointed U.S. Consul to Turkey. He is interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. Norvell Township in Jackson County, Michigan, is named for him.

<text>The Saronic Islands or Argo-Saronic Islands is an archipelago in Greece, named after the Saronic Gulf in which they are located, just off the Greek mainland. The main inhabited islands of this group are Salamis, Aegina, Agistri, and Poros. The islands of Hydra and Dokos, which lie off the northeast tip of the Peloponnese (technically between the Saronic Gulf and the Argolic Gulf), are sometimes included as part of the Saronic Islands.

Many mainland Greeks have vacation homes in the Saronic Islands, which are regularly served by ferries from the Athen&#x27;s port of Piraeus and the Peloponnese. Salamis, the largest island of the group, is where the ancient Greek navy defeated the Persians in the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC.

He was Shadow Minister for Trade 1996–97, for Resources and Energy 1997–98, for Communications 1998–2001, Health and Ageing 2001–03 and Immigration 2003–04. He was Shadow Minister for Industry, Infrastructure and Industrial Relations from October 2004 until December 2006, when he was appointed to the position of Shadow Minister for Education and Training.

During the leadership crisis in the Labor Party in 2003, Smith was a prominent supporter of his fellow Western Australian, Kim Beazley. As early as 2002 his name had been mentioned as a possible future leader. He again supported Beazley in the leadership contest which followed the resignation of Mark Latham in January 2005, which saw Beazley return to the leadership.

Smith was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in Kevin Rudd&#x27;s cabinet on 3 December following Labor&#x27;s win in the 2007 election, and when Julia Gillard took over from Kevin Rudd as prime minister in June 2010, she added Minister for Trade to Smith&#x27;s portfolio. After the 2010 federal election Smith was appointed to the vacant Defence portfolio, while Rudd and Craig Emerson were appointed to the Foreign Affairs and Trade ministries, respectively.

Following Kevin Rudd&#x27;s return to the leadership of the ALP and as prime minister, on 27 June 2013 Smith announced he would not be a candidate at the 2013 federal election.

==Post-parliamentary career==
Smith was appointed Winthrop Professor of International Law at the University of Western Australia on 29 April 2014.

In March 2016, Smith announced that he did not believe the leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia, Mark McGowan, was capable of leading the party to victory at the 2017 state election. He sought to enter the Western Australian Legislative Assembly by seeking preselection in the new seat of Baldivis. His bid for preselection was unsuccessful.

Smith served as Chairman of ASX listed Canberra-based cyber security firm archTIS from March 2018 to July 2020.

In August 2022, Smith was appointed to co-lead the Defence Strategic Review into the Australian Defence Force by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. On 30 September 2022, Smith was named as the next High Commissioner of Australia to the United Kingdom, to take up office on 26 January 2023 following the completion of the Defence Strategic Review.

<text>The Bacardi Bowl was a college football bowl game played seven times in Havana, Cuba, at Almandares Park and La Tropical Stadium. The games were also referred to as the Rhumba Bowl and were the foremost event of Cuba’s annual National Sports Festival. The first five occurrences matched an American college team (all from the Deep South) against Cuban universities or athletic clubs. The 1937 game featured two American universities. The 1946 game—sometimes considered the first of the Cigar Bowl games—also matched an American college team (from the Deep South) against a Cuban university.

==Game results==

=== Notable Bacardi Bowl games ===

====1907: LSU vs. University of Havana====
The first Bacardi Bowl in 1907 matched Louisiana State University against the University of Havana.

====1912: Florida vs. Cuban Athletic Club====
The 1912 Bacardi Bowl was scheduled as a two-game series in Havana featuring the Florida Gators against squads from two different Cuban athletic clubs. It was Florida&#x27;s first experience with postseason football.

The first game was held on Christmas Day, and the Gators defeated the Vedado Athletic Club 28–0. The second game, which pitted the Gators against the Cuban Athletic Club of Havana a few days later, was never finished. Florida head coach George E. Pyle realized during the first quarter that the game was being officiated using college football&#x27;s pre-1906 rules, and while discussing this issue with the officials, he discovered that the head referee was the former coach of his opponent. Feeling that playing under those conditions was neither fair nor safe, Pyle pulled his team off the field and was promptly arrested for violating a Cuban law prohibiting a game&#x27;s suspension after spectators&#x27; money had been collected. A trial was scheduled and Pyle was released on bail that evening, at which point he and the Gators quickly boarded a steamship for Tampa, an escape which caused the coach to be branded a &quot;fugitive from justice&quot; by Cuban authorities.

Bacardi Bowl officials declared that Florida had forfeited the game and listed it as a 1–0 win for the Cuban Athletic Club, while the University of Florida declared the contest a 1–0 forfeit win for the Gators. In later years, both the complete and incomplete games were dropped from the university&#x27;s official football record, and the Gators&#x27; trip to the Bacardi Bowl is not listed among the program&#x27;s official bowl game appearances.

====1937: Auburn vs. Villanova====
Auburn’s bowl history began with the 1937 game before 15,000 to 18,000 spectators when the Tigers and Villanova tied, 7–7. This game marked the first time that two American universities played a game on foreign soil. An Auburn drive in the first quarter stalled on the 10-yard line where the Wildcats took over on downs. After a Villanova punt, Auburn running back Billy Hitchcock broke loose around left end and rambled 40 yards for the Tigers&#x27; only score. The score at the half was Auburn 7, Villanova 0.

Auburn stopped a Villanova drive on its own 12-yard line during the third quarter but couldn’t get field position. Villanova was able to tie the score when they blocked an Auburn quick kick and the ball bounced into the endzone where Wildcat lineman Matthews Kuber fell on it for the score. The extra point tied the game. Auburn’s return to the US marked an end to more than of travel for the 7–2–2 Tigers that finished the season ranked 13th in the country under coach Jack Meagher.

The game was played in a revolutionary atmosphere. Fulgencio Batista, the dictator who would be overthrown by Fidel Castro 22 years later, had just assumed power. The game was almost canceled because Batista’s picture was not in the game program. A quick trip to the printer saved the Bacardi Bowl. The December 22, 1963, issue of the &quot;Florence Times-Tri-Cities Daily&quot; has a detailed account of former Auburn player Frank Hamm&#x27;s recollections of this game.

==Other college football games against Cuban teams==
Additional college football games were played in Cuba, or in the United States against Cuban teams, from 1906 to 1956.
&quot;Italics denote a tie game&quot;

==Other American football games in Cuba==

The last organized American football game in Cuba was in 1958, when a semipro league featuring teams of Cubans and Americans played. 

It would be another 45 years until Cuba would host a football game, this time featuring two American teams: in 2003, Bonita Vista High School and La Jolla High School from San Diego played at Pan-American Stadium. Due to the presence of metal boxes beyond the end lines, which was deemed a safety hazard, both coaches and the referee agreed to reduce the length of the field to 90 yards. In what was billed as the &quot;Havana Classic&quot;, Bonita Vista defeated La Jolla, 31–22, in front of 400 people.

<doc id="607192" wikidata="Q16197257" url="?curid=607192" title="Tony Smith (Victorian politician)">
<text>Anthony David Hawthorn Smith (born 13 March 1967) is an Australian politician who served as the 30th speaker of the House of Representatives from 2015 to 2021. A member of the Liberal Party of Australia, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the division of Casey from 2001 until he stood down in 2022.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born in Melbourne, to parents Alan Smith, a chemistry teacher, and Noel Smith, a medical secretary. Tony was the youngest child, with two older sisters: Christine (born 1960) and Heather (born 1962). He was educated first at Kerrimuir Primary School in Box Hill North before attending Carey Baptist Grammar School in Kew. He studied Commerce and Arts (Hons) at The University of Melbourne. He was president of the Melbourne University Liberal Club, and is now an honorary life member.

==Political career==
After completing his education, Smith was a research assistant at the Institute of Public Affairs, a conservative think-tank, before becoming first a media adviser and then a senior political adviser to Peter Costello, the then-Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and Treasurer.

===In parliament===
On 23 January 2007, Smith was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, John Howard. He managed to hold his seat of Casey by a considerable margin at the federal election in November of that year, although the Liberal-National Coalition was defeated. On 22 September 2008, Smith was appointed Shadow Assistant Treasurer by Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull. Smith had previously been Shadow Minister for Education, Apprenticeships and Training. He was appointed Shadow Minister for Communications in a reshuffle which took place on 8 December 2009.

When Malcolm Turnbull&#x27;s hold on the Liberal leadership became terminal, it was speculated that Smith was part of a &quot;two-Tony&quot; ticket in which Smith would be the running mate of Tony Abbott in a leadership challenge. Although Abbott successfully challenged Turnbull for the Liberal leadership on 1 December 2009, Smith was not Abbott&#x27;s running mate, and Julie Bishop remained deputy under Abbott.

Despite the speculation that they would make a leadership team in 2009, Abbott and Smith do not seem to be close as Abbott demoted Smith after the 2010 election. When Smith sought the speakership in 2015, it is understood that Abbott as Prime Minister backed rival contender Russell Broadbent as the Government&#x27;s candidate for Speaker over Smith. In 2015, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that there was an &quot;internal view&quot; in the Liberal Party that Abbott blamed Smith for the Coalition&#x27;s narrow loss at the 2010 election due to Smith&#x27;s perceived mishandling of the Coalition&#x27;s broadband policy when Shadow Communications Minister.

In the new Abbott shadow ministry announced after the August 2010 election, Smith was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Tax Reform and Deputy chairman, Coalition Policy Development Committee.

He was interviewed extensively in the ABC documentary &quot;The Howard Years&quot;. On 14 July 2021 Smith issued a statement saying he would retire as Member for Casey at the end of the 46th Parliament.

===Speaker of the House===
Following the resignation of Bronwyn Bishop as Speaker of the House of Representatives in August 2015 over entitlement rorts dating back a decade, the Liberal Party nominated Smith as the party&#x27;s candidate to replace Bishop. The House of Representatives elected Smith unopposed. He pledged to absent himself from the Liberal party room for the duration of his speakership to protect the neutrality of the chair. He also eschewed the traditional full attire of the Speaker, instead continuing to wear an ordinary business suit.

Smith was re-elected Speaker unopposed after the 2016 and 2019 federal elections. He was the first Speaker to be elected unopposed on three occasions since Frederick Holder, the inaugural holder of the position. Due to his upcoming retirement from parliament, Smith resigned as Speaker on 23 November 2021.

<doc id="607197" wikidata="Q1671012" url="?curid=607197" title="Suppression of Communism Act, 1950">
<text>The Suppression of Communism Act, 1950 (Act No. 44 of 1950), renamed the Internal Security Act in 1976, was legislation of the national government in apartheid South Africa which formally banned the Communist Party of South Africa and proscribed any party or group subscribing to communism, according to a uniquely broad definition of the term. It was also used as the basis to place individuals under banning orders, and its practical effect was to isolate and silence voices of dissent.

==Description==
The Act, which came into effect on 17 July 1950, defined communism as any scheme aimed at achieving change—whether economic, social, political, or industrial—&quot;by the promotion of disturbance or disorder&quot; or any act encouraging &quot;feelings of hostility between the European and the non-European races [...] calculated to further [disorder]&quot;. The Minister of Justice could deem any person to be a communist if he found that person&#x27;s aims to be aligned with these aims, and could issue an order severely restricting the freedoms of anyone deemed to be a communist. After a nominal two-week appeal period, the person&#x27;s status as a communist became an unreviewable matter of fact, and subjected the person to being barred from public participation, restricted in movement, or imprisoned.

The government justified passage of the Act by noting the involvement of members of the South African Communist Party in the internal resistance to apartheid, the subversive tactics of communist parties more widely, as well as the perceived threat of the Soviet Union in the emerging Cold War and decolonisation. 

The opposition in the House of Assembly protested certain functions of the act, such as the possibility to ban individuals purposedly advocating communist goals, circumventing the normal rule of law guarantees in the South African legal system. The government responded by watering down the act, explicitly outlining the right to due process before penalties (i.e. fines or imprisonment) were executed, requiring the Minister of Justice to submit requests to ban to a three-member committee, affording the right to redress by those issued a banning order, as well as exempting labour unions from the sanctions included in the act. These guarantees, however, were not followed reliably, and banning orders emerged as one of the most effective tools of the South African government throughout the apartheid era.

==Effect==

The Act was worded in such a way that anyone who opposed government policy could be deemed a communist. Since the Act explicitly declared that communism sought to encourage racial disharmony, it was frequently used to legally gag critics of racial segregation and apartheid. The Act defined communism so sweepingly that defendants were frequently convicted of &quot;statutory communism&quot;. Justice Frans Rumpff, presiding in the 1952 trial of African National Congress (ANC) leaders, observed that such an offence might have &quot;nothing to do with communism as it is commonly known.&quot;

The Act facilitated the government suppression of organisations such as the ANC and others which advocated for equal rights for blacks, coloureds and Indians. The Act forced these groups to go underground with their activism. Because of this Act, groups such as uMkhonto we Sizwe, led by Nelson Mandela as a branch of the ANC, did seek financial support from the Communist Party.

==Superseded 1982==
Most of the Act was replaced in 1982 by the Internal Security Act, 1982.

<text>The Aloha Bowl was a college football bowl game played in Honolulu, Hawaii, at Aloha Stadium. Certified by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the game featured teams from Division I-A (later known as the Football Bowl Subdivision).

==History==
The Aloha Bowl was established in 1982 by Mackay Yanagisawa, a sportsman from Oahu. With the exception of the 1983–1986 playings, the Aloha Bowl was traditionally played on Christmas morning in Honolulu. For most of its playings, the game was sponsored by Jeep Corporation. The bowl originally applied for certification by the NCAA Division I Championship Committee in 1981, but certification was delayed until 1982. The inaugural game was played in 1982 and the last game was played in 2000, after it lost its sponsorship as a result of a corporate merger between Jeep and DaimlerChrysler. In 1998 and 1999, the Aloha Bowl was part of a doubleheader followed by the Oahu Bowl; the 1998 event was the first televised doubleheader in American college football history.

After Jeep dropped its sponsorship, the bowl committees of the Hawaiian bowl games elected to move the games to the U.S. mainland. The Oahu Bowl moved to Seattle and was played as the Seattle Bowl for two years. The Aloha Bowl was to move to San Francisco, but before the move could be completed the game lost its bowl certification. San Francisco later received a bowl game, first played in December 2002 as the San Francisco Bowl, which later operated under several other names. Hawaii did not remain without a bowl for long, however, as a new bowl committee received certification in 2002 for a Christmastime game, the Hawaii Bowl, at Aloha Stadium.

The Aloha Bowl was preceded years earlier by the Poi Bowl (late 1930s) and Pineapple Bowl (1940s and early 1950s).

<text>The Argolic Gulf (), also known as the Gulf of Argolis, is a gulf of the Aegean Sea off the east coast of the Peloponnese, Greece. It is about 50 km long and 30 km wide. Its main port is Nafplio, at its northwestern end. At the entrance to the gulf is the island Spetses. This gulf and its islands are sometimes combined with the Saronic Gulf and Saronic Islands, with the result called the Argo-Saronic Gulf and the Argo-Saronic Islands. It is surrounded by two regional units: Arcadia to the southwest and Argolis to the north and east. The river Inachos drains into the Argolic Gulf near Nea Kios. The main islands in the gulf are Psili, Plateia and Bourtzi, a small island with a Venetian fortress that protects the port of Nafplio. The surrounding mountains protect it from the strong summer Meltemi wind.

The main towns that lie around the gulf are, from southwest to east:
*Tyros
*Paralio Astros
*Myloi
*Nea Kios
*Nafplio
*Tolo or Tolon, on Tolo Bay
*Porto Cheli
*Spetses

Apparently, here &quot;Sarapul&quot; is the name of a section of the river, as well as the entire area along its shores. It is believed that the name of this area comes from the word () which in Chuvash means &#x27;yellow fish&#x27;, or sturgeon, which was in abundance here. Later, however, other versions of the origin of the name were considered. In particular, one of them says that the word formed by the merger of two words: , which in one of the Siberian dialects means &#x27;money&#x27;, and , a small copper coin, thus meaning &#x27;place of money&#x27;.

It was chartered in 1780 and by the end of the 18th century had grown into a merchant town with developed footwear manufacturing industry.

The city of Sarapul was one of the residence centers of the Udmurt Jews, who spoke Udmurtish Yiddish. In the lexicon of this dialect there was a noticeable number of Udmurt and Tatar loan words.

<doc id="607226" wikidata="Q969619" url="?curid=607226" title="Preventive war">
<text>A preventive war is an armed conflict &quot;initiated in the belief that military conflict, while not imminent, is inevitable, and that to delay would involve greater risk.&quot; The party which is being attacked has a latent threat capability or it has shown that it intends to attack in the future, based on its past actions and posturing. A preventive war aims to forestall a shift in the balance of power by strategically attacking before the balance of power has had a chance to shift in the favor of the targeted party. Preventive war is distinct from preemptive strike, which is the first strike when an attack is imminent. Preventive uses of force &quot;seek to stop another state . . . from developing a military capability before it becomes threatening or to hobble or destroy it thereafter, whereas [p]reemptive uses of force come against a backdrop of tactical intelligence or warning indicating imminent military action by an adversary.&quot;

==Criticism==
The majority view is that a preventive war undertaken without the approval of the United Nations is illegal under the modern framework of international law. The consensus is that preventive war &quot;goes beyond what is acceptable in international law&quot; and lacks legal basis. The UN High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change stopped short of rejecting the concept outright but suggested that there is no right to preventive war. If there are good grounds for initiating preventive war, the matter should be put to the UN Security Council, which can authorize such action, given that one of the Council&#x27;s main functions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter (&quot;Action with Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression&quot;) is to enforce the obligation of member states under Article 4, Paragraph 2 to &quot;refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state . . . The Charter&#x27;s drafters assumed that the Council might need to employ preventive force to forestall aggression such as initiated by Nazi Germany in the 1930s. 

==Examples==
The Axis powers in World War II routinely invaded neutral countries on grounds of prevention and began the invasion of Poland in 1939 by claiming the Poles had attacked a border outpost first. In 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway and argued that Britain might have used them as launching points for an attack or prevented supply of strategic materials to Germany. In the summer of 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, inaugurating the bloody and brutal land war by claiming that a Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy threatened the Reich. In late 1941, the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran was carried out to secure a supply corridor of petrol to the Soviet Union. Iranian Shah Rezā Shāh appealed to US President Franklin Roosevelt for help but was rebuffed on the grounds that &quot;movements of conquest by Germany will continue and will extend beyond Europe to Asia, Africa, and even to the Americas, unless they are stopped by military force.&quot;

===Pearl Harbor===

Perhaps the most famous example of preventive war is the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941. Many in the US and Japan believed war to be inevitable. Coupled to the crippling US economic embargo that was rapidly degrading the Japanese military capability, that led the Japanese leadership to believe it was better to have the war as soon as possible.

The sneak attack was partly motivated by a desire to destroy the US Pacific Fleet to allow Japan to advance with reduced opposition from the US when it secured Japanese oil supplies by fighting against the British Empire and the Dutch Empire for control over the rich East Indian (Dutch East Indies, Malay Peninsula) oil-fields. In 1940, American policies and tension toward Japanese military actions and Japanese expansionism in the Far East increased. For example, in May 1940, the base of the US Pacific Fleet that was stationed on the West Coast was forwarded to an &quot;advanced&quot; position at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The move was opposed by some US Navy officials, including their commander, Admiral James Otto Richardson, who was relieved by Roosevelt. Even so, the Far East Fleet was not significantly reinforced. Another ineffective plan to reinforce the Pacific was a rather late relocation of fighter planes to bases located on the Pacific islands like Wake Island, Guam, and the Philippines. For a long time, Japanese leaders, especially leaders of the Imperial Japanese Navy, had known that the large US military strength and production capacity posed a long-term threat to Japan&#x27;s imperialist desires, especially if hostilities broke out in the Pacific. War games on both sides had long reflected those expectations.

===Iraq War (2003–2011)===

The 2003 invasion of Iraq was framed primarily as a preemptive war by the George W. Bush administration, although President Bush also argued it was supported by Security Council Resolutions: &quot;Under Resolutions 678 and 687—both still in effect—the United States and our allies are authorized to use force in ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction.&quot; At the time, the US public and its allies were led to believe that Ba&#x27;athist Iraq might have restarted its nuclear weapons program or been &quot;cheating&quot; on its obligations to dispose of its large stockpile of chemical weapons dating from the Iran–Iraq War. Supporters of the war have argued it to be justified, as Iraq both harbored Islamic terrorist groups sharing a common hatred of the United States and was suspected to be developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Iraq&#x27;s history of noncompliance of international security matters and its history of both developing and using such weapons were factors in the public perception of Iraq&#x27;s having weapons of mass destruction.

In support of an attack on Iraq, US President George W. Bush stated in an address to the UN General Assembly on September 12, 2002 that the Iraqi &quot;regime is a grave and gathering danger.&quot; However, despite extensive searches during the several years of occupation, the suspected weapons of mass destruction or weapons program infrastructure alleged by the Bush administration were not found to be functional or even known to most Iraqi leaders. Coalition forces instead found dispersed and sometimes-buried and partially dismantled stockpiles of abandoned and functionally expired chemical weapons. Some of the caches had been dangerously stored and were leaking, and many were then disposed of hastily and in secret, leading to secondary exposure from improper handling. Allegations of mismanagement and information suppression followed.

== Case for preventive nuclear war ==

Since 1945, World War III between the US and the USSR was perceived by many as inevitable and imminent. Many high officials in the US military sector and some renowned luminaries in non-military fields advocated preventive war. According to their rationale, total war is inevitable, and it was senseless to permit the Russians to develop a nuclear parity with the United States. Hence the sooner the preventive war come the better, because the first strike is almost surely decisive and less devastating.
Dean Acheson
and James Burnham adhered to the version that the war is not inevitable but is already going on, although the American people still do not realize it.

The US military sector widely and wholeheartedly shared the idea of preventive war. Most prominent proponents included Defense Secretary Louis A. Johnson, JCS Chairman Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Navy Secretary Francis P. Matthews, Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie, Air Force Secretary W. Stuart Symington, Air Force Chiefs Curtis LeMay and Nathan F. Twining, Air Force Generals George Kenney and Orvil A. Anderson, General Leslie Groves (the wartime commander of the Manhattan Project) and CIA Director Walter Bedell Smith. NSC-100 and several studies by SAC and JCS during the Korean War advocated preventive war too.

In Congress, preventive warriors counted Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Nitze, expert on the Soviet Union Charles E. Bohlen of the State Department, Senators John L. McClellan, Paul H. Douglas, Eugene D. Millikin, Brien McMahon (Chairman of the Atomic Energy Committee), William Knowland and Congressman Henry M. Jackson. The diplomatic circle included distinguished diplomats like George Kennan, William C. Bullitt (US Ambassador to Moscow), and John Paton Davies (from the same embassy).

John von Neumann of the Manhattan Project and later a consultant for the RAND Corporation expressed: &quot;With the Russians it is not a question of whether but of when… If you say why not bomb them tomorrow, I say why not today?&quot; Other renowned scientists and thinkers, such as Leo Szilard, William L. Laurence, James Burnham, and Bertrand Russell.
joined the preventive effort. The preventive war in the late 1940s was argued by “some very dedicated Americans.” “Realists” repeatedly proposed the preventive war. &quot;The argument—prevent before it is too late—was quite common in the early atomic age and by no way limited to “the lunatic fringe.” A famous atomic scientist expressed a concern: In 1946, public discussion of international problems, in the United States at least, &quot;has moved dangerously towards a consideration of so-called preventive war. One sees this tendency perhaps most markedly in the trend of news in Americans newspapers.&quot; 

Bernard Brodie noted that at least prior to 1950, preventive war was a “live issue … among a very small but earnest minority of American citizens.” The dating of Brodie is too short, as the preventive war doctrine has had increasing support since the Korean War started. The late summer 1950 saw “a flurry of articles” in the public press dealing with preventive war. One of them in Time magazine (September 18, 1950) called for a buildup, followed by a “showdown” with the Russians by 1953. “1950 may have marked the high tide of ‘preventive war’ agitation…” According to Gallup poll of July 1950, right after the outbreak of the War, 14% of the polled opined for the immediate declaration of war on the USSR, the percentage which only slightly declined by the end of the War. “So preventive war thinking was surprisingly widespread in the early nuclear age, the period from mid-1945 through late 1954.”

The preventive warriors remained minority in America’s postwar political arena, and Washington’s elder statesmen soundly rejected their arguments. However, during several of the East-West confrontations that marked the first decade of the Cold War, well-placed officials in both the Truman and Eisenhower administrations urged their Presidents to launch preventive strikes on the Soviet Union. Entry in Truman’s secret personal journal on January 27, 1952 tells: 

In 1953, Eisenhower wrote in a summary memorandum to his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles: In present circumstances, &quot;we would be forced to consider whether or not out duty to future generations did not require us to initiate war at the most propitious moment we could designate.” In May 1954, the JCS’s Advance Study Group proposed to Eisenhower to consider “deliberately precipitating war with the USSR in the near future,” before Soviet thermonuclear capability became a real menace. The same year, Eisenhower asked in a meeting of National Security Council: “Should the United States now get ready to fight the Soviet Union?” and pointed out that “he had brought up this question more than once at prior Council meetings and he had never done so facetiously.” By the fall 1954, Eisenhower made his mind up and approved a &quot;Basic National Security Policy&quot; paper which stated unequivocally that “the United States and its allies must reject the concept of preventive war, or acts intended to provoke war.”

Winston Churchill was more resolved on the preventive war. He argued repeatedly in the late 1940s that matters needed to be brought to a head with the Soviets before it was too late, while the United States still enjoyed a nuclear monopoly. Charles de Gaulle in 1954 regretted that now it was too late. The same regret of opportunity missed expressed later Curtis LeMay
and Henry Kissinger.

<doc id="607233" wikidata="Q766426" url="?curid=607233" title="Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer">
<text>The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) was a NASA satellite that observed the time variation of astronomical X-ray sources, named after physicist Bruno Rossi. The RXTE had three instruments — an All-Sky Monitor, the High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE) and the Proportional Counter Array. The RXTE observed X-rays from black holes, neutron stars, X-ray pulsars and X-ray bursts. It was funded as part of the Explorer program and was also called Explorer 69.

RXTE had a mass of and was launched from Cape Canaveral on 30 December 1995, at 13:48:00 UTC, on a Delta II launch vehicle. Its International Designator is 1995-074A.

== Mission ==
The X-Ray Timing Explorer (XTE) mission has the primary objective to study the temporal and broad-band spectral phenomena associated with stellar and galactic systems containing compact objects in the energy range 2--200 KeV and in time scales from microseconds to years. The scientific instruments consists of two pointed instruments, the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) and the High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE), and the All Sky Monitor (ASM), which scans over 70% of the sky each orbit. All of the XTE observing time were available to the international scientific community through a peer review of submitted proposals. XTE used a new spacecraft design that allows flexible operations through rapid pointing, high data rates, and nearly continuous receipt of data at the Science Operations Center (SOC) at Goddard Space Flight Center via a Multiple Access link to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). XTE was highly maneuverable with a slew rate of greater than 6° per minute. The PCA/HEXTE could be pointed anywhere in the sky to an accuracy of less than 0.1°, with an aspect knowledge of around 1 arcminute. Rotatable solar panels enable anti-sunward pointing to coordinate with ground-based night-time observations. Two pointable high-gain antennas maintain nearly continuous communication with the TDRSS. This, together with 1 GB (approximately four orbits) of on-board solid-state data storage, give added flexibility in scheduling observations.

== Telecommunications ==
* Required continuous TDRSS Multiple Access (MA) return link coverage except for zone of exclusion: Real-time and playback of engineering/housekeeping data at 16 or 32 kbs - Playback of science data at 48 or 64 kbs.
* Requires 20 minutes of SSA contacts with alternating TDRSS per orbit: Real-time and playback of engineering/housekeeping data at 32 kbs - Playback of science data at 512 or 1024 kbs.
* For launch and contingency, required TDRSS MA/SSA real-time engineering and housekeeping at 1 kbs.
* The bit error rate shall be less than 1 in 10E8 for at least 95% of the orbits.

== Instruments ==

=== All-Sky Monitor (ASM) ===
The All-Sky Monitor (ASM) provided all-sky X-ray coverage, to a sensitivity of a few percent of the Crab Nebula intensity in one day, in order to provide both flare alarms and long-term intensity records of celestial X-ray sources. The ASM consisted of three wide-angle shadow cameras equipped with proportional counters with a total collecting area of . The instrumental properties were:

* Energy range: 2–12-keV;
* Time resolution: observes 80% of the sky every 90 minutes;
* Spatial resolution: 3&#x27; × 15&#x27;;
* Number of shadow cameras: 3, each with 6° × 90° FoV;
* Collecting area: ;
* Detector: Xenon proportional counter, position-sensitive;
* Sensitivity: 30 mCrab.

It was built by the CSR at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The principal investigator was Dr. Hale Bradt.

=== High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE) ===
The High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE) is a scintillator array for the study of temporal and temporal/spectral effects of the hard X-ray (20 to 200 keV) emission from galactic and extragalactic sources. The HEXTE consisted of two clusters each containing four phoswich scintillation detectors. Each cluster could &quot;rock&quot; (beam switch) along mutually orthogonal directions to provide background measurements 1.5° or 3.0° away from the source every 16 to 128 seconds. In addition, the input was sampled at 8 microseconds so as to detect time-varying phenomena. Automatic gain control was provided by using an radioactive source mounted in each detector&#x27;s field of view. The HEXTE&#x27;s basic properties were:

* Energy range: 15–250 keV;
* Energy resolution: 15% at 60 keV;
* Time sampling: 8 microseconds;
* Field of view: 1° FWHM;
* Detectors: 2 clusters of 4 NaI/CsI scintillation counters;
* Collecting area: 2 × ;
* Sensitivity: 1-Crab = 360 count/second per HEXTE cluster;
* Background: 50 count/second per HEXTE cluster.

The HEXTE was designed and built by the Center for Astrophysics &amp; Space Sciences (CASS) at the University of California, San Diego. The HEXTE principal investigator was Dr. Richard E. Rothschild.

=== Proportional Counter Array (PCA) ===
The Proportional Counter Array (PCA) provides approximately of X-ray detector area, in the energy range 2 to 60 keV, for the study of temporal/spectral effects in the X-ray emission from galactic and extragalactic sources. The PCA was an array of five proportional counters with a total collecting area of . The instrumental properties were:

* Energy range: 2–60 keV;
* Energy resolution: &lt;18% at 6 keV;
* Time resolution: 1 μs
* Spatial resolution: collimator with 1° (FWHM);
* Detectors: 5 proportional counters;
* Collecting area: ;
* Layers: 1 propane veto; 3 Xenon, each split into two; 1 Xenon veto layer;
* Sensitivity: 0.1-mCrab;
* Background: 90-mCrab.

The PCA is being built by the Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics (LHEA) at Goddard Space Flight Center. The principal investigator was Jean Swank.

== Results ==
Observations from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer have been used as evidence for the existence of the frame-dragging effect predicted by the theory of general relativity of Einstein. RXTE results have, as of late 2007, been used in more than 1400 scientific papers.

In January 2006, it was announced that Rossi had been used to locate a candidate intermediate-mass black hole named M82 X-1. In February 2006, data from RXTE was used to prove that the diffuse background X-ray glow in our galaxy comes from innumerable, previously undetected white dwarfs and from other stars&#x27; coronae. In April 2008, RXTE data was used to infer the size of the smallest known black hole.

RXTE ceased science operations on 12 January 2012.

== Atmospheric entry ==
NASA scientists said that the decommissioned RXTE would re-enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere &quot;between 2014 and 2023&quot; (30 April 2018). Later, it became clear that the satellite would re-enter in late April or early May 2018, and the spacecraft fell out of orbit on 30 April 2018.

<text>William George Meany (August 16, 1894 – January 10, 1980) was an American labor union administrator for 57 years. He was important for the creation of the AFL–CIO and served as the AFL–CIO&#x27;s first president, from 1955 to 1979.

Meany, the son of a union plumber, became a plumber himself at a young age. He became a full-time union official 12 years later. As an officer of the American Federation of Labor, he represented the AFL on the National War Labor Board during World War II. He served as president of the AFL from 1952 to 1955.

He proposed its merger with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1952 and managed the negotiations until the merger was completed in 1955. He then served as president of the merged AFL–CIO for the next 24 years.

Meany had a reputation for integrity and consistent opposition to corruption in the labor movement, and strong anti-communism. He was one of the best known union administrators in the United States during the mid-20th century.

==Early years==

Meany was born into a Roman Catholic family in Harlem, New York City on August 16, 1894, the second of 10 children. His parents were Michael Meany and Anne Cullen Meany, who were both American-born and of Irish descent. His ancestors had immigrated to the United States during the 1850s. His father was a plumber and served as president of his plumber&#x27;s union local. Michael Meany was also a precinct level activist in the Democratic Party.

Meany grew up in the Port Morris neighborhood of The Bronx, where his parents had relocated when he was five years old. Always called &quot;George&quot;, he learned that his real first name was William only when he got a work permit as a teenager. Meany quit high school at age 16 to become a plumber like his father, beginning work as a plumber&#x27;s helper. He then served a five-year apprenticeship as a plumber and got his journeyman&#x27;s certificate in 1917, with Local 463 United Association of Plumbers and Steamfitters of the United States and Canada.

His father died of heart failure in 1916 after a bout of pneumonia. When Meany&#x27;s older brother joined the US Army in 1917, George became the sole source of income for his mother and six younger siblings. He supplemented his income for a while by playing as a semiprofessional baseball catcher. In 1919, he married Eugenia McMahon, a garment worker and a member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. They had three daughters.

==Beginning of union career in New York==
In 1920, Meany was elected to the executive board of Local 463 of the Plumber&#x27;s Union. In 1922, he became a full-time business agent for the local, which had 3,600 members at that time. Meany later stated that he had never walked a picket line during his plumber&#x27;s union days, explaining that his original plumber&#x27;s union never needed to picket,
because the employers never attempted to replace the workers.

In 1923, he was elected secretary of the New York City Building Trades Council, the city federation of unions representing construction workers. He won a court injunction against an industry lockout in 1927, which was then considered an innovative tactic for a union, and was opposed by many of the older union administrators.

In 1934, he became president of the New York State Federation of Labor, the statewide coalition of trade unions. During his first year of lobbying in Albany, the state capital, 72 bills that he promoted to the state legislature were enacted into law, and he developed a close working relationship with Governor Herbert H. Lehman.

He developed a reputation for honesty, diligence and the ability to testify effectively before legislative hearings and to speak well to the press. In 1936, he cofounded the American Labor Party, a pro-union political party active in New York, along with David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, partly to organize support among union socialists for the re-election that year of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and mayor Fiorello La Guardia .

==National leadership in Washington, DC==
Three years later, he relocated to Washington, D.C., to become national secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Labor, where he served AFL president William Green.
During World War II, Meany was one of the permanent representatives of the AFL to the National War Labor Board. During the war, he established close relationships with prominent anticommunists in the American labor movement, including David Dubinsky, Jay Lovestone and Matthew Woll. In October 1945, he organized the AFL boycott of the founding conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which welcomed participation by labor unions from the USSR and was later called a communist front.

The labor strikes of 1945-1946, which were organized to a large extent by CIO unions, resulted in passage of the Taft Hartley Act in 1947, which was perceived widely as anti-union. One provision required union officials to sign loyalty oaths affirming that they were not communists; this had a major effect on the CIO unions. Meany, in opposition to John L. Lewis and other leftist union leaders, replied that he would &quot;go further and sign an affidavit that I was never a comrade to the comrades&quot; since he had always ostracized communists. Within a year, most US union administrators unaffiliated with the Communist Party signed the affidavit, later upheld by the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1949 that the Communist Party was unique among American political parties in swearing allegiance to a foreign power.

==Merger of AFL and CIO==
When Green&#x27;s health began failing in 1951, Meany gradually assumed day-to-day operations of the AFL. He became president of the American Federation of Labor in 1952 upon Green&#x27;s death.

Meany quickly took effective control of the AFL, and proposed to merge with the CIO. It took longer for Walter Reuther to complete his control of the CIO, but when he did he became a willing partner in the merger negotiations.

It took Meany three years to negotiate the merger, and he had to overcome significant opposition. John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers termed the merger a &quot;rope of sand&quot;, and his union refused to join the AFL–CIO. Jimmy Hoffa, second in command of the Teamster&#x27;s Union, protested, &quot;What&#x27;s in it for us? Nothing!&quot; However, the Teamsters complied with the merger initially. Mike Quill, president of the Transport Workers Union of America also fought the merger, saying that it amounted to a capitulation to the &quot;racism, racketeering and raiding&quot; of the AFL.

Fearing a drawn-out negotiation process, Meany decided on a &quot;short route&quot; to reconciliation. This meant all AFL and CIO unions would be accepted into the new organization &quot;as is&quot;, with all conflicts and overlaps to be sorted out after the merger. Meany further relied on a small, select group of advisors to craft the necessary agreements. The draft constitution was written primarily by AFL Vice President Matthew Woll and CIO General Counsel Arthur Goldberg, while the joint policy statements were written by Woll, CIO Secretary-Treasurer James Carey, CIO vice presidents David McDonald and Joseph Curran, Brotherhood of Railway Clerks President George McGregor Harrison, and Illinois AFL–CIO President Reuben Soderstrom.

Meany&#x27;s efforts came to fruition in December 1955 with a joint convention in New York City that merged the two federations, creating the AFL–CIO, with Meany elected as president. Termed Meany&#x27;s &quot;greatest achievement&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the new federation had 15 million members. Only two million US workers were members of unions remaining outside the AFL–CIO.

==Campaigns against corrupt unions==
In 1953, the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association, accused of racketeering, was expelled from the AFL, an early example of Meany&#x27;s efforts against corruption and organized crime in unions. After internal reform, it was readmitted to the now-merged AFL–CIO, in 1959.

Meany also fought corruption in the AFL affiliated United Textile Workers of America from 1952. In 1957, he reported that the president of that union had been stealing more than $250,000. Meany also appointed an independent monitor to oversee reform of the union.

Concerns about corruption and the influence of organized crime in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, managed by Dave Beck, caused Meany to begin a campaign to reform that union in 1956. In 1957, amidst a fight for control of the union with Jimmy Hoffa, Beck was called before the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, commonly known as the &quot;McClellan Committee&quot; after its chairman John Little McClellan, of Arkansas.

Televised hearings during early 1957 exposed misconduct by both the Beck and the Hoffa factions of the Teamsters Union. Both Hoffa and Beck were indicted, but Hoffa won control of the Teamsters. In response, the AFL–CIO instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could continue in a leadership position. Meany told the Teamsters that they could continue as members of the AFL–CIO if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and the Teamsters were ousted from the AFL–CIO on December 6, 1957. Meany endorsed the AFL–CIO&#x27;s adoption of a code of ethics, after the scandal.

Meany also organized campaigns against organized crime and corruption in the International Jewelry Workers Union, the Laundry Workers International Union, the AFL Distillery Workers, the AFL United Auto Workers, and the Bakery and Confectionery Workers International Union. He demanded the dismissal of corrupt union officials and internal reorganization of the unions. When some unions resisted, he organized their expulsion from the AFL and later from the AFL–CIO, and he even established rival unions. He established an AFL–CIO Committee on Ethical Practices to investigate misconduct and insisted for unions being investigated to co-operate with its inquiries. According to John Hutchinson, a professor at UCLA, &quot;few American union leaders have such a public record of repeated and explicit opposition to corruption&quot;.

==Vietnam War==
Meany consistently defended President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam War policies. In 1966, Meany insisted for AFL–CIO unions to give &quot;unqualified support&quot; to Johnson&#x27;s war policy. AFL–CIO critics opposing Meany and the war at that time included Ralph Helstein of the United Packinghouse Workers of America, George Burdon of the United Rubberworkers and Patrick Gorman of the United Auto Workers.

Charles Cogen, president of the American Federation of Teachers opposed Meany in 1967, when the AFL–CIO convention adopted a resolution pledging support for the war in Vietnam. Reuther stated that he was busy with negotiations with General Motors in Detroit and could not attend the convention. In his speech to the convention, Meany said that, regarding Vietnam the AFL–CIO was &quot;neither hawk nor dove nor chicken&quot; but was supporting &quot;brother trade unionists&quot; struggling against Communism.
As an anticommunist who identified with the working class, Meany expressed contempt for the New Left. That philosophy had often criticized the labor activists for conservatism, racism, and anticommunism, and during the late 1960s and early 1970s, it included many promoters of Communism, such as the Viet Cong. In the aftermath of the violence by antiwar demonstrators and police at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Meany sympathized with the police by terming the protesters a &quot;dirtynecked and dirty-mouthed group of kooks&quot;.

Meany opposed the antiwar candidacy of U. S. Senator George McGovern for the presidency against incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972 despite McGovern&#x27;s generally pro-labor voting record in Congress. However he refused to endorse Nixon. On &quot;Face the Nation&quot; in September 1972, Meany criticized McGovern&#x27;s statements that the US should respect other peoples&#x27; rights to choose communism by saying that there had never been a country that had voted freely for communism. Meany accused McGovern of being &quot;an apologist for the Communist world&quot;.

After Nixon&#x27;s landslide defeat of McGovern, Meany said that the American people had &quot;overwhelmingly repudiated neo-isolationism&quot; in foreign policy. Meany said that the American voters had split their votes by endorsing the Democrats in Congress.

Meany&#x27;s support for the war effort continued to the final days before Saigon was captured by the North Vietnamese in April 1975. He called for President Gerald Ford to provide a US Navy &quot;flotilla&quot; if it was needed to ensure that hundreds of thousands of &quot;friends of the United States&quot; could escape before a communist regime could be established.

He also appealed for the admission of the maximum possible number of Vietnamese refugees to the United States. Meany blamed Congress for &quot;washing its hands&quot; of the war and of weakening South Vietnam&#x27;s military, damaging its &quot;will to fight&quot;. In particular, Meany accused Congress of failing to provide adequate funding for US troops to stage an orderly withdrawal.

==Conflict with Reuther==
Despite their co-operation for the AFL–CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had a contentious relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a major event in the history of the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL–CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL–CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther&#x27;s motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL–CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph&#x27;s speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.

At the time of the 1967 AFL–CIO convention, Reuther demanded that Meany make the AFL–CIO more democratic.

After years of disagreement with Meany, Reuther resigned from the AFL–CIO executive council in February 1967. In 1968, Reuther&#x27;s UAW withdrew from the AFL–CIO, and the UAW did not re-affiliate with the AFL–CIO until 1981, long after Reuther&#x27;s death in a 1970 airplane crash.

==Political goals==

Amidst of the Great Society reforms advocated by President Johnson, Meany and the AFL–CIO in 1965 endorsed a resolution calling for &quot;mandatory congressional price hearings for corporations, a technological clearinghouse, and a national planning agency&quot;. American socialist Michael Harrington commented that the AFL–CIO had &quot;initiated a programmatic redefinition that had much more in common with the defeated socialist proposal of 1894 than with the voluntarism of Gompers&quot; referring to Samuel Gompers, the founder of the AFL, who had openly opposed socialism for decades. The 1965 resolution was part of the AFL–CIO&#x27;s ongoing endorsement of industrial democracy. Despite Meany&#x27;s support for reform policies that were sometimes termed &quot;socialist&quot;, he also said that &quot;I very much agree with the free market system-&quot; Meany said, &quot;When you don&#x27;t have anything, you have nothing to lose by these radical actions. But when you become a person who has a home and has property, to some extent you become conservative.&quot;

As AFL–CIO president, Meany supported increasing the minimum wage, increasing public works spending, and protecting union organizing rights. He also endorsed universal health care. While he was president, the AFL–CIO lobbied vigorously for its goals. He backed the two party system, and believed in &quot;supporting your friends and punishing your enemies&quot;.

==Later years and death==
By the mid-1970s, Meany was past his 80th birthday and there were increasing calls for him to retire and pass the presidency of the AFL–CIO to a younger man. During his final years, Meany adopted amateur photography and painting as hobbies.

in June 1975 Meany as president of the AFL–CIO hosted Alexander Solzhenitsyn in his tour of the USA and had a dinner in Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s honor where the Russian writer gave one of his most well known speeches. Meany himself gave the speech introducing Solzhenitsyn.

Meany&#x27;s wife of 59 years, Eugenia, died in March 1979, and he became depressed after losing her. He injured his knee in a golfing mishap a few months before his death and was reliant on a wheelchair. In November 1979, he retired from the AFL–CIO, after a 57-year career in organized labor. He was succeeded by Lane Kirkland, who served as AFL–CIO president for the next 16 years.

Meany died at George Washington University Hospital on January 10, 1980, of cardiac arrest. The AFL–CIO had 14 million members at the time of his death. President Jimmy Carter termed him &quot;an American institution&quot; and &quot;a patriot&quot;. He was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland.

==Awards, tributes and legacy==
President John F. Kennedy established the Presidential Medal of Freedom on February 22, 1963, but died before he could award it. Two weeks after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, President Lyndon Johnson awarded it to Meany and thirty others on December 6, 1963. Johnson said the award was for Meany&#x27;s service to unionism and for advancing freedom throughout the world.

On November 6, 1974, Meany dedicated the George Meany Center for Labor Studies (founded 1969), which was renamed the National Labor College in 1997. From 1993 to 2013, the college housed the George Meany Memorial Archives. In 2013 the archival and library holdings were transferred to the University of Maryland libraries, making the university the official repository. The holdings date from the establishment of the AFL (1881), and offer almost complete records from the founding of the AFL–CIO (1955). Among the estimated 40 million documents are AFL–CIO Department records, trade department records, international union records, union programs, union organizations with allied or affiliate relationships with the AFL–CIO, and personal papers of union leaders. Extensive photo documentation of labor union activities from the 1940s to the present are in the photographic negative and digital collections. Additionally, collections of graphic images, over 10,000 audio tapes, several hundred movies and videotapes, and more than 2,000 artifacts are available for public research and study.

The George Meany Award was established by the Boy Scouts of America in 1974.

Books published about Meany include &quot;Meany: The Unchallenged Strong Man of American Labor&quot; (1972) and &quot;George Meany and His Times: A Biography&quot; (1981). Meany&#x27;s entry in the biographical encyclopedia &quot;American National Biography&quot; was published in 2000, authored by historian David Brody.

Meany was known as a cigar smoker, and pictures of him often appeared in newspapers and magazines smoking a cigar.

On the 100th anniversary of his birth in 1994, Meany was pictured on a United States commemorative postage stamp.

<doc id="607240" wikidata="Q7970485" url="?curid=607240" title="Warren Snowdon">
<text>Warren Edward Snowdon (born 20 March 1950) is an Australian former politician who served as a member of the House of Representatives from July 1987 to March 1996, and again from October 1998 until May 2022. Initially representing the Division of Northern Territory, and later the Division of Lingiari, his constituents consisted of all the residents of the Northern Territory located outside Darwin, as well as Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean. He was the last sitting MP who was first elected in the 1980s, and the last who served in Old Parliament House.

Snowdon was the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs, Minister for Indigenous Health, and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC in the second Rudd ministry. Snowdon is a member of the left faction of the Labor Party.

Snowdon did not contest the 2022 federal election and retired from politics.

==Early life and career==
Snowdon was born in Canberra and was educated at St Edmund&#x27;s College, the Australian National University and the University of Western Australia.

He worked as a teacher with the Northern Territory teaching service before entering politics. He was a senior project officer with the Central Land Council in Alice Springs 1983–87 and was founding president of the Central Australian Regional Trades and Labour Council, then assistant secretary of the Northern Territory Trades and Labour Council.

== Political career ==
Snowdon was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications 1990–92, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training 1992–96, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories 1993 and 1994–96 and Parliamentary Secretary (Territories) 1993–94.

Defeated at the 1996 federal election, Snowdon returned to parliament two years later. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Minister for Regional and Urban Development, Transport and Infrastructure (Northern Australia and the Territories) 2001–04. From 2004 to 2007 he was Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Northern Australia and Indigenous Affairs.

Snowdon was sworn in as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in the first Rudd ministry on 3 December 2007. Following a reshuffle of the Ministry on 9 June 2009 as a result of the resignation of the Defence Minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, Snowdon was promoted to Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery. On 14 September 2010, he gained the portfolio of Veterans&#x27; Affairs and regained Defence Science and Personnel, while losing responsibility for Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery, but retaining Indigenous Health. On 12 September 2011 he was given the added responsibility of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC.

Snowdon narrowly retained his seat at the 2013 federal election, largely due to his winning all but five booths. However, Snowdon was not appointed to the shadow ministry.

Snowdon was re-elected in the 2016 federal election with a seven-point swing towards him, becoming the longest-serving MP in the House, and the only member who was first elected in the 1980s. Snowdon was however not the Father of the House due to his continuous service only beginning from 1998. Kevin Andrews, whose continuous service began from 1991, became Father of the House instead. Snowdon again retained his seat at the 2019 federal election.

He sat on the &quot;Inquiry into the destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia&quot; from June 2020.

In reference to his service from Old Parliament House, Snowdon said:
&quot;I&#x27;m a bit of a relic. I&#x27;m the only one left in this parliament - Senate or House of Reps - from the Old Parliament House.&quot;

Snowdon did not contest the 2022 federal election and retired from politics.

<text>The New York Historical (known as the New-York Historical Society from 1804–2024) is an American history museum and library on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. The society was founded in 1804 as New York&#x27;s first museum. It presents exhibitions, public programs, and research that explore the history of New York and the nation. The New York Historical Museum &amp; Library has been at its present location since 1908. The granite building was designed by York &amp; Sawyer in a classic Roman Eclectic style. The building, along Central Park West between 76th and 77th Streets, is a New York City designated landmark. A renovation, completed in November 2011, made the building more accessible to the public, provided space for an interactive children&#x27;s museum, and facilitated access to its collections.

Louise Mirrer has been the president of the New York Historical since 2004. Beginning in 2005, the museum presented a two-year exhibit on &quot;Slavery in New York,&quot; its largest theme exhibition in 200 years on a topic which it had never addressed before. It included an art exhibit by artists invited to use museum collections in their works. The Society generally focuses on the developing city center in Manhattan. Another historical society, the Long Island Historical Society (later Brooklyn Historical Society) was founded in Brooklyn in 1863.

The New York Historical holds an extensive collection of historical artifacts, works of American art, and other materials documenting the history of New York and the United States. It presents well-researched exhibitions on a variety of topics and periods in American history, such as George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Slavery in New York, The Hudson River School, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Tiffany designer Clara Driscoll, and the history of the Constitution. The Society also offers an extensive range of curriculum-based school programs and teacher resources, and provides academic fellowships and organizes public programs for adults to foster lifelong learning and a deep appreciation of history.

==Collections==

The New York Historical&#x27;s museum is the oldest in New York City and predates the founding of the Metropolitan Museum of Art by nearly 70 years. Its art holdings comprise more than 1.6 million works. Among them are a world-class collection of Hudson River School paintings, including major works by Thomas Cole and Frederic Edwin Church; iconic genre and history paintings, including works by William Sidney Mount and Eastman Johnson; a vast range of American portraits, including paintings by Rembrandt Peale and Gilbert Stuart; all 435 of John James Audubon&#x27;s extant preparatory watercolors for &quot;The Birds of America&quot;; and an encyclopedic collection of more than 800 works documenting the full catalog of representational sculpture in America from the colonial period to the present day.

The Historical Society holds an important collection of paintings and drawings by marine artist James Bard. The museum holds much of sculptor Elie Nadelman&#x27;s legendary American folk art collection, including furniture and household accessories such as lamps, candlesticks, textiles, glass, and ceramic objects, as well as paintings, toys, weather vanes, sculptural woodcarvings, and chalkware. The Historical Society&#x27;s holdings in artifacts and decorative arts include George Washington&#x27;s camp bed from Valley Forge, the desk at which Clement Clarke Moore wrote &quot;A Visit from Saint Nicholas&quot;, one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of Tiffany lamps and glasswork, and a collection of more than 550 late 19th-century American board games.

Its research library contains more than three million books, pamphlets, maps, atlases, newspapers, broadsides, music sheets, manuscripts, prints, photographs, and architectural drawings. Among its collections are far-ranging materials relating to the founding and early history of the nation including the first documentary evidence of the phrase &quot;United States of America&quot;; one of the best collections of 18th-century newspapers in the United States; an outstanding collection of materials documenting slavery and Reconstruction; an exceptional collection of Civil War material, including Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s terms of surrender for Robert E. Lee; collections relating to trials in the United States prior to 1860; American fiction, poetry, and &quot;belles-lettres&quot; prior to 1850; a broad range of materials relating to the history of the circus; and American travel accounts from the colonial era to the present day.

The Society operates a website showing many images from its collection. In 2015, it announced the digitization and posting of over a thousand negatives by photographer Robert L. Bracklow from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Early history==
The Historical Society was founded on November 20, 1804, largely through the efforts of John Pintard. He was for some years secretary of the American Academy of Fine Arts, as well as the founder of New York&#x27;s first savings bank. He was also among the first to agitate for a free school system. The first meeting comprised 11 of the city&#x27;s most prominent citizens, including Mayor DeWitt Clinton. At the meeting, a committee was selected to draw up a constitution, and by December 10, the Historical Society was officially organized.

According to the Historical Society&#x27;s first catalogue, printed in 1813, the museum then held 4,265 books, as well as 234 volumes of United States documents, 119 almanacs, 130 titles of newspapers, 134 maps, and 30 miscellaneous views. It had already collected the start of a manuscript collection, several oil portraits and 38 engraved portraits.

The Historical Society suffered under heavy debt during its early decades. In 1809, it organized a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the arrival of Henry Hudson in New York Harbor. Inspired by the event, the Historical Society petitioned and later obtained an endowment from the New York State Legislature, to be financed by a lottery in 1814. The failure of the lottery resulted in a debt that forced the Society to mortgage some of its books, which were not redeemed until 1823.

The Historical Society and its collections moved frequently during the 19th century. In 1809, the Historical Society and its collections moved to the Government House on Bowling Green. Constructed as a residence for the President of the United States when New York was the temporary capital, the building had been unoccupied since the government&#x27;s relocation to Philadelphia in 1790. In 1816, the Historical Society moved to the New York Institution, formerly the city almshouse on City Hall Park.

In 1857, it moved into the first building constructed specifically for its collections, at the then-fashionable intersection of Second Avenue and 11th Street, where it stayed for the next 50 years. The Historical Society later acquired a collection of Egyptian and Assyrian art, which was eventually transferred to the Brooklyn Museum of Art. In 1936 it acquired the collections of the Naval History Society (1912–1936).

==Current building==

Construction for its eighth home began September 10, 1902. The central portion of the current building on Central Park West was completed on December 15, 1908, to designs by architects York and Sawyer, who were known for their bank designs. In 1938 that central block was extended and sympathetically completed by the construction of pavilions on either end, with Walker &amp; Gillette as architects. That extension project stands among the last examples of Beaux-Arts architecture completed in the city and in the entire country. The building was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966.

Two notable stained glass windows are found in the library on the 2nd floor. &quot;The Arrival of Henry Hudson&quot; was designed by Mr. Calvert of the Gorham Manufacturing Company. The second is &quot;Revocation of the Edict of Nantes&quot;, known as the French Huguenot memorial window, in honor of religious refugees to New York. It is inscribed and signed by the artist, Mary Elizabeth Tillinghast. The window was underwritten by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage, a philanthropist who was instrumental in commissioning other windows by Tillinghast.

==Decline and revival==
The Historical Society&#x27;s collection continued to grow throughout the 20th century, but renewed financial woes in the 1970s and 1980s forced the Historical Society to limit access to its collections to professional researchers. In the 1980s, under the leadership of Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., a private equity financier and Enron board member, the Society was forced to use endowment invasion to pay their annual operating costs and cover their salaries, to the point where by 1988, they had only enough money in their endowment to pay for another 18 months of operating expenses.

Barbara Knowles Debs from Manhattanville College was named interim director of the Historical Society. In the same year hundreds of paintings, decorative art objects, and other artifacts, which were stored in a Manhattan warehouse, were found to be critically deteriorating. Many of the objects were on long-term loan to the museum.

In 1995, grants from the city and state restored public access under the direction of Betsy Gotbaum. Since the late 1990s, the New York Historical has invested significantly in facility and installation upgrades, and conducted fundraising. It has increased its operating budget by 160 percent to enhance and expand its public programs, while maintaining a balanced budget from 1998 to the present. Recent renovations to the Historical Society include new galleries and exhibition spaces, the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture, a state-of-the-art library reading room, and a new facility to house and provide access to the letters and manuscripts of the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. In 2005, the Historical Society was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.
The museum has mounted exhibits on national themes through history in New York. For instance, beginning in 2005 with &quot;Slavery and the Making of New York, 1600s–1827&quot;, it mounted the first exhibition ever in New York City on the major but little-known role of slavery in the city&#x27;s economy and history. During the colonial years, 41% of households had slaves, and much of the city&#x27;s economy through the Civil War was related to the South and slavery; half of its exports were related to cotton. Devoting the entire first floor to the exhibit, the museum mounted the largest theme exhibit in its 200-year history. It also addressed the strengths of African Americans who resisted slavery and created their own culture, both in New York and the nation.

A related part of the exhibit was commissioning 20 new works by invited artists, some of whom used objects from the museum&#x27;s collections to create new works and installations on this theme. The second exhibition was &quot;New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War, 1827–1865&quot;, (November 17, 2006 to September 3, 2007), which explored the economy before the war and strong business ties to the South, events related to the war such as the New York City Draft Riots, and other aspects. Southerners visited New York so frequently in the antebellum era that they had favorite hotels.

Under the direction of Louise Mirrer, a three-year, $65 million renovation of the landmark building on Central Park West was completed in 2011 to enhance public access to the institution&#x27;s resources. On Central Park West, windows were lengthened to form new entrances, with views into the main gallery, and windows were expanded. To establish &quot;a street presence,&quot; the society has installed life-size bronze sculptures outside the building—Abraham Lincoln on Central Park West, Frederick Douglass on West 77th Street—national figures with connections to New York.

After reopening, the Historical Society offered a multimedia installation of major themes of American history through stories and figures from New York&#x27;s past. It also has a new section for an interactive children&#x27;s history museum.

In 2023, the New York Historical Society began constructing the Tang Wing, designed by Robert A. M. Stern. The wing will contain collections on LGBTQ+ history. , the wing is scheduled to open in 2026.

==Branding==
The Historical Society uses an archaic spelling of the name &quot;New York&quot;. Hyphenating the city&#x27;s name was common in the 19th century when the institution was founded. The hyphen is still used in the 21st century to give the Historical Society a unique identity. In October 2024, the organization announced that it would be rebranding itself as New York Historical.

<doc id="607248" wikidata="Q186292" url="?curid=607248" title="Joey Bishop">
<text>Joseph Abraham Gottlieb (February 3, 1918 – October 17, 2007), known professionally as Joey Bishop, was an American entertainer who appeared on television as early as 1948 and eventually starred in his own weekly comedy series playing a talk/variety show host, then later hosted a late-night talk show with Regis Philbin as his young sidekick on ABC. He also was a member of the &quot;Rat Pack&quot; with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford. He is listed as the 96th entry on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of 100 greatest comedians.

== Early life and education ==
Bishop, the youngest of five children, was born on February 3, 1918, in the Bronx, New York City, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants Anna (née Siegel) and Jacob Gottlieb. His father was a bicycle repairman. Bishop was raised in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Bishop was drafted into the US Army during World War II, and he rose to the rank of sergeant in the Special Services, serving at Fort Sam Houston in Texas.

== Career ==
Bishop began his career in the 1930s when he skipped his final semester of high school to form a comedy trio with two other boys, performing in nightclubs and burlesque houses in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and throughout the East Coast. The boys were not related, but called themselves the &quot;Bishop Brothers&quot;, borrowing the name of their driver, Glenn Bishop, with each adopting &quot;Bishop&quot; as their stage name. The act was originally made up of Morris &quot;Rummy&quot; Spector, Joey, and Sammy Reisman - who soon dropped out and was replaced by Mel Farber - and were individually known as Rummy Bishop, Joey Bishop, and Mel Bishop - stage names they would keep throughout their careers. The act broke up when Rummy was drafted during World War II, with Joey Bishop continuing as a solo performer until he himself was drafted in 1942. Bishop would later include his former partners in his projects, with Rummy Bishop having a small role in &quot;Oceans 11&quot; and Mel Bishop appeared in several roles on &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, including one episode. &quot;Must the Show Go On?&quot; in which all three &quot;Bishop Brothers&quot; were reunited for the first time since the 1940s.

Bishop resumed his solo career after he was discharged from the military in August 1945, working at the Casablanca Roadhouse in New Jersey and then becoming an opening act in New York City at the Greenwich Village Inn. He became a regular performer at New York&#x27;s Latin Quarter nightclub for $1,000 a week, which led to appearances on television and film. Bishop appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on May 28, 1950. In 1952, Frank Sinatra saw Bishop perform at the Latin Quarter and, impressed, asked Bishop to be his opening act at the Bill Miller&#x27;s Riviera in Fort Lee, New Jersey and then at the Copacabana in New York and at other venues, leading to Bishop becoming known as &quot;Sinatra&#x27;s comic&quot; as Sinatra&#x27;s career ascended in the 1950s.

Bishop&#x27;s growing celebrity led to his being a headliner in top nightclubs his own right, and television appearances on &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot; on April 19, 1957, and many other variety programs in the early days of television. He guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; substituting for Jack Paar, and then guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; at least 175 times in the 1960s, and from 1971 to 1976 more than anyone else until that time (Jay Leno and Joan Rivers later surpassed his record). He also frequently appeared on Steve Allen&#x27;s and Jack Paar&#x27;s previous versions of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. He later had his own late-night show.

Bishop starred in the situation comedy &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot; that premiered on September 20, 1961, and ran for 123 episodes over four seasons, first on NBC and later CBS. Bishop played Joey Barnes, at first a publicity agent and then later a talk show host. Abby Dalton joined the cast in 1962 as his wife.

Bishop later hosted a 90-minute late-night talk show, also titled &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, that was launched by ABC on April 17, 1967, as competition to Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; and ran until December 26, 1969. His sidekick was then-newcomer Regis Philbin.

Bishop was among the stars of the original &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; film about military veterans who reunite in a plot to rob five Las Vegas casinos on New Year&#x27;s Eve. He co-starred with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Peter Lawford, also known as the Rat Pack, although the five of them did not publicly acknowledge that name.

During filming, the five entertainers performed together onstage in Vegas at the Sands Hotel. Bishop did only a little singing and dancing, but he told jokes and wrote most of the act&#x27;s material. He later appeared with Sinatra, Martin, Davis, and Lawford in the military adventure &quot;Sergeants 3&quot; (1962), a loose remake of &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939), and with Martin in the Western comedy &quot;Texas Across the River&quot; (1966), in which he portrayed an American Indian.

Sinatra fell out with Bishop in 1964 when Sinatra asked him to fill in for him at the Cal-Neva Lodge in Lake Tahoe as a favor and Bishop demanded $50,000 and to be flown in a private jet. Sinatra, offended, hung up on Bishop and cut him out of the Rat Pack.

Bishop was the only member of the Rat Pack to work with members of a younger group of actors dubbed the Brat Pack, appearing (as a ghost) in the film &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1990) with Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy. His final appearance in a film was a non-speaking role in &quot;Mad Dog Time&quot; (1996), written and directed by his son, Larry. His character was named Gottlieb, which was his real surname. The film was panned by critics.

Bishop was portrayed by Bobby Slayton in the HBO film &quot;The Rat Pack&quot; (1998).

== Personal life and final years ==
Bishop wed Sylvia Ruzga in 1941, and they were married for 58 years until her death from lung cancer in 1999. They had one son, Larry Bishop, a film director and actor.

Thereafter, Bishop had a longtime companion, Nora Garibotti. In failing health for some time, Bishop died at age 89 of multiple organ failure on October 17, 2007, in his home on Lido Isle, a man-made island in the harbor of Newport Beach, California, as the last surviving Rat Pack member. Per Bishop&#x27;s wishes, his remains were cremated and scattered in the Pacific Ocean near his home. He had two grandsons, Kirk and Scott.

The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia posthumously inducted Bishop into their Hall of Fame in 2009.

<text>Hervey Bay () is a city on the coast of the Fraser Coast Region of Queensland, Australia. The city is situated approximately or 3½ hours&#x27; highway drive north of the state capital, Brisbane. It is located on the bay of the same name open to the Coral Sea between the Queensland mainland and nearby K&#x27;gari (also known as Fraser Island). The local economy relies on tourism which is based primarily around whale watching in Platypus Bay to the north, ferry access to K&#x27;gari, accessible recreational fishing and boating and the natural north facing, calm beaches with wide undeveloped foreshore zones. In October 2019, Hervey Bay was named the First Whale Heritage Site in the world by the World Cetacean Alliance, for its commitment to and practices of sustainable whale and dolphin watching.

In the , Hervey Bay had a population of 57,722 people. A 2010 study by Deakin University showed that people on the Fraser Coast area including Hervey Bay, were the happiest in Australia.

The area that became Hervey Bay is on the traditional lands of the Butchulla people. The city takes its name from Hervey Bay, named by James Cook in 1770 in honour of Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol. Several small townships developed along the bayside, the earliest being Pialba in 1863. From 1863 to 1906, the Wide Bay region became a central part of the Pacific Slave trade, with more than 12 thousand South Sea Islanders brought to the cotton and sugarcane plantations in Maryborough and Hervey Bay. During World War II, the region operated a training school for the Z Special Unit special forces. Hervey Bay boomed from the 1980s on and was proclaimed a city in 1984.

==History==

Butchulla (also known as Batjala, Badtjala, Badjela, and Badjala) is the language of the Fraser Coast region, including K’gari. Butchulla language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Fraser Coast Regional Council, particularly the towns of Maryborough and Hervey Bay extending south towards Double Island Point and north to Burrum Heads.

The indigenous Batjala people including the Kabi Kabi are the traditional residents of Hervey Bay. Batjala means Bat-No and Jala-tongu. The first recorded European sighting of Hervey Bay was made by James Cook while carrying out his running survey of the east coast of Australia, on 22 May 1770. By noon Cook&#x27;s ship was in a position a little over half-way across the opening of Hervey Bay heading for Bundaberg. When Cook first discovered Hervey Bay, he did not realise that Fraser Island was separated from mainland Australia; Cook did not travel far enough south due to the shallow depths of the waters in the Bay. Cook named the bay &quot;Hervey&#x27;s Bay&quot; after Augustus John Hervey (1724–1779), later Third Earl of Bristol, a naval officer who became a Lord of the Admiralty the year Endeavour returned.

Until around the mid-1980s the area was serviced by a rail link from the main North Coast line that diverted from Aldershot and went through Takura, Walligan, and Nikenbah, before continuing on to Pialba and Urangan. The line was a major freight point for the Port of Maryborough and for the sugar cane industry until road transport assumed the role.

On 18 February 1984, the Town of Hervey Bay was officially proclaimed as the &quot;City of Hervey Bay&quot;, due to its increasing population and growth in its business sector and tourism industry. Despite this, many of the local residents still saw it as a small seaside village. Along with the City of Maryborough and the Shire of Woocoo, as well as parts of the Shire of Tiaro, it was amalgamated into the Fraser Coast Region on 15 March 2008. 

The Hervey Bay Library opened in 1997 and had a major refurbishment in 2014. A new library is under construction with an expected completion date of mid 2026.

===Railway===

Despite Hervey Bay&#x27;s growing popularity, no plans have been made for a new railway line to the city. The previous passenger and freight line branched off the North Coast main line at Colton, just north of Maryborough. Trains stopped at many stations along the line, but the main stations were Pialba and Urangan. The railway then extended along the Urangan Pier. The line carried out pineapples and local goods from the city. The line was closed in 1993. The tracks from Nikenbah to Urangan were removed and the Pialba – Urangan line was converted into a rail trail. Traces of the railway line are still visible in Urangan. There are two semi-removed crossings (Everything but the tracks was removed) near the end of Pier Street and the track&#x27;s ballast is still slightly visible from where the mobility corridor ends.

<text>A Living Machine is a form of ecological sewage treatment based on fixed-film ecology.

The Living Machine system was commercialized and is marketed by Living Machine Systems, L3C, a corporation based in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States.

==Examples==
Examples of Living Machines are mechanical composters for industrial kitchens, effective microorganisms as fertilizer for agricultural purposes, and Integrated Biotectural systems in landscaping and architecture like Earthships or the IBTS Greenhouse.

Components like tomato plants (for more water purification) and fish (for food) have been part of the living, ecosystem-like designs. The theory does not limit the size of the system, or the amount of species. One design optimum is a natural ecosystem which is designed for a special purpose like a sewage treating wetland in a suitable ecosystem for the locality. Another optimum is an economically viable system returning profit for the investor. The practice of permaculture is one example for a compromise between the two optimum design points.

The scale of Living Machine systems ranges from the individual building to community-scale public works. Some of the earliest Living Machines were used to treat domestic wastewater in small, ecologically-conscious villages, such as Findhorn Community in Scotland. The latest-generation Tidal Flow Wetland Living Machines are being used in major urban office buildings, military bases, housing developments, resorts and institutional campuses.

==Living Machine System Process==

*“Fixed film ecology” has superseded systems based on hydroponics or a fluid medium. In fixed film systems, the wetland cells are filled with a solid aggregate medium having extensive surface area for beneficial biofilm (treatment bacteria) growth. Fixed film ecology allows denser and more diverse micro-ecosystems to form than does a liquid medium. These ecosystems go well beyond bacteria to include a variety of organisms up to and including macro-vegetation.
*Tidal cycles (filling and draining the wetland in accelerated tidal action, with 12 or more cycles per day) are used to passively bring oxygen into the wetland cells. This action mimics the type of biological action that occurs in natural tidal estuaries. Tidal flow wetlands replace the need to blow air into a liquid medium - they use gravity to bring atmospheric oxygen into the cell when it is drained.

<text>A potato masher, tater masher, bean masher, pea masher, masher, or crusher is a food preparation utensil used to crush soft food for such dishes as mashed potatoes, apple sauce, or refried beans. Potatoes mashed using a potato masher tend to be fluffier and lighter in texture compared to other methods of mashing, because use of the device reduces cell damage to the potato, releasing less starch.

==Construction==
The potato masher consists of an upright or sideways handle connected to a mashing head. The head is most often a large-gauge wire in a rounded zig-zag shape, or a plate with holes or slits. The term &#x27;potato masher&#x27; first appeared in the diaries of keen potato breeder Lord Timothy George II of Cornwall, in 1813. Basic designs made from a single piece of wood were used in Victorian times, before the more complex modern designs which are now used. This type of wooden masher, which is effectively a large wooden pestle, is still used in Scotland and is known as a &#x27;Potato-Beetle&#x27; or just a &#x27;Beetle&#x27;.

==Uses==
Although potato mashers are most commonly used to mash potatoes, they are also used for mashing a variety of foods. They are most used in home kitchens, but may also be used in commercial kitchens. Commercial mashers are often of larger design (up to 32 inches in base width). Other common uses include mashing pumpkins and rutabagas for soup, making hummus, guacamole, baking mix, egg salad, or even purées (depending on the fineness of the ridges).

The plunger is used to push the potatoes through the holes in the body of the masher. the grip is used to hold the masher. The body of the masher is made of metal or plastic, and the plunger is made of metal. The plunger has ridges on it, which help to mash the potatoes.

<doc id="607259" wikidata="Q742698" url="?curid=607259" title="Harris's hawk">
<text>Harris&#x27;s hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), formerly known as the bay-winged hawk or dusky hawk, and known in Latin America as the peuco, is a medium-large bird of prey that breeds from the southwestern United States south to Chile, central Argentina, and Brazil. This bird is sometimes reported to be at large in Western Europe, especially Britain, but it is a popular species in falconry and these records almost invariably all refer to escapes from captivity.

The name is derived from the Greek &quot;para&quot;, meaning beside, near or like, and the Latin &quot;buteo&quot;, referring to a kind of buzzard; &quot;uni&quot; meaning once; and &quot;cinctus&quot; meaning girdled, referring to the white band at the tip of the tail. John James Audubon gave this bird its English name in honor of his ornithological companion, financial supporter, and friend Edward Harris.

Harris&#x27;s hawk is notable for its behavior of hunting cooperatively in packs consisting of tolerant groups, while other raptors often hunt alone. Harris&#x27;s hawks&#x27; social nature has been attributed to their intelligence, which makes them easy to train and has made them a popular bird for use in falconry.

==Description==
This medium-large hawk is roughly intermediate in size between a peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) and a red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;). Harris&#x27;s hawks range in length from and generally have a wingspan of about . These hawks have a brownish plumage, reddish shoulders, and tail feathers with a white base and white tip.

They exhibit sexual dimorphism with the females being larger by about 35%. In the United States, the average weight for adult males is about , with a range of , while the adult female average is , with a range of . They have dark brown plumage with chestnut shoulders, wing linings, and thighs, white on the base and tip of the tail, long, yellow legs, and a yellow cere. The vocalizations of Harris&#x27;s hawk are very harsh sounds.

The lifespan of Harris&#x27;s Hawk is 10–12 years in the wild and 20–25 years in captivity.

===Juvenile===
The juvenile Harris&#x27;s hawk is mostly streaked with buff and appears much lighter than the dark adults. When in flight, the undersides of the juveniles&#x27; wings are buff-colored with brown streaking. They can look unlike adults at first glance, but the identical chestnut plumage is an aid for identification.

There are three subspecies of Harris&#x27;s hawk:

===Subspecies===
==Taxonomy==
Robert Ridgway placed Harris&#x27; Hawk in its own new subgenus &quot;Urubitinga (Antenor)&quot; in 1873, and introduced the generic name &quot;Parabuteo&quot; in 1874. Richard Bowdler Sharpe also separated Harris&#x27; Hawk to a monotypic genus, &quot;Erythrocnema&quot;, in 1874. In his &quot;Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum&quot;, Sharpe gives an extensive synonymy, with various authors having earlier placed &quot;harrisii&quot; in three genera and &quot;unicinctus&quot; in eleven.

==Distribution and habitat==
Harris&#x27;s hawks live in sparse woodland and semi-desert, as well as marshes (with some trees) in some parts of their range (Howell and Webb 1995), including mangrove swamps, as in parts of their South American range. Harris&#x27;s hawks are permanent residents and do not migrate. Important perches and nest supports are provided by scattered larger trees or other features (e.g., power poles, woodland edges, standing dead trees, live trees, boulders, and saguaros).

The wild Harris&#x27;s hawk population is declining due to habitat loss; however, under some circumstances, they have been known to move into developed areas.

==Behaviour==
This species occurs in relatively stable groups. A dominance hierarchy occurs in Harris&#x27;s hawks, wherein the mature female is the dominant bird, followed by the adult male and then the young of previous years. Groups typically include from two to seven birds. Not only do birds cooperate in hunting, but they also assist in the nesting process. No other bird of prey is known to hunt in groups as routinely as this species.

===Breeding===
They nest in small trees, shrubby growth, or cacti. The nests are often compact, made of sticks, plant roots, and stems and are often lined with leaves, moss, bark, and plant roots. They are built mainly by the female. There are usually two to four white to blueish-white eggs sometimes with a speckling of pale brown or gray. The nestlings start light buff, but in five to six days turn a rich brown.

Very often, there will be three hawks attending one nest: two males and one female. Whether or not this is polyandry is debated, as it may be confused with backstanding (one bird standing on another&#x27;s back). The female does most of the incubation. The eggs hatch in 31 to 36 days. The young begin to explore outside the nest at 38 days, and fledge, or start to fly, at 45 to 50 days. The female sometimes breeds two or three times in a year. Young may stay with their parents for up to three years, helping to raise later broods. Nests are known to be predated by coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), red-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), and flocks of common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), predators possibly too formidable to be fully displaced by Harris&#x27;s hawk&#x27;s cooperative nest defenses. No accounts show predation on adults in the United States and Harris&#x27;s hawk may be considered an apex predator, although presumably predators like eagles and great horned owls would be capable of killing them. In Chile, black-chested buzzard-eagles (&quot;Geranoaetus melanoleucus&quot;) are likely predators.

===Feeding===
The majority of Harris&#x27;s hawks&#x27; prey are mammals, including ground squirrels, rabbits, and larger black-tailed jackrabbits (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;). Birds from the size of small passerines such as diuca finch (&quot;Diuca diuca&quot;) to adult great egret (&quot;Ardea alba&quot;) and half-grown wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;) can be taken. In one instance, a lone Harris&#x27;s hawk successfully killed a subadult great blue heron (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;). Reptiles such as lizards and snakes are additionally taken as well as large insects.

When hunting in groups, Harris&#x27;s hawk can take large prey effectively, such as desert cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus auduboni&quot;), the leading prey species in the north of Harris&#x27;s hawk&#x27;s range, usually weighs or less. Even adult black-tailed jackrabbits weighing more than can be successfully taken by a pack of Harris&#x27;s hawks.

Undoubtedly because it pursues large prey often, this hawk has larger and stronger feet, with long talons, and a larger, more prominent hooked beak than most other raptors around its size. Locally, other buteonine hawks, including the ferruginous hawk, the red-tailed hawk, and the white-tailed hawk also hunt primarily cottontails and jackrabbits, but each is bigger, weighing about , and , respectively, more on average than a Harris&#x27;s hawk.

In the Southwestern United States, the most common prey species (in descending order of prevalence) are desert cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus auduboni&quot;), eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;), black-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;), ground squirrels (&quot;Ammospermophilus&quot; spp. and &quot;Spermophilus&quot; spp.), woodrats (&quot;Neotoma&quot; spp.), kangaroo rats (&quot;Dipodomys&quot; spp.), pocket gophers (&quot;Geomys&quot; and &quot;Thomomys&quot; spp.), Gambel&#x27;s quail (&quot;Callipepla gambelii&quot;), scaled quail (&quot;C. squamata&quot;), northern bobwhite (&quot;Colinus virginianus&quot;), cactus wren (&quot;Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus&quot;), northern mockingbird (&quot;Mimus polyglottos&quot;), desert spiny lizards (&quot;Sceloporus magister&quot;), and skinks (&quot;Eumeces&quot; spp.) In the tropics, Harris&#x27;s hawks have adapted to taking prey of several varieties, including those like chickens and European rabbits introduced by man. In Chile, the common degu (&quot;Octodon degus&quot;) makes up 67.5% of the prey.

===Hunting===
While most raptors are solitary, only coming together for breeding and migration, Harris&#x27;s hawks will hunt in cooperative groups of two to six. This is believed to be an adaptation to the lack of prey in the desert climate in which they live. In one hunting technique, a small group flies ahead and scouts, then another group member flies ahead and scouts, and this continues until prey is bagged and shared. In another, all the hawks spread around the prey and one bird flushes it out. Harris&#x27;s hawks will often chase prey on foot and are quite fast on the ground; their long legs are adapted for this, whereas most other hawks do not spend as much time on the ground. Groups of Harris&#x27;s hawks tend to be more successful at capturing prey than lone hawks, with groups of two to four individuals having ~10% higher success rates per extra individual.

==Relationship with humans==

===Falconry===
Since about 1980, Harris&#x27;s hawks have been increasingly used in falconry and are now the most popular hawks in the West (outside of Asia) for that purpose, as they are one of the easiest to train and the most social.

Trained Harris&#x27;s hawks have been used to remove an unwanted pigeon population from London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square, and from the tennis courts at Wimbledon.

Trained Harris&#x27;s hawks have been used for bird abatement by falconry experts in Canada and the United States at various locations including airports, resorts, landfill sites, and industrial sites.

===In art===
John James Audubon illustrated Harris&#x27;s hawk in &quot;The Birds of America&quot; (published in London, 1827–38) as Plate 392 with the title &quot;Louisiana Hawk -&quot;Buteo harrisi&quot;&quot;. The image was engraved and colored by the Robert Havell, London workshops in 1837. The original watercolor by Audubon was purchased by the New York History Society where it remains to this day (January 2009).

<text>In Northern English folklore, the Barghest or Barguest is a mythical monstrous black dog with large teeth and claws, though in other cases the name can refer to a ghost or household elf, especially in Northumberland and Durham, such as the Cauld Lad of Hylton.

== Origin of the name ==
&quot;Ghost&quot; in Northern England was pronounced &quot;guest&quot;, and the origin is thought to be of the combination &quot;burh-ghest&quot;, &quot;town-ghost&quot;. Others explain it as cognate to German &quot;Berg-geist&quot;, &quot;mountain ghost&quot; or &quot;Bär-geist&quot;, &quot;bear-ghost&quot;. Another mooted derivation is &quot;Bahr-Geist&quot;, German for the &quot;spirit of the funeral bier&quot;.

== Domain and description ==
In Yorkshire, England, one notable case is said to frequent a remote gorge named Troller&#x27;s Gill in the Yorkshire Dales. A ballad entitled &quot;The Legend of the Troller&#x27;s Gill&quot; can be found in William Hone&#x27;s &quot;Everyday Book&quot; (1830). It recounts the tale of a man who ventures forth &quot;to the horrid gill of the limestone hill&quot; in order to summon and confront the Barghest in an act of ritual magic. The man&#x27;s lifeless body is discovered soon afterward with inhuman marks upon his breast. There is also a story of a Barghest entering the city of York occasionally where, according to legend, it preys on lone travellers in the city&#x27;s narrow Snickelways. Furthermore, the building at number 1 The Shambles is named Barghest. The town of Whitby is also associated with the spectre, and yet another haunted an area of wasteland between Wreghorn and Headingley Hill near Leeds.

In Durham, during the 1870s a shapeshifting Barghest was said to live near Darlington and was said to take the form of a headless man (who would vanish in flames), a headless lady, a white cat, a rabbit, a dog, or a black dog. Another was said to live in an &quot;uncanny-looking&quot; dale between Darlington and Houghton near Throstlenest.

The Barghest often allegedly serves as an omen of death. At the passing of a notable person the Barghest may appear, followed by all the other dogs of the local area in a kind of funeral procession, heralding the person&#x27;s death with howling and barking. If anyone were to get in the Barghest&#x27;s way it would strike out with its paw and leave a wound that never heals.

Besides taking the form of a large black dog with fiery eyes, it may also become invisible and walk about with the sound of rattling chains. It may also foretell the death of an individual by laying across the threshold of his or her house, and like the vampire the Barghest is unable to cross rivers.

== In popular culture ==

<text>The Metal Men are a group of robot superheroes that appear in DC Comics. The characters first appeared in &quot;Showcase&quot; #37 (March–April 1962) and were created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Ross Andru. Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the characters have appeared in comic books and other DC Comics-related products such as animated television series, clothing, figurines and trading cards.

==Publication history==
===1960s and 1970s===
Established as advanced artificially intelligent robots, the Metal Men were introduced in the comic book &quot;Showcase&quot; #37 (March–April 1962) as &quot;last minute&quot; filler. Created by scientist Dr. William &quot;Will&quot; Magnus, the six robots were field leader Gold; strongman Iron; slow-witted and loyal Lead; hot-headed Mercury; self-doubting and insecure Tin; and Platinum (also called &quot;Tina&quot;), who believed that she was a real woman and was in love with her creator. The group&#x27;s personalities mirrored their namesake metals, being dictated by devices called responsometers. Each Metal Man also possessed abilities that reflected the traits of their namesake metal: Gold could stretch his form almost infinitely, Iron was super-strong, Lead could block harmful radiation by morphing into thick shields, Mercury could melt and pass through small spaces before reforming, while Platinum and Tin could stretch, flatten or spin into fine filaments.

The characters reappeared in the following three issues of &quot;Showcase&quot; (#38–40, June–October 1962) and proved popular enough to warrant a reappearance in their own eponymous title. First published in May 1963, the title ran on a bi-monthly schedule with original stories until &quot;Metal Men&quot; #41 (December 1969). The comic was unusual for the time, for having continued serialized storylines across issues. A second female robot (created by Tin) was introduced in issue #13 (April–May 1965), and was later (issue #15, August–September 1965) christened as &quot;Nameless&quot;, last appearing in issue #32.

With sales dropping, the series&#x27; tone darkened with issue #33 (September 1968), as the cover tagline changed to &quot;The New Hunted Metal Men&quot;. Shortly after, the team adopted human identities in issue #37 (May 1969). The title was cancelled in mid-story with issue #41 (December 1969).

Issues #42, 43 and 44 (March, May, and July 1973) reprinted earlier &quot;Showcase&quot; appearances and the first issue, with the title then on until returning with original numbering in issue #45 (May 1976). The bi-monthly publishing schedule continued until issue #56 (March 1978), when the title and many others were cancelled during the DC Implosion.

Until issue #21, the Metal Men appeared to be the sole super-heroes in a separate fictional universe, with no other DC Comics characters appearing (though the Metal Men watch a Batman television series, and Dr. Yes is recognized by them as resembling an enemy of Wonder Woman — Magnus and the Metal Men even seem to know at times that they are comic book characters, referring to earlier issues and reader response). Then the Metal Men became part of the shared universe of the DC heroes, even though they continued to fight their own foes (such as Chemo).

The Metal Men co-starred with other DC heroes such as the Atom, Metamorpho and Batman in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #55 (September 1964), 66 (July 1966), 74 (November 1967), 103 (November 1972), 113 (July 1974), 121 (September 1975), 135–136 (July–September 1977) and 187 (June 1982). This trend was repeated with Superman in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #4 (December 1978) and 70 (June 1984), and an appearance in &quot;Showcase&quot; #100 (May 1978).

===1990s===
The group returned in an eponymous four-issue miniseries (&quot;Metal Men&quot; (vol. 2) #1–4 (October 1993 – January 1994)) that featured a retcon of the characters&#x27; origin story. A laboratory accident transfers the intellects and personalities of Doctor Magnus&#x27; brother Mike, his fiancé Sharon, laboratory workers Redmond Wilde and Randy Pressman, Thomas Tinkham and a pizza delivery man named Jack to blank robots (Gold, Platinum, Mercury, Iron, Tin and Lead, respectively). During a battle, Gold is killed and Doctor Magnus mortally wounded, being forced to transfer his personality into another robot named Veridium. Magnus then becomes the leader of the Metal Men. Lead later makes a brief appearance as a worker at a superhero bar, and is temporarily damaged while protecting civilians. A robot Tungsten with no personality that served as a personal aide to Magnus was introduced in a guest appearance in &quot;The Doom Patrol&quot;; he was killed by a villain named the Candlemaker.

===2000s===
The Metal Men then reappeared during the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline (&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #1–7, December 2005 – June 2006, &quot;Villains United&quot; #1–6, July–December 2005), battling the O.M.A.C. cyborgs and acting as part of a superhero strike force assembled to protect the city of Metropolis from the Secret Society of Super Villains. Several of the Metal Men appeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #1 (August 2006), with the events of the limited series eventually revised and presented as a delusion suffered by Doctor Magnus in &quot;52&quot;, #22 (October 2006).

The entire group reappeared in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #34–36 (May, July–August 2007), having been rebuilt and upgraded and including a new female member, the sarcastic Copper. Employed by Lucius Fox as security for WayneTech, the Metal Men temporarily fall under the influence of Brainiac. The group starred in another eponymous limited series, running for eight issues (&quot;Metal Men&quot; (vol. 3) #1–8 October 2007 – June 2008). David Magnus, another brother of Will and Mike Magnus, attempts to avert a catastrophic future and prevent the creation of the group, and uses a device stolen from the villain T. O. Morrow to change the Metal Men into evil, radioactive versions based on other metals, called the Death Metal Men: Uranium (Iron), Strontium (Mercury), Thorium (Platinum), Radium (Gold), Lithium (Copper), Polonium (Lead), and Fermium (Tin). Doctor Magnus, however, is able to reverse the process and with the Metal Men and the assistance of the alien robot L-Ron, defeating his brother.

The Metal Men also featured in a stand-alone story in the weekly publication &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot; (#1–12, September–November 2009), and co-starred in the first seven issues of &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (vol. 5, October 2009 – April 2010). This series was later reprinted in &quot;DC Comics Presents: Metal Men 100 Page Spectacular&quot; (2011).

The Metal Men appeared in &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot; #10–11 (November–December 2010). Captured by villain Maxwell Lord, the Metal Men are reprogrammed and believe themselves to be humans living in a magical fantasy world. At Lord&#x27;s behest, the brainwashed Metal Men attack the members of the new Justice League International (thinking them monsters), and merge into their alternate universe persona Alloy (from the limited series &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; (#1–4, May–August 1996)), but are eventually defeated.

===2010s===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, the Metal Men were created by Doctor Magnus but subsequently disappeared. Cyborg locates Magnus and learns the scientist was tasked by the military with the creation of a rescue team that could enter toxic environments. Although successful, Magnus learns the military intends to use the Metal Men as assassins and the group flees and takes refuge in his apartment. When the entity Chemo is created (on account of a prototype responsometer created by Magnus being thrown into a vat of chemicals by a thief), the Metal Men fought Chemo to protect Will Magnus and the local population, and while successful are thought destroyed before eventually reappearing in an issue of &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;. 

In 2016, the Metal Men were featured in &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, a six-issue anthology series. They were in Nevada fighting off a robot enemy, and the government wanted to destroy the Metal Men and get rid of them as a threat to the people. During a run in with several other heroes, The Metal Men encountered three new Metal Men—Magnesium, Lithium and Silicon—who were created by the government in a plan to get the original Metal Men back in the military as assassins again. Despite their attempts&#x27; the three new robots are eventually destroyed in the conflict.

In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, the Metal Men are among the superheroes that head to Mars to confront Doctor Manhattan. Gold, Tin and Platinum are later seen as recruits of the League, to research a multi-verse ending threat.

The Metal Men were seen again in a 12-issue miniseries in 2019, with a new metal member to the team that was found at a construction site and called for Magnus. The Metal Men were destroyed by Magnus for trying to rebuild them from scratch again, and again the new one saw a version of himself destroyed. Dr. Will Magnus just had had enough of making the Metal Men and he fell in love with a girl, leaving the Metal Men to fend for themselves after having flashbacks of how he had made them up to now. After getting the new metal that they found in Magnus&#x27; lab, he helped it out as it called his name. He introduced them to his Metal Man that he had made, and it became part of the team. The new member enjoyed talking to Platinum and it fell in love with her.

==Team roster==
While there have been a number of different Metal Men members over the course of their history, the original and most common team line-up is Gold, Iron, Lead, Mercury, Platinum, and Tin led by their creator/mentor, scientist Dr. Will Magnus. Occasionally, the roster includes Copper as well.

==Enemies==

Over the years the Metal Men have fought with a variety of villains such as Dr. Yes, Professor Bravo and his Plastic Perils, Vox The Bionic Bandit, Grid, The Chemical Monster Chemo, Uranium, Missile Men, Gas Gang, Darzz The Intergalactic Dictator, Radioactive Manta Ray Monster From Space, Alien Fly Monster Fferka, Volcano Man, Sizzler, Von Vroon etc. Many of the team&#x27;s foes are fellow robots, aliens, evil scientists and other villains.

<doc id="607271" wikidata="Q3544019" url="?curid=607271" title="USS Clamagore">
<text>USS &quot;Clamagore&quot; (SS-343) was a submarine, which operated as a museum ship at the Patriot&#x27;s Point Naval &amp; Maritime Museum outside Charleston, South Carolina from 1979 to 2022. Built in 1945 for the United States Navy, she was still in training when World War II ended. She was named for the clamagore. A National Historic Landmark, she was the last surviving example of a GUPPY III type submarine.
On 15 October 2022, the USS Clamagore, stripped of sail and superstructure was removed from Patriots Point and towed to Norfolk VA to begin final recycling.

==Construction==
&quot;Clamagore&quot; was built by Electric Boat Co. in Groton, Connecticut near the end of World War II. She was launched on 25 February 1945 and sponsored by Miss Mary Jane Jacobs, daughter of Vice Admiral Randall Jacobs and commissioned on 28 June 1945, with Commander S.C. Loomis, Jr., taking command.

==Operational history==
&quot;Clamagore&quot; was first assigned to Key West, Florida, and reported there on 5 September 1945. She operated off Key West with various fleet units and with the Fleet Sonar School, voyaging on occasion to Cuba and the Virgin Islands until 5 December 1947, when she entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for GUPPY II modernization and installation of a snorkel.

&quot;Clamagore&quot; returned to Key West 6 August 1948 and assumed local and Caribbean operations for the next eight years, except for a tour of duty in the Mediterranean from 3 February to 16 April 1953.

&quot;Clamagore&quot; called at New London, Connecticut and Newport, Rhode Island early in 1957, returning to Key West 13 March. Between 23 September and 7 December she took part in NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, calling at Portsmouth, England, and Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. On 29 June 1959, she arrived at Charleston, her new home port, and after a period of coastwise operations, sailed 5 April 1960 to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean for a tour of duty which continued until July, when the submarine returned to Charleston. For the remainder of 1960, &quot;Clamagore&quot; operated off the east coast.

In 1962, &quot;Clamagore&quot; became one of only nine boats to undergo the GUPPY III conversion. She had a hull extension added forward of the control room, a plastic sail and the BQG-4 PUFFS passive ranging sonar, which included the three sharkfin sensors on her deck.

&quot;Clamagore&quot; finished her GUPPY III conversion in February 1963, and was transferred to Submarine Squadron 2 (SUBRON2) in Groton, Connecticut.

==Post operational history==
&quot;Clamagore&quot; was decommissioned on 12 June 1975 and stricken on 27 June 1975 after having served in the Navy for thirty years. She was donated as a museum ship on 6 August 1979.

&quot;Clamagore&quot; arrived at Patriot&#x27;s Point Naval &amp; Maritime Museum, Charleston, South Carolina in May 1981, where she was moored as a museum ship along with aircraft carrier and destroyer .

&quot;Clamagore&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark on 29 June 1989.

According to the South Carolina Department of Archives and History, &quot;Clamagore&quot; &quot;is now the only surviving GUPPY type III submarine in the United States. She represents the continued adaptation and use of war-built diesel submarines by the Navy for the first two decades after the war.&quot; The GUPPY conversion submarines constituted the bulk of the nation&#x27;s submarine force through the mid-1960s.

Due to severe degradation of the hull the Patriot Point museum had, on several occasions, looked for an alternate means to preserve the vessel. On 10 January 2017 the Palm Beach County Commissioners voted unanimously to approve funds for the vessel to be sunk as an artificial reef. On 16 April 2019 a group of retired submariners sued the State of South Carolina to save the &quot;Clamagore&quot;. In early 2020, the museum formed a plan to sink &quot;Clamagore&quot; at the Vermilion Reef site before the 2021 hurricane season. The next year, the museum announced plans to scrap the submarine as the cost of preservation was considered unsupportable.

During the summer of 2022, the museum began the process of scrapping the &quot;Clamagore&quot;. Its National Historic Landmark designation was withdrawn in September 2024.

<text>Alexander Gennadevich Mogilny (; born 18 February 1969) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player and the current president of Amur Khabarovsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He was the first National Hockey League (NHL) draftee to defect from the Soviet Union in order to play in North America.

During his NHL career, Mogilny played for the Buffalo Sabres, Vancouver Canucks, Toronto Maple Leafs and New Jersey Devils. He tied for the NHL lead in goals in the 1992–93 season with 76, and became a member of the Triple Gold Club by winning the Stanley Cup in 2000 with New Jersey.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Growing up in the Soviet Union, Mogilny was recruited at a young age to join CSKA Moscow, commonly referred to as the &quot;Red Army Team&quot;. As the CSKA organization was a functioning division of the Soviet Army, it was able to draft the best young hockey players in the Soviet Union onto the team.

In 1986, Mogilny was made a full-time player of CSKA Moscow. He finished his first year with 15 goals and 16 points in 28 games. At only 17 years old, Mogilny and Sergei Fedorov were the youngest members on the team. Still, team officials anticipated that the duo, along with the looming arrival of Pavel Bure, would succeed the top line of Vladimir Krutov, Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov. Mogilny&#x27;s first major appearance for the Soviet Union on the international stage was at the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He finished the tournament with 3 goals and 2 assists in 6 games. However, his team was ejected from the tournament during its last game as a result of the brawl between the Soviet Union players and Team Canada known as the &quot;Punch-up in Piestany&quot;. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) suspended all the players involved in that game from competing in international events for 18 months. The penalty was eventually reduced to six months, which allowed Mogilny to compete in the 1988 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He finished the tournament with 9 goals and 18 points in 7 games en route to a silver medal finish and winning the Top Forward award. He also played with the senior team at the 1988 Winter Olympics, where he won a gold medal as the team&#x27;s youngest player. The next year, at the 1989 World Junior Championships, he served as team captain and was a part of the commanding Bure-Fedorov-Mogilny line which led their team to a gold medal. Mogilny finished that tournament with 7 goals and 12 points in 7 games. He went on to win his first World Championships when the Soviet Union won the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships. Despite his success with the Soviet National team, and his growing importance on CSKA Moscow, Mogilny yearned for a life in the NHL and decided to join the Buffalo Sabres, the NHL team that had drafted him 89th overall in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. He boarded a plane in Stockholm at the conclusion of the 1989 World Championships and defected to North America.

===Buffalo Sabres===
Mogilny was given the number 89 by team management in recognition of both the year he arrived and his place in the draft. He subsequently wore #89 for his entire playing career.

He made his NHL debut on 5 October 1989 against the Quebec Nordiques during the 1989–90 season and scored his first NHL goal just 20 seconds into his first shift at age 20 (coincidentally, the Sabres were celebrating their 20th season in the NHL). After the perfect start to his new life, the rest of Mogilny&#x27;s first season was middling. He was considered by some to be one of the best players outside the NHL prior to his defection, but it took time for him to adjust to a new country and culture. He had a fear of flying (relating to not being used to flying so much) that he stuggled to deal with in his early NHL years. He finished his first NHL season with 43 points in 65 games and improved to 30 goals and 64 points during his sophomore season. He continued his ascension with 39 goals and 84 points in only 67 games the next year and broke out as an NHL superstar in his fourth season. On 21 December 1991, in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Mogilny scored five seconds into the game to tie the NHL record for fastest goal scored to start a game.

In the 1991–92 season, the Buffalo Sabres acquired future captain Pat Lafontaine from the New York Islanders. Lafontaine developed an instant chemistry playing with Mogilny and two players elevated their games to new heights by maximizing their speed and skill. The 1992–93 season was a banner year for Mogilny, as he scored an astonishing 76 goals and 127 points in 77 games. His 76 goals tied Finnish rookie Teemu Selänne for the NHL goal-scoring lead that year, which was the fifth-highest season goal total in NHL history and the first time that two players developed outside North America led the NHL in goals. Mogilny&#x27;s 76 goals and 127 points set the highest season totals ever for a Russian NHL player, a record which held until Nikita Kucherov scored 128 points in the 2018-19 NHL season, and the highest goal totals in Buffalo Sabres franchise history. He scored his 50th goal in his 46th game that year, but it did not count as an official 50 goals in 50 games record as it occurred during the team&#x27;s 53rd game. Mogilny finished the season with seven hat-tricks including three in four games, two four-goal games and a stretch where he scored 23 goals in 13 games. In the 1993 playoffs, he played a critical role for the Sabres in the first round, with 6 goals in 4 games, which helped his team sweep the Boston Bruins in the first round. In the second round, the Sabres were matched with the Montreal Canadiens, who had just finished a 100-point regular season. After scoring a goal and an assist in the series opener, Mogilny broke his leg during a collision in game 3 and was unable to return for the rest of the series. Without their superstar sniper, the Sabres would go on to lose the next game and the series in 4 games. It was the second time in back-to-back years that Mogilny had broken his leg, the first time during the 1992 playoffs. The multiple broken leg injuries in such a short time would limit the potential of his talent before Mogilny reached his prime. The second leg injury would also delay his start to the next season. He served as the Sabres&#x27; captain for a period that year, the first Russian captain in NHL history, and finished the year with 79 points in 66 games.

===Vancouver Canucks===
Due to financial restraints brought about by the contractual demands of Lafontaine and Dominik Hašek, the Sabres were looking to cut salary and subsequently traded Mogilny, along with a fifth round draft pick (Todd Norman), to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for Michael Peca, Mike Wilson and a first-round draft pick (Jay McKee) ahead of the 1995 NHL entry draft on 8 July 1995. In doing so, the Sabres lowered team salary from about $22 million to around $18–19 million at the time of the trade, although retained a portion of Mogilny&#x27;s $3.75 million contract.

Vancouver Canucks President Pat Quinn acquired Mogilny with the sole intention of winning the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup. The team had just been swept in round 2 of the 1995 playoffs by the Chicago Blackhawks, and Quinn gave up three important pieces to acquire one of the league&#x27;s best talents. The motive was to pair Mogilny with Pavel Bure and form a dominant scoring line, as the two had played together at CSKA Moscow and had a well-established chemistry off the ice. Bure, however, would miss almost their entire first season together with a torn ACL, so Mogilny played primarily with Cliff Ronning and Martin Gélinas. He had an outstanding first year, leading the team with 55 goals, 107 points, and finishing 3rd in the league in goals. Mogilny followed that with 9 points in 6 games in his first playoff series for Vancouver but it was to no avail as the Canucks were ousted in the first round by the Stanley Cup champions that year, the Colorado Avalanche, who were led by Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg and Patrick Roy. Mogilny would lead the Canucks in scoring again his second year with 73 points, but it would mark the end of his success in Vancouver. In the subsequent years, assorted injuries and inconsistency dropped his production to 128 points in 157 games over the next three seasons and the Canucks missed the playoffs each year. He was also unable to find the expected on-ice success with Bure as both players preferred to play on their off-wing. After trading Bure to the Florida Panthers in January 1999, the Canucks traded Mogilny to the New Jersey Devils at the trade deadline in 2000 in exchange for Brendan Morrison and Denis Pederson.

===New Jersey Devils===
Mogilny did not produce at the level that was expected, but nonetheless, the Devils won the Stanley Cup that year after beating the Dallas Stars in the finals. With the win, Mogilny captured his first Stanley Cup and became a member of the prestigious Triple Gold Club.

The next year, he stayed mainly injury-free for the first time in three years had a strong bounce-back season, leading the Devils with 43 goals and finishing with 83 points. The Devils went back to the Stanley Cup Finals for a second consecutive season, but could not repeat and lost to the Colorado Avalanche in 7 games.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
During the free agency period of 2001, multiple teams expressed interest in Mogilny as the Devils could not meet his market price. On 3 July 2001, he signed a four-year, $22 million contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs, citing the team&#x27;s fanbase and that there was no better place to be for his decision, although admitted that he was disappointed to be leaving New Jersey and that the Devils were unwilling to meet his contract demands. He became the elite winger the Leafs lacked for many years since Wendel Clark&#x27;s first stint with the team. This was also a reunion for Mogilny and Quinn, as the latter was the General Manager of the Leafs who signed Mogilny that summer and was the one who traded for Mogilny to Vancouver. Mogilny had a strong start with his new team, scoring two goals in his Maple Leafs debut. He scored his 400th career NHL goal a few games later, in a 6-1 win over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He battled through various injuries throughout the season but was able to finish his first year third in team scoring playing primarily on a line with Gary Roberts and Robert Reichel. Mogilny followed that season by playing a substantial role during that spring&#x27;s playoff run: with Mats Sundin injured for most of the 2002 playoffs, Mogilny led the team in playoff goal-scoring and scored two goals in both Game 7 wins against the New York Islanders and Ottawa Senators. Toronto however, was eliminated from the playoffs by the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Finals.

The next season, head coach Pat Quinn decided to start the season by pairing his two best forwards, Mogilny and Sundin, on the team&#x27;s first line. Darcy Tucker was the initial third forward on the line but was soon replaced by Nik Antropov after Tucker could not find consistency with the dynamic duo. The new Leafs trio became a dangerous line for the remainder of the season. Mogilny and Sundin had good chemistry playing together, particularly on the powerplay, and both players finished with 70+ point seasons. Mogilny led the team with 79 points, three shorthanded goals (tied with Sundin), 9 game-winning goals and added two hat-tricks that year. It was the only year that Sundin did not lead the Leafs in regular season scoring during his Maple Leafs career. They were matched with the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round, where Mogilny scored his first career playoff hat-trick in Game 1 win, led the team in playoff goals again, but the Leafs were eliminated in six games. He was awarded the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct at season&#x27;s end, the first Leaf to win it since Dave Keon in 1963. It was also the first individual award won by a Maple Leafs player since 1993, when Doug Gilmour was awarded the Frank J. Selke Trophy.

The next year, Mogilny spent most of the season injured as he underwent major hip surgery. He returned late in the season where he recorded his 1,000th career NHL point in dramatic fashion against the Buffalo Sabres: down 5–2 in the third period, the Leafs completed their comeback when Gary Roberts tipped a Mogilny shot for Mogilny&#x27;s 1,000th career point and the game-tying goal late in the third period. Mogilny then set up Tomáš Kaberle for the thrilling overtime winner immediately after serving a questionable penalty. Despite high expectations for the team that year for a Stanley Cup with many future Hockey Hall of Famers on the roster, they would not have much success in the playoffs. With outstanding performances by goaltender Ed Belfour, Toronto edged the Ottawa Senators in the first round but was eliminated by a physical Philadelphia Flyers team in the second round. Mogilny&#x27;s fourth season with the club was cancelled due to the lockout and he became a free agent in 2005, as the Leafs were unable to afford Mogilny under the new salary cap. On 14 October 2016, the Maple Leafs unveiled their Top 100 greatest players list where Mogilny was ranked as the #83 greatest Maple Leaf of all-time.

===Return to New Jersey===
Recovering over the lockout cancelled 2004–05 season, on 16 August 2005, Mogilny returned to New Jersey Devils after agreeing to a two-year, US$7 million contract. Although he scored 25 points in 34 games, Mogilny&#x27;s chronic hip problem left him as a shadow of his previous self and he was unable to perform at his previous levels. He agreed to play for the Albany River Rats, the Devils&#x27; then-American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, midway through the 2005–06 season for salary cap reasons. His 473 career NHL goals at the time were the most ever for a player entering the AHL. Mogilny finished the year after playing 19 games for the River Rats, but could not gain medical clearance to return to the NHL for the 2006–07 season. He was placed on long-term injury reserve during training camp and retired from professional hockey at the end of the season.

===Post-playing career===
Following his retirement from professional hockey, Mogilny returned to Russia and began consulting for his hometown team, Amur Khabarovsk, in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Admiral Vladivostok of the KHL hired him as its president in 2013. After two seasons with that club, he returned to Khabarovsk to become its president and still holds that title.

===Legacy===
Mogilny was the first Russian to be an NHL captain, first Russian named to the NHL All-Star team and holds the highest single-season goal total and second highest single-season point total for a Russian player. He is (as of the middle of the 2023-24 NHL season) the fourth-highest Russian scorer in the history of the NHL. Mogilny was the second Russian player to reach 1,000 points in the NHL, hitting the milestone just a few days after Sergei Fedorov. His 1992–93 tie with Teemu Selänne of Finland made them the first non-North Americans ever to lead the NHL in goals scored.

In 2016, he was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame but did not attend the ceremony. Despite being widely recognized as one of the best goal-scorers in history, having comparable statistics to recent inductees such as Daniel Alfredsson and Paul Kariya, and being a trailblazer for Russian participation in the NHL, Mogilny has been denied entry into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==International play==
At the 1988 Winter Olympics, Mogilny made his senior debut with the Soviet national team as an 18-year-old in Canada. He played with the full-roster Soviet Union team that won the gold medal.

In the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, Russia had played five preliminary games in order to set the groupings for the main tournament stage. Russia was the only team that went undefeated (winning against Finland (Moscow), Germany (Landshut), Sweden (Stockholm), the United States (Detroit) and tied against Canada (Calgary). The United States, Sweden and Finland games saw the pairing line of &quot;Bure-Fedorov-Mogilny&quot;, for the first and only time internationally at the senior level, and was considered &quot;perhaps the best forward line on earth&quot; at the time. Mogilny and Fedorov played on the same line and both led the team in scoring, but they lost in the semi-finals against the United States after defeating Finland 5–0 in the quarter-finals.

==Player profile==

Former Toronto Maple Leafs captain Mats Sundin once called Mogilny the &quot;best player [he&#x27;s] ever played with&quot;. The two were teammates during Mogilny&#x27;s tenure with the Maple Leafs. Sundin described Mogilny as &quot;gifted, skilled, a natural hockey player, and the best pure goal-scorer he&#x27;s ever seen. The late two-time Jack Adams Award winner and former coach of the Canadian Olympic hockey team, Pat Quinn, called him, &quot;The most talented player that he&#x27;s ever coached.&quot; Mogilny was characterized by Quinn as &quot;[h]aving good size and wonderful skating ability, he can play any kind of game&quot;.

Sergei Fedorov praised him, saying, &quot;Alex was faster than all of us, [Pavel] Bure and Fedorov, and Alex was a machine. He was built like a machine.&quot; &quot;Plus on top of all the crazy skill he had, he’s better than all of us. He’s amazing.&quot; Fedorov said all three players were known for their speed, but Mogilny, in his opinion, was the fastest player of them all. &quot;If you went back and forth five times, (Mogilny) will be first,&quot; Fedorov said. &quot;I will be third.&quot; Igor Larionov, who played with him briefly when Mogilny was a rookie with the Central Army team, was quickly impressed by the young Russian from Khabarovsk. When asked about Mogilny, Larionov said, &quot;He was such a talented guy. Really good with the stick, and smart. He was a natural.&quot; Pat Lafontaine described Mogilny as the &quot;[b]est player [he&#x27;s] seen and played with. I’ve been lucky to play with some great players in my career, but I put Alex as the best player that I had a chance to see and play with talent-wise,&quot; LaFontaine said of his teammate. &quot;He was the rare combination of the speed, the skill and finesse, quickness. He was just the full package.&quot; Lafontaine and Mogilny were linemates during the 1992–93 season and enjoyed remarkable success, as Mogilny scored 76 goals and Lafontaine had 148 points that year. Lafontaine described that year as follows: &quot;There was a sixth sense. We just had an idea of where each other was going to be on the ice. One thing about Alex, he thinks the game at such a high level. His hockey sense and to be able to have the hands and the feet and the speed, he’s that rare combination of everything.&quot; Former long-time New Jersey Devils president Lou Lamoriello once said of Mogilny, &quot;If there was any one player capable of breaking a game open at any given time, he certainly is that. His skating is exceptional. His shot is exceptional.&quot;

Often the offensive catalyst for his line and his team, Mogilny has led his team in scoring various times. As his career progressed and injuries began to mount, he evolved into a cerebral play-maker to generate his offence. Mogilny has always been a strong two-way player thanks to a high level of hockey instincts and a tremendous sense of anticipation. His preferred move on a breakaway is a quick snapshot to catch the goaltender off-guard. The backhand five-hole was also one of Mogilny&#x27;s favourite moves.

<doc id="607275" wikidata="Q1558442" url="?curid=607275" title="Gympie">
<text>Gympie ( ) is a city and a locality in the Gympie Region, Queensland, Australia. Located in the Greater Sunshine Coast, Gympie is about north of the state capital, Brisbane. The city lies on the Mary River, which floods Gympie occasionally. The locality of Gympie is the central business district for the city of Gympie and also the administrative centre for the Gympie Region local government area. In the , Gympie had an urban population of 22,424 people.

Gympie is famous for its gold field. It contains a number of historic buildings registered on the Queensland Heritage Register.

==History==
&quot;Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi)&quot; is an Australian Aboriginal language formerly spoken by the indigenous peoples of the Sunshine Coast Region and Gympie Region, particularly the towns of Caloundra, Noosa Heads, Gympie and extending north towards Maryborough and south to Caboolture&quot;.&quot;

Gympie&#x27;s name derives from the Gubbi Gubbi word &quot;gimpi-gimpi&quot;, which means &quot;stinging tree&quot; and refers to &quot;Dendrocnide moroides&quot;. The tree has large, round leaves that have similar properties to stinging nettles. The city was previously named Nashville, after James Nash, who discovered gold in the area in 1867. The name was changed to Gympie in 1868.
Graziers were the original European settlers. Subsequently, James Nash reported the discovery of &quot;payable&quot; alluvial gold on 16 October 1867. At the time of Nash&#x27;s discovery, Queensland was suffering from a severe economic depression. Nash saved Queensland from bankruptcy. A memorial fountain in Gympie&#x27;s Park honours Nash&#x27;s discovery. The Gympie Gold Rush Festival celebrates the event today. The Gold Rush Festival holds 10 days of cultural events in October. Gold mining still plays a role in the area&#x27;s fortunes, along with agriculture (dairy predominantly), timber and tourism. The gold rush&#x27;s rapid development led to streets that are in an irregular fashion.

Nashville Masonic Lodge opened on 24 March 1869 in Duke Street. The first Master was Edward Henry King, the first goldfield commissioner in Gympie. The lodge later relocated and is now known as Pioneer Lodge, while the Duke Street site became the offices of the Shire of Woocoo.

In 1882, a handful of macadamia seeds was taken from trees in Gympie to Hawaii, where they became the basis of Hawaii&#x27;s macadamia industry. In 2019, researchers collected samples from hundreds of macadamia trees in Queensland, and compared their genetic profiles to samples from Hawaiian orchards. They determined that essentially all the Hawaiian trees must have descended from a small population of Australian trees from Gympie, possibly just a single tree.

Gympie Creek Post Office opened on 1 December 1867. It was renamed Gympie in 1868.

In 1868, a slab hut was built behind the Northumberland Hotel and called the Miner&#x27;s Bethel. This hut was used to hold religious services by the Anglican Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and Methodist Church until each had established its own church.

A Primitive Methodist Church opened on the diggings at Gympie Creek &quot;circa&quot; July 1868. It was claimed to be the first church in Gympie. A new Primitive Methodist Church was opened on Commissioner&#x27;s Hill on Sunday 30 July 1876. Commissioners Hill is described as being from the post office in Duke Street to the corner of Channon and Henry Streets.

A Catholic primary school was established in 1868 by Father. M Horan under lay administration, and was taken over by the Sisters of Mercy in 1880, becoming St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Primary School.

In August 1868, Wesleyan Methodists erected a bark hut of pole construction on Surface Hill to use as a basic chapel. It was replaced by a more permanent timber church on the same site facing Reef Street, which opened on Sunday 4 July 1869. The architect was Charles G. Smith and the builder was John Nesbit. In 1890 a brick church was built on the site facing Channon Street and became the Surface Hill Uniting Church ().

A Presbyterian Church opened on One Mile Road at One Mile on Sunday 8 November 1868.

In 1868, a Cobb &amp; Co. service between Brisbane and Gympie commenced, running twice a week. The changing station stables were located adjacent to the Northumberland Hotel in Channon Street.

In 1869, the Church of England constructed a timber church on the corner of Palantine and School Streets; the first rector was Reverend Henry Jephson Campbell. It was known as the Church of St Peter. This church became the parish hall when a second church was built in Lady Mary Terrace in 1887. This was then superseded by the third and current church, built in brick, on the corner of Lady Mary Terrace and Amy Street ().

One Mile State School was the first school opened in Gympie on 20 September 1869 as One Mile Boys State School with the One Mile Girls and Infants State School opening in October 1874. In January 1943, they were merged into One Mile State School.

Gympie Central Boys State School opened on 18 October 1869 with Gympie Central Girls and Infants State School opening in 1874. In 1899, the Girls and Infants School was separated to become Gympie Central Girls State School and Gympie Central Infants State School. They were amalgamated again in 1912 to become Gympie Central Girls and Infants State School. They were separated again in 1944 re-establishing Gympie Central Infants State School while amalgamating the girls&#x27; school with the boys&#x27; school to become Gympie Central State School. In 1963, the infants&#x27; school amalgamated into Gympie Central State School.

In January 1870, tenders were called for the erection of a Roman Catholic Church.

The railway from Maryborough was completed in 1881. The North Coast railway linked Gympie to Brisbane in 1891.

St Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Church was first established at Mount Pleasant/One Mile in 1876. It closed around 1968. As at 2019, the church building no longer exists, but the rectory in Graham Street had become a private home. In 2020, this was relocated to Gympie and opened on 29 January 1902.The state declared Gympie a town in 1903.

Little Flower School was opened in 1904 by the Christian Brothers as a secondary school for boys. It was later renamed Sacred Heart Memorial College. It closed in 1982 when it was amalgamated with St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Secondary School for Girls to create St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic College.

Gympie South State School opened on 4 July 1910.

Gympie State High School opened on 29 January 1912. This school is one of the oldest state secondary schools in Queensland.

==Traveston Crossing Dam==
The Queensland government had plans to build a dam on the Mary River at Traveston Crossing, about south of Gympie, arguing that the geology is sound and that the South East Queensland region needed greater water security due to climate change and population growth. The project was scrapped in 2010.

The proposed dam would have flooded about 900 properties. The affected land owners and other shire residents staged rallies protesting the proposed dam. Strong opposition to the dam from the wider and international community based on environmental concerns related to the endangered Mary River cod, Mary River turtle, giant barred frog, Cascade tree frog, and Coxen&#x27;s fig parrot and the vulnerable Queensland lungfish, tusked frog, honey blue-eye fish, Richmond birdwing butterfly, and Illidge&#x27;s ant blue butterfly finally shut down the project.

<text>The Onondaga people (Onontaerrhonon, Onondaga: , &quot;People of the Hills&quot;) are one of the five original nations of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy in the Northeastern Woodlands. Their historical homelands are in and around present-day Onondaga County, New York, south of Lake Ontario. 

Being centrally located, they are considered the &quot;Keepers of the Fire&quot; ( in Tuscarora) in the figurative longhouse that shelters the Five Nations. The Cayuga and Seneca have territory to their west and the Oneida and Mohawk to their east. For this reason, the League of the Iroquois historically met at the Iroquois government&#x27;s capital at Onondaga, as the traditional chiefs do today.

In the United States, the home of the Onondaga Nation is the Onondaga Reservation. Onondaga people also live near Brantford, Ontario on Six Nations territory. This reserve used to be Haudenosaunee hunting grounds, but much of the Confederacy relocated there as a result of the American Revolution. Although the British promised the security of Haudenosaunee homelands, the 1783 treaty of Paris ceded the territory over to the United States.

==History==
According to oral tradition, the Great Peacemaker approached the Onondaga and other tribes to found the Haudenosaunee. The tradition tells that at the time the Seneca nation debated joining the Haudenosaunee based on the Great Peacemaker&#x27;s teachings, a solar eclipse took place. The most likely eclipse visible in the area was in 1142 AD.

This oral tradition is supported by archeological studies. Carbon dating of particular sites of Onondaga habitation shows dates starting close to 1200AD ± 60 years with growth for hundreds of years.
In the American Revolutionary War, the Onondaga were at first officially neutral, although individual Onondaga warriors were involved in at least one raid on American settlements. After Americans attacked their main village on April 20, 1779, the Onondaga later sided with the majority of the League and fought against the American colonists in alliance with the British. In 1779, George Washington ordered the termination of the Onondaga people, in an operation known as &quot;The Sullivan Expedition&quot;, breaking the neutrality agreement and devastating the Onondaga people. When the United States won independence, many Onondaga followed Joseph Brant to Upper Canada, where they were given land by the British Crown at Six Nations. 

In the aftermath of the &quot;Sullivan Expedition&quot;, following the brutal winter of 1780, there was a massive swarm of periodical cicadas, which emerge from underground every seventeen years. The sudden arrival of such a large quantity of the insects provided a source of sustenance for the Onondaga people who were experiencing severe food insecurity following the Sullivan campaigns and the subsequent brutal winter. The seemingly miraculous arrival of the cicadas (specifically, Brood VII also known as the Onondaga brood) is commemorated by the Onondaga as though it were an intervention by the Creator to ensure their survival after such a traumatizing, catastrophic event. 

On November 11, 1794, the Onondaga Nation, along with the other Haudenosaunee nations, signed the Treaty of Canandaigua with the United States, in which their right to their homeland was acknowledged by the United States in article II of the treaty.

In 1816, 450 Onondaga were living in New York, 210 of whom lived on Buffalo Creek Reservation.

== Prestige factors ==
The Onondaga Nation was crucial in forming the Iroquois League which led them to be very well revered by their peers. The &quot;Tree of Peace&quot; was planted on Onondaga Land. Onondaga has been regarded as the capital of Iroquois land. The Onondaga were known as the Central Fire-Keepers of the Confederacy. The Onondaga were known as the guardians or watchkeepers of the league. They were keepers of the law in order to preserve traditions and institutions. The culture hero Hyenwatha was an Onondaga Indian and was essential in the early organization of the league. The title of Tadodaho was always held by an Onondaga chief; he was to be the chief arbitrator of the Lords of the Confederacy. The Onondaga maintained the largest number chieftainship titles as well as the largest number of clans among the Iroquois. Handsome Lake, the Seneca half-brother of Cornplanter and author of his eponymous Code, died at Onondaga.

== Customs ==

The Onondaga practice the sprinkling of ashes when juggling the treatment of the sick. They also do a public confession of sins upon a string of wampum (shell beads). The wampum is employed in all matters of public importance. Their funerals were known to be quiet and solemn, with the women covering their faces. There were also special events such as the Planting Feast which would happen in May or when the Onondaga believed the ground was ready. This was three days for penitential and religious services. One day for the children&#x27;s dance, and one each for the Four Persons, the Holder for the Heavens, the Thunder, and for gambling. The Strawberry Feast comes when the berries are ripe. This day there are dancing for the Thunder and a feast of strawberries. The Green Bean Dance comes when the green beans are fit for use. This day there are dances for the Thunder and a mixture of war and feather dances. The Green Corn dance always comes after the Green Bean dance. This day there are three days for religious services, one for the children, one for the Four Persons, one for the Holder of the heavens, and one for the Thunder with the feast. The Onondaga&#x27;s Thanksgiving feast in October closely resembled the Green Corn Dance.

The Onondaga peoples place great emphasis on giving thanks, and this is reflected in their ceremonies. Ceremonial songs would be performed in the longhouse, and danced to in a counter-clockwise direction since this is the life-providing direction of Mother Earth, moon, and stars. The more spirited the singing and dancing, the more thanks is given to the Creator. The Onondaga peoples rely on the lunar calendar for their ceremonies that occur, and there are &quot;faith-keepers&quot; responsible for initiating the ceremonies based on the different moons.

== Culture ==
Some factors that defined pre-colonial Onondaga life were:

* a continued placement of villages on defensive high points away from rivers and the presence of defensive earthen embankments
* a gradual evolution of pottery vessels and smoking pipe forms and decorations
* a gradual evolution of stone and bone tools and implements
* continuity in subsistence systems
* continuity of house forms and inferred communal living
* the continued use of human face motifs
* evidence for bear ceremonialism

==Government==

=== Clan system ===

The Onondaga in New York have a traditional matriachal form of government, wherein chiefs are nominated by clan mothers, rather than elected. One&#x27;s clan is determined by their matrilineal lineage, meaning that clan membership is inherited from the mother. Membership in the Onondaga is also exclusively inherited matrilineally. The clan system extends throughout the Haudenosaunee, and clan members from other nations are considered family. In total there are nine clans:

*wolf
*turtle
*beaver
*snipe
*heron
*deer
*eel
*bear
*hawk

Onondaga peoples believe it is their duty to help and support their clan in tough times, sickness, and death. Interclan marriages are mandatory, so a member of one clan can only marry someone outside of their clan.

===Land===

On March 11, 2005, the Onondaga Nation in the town of Onondaga, New York, filed a land rights action in federal court, seeking acknowledgment of title to over of ancestral lands centering in Syracuse, New York. They hoped to obtain increased influence over environmental restoration efforts at Onondaga Lake and other EPA Superfund sites in the claimed area. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the Onondagas&#x27; claim in 2012, and the Supreme Court in 2013 declined to hear an appeal.

On June 29, 2022, 1,023 acres of land were returned to the Onondaga Nation.

On September 30, 2024, 1,000 acres of land were returned to the Onondaga Nation.

== Sports ==
The Onondaga very much enjoyed sports and physical activity. Lacrosse and foot races were always known to be favorites of the Onondaga people. They also adopted many games from European settlers such as mumble the peg, marbles, some games of ball, pull away, and fox and geese in the snow. Hide and seek and Blind man&#x27;s buff were played but no games with song.

<text>A haplotype (haploid genotype) is a group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent.

Many organisms contain genetic material (DNA) which is inherited from two parents. Normally these organisms have their DNA organized in two sets of pairwise similar chromosomes. The offspring gets one chromosome in each pair from each parent. A set of pairs of chromosomes is called diploid and a set of only one half of each pair is called haploid. The haploid genotype (haplotype) is a genotype that considers the singular chromosomes rather than the pairs of chromosomes. It can be all the chromosomes from one of the parents or a minor part of a chromosome, for example a sequence of 9000 base pairs or a small set of alleles.

Specific contiguous parts of the chromosome are likely to be inherited together and not be split by chromosomal crossover, a phenomenon called genetic linkage. As a result, identifying these statistical associations and a few alleles of a specific haplotype sequence can facilitate identifying &quot;all other such&quot; polymorphic sites that are nearby on the chromosome (imputation). Such information is critical for investigating the genetics of common diseases; which have been investigated in humans by the International HapMap Project.

Other parts of the genome are almost always haploid and do not undergo crossover: for example, human mitochondrial DNA is passed down through the maternal line and the Y chromosome is passed down the paternal line. In these cases, the entire sequence can be grouped into a simple evolutionary tree, with each branch founded by a unique-event polymorphism mutation (often, but not always, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)). Each clade under a branch, containing haplotypes with a single shared ancestor, is called a haplogroup.

==Haplotype resolution==

An organism&#x27;s genotype may not define its haplotype uniquely. For example, consider a diploid organism and two bi-allelic loci (such as SNPs) on the same chromosome. Assume the first locus has alleles &quot;A&quot; or &quot;T&quot; and the second locus &quot;G&quot; or &quot;C&quot;. Both loci, then, have three possible genotypes: (&quot;AA&quot;, &quot;AT&quot;, and &quot;TT&quot;) and (&quot;GG&quot;, &quot;GC&quot;, and &quot;CC&quot;), respectively. For a given individual, there are nine possible configurations (haplotypes) at these two loci (shown in the Punnett square below). For individuals who are homozygous at one or both loci, the haplotypes are unambiguous - meaning that there is not any differentiation of haplotype T1T2 vs haplotype T2T1; where T1 and T2 are labeled to show that they are the same locus, but labeled as such to show it does not matter which order you consider them in, the end result is two T loci. For individuals heterozygous at both loci, the gametic phase is ambiguous - in these cases, an observer does not know which haplotype the individual has, e.g., TA vs AT.

The only unequivocal method of resolving phase ambiguity is by sequencing. However, it is possible to estimate the probability of a particular haplotype when phase is ambiguous using a sample of individuals.

Given the genotypes for a number of individuals, the haplotypes can be inferred by haplotype resolution or haplotype phasing techniques. These methods work by applying the observation that certain haplotypes are common in certain genomic regions. Therefore, given a set of possible haplotype resolutions, these methods choose those that use fewer different haplotypes overall. The specifics of these methods vary - some are based on combinatorial approaches (e.g., parsimony), whereas others use likelihood functions based on different models and assumptions such as the Hardy–Weinberg principle, the coalescent theory model, or perfect phylogeny. The parameters in these models are then estimated using algorithms such as the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM), Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), or hidden Markov models (HMM).

Microfluidic whole genome haplotyping is a technique for the physical separation of individual chromosomes from a metaphase cell followed by direct resolution of the haplotype for each allele.

===Gametic phase===
In genetics, a gametic phase represents the original allelic combinations that a diploid individual inherits from both parents. It is therefore a particular association of alleles at different loci on the same chromosome. Gametic phase is influenced by genetic linkage.

==Y-DNA haplotypes from genealogical DNA tests==
Unlike other chromosomes, Y chromosomes generally do not come in pairs. Every human male (excepting those with XYY syndrome) has only one copy of that chromosome. This means that there is not any chance variation of which copy is inherited, and also (for most of the chromosome) not any shuffling between copies by recombination; so, unlike autosomal haplotypes, there is effectively not any randomisation of the Y-chromosome haplotype between generations. A human male should largely share the same Y chromosome as his father, give or take a few mutations; thus Y chromosomes tend to pass largely intact from father to son,
with a small but accumulating number of mutations that can serve to differentiate male lineages.
In particular, the Y-DNA represented as the numbered results of a Y-DNA genealogical DNA test should match, except for mutations.

===UEP results (SNP results)===

Unique-event polymorphisms (UEPs) such as SNPs represent haplogroups. STRs represent haplotypes. The results that comprise the full Y-DNA haplotype from the Y chromosome DNA test can be divided into two parts: the results for UEPs, sometimes loosely called the SNP results as most UEPs are single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and the results for microsatellite short tandem repeat sequences (Y-STRs).

The UEP results represent the inheritance of events it is believed can be assumed to have happened only once in all human history. These can be used to identify the individual&#x27;s Y-DNA haplogroup, his place in the &quot;family tree&quot; of the whole of humanity. Different Y-DNA haplogroups identify genetic populations that are often distinctly associated with particular geographic regions; their appearance in more recent populations located in different regions represents the migrations tens of thousands of years ago of the direct patrilineal ancestors of current individuals.

===Y-STR haplotypes===

Genetic results also include the Y-STR haplotype, the set of results from the Y-STR markers tested.

Unlike the UEPs, the Y-STRs mutate much more easily, which allows them to be used to distinguish recent genealogy. But it also means that, rather than the population of descendants of a genetic event all sharing the &quot;same&quot; result, the Y-STR haplotypes are likely to have spread apart, to form a &quot;cluster&quot; of more or less similar results. Typically, this cluster will have a definite most probable center, the modal haplotype (presumably similar to the haplotype of the original founding event), and also a haplotype diversity — the degree to which it has become spread out. The further in the past the defining event occurred, and the more that subsequent population growth occurred early, the greater the haplotype diversity will be for a particular number of descendants. However, if the haplotype diversity is smaller for a particular number of descendants, this may indicate a more recent common ancestor, or a recent population expansion.

It is important to note that, unlike for UEPs, two individuals with a similar Y-STR haplotype may not necessarily share a similar ancestry. Y-STR events are not unique. Instead, the clusters of Y-STR haplotype results inherited from different events and different histories tend to overlap.

In most cases, it is a long time since the haplogroups&#x27; defining events, so typically the cluster of Y-STR haplotype results associated with descendants of that event has become rather broad. These results will tend to significantly overlap the (similarly broad) clusters of Y-STR haplotypes associated with other haplogroups. This makes it impossible for researchers to predict with absolute certainty to which Y-DNA haplogroup a Y-STR haplotype would point. If the UEPs are not tested, the Y-STRs may be used only to predict probabilities for haplogroup ancestry, but not certainties.

A similar scenario exists in trying to evaluate whether shared surnames indicate shared genetic ancestry. A cluster of similar Y-STR haplotypes may indicate a shared common ancestor, with an identifiable modal haplotype, but only if the cluster is sufficiently distinct from what may have happened by chance from different individuals who historically adopted the same name independently. Many names were adopted from common occupations, for instance, or were associated with habitation of particular sites. More extensive haplotype typing is needed to establish genetic genealogy. Commercial DNA-testing companies now offer their customers testing of more numerous sets of markers to improve definition of their genetic ancestry. The number of sets of markers tested has increased from 12 during the early years to 111 more recently.

Establishing plausible relatedness between different surnames data-mined from a database is significantly more difficult. The researcher must establish that the &quot;very nearest&quot; member of the population in question, chosen purposely from the population for that reason, would be unlikely to match by accident. This is more than establishing that a &quot;randomly selected&quot; member of the population is unlikely to have such a close match by accident. Because of the difficulty, establishing relatedness between different surnames as in such a scenario is likely to be impossible, except in special cases where there is specific information to drastically limit the size of the population of candidates under consideration.

==Diversity==
Haplotype diversity is a measure of the uniqueness of a particular haplotype in a given population. The haplotype diversity (H) is computed as:&lt;br&gt;
formula_1&lt;br&gt;
where formula_2 is the (relative) haplotype frequency of each haplotype in the sample and formula_3 is the sample size. Haplotype diversity is given for each sample.

== History ==
The term &quot;haplotype&quot; was first introduced by MHC biologist Ruggero Ceppellini during the Third International Histocompatibility Workshop to substitute &quot;pheno-group&quot;.

<doc id="607286" wikidata="Q968548" url="?curid=607286" title="Hilbert's program">
<text>In mathematics, Hilbert&#x27;s program, formulated by German mathematician David Hilbert in the early 1920s, was a proposed solution to the foundational crisis of mathematics, when early attempts to clarify the foundations of mathematics were found to suffer from paradoxes and inconsistencies. As a solution, Hilbert proposed to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of axioms, and provide a proof that these axioms were consistent. Hilbert proposed that the consistency of more complicated systems, such as real analysis, could be proven in terms of simpler systems. Ultimately, the consistency of all of mathematics could be reduced to basic arithmetic.

Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, published in 1931, showed that Hilbert&#x27;s program was unattainable for key areas of mathematics. In his first theorem, Gödel showed that any consistent system with a computable set of axioms which is capable of expressing arithmetic can never be complete: it is possible to construct a statement that can be shown to be true, but that cannot be derived from the formal rules of the system. In his second theorem, he showed that such a system could not prove its own consistency, so it certainly cannot be used to prove the consistency of anything stronger with certainty. This refuted Hilbert&#x27;s assumption that a finitistic system could be used to prove the consistency of itself, and therefore could not prove everything else.

==Statement of Hilbert&#x27;s program==
The main goal of Hilbert&#x27;s program was to provide secure foundations for all mathematics. In particular, this should include:
*A formulation of all mathematics; in other words all mathematical statements should be written in a precise formal language, and manipulated according to well defined rules.
*Completeness: a proof that all true mathematical statements can be proved in the formalism.
*Consistency: a proof that no contradiction can be obtained in the formalism of mathematics. This consistency proof should preferably use only &quot;finitistic&quot; reasoning about finite mathematical objects.
*Conservation: a proof that any result about &quot;real objects&quot; obtained using reasoning about &quot;ideal objects&quot; (such as uncountable sets) can be proved without using ideal objects.
*Decidability: there should be an algorithm for deciding the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement.

==Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems==

Kurt Gödel showed that most of the goals of Hilbert&#x27;s program were impossible to achieve, at least if interpreted in the most obvious way. Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem shows that any consistent theory powerful enough to encode addition and multiplication of integers cannot prove its own consistency. This presents a challenge to Hilbert&#x27;s program:

*It is not possible to formalize all mathematical true statements within a formal system, as any attempt at such a formalism will omit some true mathematical statements. There is no complete, consistent extension of even Peano arithmetic based on a computably enumerable set of axioms.
*A theory such as Peano arithmetic cannot even prove its own consistency, so a restricted &quot;finitistic&quot; subset of it certainly cannot prove the consistency of more powerful theories such as set theory.
*There is no algorithm to decide the truth (or provability) of statements in any consistent extension of Peano arithmetic. Strictly speaking, this negative solution to the Entscheidungsproblem appeared a few years after Gödel&#x27;s theorem, because at the time the notion of an algorithm had not been precisely defined.

==Hilbert&#x27;s program after Gödel==
Many current lines of research in mathematical logic, such as proof theory and reverse mathematics, can be viewed as natural continuations of Hilbert&#x27;s original program. Much of it can be salvaged by changing its goals slightly (Zach 2005), and with the following modifications some of it was successfully completed:
*Although it is not possible to formalize all mathematics, it is possible to formalize essentially all the mathematics that anyone uses. In particular Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, combined with first-order logic, gives a satisfactory and generally accepted formalism for almost all current mathematics.
*Although it is not possible to prove completeness for systems that can express at least the Peano arithmetic (or, more generally, that have a computable set of axioms), it is possible to prove forms of completeness for many other interesting systems. An example of a non-trivial theory for which completeness has been proved is the theory of algebraically closed fields of given characteristic. 
*The question of whether there are finitary consistency proofs of strong theories is difficult to answer, mainly because there is no generally accepted definition of a &quot;finitary proof&quot;. Most mathematicians in proof theory seem to regard finitary mathematics as being contained in Peano arithmetic, and in this case it is not possible to give finitary proofs of reasonably strong theories. On the other hand, Gödel himself suggested the possibility of giving finitary consistency proofs using finitary methods that cannot be formalized in Peano arithmetic, so he seems to have had a more liberal view of what finitary methods might be allowed. A few years later, Gentzen gave a consistency proof for Peano arithmetic. The only part of this proof that was not clearly finitary was a certain transfinite induction up to the ordinal ε0. If this transfinite induction is accepted as a finitary method, then one can assert that there is a finitary proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic. More powerful subsets of second-order arithmetic have been given consistency proofs by Gaisi Takeuti and others, and one can again debate about exactly how finitary or constructive these proofs are. (The theories that have been proved consistent by these methods are quite strong, and include most &quot;ordinary&quot; mathematics.)
*Although there is no algorithm for deciding the truth of statements in Peano arithmetic, there are many interesting and non-trivial theories for which such algorithms have been found. For example, Tarski found an algorithm that can decide the truth of any statement in analytic geometry (more precisely, he proved that the theory of real closed fields is decidable). Given the Cantor–Dedekind axiom, this algorithm can be regarded as an algorithm to decide the truth of any statement in Euclidean geometry. This is substantial as few people would consider Euclidean geometry a trivial theory.

<text>Bill Mathis (December 10, 1938 – October 20, 2020) was an American professional football player who was a running back for the New York Titans/Jets in the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the Clemson Tigers. He also competed on the Clemson Tigers track and field team. He started his professional career with the Titans, and played his entire career with the AFL&#x27;s New York franchise. One of four Titans who remained with the New York Jets to play in and win a Super Bowl, Mathis led the AFL in carries in 1961 and was selected by his peers to the Sporting News 1961 AFL All-League team. He was an AFL Eastern Division All-Star in 1961 and 1963. Mathis had a collarbone broken in the third game of 1961, against the Boston Patriots. He played in the next game, and in fact in all the remaining games of the season.

That persistence allowed him to gain a roster spot year after year, and end his career in 1969 after winning Super Bowl III. He is one of twenty players who were in the AFL for its entire ten-year existence, and seven players who played their entire AFL careers for one franchise. He was inducted into the Clemson University Hall of Fame, South Carolina Hall of Fame, and the Georgia Hall of Fame.

After retiring from football, Mathis began a career on Wall Street, starting at the firm Cogan, Berlind, Weill &amp; Levitt.

<doc id="607291" wikidata="Q2018133" url="?curid=607291" title="Three (TV channel)">
<text>Three (), stylised as +HR=E, is a New Zealand nationwide television channel. Launched on 26 November 1989 as TV3, it was New Zealand&#x27;s first privately owned television channel. The channel currently broadcasts nationally (with regional advertising targeting four markets) in digital free-to-air form via the state-owned Kordia on terrestrial and satellite. Vodafone also carries the channel for their cable subscribers in Wellington and Christchurch. It previously broadcast nationally on analogue television until that was switched off on 1 December 2013.

Three is a general entertainment channel owned by Warner Bros. Discovery New Zealand, with a significant news and current affairs element under the banner of ThreeNews. Three carries a significant amount of local content, most of which airs at prime-time.

==History==
===Establishment===
Applications to apply for warrants to operate New Zealand&#x27;s third national television network opened in early 1985 and closed on 29 March 1985. There were four regional channel warrants - Region 1 serving Auckland and Northland, Region 2 serving Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Region 3 serving Wellington, Manawatu and Taranaki, and Region 4 serving the South Island. Applicants for the warrants included Aotearoa Broadcasting System, Civic Enterprises (region 4 only), Energy Source Television Network, Impact Television, On-Shore Services (region 1 only), Southern Cross Television (except region 2), Tele-Vid Three group, and United Telecast Corporation (region 2 only). Hearings began in August 1985.

The Broadcasting Tribunal announced in August 1987 that the Tele-Vid Three group (TV3) had been awarded all four warrants. The four channels would be based in Auckland, Tauranga, Wellington and Christchurch, with a jointly-owned national news and current affairs service and a national advertising service. TV3 was proposed to launch in early 1989, with broadcasts initially covering 80 percent of the population.

There were numerous delays to the launch date of TV3. Litigation surrounded the granting of the warrant, as did the share market crash in October 1987, which wiped out a large proportion of the capital that TV3 required to establish the channel. These problems resulted in the ambitious regional plans being rationalised before being shelved completely. The network was to be based in Auckland with limited studios and news and sales teams in the other main centres. TV3 expected to take 30% of the television advertising revenue, rising to 36% by 1994.

TV3 began broadcasting on Sunday 26 November 1989 at 8:00 pm with Governor-General Paul Reeves officially launching the station. This was followed by a two-hour special previewing the network&#x27;s programmes, featuring comedians David McPhail and Jon Gadsby playing cameramen. TV3&#x27;s initial slogan proclaimed &#x27;Come Home to the Feeling&#x27;; a derivative of the &#x27;Come Home to the Best, Only on NBC&#x27; slogan used by NBC in the United States at the time. At launch, TV3 could be received by an estimated 55 percent of the population, in Auckland, Waikato, Western Bay of Plenty, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

Regular broadcasts began the following day, Monday 27 November 1989, at 7:00 am. The first day&#x27;s programme schedule was as follows:
* 7:00am − &quot;The Early Bird Show,&quot; with news and weather at 7:00am, 7:30am, 8:00am, 8:30am and 9:00am with Joanna Paul.

One of the financial supporters of TV3 in its early life was America&#x27;s NBC (through NBC International Ltd), taking 14.9% of TV3&#x27;s shares and had the biggest and effectively controlling interest. Existing laws forbade foreign ownership beyond the 15% level, what TV3 considers as &quot;the main block to sell&quot; itself. NBC sold the stake when TV3 was into receivership in May 1990; by this time the share was at 16.4%.

Despite breaking TVNZ&#x27;s monopoly, TV3 had found itself in an uphill struggle. Its current affairs programmes and sports programmes were axed due to disappointing ratings and poor advertising income. Its staff were also laid off. It also had to face competition with the then-new Sky Network Television. TV3 was ready for any ratings battle.

===Westpac ownership===
TV3 failed to gain ground against a recently revitalised TVNZ and was placed into receivership on 2 May 1990. TV3 continued to broadcast with the major creditor, Westpac, supporting the network by taking a large shareholding. TV3 was delisted from the New Zealand Stock Exchange in December 1990 because it could afford to meet listing requirements. Its board of directors had lost their confidence when TV3 was into receivership.

As TV3 needed investment during a climate of economic recession, the government liberalised the rules on foreign ownership of television stations (raising the 15 percent cap to 49 percent and later removing all restrictions), allowing TV3 to search for an investor overseas. In December 1991, Canwest took a 20 percent shareholding in TV3 and secured a management agreement allowing it full control to operate the station. Canwest introduced tighter controls on budgets while targeting the lucrative 18- to 49-year-old audience. TV3&#x27;s audience share and advertising revenue steadily increased, leading to significant profits. TV3 also steadily increased its coverage within New Zealand, adding dozens of transmitters and translators, often with the assistance of New Zealand On Air. By 1998 about 97 percent of the population could receive the channel.

On 2 October 1996, TV3 announced a reshuffling of its broadcast frequencies to enable it to launch a new network, to be called TV4 Network Limited, on the VHF band. TV4, which started on 29 June 1997, is a free-to-air network aimed at a younger audience than TV3. The launch was considered successful, with high brand recognition and ratings significantly higher than MTV, TV4&#x27;s television rival. TV4&#x27;s opening broadcast was the controversial Tyson–Holyfield boxing rematch.

===Canwest ownership===
In April 1997 Canwest purchased Westpac&#x27;s 48 percent shareholding in TV3, taking Canwest&#x27;s stake to 68 percent. In June Canwest picked up the More FM Radio network, followed in November with the purchase of the remaining 32 percent of TV3. In April 1998, Canwest announced that it had made Can$22 million in the six months to February 1998 in New Zealand, up a third on the same period the year before. TV4 contributed positively to the result, with some of the increase due to the inclusion of More FM, while TV3 was continuing to experience strong revenue growth.

In September 1999, the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) upheld a complaint over TV3&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; story &quot;Sex, Lies and Videotape&quot; in June 1998. The story received twelve complaints and was upheld on the grounds of privacy, viewpoints on controversial Issues, accuracy, fairness and responsible programming. The BSA ordered TV3 to pay $100,000 in costs, to broadcast statements on-air regarding the upheld complaint, and the channel was banned from showing advertising between 6:00pm and 8:30pm on 10 October 1999.

Canwest&#x27;s investments in New Zealand had developed considerably in New Zealand over the period that it had interests in the country. TV4 continued to be a source of concern for the broadcaster, but the position of TV3 was strengthened by alliances with Sky Television for sport and a series of high-profile mistakes by TVNZ as it dealt with the dominance of Sky in pay television. The election of the Labour government in 1999 refocused TVNZ as a semi-non-commercial broadcaster, no longer ratings-driven and no longer attempting to dominate the free to air television market. As a commercial broadcaster, TV3 was in a position to take advantage of TVNZ&#x27;s change of focus.

During 2004 the station was transferred into the ownership of Canwest MediaWorks (NZ) as a way of listing 30 percent of the Canadian company&#x27;s New Zealand assets on the New Zealand share market. TV3&#x27;s parent company TVWorks announced its annual revenue at $124 million in October 2004, which was $13 million up from the previous financial year.

===MediaWorks ownership===
In May 2007 it was announced that Ironbridge Capital, an Australian private equity firm, was paying $386 million or $2.43 a share for the 70 percent of CanWest MediaWorks (NZ) owned by CanWest Global Communications. It was also offering the same price to minority shareholders under a full takeover bid.

On 1 April 2008, TV3 became the first New Zealand television network to introduce high-definition television, to coincide with the launch of Freeview HD and MySky HDi in New Zealand. The first programme to broadcast in true 1080i high definition (i.e. not upscaled) was that night&#x27;s screening of &quot;Boston Legal&quot;.

On 17 June 2013 the parent company of TV3 went into receivership, this being the second receivership for TV3. When TV3&#x27;s parent company MediaWorks was purchased by Ironbridge Capital they took on $700 million of debt which could no longer be sustained. Following the receivership TV3 and the radio stations owned by MediaWorks remained on air and all staff have retained their jobs. Shares in the company were gradually and completely bought out by US hedge fund Oaktree Capital Management.

Since 3 July 2016, with the closure of sister channel Four, some of its programming, such as Sticky TV, moved over to TV3 in a new daytime lineup.

On 9 February 2017, TV3 underwent a major re-branding, changing its name to Three and adopting a new logo and on-air imaging. The new brand was promoted as being &quot;vibrant, playful, and inspiring&quot;; chief content officer Andrew Szusterman explained that TV3 as a brand had not evolved with its programming, and that &quot;a channel this strong, with content this strong, should be bigger than the sum of its parts and it should represent the content itself whereas the pieces of content were living in isolation.&quot; The new imaging was widely criticised by viewers, particularly the unusual design and stylization of its new logo as &quot;+HR=E&quot;.

A second sister channel, ThreeLife, was launched on 15 April 2018.

On 18 October 2019, MediaWorks announced Three was for sale.

On 25 March 2020, ThreeLife and ThreeLife + 1 went off air, and were replaced by the return of The Edge TV and new channel Breeze TV.

===Discovery Inc./Warner Bros. Discovery ownership===

In early September 2020, MediaWorks confirmed that it would be selling its television media assets, which include Three, to U.S.-based Discovery, Inc. The acquisition was completed on 1 December 2020.

In April 2022, Discovery merged with WarnerMedia to form Warner Bros. Discovery. As a result, Discovery New Zealand and its assets including Three and Newshub became part of the new media company. The Edge TV and The Breeze TV were both discontinued in December 2022, to be replaced with Eden, Edent+1 and Rush.

In late February 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery proposed eliminating Three&#x27;s news service Newshub, effective 1 July 2024, citing declining advertising revenue. Newshub&#x27;s closure was confirmed on 10 April 2024, with 5 July being its final airdate. On 16 April, Warner Bros. Discovery and newspaper company Stuff reached an agreement for Stuff to produce Three&#x27;s 6pm news bulleting, commencing 6 July 2024.

On 7 May, Stuff announced that seven former Newshub journalists including Samantha Hayes, Jenna Lynch, Laura Tupou, Ollie Ritchie, Juliet Speedy, Zane Small and Heather Keats would produce Stuff&#x27;s 6pm news bulletin and other news content.

===Output contracts===
Mediaworks acquired a first-run and re-run contract with HD sourced material for 20th Century Fox Television content (which includes films under the brands 20th Century Fox, DreamWorks Animation – 2008 to present, Fox Atomic, Fox Searchlight Pictures, Icon Films – 2007 to 2012, now belongs to Prime Television New Zealand and Regency Enterprises), which was previously held by TVNZ. When TVNZ outbid them for their previous Disney Media Distribution contract. In 2015, they had the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for more recent films.

Exclusive contracts with CBS News, ITV News, and Seven News for international news coverage.

Mediaworks has long held first-option contracts with NBC Universal (which includes films under the brands Focus Features and Universal Pictures) with select HD material from February 2011. As well as until the start of the US 2012 season, a first-option contract with CBS Television Distribution (which included films under the brands Paramount Pictures and non-animated DreamWorks Pictures) with select HD material from the end of 2012, this deal came to an end for new content from the start of 2013. From mid-2013, TV3 secured a first option deal with Sony Pictures Television for new content for TV series and movies that will be scheduled for late 2013 and the 2014 season. This deal signals a move away from the more expensive exclusive Fox deal, which is still under re-negotiation following the broadcaster&#x27;s change in ownership.

On 20 December 2013, MediaWorks re-signed a revised down scaled exclusive deal with Fox. As a result of their receivership, they lost their first-option rights over NBCUniversal shows, which resulted in TVNZ acquiring the rights to &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; in 2014. They also lost their rights to air 20th Television programmes, which resulted in Prime airing &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, and TVNZ airing &quot;Empire&quot;.

==Broadcasting details==
From launch in November 1989 until digital television transition was completed on 1 December 2013, TV3 broadcast terrestrially using the analogue PAL-B&amp;G. In some areas, TV3&#x27;s analogue broadcast was on a different transmitter from TV One and TV2&#x27;s analogue broadcasts, and viewers needed an additional antenna to pick up the channel; these included Hamilton, Tauranga, Taupo, Gisborne, Kapiti, Masterton, and Nelson.

Three is a broadcasting member of the Freeview platform as well as broadcasting on Sky. TV3 began screening widescreen transmissions on both platforms on 11 April 2007, although TelstraClear InHomeTV which got most of its content from Sky, switched back to screening the cropped version of TV3 for a couple of months due to non-widescreen customer complaints. TelstraClear resumed broadcasting the widescreen version of TV3 on 24 July 2007. In April 2008 TV3 commenced 1080i high definition broadcasts on the Freeview terrestrial platform and on Sky&#x27;s HD satellite platform.

Three also broadcasts a livestream of the Auckland feed on its ThreeNow website and app.

<text>Alexander Michael Somlyay (born 18 January 1946) is a former Australian politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1990 to 2013, representing the Queensland seat of Fairfax for the Liberal Party. He briefly held ministerial office in the Howard government as Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government from 1997 to 1998.

==Early life==
Somlyay was born on 18 January 1946 in Budapest, Hungary. He is of Hungarian-Jewish descent; he and his parents arrived in Australia in 1949 as stateless persons, with his parents having been stripped of their Hungarian citizenship during World War II. In the early 1990s he renounced any claim to Hungarian citizenship in accordance with section 44(i) of the Australian constitution, in advance of a new Hungarian law that would have granted citizenship retrospectively.

Somlyay joined the Commonwealth Public Service in 1963 and worked for several different departments. He completed the degree of Bachelor of Economics in 1975 at the Australian National University (ANU). He later moved to the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, where he was a consultant economist and company director.

==Politics==
Somlyay was senior private secretary to National Country Party MP Evan Adermann from 1976 to 1980. He later joined the Liberal Party and was chair of its Maroochydore branch.

At the 1990 federal election, Somlyay won the seat of Fairfax for the Liberal Party following Adermann&#x27;s retirement. He defeated high-profile Nationals shadow minister John Stone, who was attempting to transfer to the House of Representatives from the Senate. His campaign targeted Stone as an outsider who would not make a suitable local member.

Somlyay was a member of the informal conservative faction the Lyons Forum when it was active in the 1990s. He held junior portfolios in John Hewson&#x27;s shadow ministry from 1992 to 1994, as secretary to the shadow cabinet and shadow parliamentary secretary to the leader of the opposition. In 1997 he was appointed Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government in the Howard government, following a ministerial reshuffle. He was not retained in the ministry after the 1998 federal election.

Somlyay chaired a number of committees during his parliamentary tenure and was chief opposition whip in the House of Representatives from 2008 to 2010. Following the 2010 federal election, at which the Australian Labor Party (ALP) retained office at the head of a minority government, he publicly announced that he would stand for deputy speaker of the House of Representatives with the endorsement of the ALP. His announcement was controversial as the position is typically held by a member of the governing party and he stated that he would support the government on confidence and supply. However, Somlyay subsequently withdrew his candidacy for the position.

In September 2010 Somlyay announced that he would not stand for re-election at the next federal election. In his valedictory speech to parliament in June 2013 he stated that his political career had been affected by a range of health issues including &quot;a stroke in 1993 followed by two lots of heart bypass surgeries, seven angioplasties, a pacemaker, diabetes and cancer&quot;.

===Expenses investigation===
An investigation by a Fairfax Media reporter published in the Sydney Morning Herald in January 2014 alleged that Somlyay had used his parliamentary office to pay his wife almost seventy thousand dollars for the year 2012-13 &quot;for non-existent work in his electorate office.&quot; The report also alleged that Somlyay had obscured his wife&#x27;s identity in his list of employed staff. Somlyay defended the payments from his taxpayer-funded budget to his wife, claiming that he had done nothing wrong. On February of the same year, the &quot;Herald&quot; again reported that the Australian Federal Police had found nothing that &quot;would constitute a criminal offence&quot; related to the employment of his wife and closed the investigation.

<text>Merrow (from Irish &#x27;, [[Middle Irish]]&#x27; or &quot;&quot;) is a mermaid or merman in Irish folklore. The term is anglicised from the Irish word murúch.

The merrows supposedly require a magical cap (; anglicised: cohuleen druith) in order to travel between deep water and dry land.

==Overview==
The term appears in two tales set in Ireland published in the 19th century: &quot;Lady of Gollerus&quot;, where a green-haired merrow weds a local Kerry man who deprives her of the &quot;magical red cap&quot; (&quot;&quot;); and &quot;The Soul Cages&quot; where a green-bodied grotesque male merrow entertains a fisherman at his home under the sea.

These tales with commentary were first published in T. C. Croker&#x27;s &quot;Fairy Legends&quot; (1828). William Butler Yeats and others writing on the subject borrowed heavily from this work. &quot;The Soul Cages&quot; turned out not to be a genuine folktale, but rather a piece of fiction fabricated by Thomas Keightley.

A number of other terms in Irish are used to denote a mermaid or sea-nymph, some tracing back to mythological tracts from the medieval to the post-medieval period. The Middle Irish &#x27; is a siren-like creature encountered by legendary ancestors of the Irish (either Goidels or Milesians) according to the &quot;Book of Invasions&quot;. This, as well as &#x27; and &#x27; are terms for the mermaid that appear in onomastic tales of the &#x27;. A &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;sea-wanderer&quot;, is the term for the mermaid .

==Etymology==
Current scholarship regards &quot;merrow&quot; as a Hiberno-English term, derived from Irish &#x27; (Middle Irish &#x27; or &quot;&quot;) meaning &quot;sea singer&quot; or &quot;siren&quot;. But this was not the derivation given by 19th century writers.

According to Croker, &quot;merrow&quot; was a transliteration of modern Irish &#x27; or &#x27;, which resolved into &#x27; &quot;sea&quot; + &#x27; &quot;maid&quot;. This &quot;Gaelic&quot; word could also denote &quot;sea monster&quot;, and Croker remarked that it was cognate with Cornish &#x27;, a &quot;sea hog&quot;. Yeats added &#x27; as an alternative original, as that word is also synonymous with mermaid.

The corresponding term in the Scots dialect is &quot;, derived from the Irish, with no original Scottish Gaelic form suggested.

The Middle Irish &#x27;, (from &#x27; + &quot; &quot;chant, song&quot;) with its singing melodies that held sway over seamen was more characteristic of the sirens of classical mythology, and was imported into Irish literature via Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

==Synonyms==
The terms &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27; been listed as synonymous to &quot;mermaid&quot; or &quot;sea nymph&quot;. These are Old or Middle Irish words, and usage are attested in medieval tracts. Other modern Irish terms for mermaid are given in O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s dictionary (1864); one of them, &#x27; (&quot;sea-maiden&quot;), being the common term for &quot;mermaid&quot; in Irish today (cf. de Bhaldraithe&#x27;s dictionary, 1959).

The term &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;sea-wanderer&quot;, has been applied, among other uses, to , a legendary figure who underwent metamorphosis into a salmon-woman.

Strictly speaking, the term &#x27; in the &#x27; example signifies &quot;mermaid&#x27;s melody&quot;. However, O&#x27;Clery&#x27;s Glossary explains that this was rhetorically the &quot;name of the nymphs that are in the sea&quot;. The term &#x27; for &quot;mermaid&quot; also finds instance in the &#x27;. Croker also vaguely noted that &quot;&quot; has been used by &quot;romantic historians&quot; in reference to the &quot;sea-nymphs&quot; enountered by Milesian ships.

==Folk tales==
Thomas Crofton Croker&#x27;s Second Volume to the &quot;Fairy Legends&quot; (1828) laid the groundwork for the folkloric treatment of the merrow. It was immediately translated into German by the Brothers Grimm. Croker&#x27;s material on the merrow was to a large measure rehashed by such authors on the fairy-kind as Thomas Keightley, John O&#x27;Hanlon, and the poet William Butler Yeats. A general sketch of the merrow pieced together by such 19th century authors are as follows.

===Characteristics===
The merrow-maiden is like the commonly stereotypical mermaid: half-human, a gorgeous woman from waist up, and fish-like waist down, her lower extremity &quot;covered with greenish-tinted scales&quot; (according to O&#x27;Hanlon). She has green hair which she fondly grooms with her comb. She exhibits slight webbing between her fingers, a white and delicate film resembling &quot;the skin between egg and shell&quot;.

Said to be of &quot;modest, affectionate, gentle, and [benevolent] disposition&quot;, the merrow is believed &quot;capable of attachment to human beings&quot;, with reports of inter-marriage. One such mixed marriage took place in Bantry, producing descendants marked by &quot;scaly skin&quot; and &quot;membrane between fingers and toes&quot;. But after some &quot;years in succession&quot; they will almost inevitably return to the sea, their &quot;natural instincts&quot; irresistibly overcoming any love-bond they may have formed with their terrestrial family. And to prevent her acting on impulse, her &quot;&quot; (or &quot;little magic cap&quot;) must be kept &quot;well concealed from his sea-wife&quot;.

O&#x27;Hanlon mentioned that a merrow may leave her outer skin behind in order to transform into other beings &quot;more magical and beauteous&quot;, But in Croker&#x27;s book, this characteristic isn&#x27;t ascribed to the merrow but to the merwife of Shetlandic and Faroese lore, said to shed their seal-skins to shapeshift between human form and a seal&#x27;s guise (i.e., the selkie and its counterpart, the &quot;&quot;). Another researcher noted that the Irish merrow&#x27;s device was her cap &quot;covering her entire body&quot;, as opposed to the Scottish Maid-of-the-Wave who had her salmon-skin.

Yeats claimed that merrows come ashore transformed into &quot;little hornless cows&quot;. One stymied investigator conjectured this claim to be an extrapolation on Kennedy&#x27;s statement that sea-cows are attracted to pasture on the meadowland wherever the merrow resided.

Merrow-maidens have also been known to lure young men beneath the waves, where afterwards the men live in an enchanted state. While female merrows were considered to be very beautiful, the mermen were thought to be very ugly. This fact potentially accounted for the merrow&#x27;s desire to seek out men on the land.

Merrow music is known to be heard coming from the farthest depths of the ocean, yet the sound travels floatingly across the surface. Merrows dance to the music, whether ashore on the strand or upon the wave.

===Merrow-men===
While most stories about merrow are about female creatures, a tale about an Irish merman does exist in the form of &quot;The Soul Cages&quot;, published in Croker&#x27;s anthology. In it, a merman captured the souls of drowned sailors and locked them in cages (lobster pot-like objects) under the sea. This tale turned out to be an invented piece of fiction (an adaptation of a German folktale), although Thomas Keightley who acknowledged the fabrication claimed that by sheer coincidence, similar folktales were indeed to be found circulated in areas of counties Cork and Wicklow.

The male merrow in the story, called Coomara (meaning &quot;sea-hound&quot;), has green hair and teeth, pig-like eyes, a red nose, grows a tail between his scaly legs, and has stubby fin-like arms. Commentators, starting with Croker and echoed by O&#x27;Hanlon and Yeats after him, stated categorically that this description fitted male merrows in general, and ugliness ran generally across the entire male populace of its kind, the red nose possibly attributable to their love of brandy.

The &quot;merrow&quot; which signifies &quot;sea maiden&quot; is an awkward term when applied to the male, but has been in use for a lack of a term in Irish dialect for &quot;merman&quot;. One scholar has insisted the term &quot;macamore&quot; might be used as the Irish designation for merman, since it means literally &quot;son of the sea&quot;, on authority of Patrick Kennedy, though the latter merely glosses &quot;macamore&quot; as designating local inhabitants of the County Wexford coast. Gaelic (Irish) words for mermen are &#x27; &quot;mermaid-man&quot; or &#x27; &quot;man of the sea&quot;.

===Cohuleen druith===
Merrows wear a special hat called a &quot;&quot;, which enables them to dive beneath the waves. If they lose this cap, it is said that they will lose their power to return beneath the water.

The normalized spelling in Irish is &#x27;, literally &quot;little magic hood&quot; (&#x27; &quot;cowl, hood, hooded cloak&quot; + &#x27; diminutive suffix + gen. of &#x27;). This rendering is echoed by Kennedy who glosses this object as &quot;nice little magic cap&quot;.

Arriving at a different reconstruction, Croker believed that it denoted a hat in the a particular shape of a matador&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, or in less exotic terms, &quot;a strange looking thing like a cocked hat&quot;, to quote from the tale &quot;The Lady of Gollerus&quot;. A submersible &quot;cocked hat&quot; also figures in the invented merrow-man tale &quot;The Soul Cages.&quot;

The notion that the &#x27; is a hat &quot;covered with feathers&quot;, stated by O&#x27;Hanlon and Yeats arises from taking Croker too literally. Croker did point out that the merrow&#x27;s hat shared something in common with &quot;feather dresses of the ladies&quot; in two &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tales. However, he did not mean the merrow&#x27;s hat had feathers on them. As other commentators have point out, what Croker meant was that both contained the motif of a supernatural woman who is bereft of the article of clothing and is prevented from escaping her captor. This is commonly recognized as the &quot;feather garment&quot; motif in swan maiden-type tales. The &quot;&quot; was also considered to be of red color by Yeats, although this is not indicated by his predecessors such as Croker.

An analogue to the &quot;mermaid&#x27;s cap&quot; is found in an Irish tale of a supernatural wife who emerged from the freshwater Lough Owel in Westmeath, Ireland. She was found to be wearing a salmon-skin cap that glittered in the moonlight. A local farmer captured her and took her to be his bride, bearing him children, but she disappeared after discovering her cap while rummaging in the household. Although this &quot;fairy mistress&quot; is not from the sea, one Celticist identifies her as a &quot;&quot; (sea-maiden) nevertheless.

The Scottish counterpart to the merrow&#x27;s cap was a &quot;removable&quot; skin, &quot;like the skin of a salmon, but brighter and more beautiful, and very large&quot;, worn by the Maid-of-the-wave. It was called in Scottish Gaelic &quot;cochull&quot;, glossed as &#x27;slough&#x27; and &quot;meaning apparently a scaly tail which comes off to reveal human legs&quot;, though it should be mentioned that a &quot;cochull&quot; in the first instance denotes a piece of garment over the head, a hood-cape.

The &quot;fishtail-skin&quot; mermaid folklore (as well as that of &quot;seal-skin&quot; seal-woman/selkie) are found all over the Irish and Scottish coasts.

==Medieval writings==
It did not escape the notice of 19th century folklorists that attestations of &quot;&quot; occur in Irish medieval and post-medieval literature, although they have been somewhat imprecise in specifying their textual sources.

Croker&#x27;s remark that &quot;the romantic historians of Ireland&quot; depicted &#x27; (synonym of merrow) playing round the ships of the Milesians actually leads to the &quot;Book of Invasions&quot;, which recounts siren-like &#x27; encountered by legendary ancestors of the Irish people while migrating across the Caspian Sea. O&#x27;Hanlon&#x27;s disclosure of &quot;an old tract, contained in the Book of Lecain [&quot;sic&quot;]&quot; about the king of the Fomorians encountering them in the Ictian Sea is a tale in the &quot;&quot;.

The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; (17th cent.), an amalgamation of earlier annals, has an entry for the year 887 that reports that a mermaid was cast ashore on the coast of Scotland (Alba). She was in length and had hair long; her fingers were long as was her nose, while she was as white as a swan.

The &quot;Four Masters&quot; also records an entry under year 558 for the capture of as a mermaid; the same event (the capture of the &quot;sea lunatic&quot; , which is &#x27;s nickname) is recorded in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; for the year 571.

===Invasions of Ireland===
The medieval &#x27; (&quot;The Book of Invasions&quot;) relates how a band of Goidels on a migratory voyage were stalled on the Caspian Sea by &#x27; (translated as &quot;sirens&quot; by Macalister) who lulled them to sleep with their songs. Wax ear-plugs for the shipmates prescribed by Caicher the Druid proved to be an effective .

Even though Caicher the Druid is present in either case, different sets of voyagers, generationally-shifted from each other are engaged in actions with the sirens, depending on the variant text groups. In the First Redaction of &quot;, the Goidels settled in Scythia embarking on an exodus, led by men such as were the ones upon which the sirens wreaked havoc, while in the Second and Third Redactions, their the Milesians led by met the same fate.

These &quot; resemble sirens defeated by Odysseus to such a degree, &quot;Homeric influence&quot; is plainly evident.

The medieval scribes of &#x27; eschewed physical descriptions. However, Michael O&#x27;Clery&#x27;s 17th century recension of the &quot;Book of Invasions&quot; interpolated a decidedly half-fish half-female depiction of the &#x27; in his copy of the &quot;&quot;:

In this wise are those seamonsters, with the form of a woman from their navels upwards, excelling every female form in beauty and shapeliness, with light yellow hair down over their shoulders; but fishes are they from their navels downwards. They sing a musical ever-tuneful song to the crews of the ships that sail near them, so that they fall into the stupor of sleep in listening to them; they afterwards drag the crews of the ships towards them when they find them thus asleep, and so devour them... 

=== Dindsenchas ===
There are tales featuring Irish mermaids in the &#x27;, collections of onomastic tales explaining the origins of place names. One tale explains how the demise of Roth son of Cithang by mermaids (&#x27;) in the Ictian sea (English Channel) gave birth to the name (now County Waterford). &quot;Port of the Thigh&quot; it came to be called where his thigh washed ashore. The mermaids here are described as beautiful maidens except for their hill-sized &quot;hairy-clawed bestial lower part&quot; below water. While one text group only goes as far as to say the mermaids dismembered Roth, alternate texts says that they devoured him, so that only the thigh bone drifted ashore.

Thus, like the mermaids in O&#x27;Clery&#x27;s version, the half-beautiful mermaids here sang sleep-inducing &quot;burdens&quot; or musical refrains, tore their victims apart, and ate them. Whitley Stokes noted that the description of mermaids here coincides with the description of sirens in the &quot;, or rather the medieval European bestiaries, particularly that of .

There are several onomastic tales which attempts to explain the name origin of (Assaroe Falls), one of which involves mermaid music (&quot;). It purports a woman named Ruad who rowed out to the estuary was lulled to sleep by the &quot;mermaid&#x27;s melody&quot; and drowned in the spot, which received its name after her.

The of (estuary of Delvin River, County Dublin) is counted as a mermaid tale, though no &quot;mermaid&quot; term specifically occurs. Nine women dwelling in the sea held immobilized the fleet of three ships led by son of , a grandson of the king of the people. Rúad lay with the beautiful women, but he made an empty promise to carry on their tryst. The women arrived by boat to exact vengeance on Rúad, but frustrated, slew two of his sons instead, including the child one of them had borne. The episode is also embedded in the story &quot;The Wooing of Emer&quot; of the Ulster Cycle.

<text>Man of Sorrows, a biblical term, is paramount among the prefigurations of the Messiah identified by the Bible in the passages of Isaiah 53 (&quot;Servant songs&quot;) in the Hebrew Bible. It is also an iconic devotional image that shows Christ, usually naked above the waist, with the wounds of his Passion prominently displayed on his hands and side (the &quot;ostentatio vulnerum&quot;, a feature of other standard types of image), often crowned with the Crown of Thorns and sometimes attended by angels. It developed in Europe from the 13th century and was especially popular in Northern Europe.

The image continued to spread and develop iconographical complexity until well after the Renaissance, but the Man of Sorrows in its many artistic forms is the most precise visual expression of the piety of the later Middle Ages, which took its character from mystical contemplation rather than from theological speculation. Together with the &quot;Pietà&quot;, it was the most popular of the Andachtsbilder-type images of the period – devotional images detached from the narrative of Christ&#x27;s Passion, intended for meditation.

The Latin term &quot;Christus dolens&quot; (&quot;suffering Christ&quot;) is sometimes used for this depiction. The &quot;Pensive Christ&quot; is a similar depiction, and the usual composition of the &quot;Mass of Saint Gregory&quot; includes a vision of the &quot;Man of Sorrows&quot;.

== Biblical narrative ==
The phrase translated into English as &quot;Man of Sorrows&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;’îš maḵ’ōḇōṯ&quot; in the Hebrew Bible, &quot;vir dolōrum&quot; in the Vulgate) occurs at verse 3 (in Isaiah 53):

3) He is despised and rejected of men, a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.
4) Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
5) But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed.
6) All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.

==Development of the image==
The image developed from the Byzantine epitaphios image, which possibly dates back to the 8th century. A miraculous Byzantine mosaic icon of it is known as the Imago Pietatis or &quot;Christ of Pity&quot;. The work appears to have been brought to the major pilgrimage church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome in the 12th century. Only replicas of the original work now survive. By the 13th century it was becoming common in the West as a devotional image for contemplation, in sculpture, painting and manuscripts. It continued to grow in popularity, helped by the Jubilee Year of 1350, when the Roman image seems to have had, perhaps initially only for the Jubilee, a papal indulgence of 14,000 years granted for prayers said in its presence.

The image formed part of the subject of the Mass of Saint Gregory; by 1350 the Roman icon was being claimed as a contemporary representation of the vision. In this image the figure of Christ was typical of the Byzantine forerunners of the Man of Sorrows, at half length, with crossed hands and head slumped sideways to the viewer&#x27;s left.

The various versions of the Man of Sorrows image all show a Christ with the wounds of the Crucifixion, including the spear-wound. Especially in Germany, Christ&#x27;s eyes are usually open and look out at the viewer; in Italy the closed eyes of the Byzantine epitaphios image, originally intended to show a dead Christ, remained for longer. For some the image represented the two natures of Christ – he was dead as a man, but alive as God. Full-length figures also first appear in southern Germany in wall-paintings in the 13th century, and in sculpture from the beginning of the 14th.

Other elements that were sometimes included, in distinct sub-forms of the image, included the &quot;Arma Christi&quot; or &quot;Instruments of the Passion&quot;, the cross, a chalice into which blood poured from Christ&#x27;s side or other wounds (giving an emphasis on the Eucharist), angels to hold these objects or support a slumped Christ himself (Meister Francke shows both roles below), and mourners or worshippers. The &quot;Throne of Mercy&quot; is an image of the Trinity with Christ, often diminutive, as Man of Sorrows, supported by his Father.

Isaiah 53:2 had already been crucial in developing the iconography of the Tree of Jesse: &quot;For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground&quot;.

<doc id="607301" wikidata="Q837700" url="?curid=607301" title="Pseudo-Philo">
<text>Pseudo-Philo is the name commonly used for the unknown, anonymous author of the &quot;Biblical Antiquities&quot;. This text is also commonly known today under the Latin title &quot;Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum&quot; (Book of Biblical Antiquities), a title that is not found in the Latin manuscripts. Although probably originally written in Hebrew, it is preserved today only through a Latin translation found in 18 complete and 3 fragmentary manuscripts that date between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries CE. In addition, material paralleling that in the &quot;Biblical Antiquities&quot; is also found in the &quot;Chronicles of Jerahmeel&quot;, a 14th-century Hebrew composition. The Latin text of the &quot;Biblical Antiquities&quot; circulated alongside Latin translations of the authentic writings of Philo of Alexandria. Scholars have long recognized the pseudonymous character of the text now known as the &quot;Biblical Antiquities&quot;. Primary in this regard is a vastly differing approach to and use of the Jewish scriptures. For the sake of convenience, scholars continue to follow the lead of Leopold Cohn in calling the unknown author &quot;Pseudo-Philo&quot;.

==Estimated date of work==

Most scholars contend that Pseudo-Philo&#x27;s &quot;Biblical Antiquities&quot; was written sometime between the mid-first century CE and the mid-second century CE. Some scholars propose that the &quot;Biblical Antiquities&quot; was written shortly preceding the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple in 70 CE while other scholars suggest that it was written post-70 CE, possibly as late as shortly following the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-136 CE). A very small minority of scholars suggest dates outside these bounds. Examples include Abram Spiro who suggests that it was composed in the second century BCE, J. R. Porter who dates Pseudo-Philo to 25 CE, and Alexander Zeron who posits that it was composed sometime in the third or fourth centuries CE. Among the evidence cited by scholars in support of a pre-70 CE date of composition is the depiction of the temple in Jerusalem as still standing and in use for sacrifices (e.g., LAB 22:8). Further, Daniel J. Harrington writes: &#x27;A date prior to AD 70 (and perhaps around the time of Jesus) is suggested by the kind of Old Testament text used in the book, the free attitude towards the text, the interest in the sacrifices and other things pertaining to cult, and the silence about the destruction of the temple&#x27;. Howard Jacobson, for example, treats this view dismissively, stating that &quot;Simply put, there are no particularly cogent arguments in support of a pre-70 date.&quot; Among the evidence cited in support of a post-70 CE date of composition are thematic parallels with 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra, Jewish texts composed post-70 CE and references to the destruction of the temple (e.g., LAB 19:7).

==Original language and translational history==

The scholarly consensus is that Pseudo-Philo&#x27;s &quot;Biblical Antiquities&quot; was not composed in Latin but, rather that it was composed in Hebrew and translated into Greek before being translated into Latin by the fourth century CE. The primary evidence for this are the many difficult readings that are best explained by the existence of Hebrew and Greek antecedents.

==Short description of content==

Pseudo-Philo&#x27;s &quot;Biblical Antiquities&quot; is a selective rewriting of Jewish scriptural texts and traditions. Following a basic narrative outline derived from the Jewish Scriptures, the work opens with the creation of the world (LAB 1) and concludes with the death of King Saul (LAB 65). As Leopold Cohn observes, it “passes rapidly over” or “omits” certain aspects of the scriptural narrative while elaborating on others, even supplying “many quite novel additions” not present in the Jewish Scriptures. Many of its additions have parallels in other Jewish traditions.

Some scholars have reasoned that the work&#x27;s ending with the death of Saul implies there were further parts of the text which are now missing; others believe that the extant text is complete.

===The work as source of legends===

It is probably the earliest reference for many later legendary accretions to the Biblical text, such as the casting of Abraham into the fire, Dinah&#x27;s marriage to Job, and Moses born circumcised. It also contains several other embellishments which deviate quite substantially from the norm, such as Abraham leading a rebellion against the builders of the Tower of Babel (the reason for him being cast into the fire).

It includes a lament about the human sacrifice of Jephthah&#x27;s daughter, with the daughter being the singer. Commentators have noted that the characterisation of the daughter is (like other female characterisations in Pseudo-Philo) much stronger and more positive than that of her biblical counterpart. She has a name (Seila), and her role is as a wise and willing - rather than passive and reluctant - participant. One commentator has observed that &#x27;the author has done his utmost to put this woman on the same level as the patriarchs, in this case especially Isaac&#x27;.

===Differences from Philo of Alexandria===
According to James H. Charlesworth and Daniel J. Harrington, the attribution of Pseudo-Philo to Philo of Alexandria cannot be sustained for four main differences: Philo of Alexandria wrote in Greek, whereas the Pseudo-Philo apparently wrote in Hebrew; &quot;1,652 years from Adam to the Flood (3:6) against Philo&#x27;s 2,242; the favorable or at least neutral portrayal of Balaam (16) against Philo&#x27;s negative description; Moses&#x27; burial by God (19:16), not by the angels.&quot;

<text>Andrew John Southcott (born 15 October 1967) is an Australian politician and medical practitioner. He was the Liberal member for the House of Representatives seat of Boothby from the 1996 election until he stood down at the 2016 election.

==Early life==
Southcott was born in Panorama, South Australia, and attended Paringa Park Primary School, and St Peter&#x27;s College.

He studied medicine at University of Adelaide and was a medical practitioner before entering politics, serving as an intern and surgical trainee at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and as a surgical registrar at the Flinders Medical Centre and Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park. While in office he has completed a Bachelor of Economics at Flinders University and a Master of Business Administration at the University of Adelaide.

==Political career==
Southcott joined the party in 1989 while serving as president of the Adelaide Medical Students Society. He defeated Senate leader and future Defence Minister Robert Hill, a moderate, in a pre-selection battle for the seat of Boothby in 1994. Southcott is from the conservative faction of the Liberal Party of Australia.

Southcott was elected to the House of Representatives seat of Boothby at the 1996 election and remained a backbencher throughout the Howard government.

At the 2004 election, despite a solid national two-party swing and vote to the Liberals, Boothby became a marginal Liberal seat for the first time in over half a century, with Labor&#x27;s Chloë Fox reducing the Liberals to a marginal 5.4 percent two-party margin. Labor&#x27;s Nicole Cornes reduced the Liberals to a marginal 2.9 percent two-party margin at the 2007 election, while at the 2010 election Labor&#x27;s Annabel Digance reduced the Liberals to just a 0.75 percent two-party margin (638 votes), which put Boothby ahead of neighbouring Sturt as the most marginal seat in South Australia. However, Boothby became a fairly safe Liberal seat again at the 2013 election.

Southcott was a supporter of Republicanism in Australia.

Southcott was chair of the Parliament&#x27;s Joint Standing Committee on Treaties from 2003 until 2007.

Following the Coalition&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 election, Southcott was appointed by party leader Brendan Nelson to the Outer Shadow Ministry as Shadow Minister for Employment Participation, and Apprenticeships and Training.

Resulting from the ascendancy of Malcolm Turnbull at the 2008 Liberal leadership ballot, Southcott became Shadow Minister for Employment Participation, Training and Sport.

After the ascendancy of Tony Abbott at the 2009 Liberal leadership ballot, Southcott was dropped from the Outer Shadow Ministry and demoted to Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Health Services, Health and Wellbeing. Following the 2010 election, Southcott was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Primary Healthcare.

Resulting from the 2013 election where the Abbott government took office, Southcott was dropped and not included in the incoming Abbott ministry, returning to the backbench where he remained.

Following the resignation of Bronwyn Bishop, Southcott ran for the position of Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives in August 2015 but was unsuccessful.

===Parliamentary resignation===
On 4 September 2015, Southcott announced that he would retire from parliament at the 2016 election, and resume his medical career. Southcott said his decision not to re-contest Boothby was &quot;completely unrelated&quot; to being unsuccessful in running for the Speakership. The Liberals pre-selected doctoral student and newspaper columnist Nicolle Flint as their candidate in Boothby at the 2016 election.

<doc id="607307" wikidata="Q1060637" url="?curid=607307" title="Ibn al-Muqaffa'">
<text>Abū Muhammad ʿAbd Allāh Rūzbih ibn Dādūya (), born Rōzbih pūr-i Dādōē (), more commonly known as Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ (; ), was a Persian translator, philosopher, author and thinker who wrote in the Arabic language. He bore the name Rōzbeh/Rūzbeh before his comparatively late conversion to Islam from Manichaeism.

==Biography==
Ibn al-Muqaffa, though a resident of Basra, was originally from the town of Goor (or Gur, Firuzabad, Fars) in the Iranian province of Fars and was born into a family of Persian stock. He was a native speaker of Middle Persian and a non-native speaker of Arabic; Ibn al-Muqaffa composed his Arabic works during a period when the rules of Classical Arabic were still taking shape and the Arabic linguistic tradition was just emerging. His father had been a state official in charge of taxes under the Umayyads, and after being accused and convicted of embezzling some of the money entrusted to him, was punished by the ruler by having his hand crushed, hence the name &quot;Muqaffa&quot; (shrivelled hand).

Ibn al-Muqaffa served in sectarian posts under the Umayyad governors of Shapur and Kirman. Unlike his other colleagues, he escaped persecution at the hands of Abbasids after their overthrow of the Umayyad dynasty. He later returned to Basra and served as a secretary under Isa ibn Ali and Sulayman ibn Ali, the uncles of the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur.

After their brother Abdallah ibn Ali made an abortive bid for the throne, they asked Ibn al-Muqaffa to write a letter to the Caliph to not retaliate against his uncle and pardon him. The language of the letter offended al-Mansur, who wished to get rid of Ibn al-Muqaffa. He was reportedly executed in Basra in 757 AD for heresy by al-Mansur.

A defense of dualism and a few lines of prose written in imitation of the Quran have been ascribed to him. Whether authentic or not, and despite his conversion to Islam, these texts contributed to his posthumous reputation as a Zoroastrian heretic.

==Literary career==
Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Kalīla wa Dimna&quot; from Middle Persian is considered the first masterpiece of Arabic literary prose. &quot;Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; was a pioneer in the introduction of literary prose narrative to Arabic literature. He paved the way for later innovators such as al-Hamadani and al-Saraqusti, who brought literary fiction to Arabic literature by adapting traditionally accepted modes of oral narrative transmission into literary prose.&quot; Ibn al-Muqaffa was also an accomplished scholar of Middle Persian, and was the author of several moral fables.

==Works==

=== Translations and adaptations ===

&quot;Isāghūjī:&quot; His translation from a Syriac version of Porphyry&#x27;s Isagoge (Introduction), became the standard introductory logic text in the Arabic and broader Muslim world.

Kalīla wa Dimna : His translation of a Middle Persian collection of animal fables, mostly of Indian origin, involving two jackals, Kalīla and Demna. The Middle Persian original, now lost but thought have been entitled &quot;Karīrak ud Damanak&quot; was written by one Borzōē/Borzūya, a Persian physician attached to the Sasanian court in the 6th century. Prefaced by a putative autobiography of Borzūya and an account of his voyage to India, the full work was done into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;, who introduced it with a prologue of his own and may have been responsible for four added stories. From Ibn al-Moqaffaʿ&#x27;s Arabic rendering of Borzūya&#x27;s work are descended not only all later Arabic versions of Kalīla wa Dimna, but also one of two Syriac versions (the other one is pre-Islamic ) and the medieval Greek, Persian (6th/12th century), Hebrew, Latin, and Castilian versions. Though there are many Arabic manuscripts of Kalīla wa Dimna, Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; version is not among them, and the oldest dated copy was written almost five centuries after his death. That he aimed at an idiomatic rather than a slavishly literal rendering is generally agreed, and all indications are that he achieved clarity of expression by simplicity of diction and plain syntactical structures. As no medieval Arab critic seems to have impugned his style, it was evidently pleasing and well suited to the taste of his Arab readers.

Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; translation of Kalīla wa Dimna was not a conscious attempt to start a new literary trend; it was clearly just one of several works of old Sasanian court literature which Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; introduced to an exclusive readership within court circles, its function being to illustrate what should or should not be done by those aiming at political and social success. Kalīla wa Dimna, nonetheless, served as a stimulus to the development of Arabic prose literature and inspired imitators, artists, and poets. A prose Persian translation of the Arabic text was available as early as the 10th century, of which a versified version was made by Rudaki (d.941-42). Both versions are lost except for a few lines of Rūdakī&#x27;s poem preserved in other sources. A later prose translation was rendered by Abu’l-Maʿālī Nasr-Allāh Ibn Mohammad Shirazi and dedicated to the Ghaznavid Bahramshah.

Khwaday-Namag: Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; is thought to have produced an Arabic adaptation of the late Sasanian Khwaday-Namag, a chronicle of pre-Islamic Persian kings, princes, and warriors. A mixture of legend, myth, and fact, it served as a quasi-national history inspired by a vision of kingship as a well-ordered autocracy with a sacred duty to rule and to regulate its subjects&#x27; conduct within a rigid class system. Interspersed with maxims characteristic of &quot;andarz&quot; literature, the narrative also offered practical advice on civil and military matters. Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; is known to have modified certain parts of the original and excluded others, possibly to make it intelligible to his Arab Muslim readers. He is thought to have inserted an account of Mazdak, from which later Perso-Arab historians derived much of their knowledge of the Mazdakite movement. Like its Middle Persian original, Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; Arabic version is not extant. The &quot;Oyun al-akhbar&quot; and the &quot;Ketab al-maʿaref&quot; of Ibn Qutayba (d. 889) may preserve fragments of it; certainly the &quot;Sīar al-ʿAjam&quot;, quoted by Ibn Qutayba without ascription, renders the Khwaday-Namag.

Other books: Ibn al-Nadim attributes several other Arabic translations of Middle Persian works to Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;, namely Āʾīn-nāma, Kitāb al-tāj, and Kitāb Mazdak. Ibn Qutayba is thought to have preserved parts of the Āʾīn-nāma, for in his Oyun a number of passages are quoted, albeit without ascription, with the opening words &quot;I have read in the Aiin (or Kitāb al-āʾīn)&quot;. The quotations bear on topics such as court manners and customs, military tactics, divination and physiognomy, archery, and polo, subjects typical of various works on Sasanian institutions, protocol, entertainment, general savoir faire, and so on. Also in the Oyun are extracts from a Kitāb al-tāj. Ebn al-Nadim describes this book as a biography of Khosrau I (Anoshirvan), but Ibn Qutayba&#x27;s extracts mostly pertain to Khosrau II (Parviz) and suggest a &quot;mirror for princes&quot;. The subject of the Ketab Mazdak was, as its title implies, the leader of the revolutionary religious movement whose activities led to his execution in 531.A better product of Ibn al-Muqaffa&quot;s translation activities is the Nāma-ye Tansar, a political work taking its name from its putative author Tansar, the Zoroastrian priestly adviser to the first Sasanian monarch, Ardashir I. Ibn al-Muqaffa&quot;s Arabic version is lost, but Ibn Isfandiar&#x27;s Persian rendering of it, made in the early 13th century and embodied in his &quot;Tarikh-e Tabarestan&quot; (History of Tabarestan), reveals its content. Apart from adding various illustrative verses, some...in elegant Persian, Ibn al-Muqaffa evidently inserted Quranic and Biblical quotations, presumably as a concession to Muslims. Be that as it may, his Sasanian text is still Iranocentric: ...we are the best of Persians, and there is no quality or trait of excellence or nobility which we hold dearer than the fact that we have ever showed humility and lowliness…in the service of kings, and have chosen obedience and loyalty, devotion and fidelity. Through this quality…we came to be the head and neck of all the climes...

=== Original works ===
Two preceptive works in Arabic are ascribed to Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;, al-Adab al-kabīr and al-Adab al-saghir, but only the first, now known as Kitāb al-ādāb al-kabīr, can be accepted as his. The first of its four parts is a very brief rhetorical retrospect on the excellence of the ancients&#x27; legacy, clearly Sasanian, of spiritual and temporal knowledge. The second is a miniature mirror for princes. The addressee, seemingly the caliph&#x27;s son, is apostrophized as one in pursuit of the rule of seemly conduct (adab). He is to give strict priority to the mastery of fundamentals, examples of which are given along with illustrations of the ways in which they can be applied. The author then turns to pitfalls before a prince (e.g., the love of flattery and the fault of allowing others to detect it). More positively, he urges the prince to cultivate men of religion and moral perfection as potential aides and intimates, to take advice, even if unpalatable, from those best qualified to give it, to keep abreast of his officials&#x27; conduct, to be sparing with his favors, and so on. Having defined, very much in a Sasanian vein, the bases of kingship, he discusses particular circumstances calling for caution and prudence. After exhortation to seemly conduct and sundry observations on statecraft he ends by stressing the pivotal role in government of power and a seemly public image. The Ādāb&#x27;s third part, longer than the second, is a pragmatic guide to survival for a ruler&#x27;s intimates and highly, but precariously, placed officers of state. It offers advice in a high moral vein, but it rests on no philosophical, ethical-religious, or spiritual basis: it rests on familiarity with age-old vagaries of oriental despots and their entourages. The fourth and longest part of the Ādāb treats of a man&#x27;s relations with colleagues in what we may take to be the secretarial fraternity. The main theme is friendship and the avoidance of enmity. For Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;, the ideal is a permanent relationship, sustained by fidelity, loyalty, and devotion, and proof against all corrosive forces. As always, his treatment of the subject is didactic and heavily dependent on aphorisms. He remains pragmatic: A friendship should be formed, not with an inferior, but with a superior, for to make friends of inferiors bespeaks envy, which is reprehensible. To shed a friend is a threat to honor—unlike a divorce. To women and their allure he makes certain disparaging references, but they are only incidental to his main interest, promoting companionship and amity in the circles that concern him. One can detect in the Ādāb as a whole certain ideas known to Sasanian Persia from pre-Islamic translations of Greek works. The Ādāb is cast in the parallelistic mode of expression born of the early Khotba and expanded and elaborated in Omayyad hortatory compositions, unembroidered with contrived rhyming of the sort found in later Abbasid prose literature. To point contrasts and enforce parallels, full use is made of devices well known to the ancient schools of rhetoric.

The Risala fi-l-Sahaba is a short but remarkably percipient administrative text. In less than 5,000 words, he discusses specific problems facing the new Abbasid regime. The unnamed addressee is identifiable as al-Mansur, who may never have seen it. There is no logical arrangement. After an opening eulogy, purposefully complimentary but devoid of extravagant panegyric, he discusses the army, praising the Khorasanis in Iraq but suggesting that, as an ethnically mixed body exposed to heterodox thinking, they should be taught only the tenets of a clear, concise religious code issued by the caliph. Concern for the army&#x27;s standing, morale, and future loyalty leads him to suggest reforms, including the removal of fiscal duties from the military, officer recruitment from the ranks based on merit, religious education, inculcation of integrity and loyalty, regular pay linked to inflation, and maintenance of an efficient intelligence service throughout Khorasan and peripheral provinces, regardless of cost. He calls for vigilance and good intelligence in Iraq to counter discontent in Basra and Kufa and pleads for deserving Iraqis to be afforded scope for the exercise of their talents in government service. In view of wide divergences in legal theory and practice, born of local precedents or flawed personal reasoning, he suggests to the caliph a scrutiny and resolution of all conflicts of law by his own command and the imposition of unity by a comprehensive enactment. He recommends cautious clemency for the conquered Syrians, the recruitment from among them of a hand-picked caliphal elite, the lifting of ruinous economic sanctions, and fair distribution of foodstuffs in the Syrian military districts. At long last, he comes to the caliph&#x27;s entourage, which, though introduced in glowing terms, can be perceived as far from ideal. In the past, ministers and secretaries—the approach is tactful—brought the entourage into disrepute: men unworthy of access to the caliph became members to the exclusion of, for instance, scions of the great families of early Islam. The caliph should now remedy the situation by taking account of claims to precedence and singling out for preferment men with special talents and distinguished service records, as well as men of religion and virtue and incorruptible and uncorrupting men of noble lineage. Also, the caliph&#x27;s kin and princes of his house should be considered. In a section on land-tax (Kharaj) the author focuses on the arbitrary exploitation of cultivators and recommends taxation governed by known rules and registers. After a few lines on Arabia he closes with a proposal for mass education aimed at achieving uniformity of orthodox belief through a body of paid professional instructors. This would make for stability, and trouble-makers would not go unobserved. The Resāla ends with an expression of pious hopes and prayers for the caliph and his people. Stylistically, the work markedly differs from the Ādāb in certain important respects, the reason for which may be the subject-matter.

Of the various works attributed, rightly or wrongly, to Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27;, there are two of which we have only fragments quoted in hostile sources. One, posing a problem of authenticity, may be described as a Manichaean apologia. The other is the Moarazat al-Quran, which sees not as anti-Islamic, but rather as an exercise designed to show that in the author&#x27;s time something stylistically comparable to the Quran could be composed. Other compositions and occasional pieces attributed to Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; are the Yatima tania a short, sententious epistle on good and bad rulers and subjects ; may be authentic, though the long resāla entitled Yatimat al-soltan and the collection of aphorisms labeled Hekam certainly are not. A doxology is almost certainly spurious, though a series of passages and sentences that follow it may have come from the lost Yatima fi’l-rasael.

==Legacy and commemoration==
The Bosnian poet Dzevad Karahasan wrote a play about al-Muqaffa. The world premiere was performed in 1994 during the civil war in Bosnia-Hercegovina by the Bosnian actors Zijah Sokolović and Selma Alispahić from the National Theatre of Sarajevo under the direction of Herbert Gantschacher in a production of the Austrian theatre ARBOS – Company for Music and Theatre in Vienna
