<text>Tonbridge School is a public school (English fee-charging boarding and day school for boys 13–18) in Tonbridge, Kent, England, founded in 1553 by Sir Andrew Judde (sometimes spelled Judd). It is a member of the Eton Group and has close links with the Worshipful Company of Skinners, one of the oldest London livery companies.

There are currently around 800 boys in the school, aged between 13 and 18. The school occupies a site of on the edge of Tonbridge, and is largely self-contained, though most of the boarding and day houses are in nearby streets. Since its foundation the school has been rebuilt twice on the original site. For the academic year 2023/24, Tonbridge charges full boarders up to £16,648 per term and £12,490 per term for day pupils, making it the 4th and 6th most expensive HMC boarding and day school respectively.

The headmaster is James Priory who began his tenure at the school in 2018.

The school is one of only a very few of the ancient public schools not to have turned co-educational, and there are no plans for this to happen.

Tonbridge School was listed in the 2024 edition of The Schools Index as one of the world&#x27;s best 150 private schools and among top 30 UK senior schools.

==History==

===Foundation===

The school was founded in 1553 by Andrew Judde, being granted its royal charter by Edward VI. The first headmaster was the Revd John Proctor, a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. From 1553 until his death in 1558, Judde was the sole governor of the school, and he framed the statutes that were to govern it for the next 270 years. On Judde&#x27;s death, the school was passed to the Skinners&#x27; Company, after a dispute with Judde&#x27;s business partner Henry Fisher.

For the next hundred years few details of the school survive apart from rare records in the Skinners&#x27; Company books. Headmaster Proctor died in 1558, and was succeeded by a series of headmasters, usually clergy and always classical scholars. They included the Revd William Hatch (1587–1615), the first Old Tonbridgian headmaster. According to the Skinners&#x27; records, the Revd Michael Jenkins (1615–24) was appointed because &quot;he was the only one who turned up&quot;. During his time as headmaster, the school received a series of generous endowments from Thomas Smythe, the first governor of the East India Company and son of Andrew Judde&#x27;s daughter Alice.

===Second hundred years===
Very little written material relating to the school over the next century survives. Numbers fluctuated between 40 and 90, and the school obtained a new refectory and a new library. However, from 1680 numbers declined, and for a few years the examiners reported that there were no candidates fit for university study. In 1714, the Reverend Richard Spencer, of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, was made headmaster. He was an immediate success and very popular, and by 1721 numbers had risen to over seventy. The governors raised Spencer&#x27;s salary to 30 guineas, and several of his pupils went on to successful careers. These included a future Lord Mayor of London, a vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, and George Austen, father of Jane Austen.

The first Old Tonbridgian dinner was held on 8 June 1744. The year before this, however, Spencer had resigned, and the headmastership was bestowed upon the Reverend James Cawthorn. Cawthorn persuaded the governors to build a new library at the south end of the school in 1760, and it survives today as the headmaster&#x27;s house and the Skinners&#x27; Library. In 1765, the townspeople of Tonbridge asked the question of free education, and governors&#x27; legal team decided that the parishioners&#x27; children, provided they could write competently and read Latin and English perfectly, had the right to learn at the school paying only the sixpence entry fee.

In 1772, classical scholar Vicesimus Knox was made headmaster, but he reigned for a mere six years. During his tenure, numbers dropped to only seventeen. His son and namesake, Vicesimus Knox, was to take his father&#x27;s place in 1779. School numbers under the young Knox rose to 85, and pupils began to arrive from all over England and also from abroad.

===19th century===

Knox retired in 1812, and was succeeded by his younger son, Thomas. The period of Knox&#x27;s headmastership was one of national economic and political change, but at the school the greatest change was the increasing importance of cricket. John Abercrombie was the school&#x27;s first cricket blue (for Cambridge) in 1839. In 1818, a nationwide commission visited Tonbridge to investigate on behalf of the reforming government. Over the next few years, a new scheme for the school was prepared and approved by the Lord Chancellor. New buildings were agreed upon by the governors, and a new dining room and dormitories were built. The school also bought the Georgian building on the High Street to the north of the new junior school, and it was renamed Judde House. This was the school&#x27;s second boarding house, with the original buildings serving to house boys of the larger School House. In 1826, the governors bought the field which now contains the Head cricket ground, and the patches to the north and south of it, later to be called the Upper and Lower Hundreds. In 1838, Knox took the decision to level the Head, a considerable project, using labour and earth from the new railway workings in the town. The labourers often engaged in fights with the boys, as they were lodged nearby. The Head became the focal point of the school and was regarded as one of the most beautiful cricket grounds in the south of England. Thomas Knox died shortly after the completion of his cricket pitch, in 1843, whilst preparing to preach in the parish church. His death brought to an end the 71-year reign of the Knox family.

===World wars===

Tonbridge lost a great many former pupils in both world wars; 415 Old Tonbridgians and three masters died in the Great War, and a further 301 OTs died in the line of duty between 1939 and 1945.
*Eric Stuart Dougall was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross to go with his Military Cross in Belgium during the closing stages of World War I.
*James Brindley Nicolson became the only RAF fighter pilot to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the course of the Battle of Britain after climbing back into his burning Hawker Hurricane to engage a Messerschmitt Bf 110 over the skies of Southampton.
*Harold Newgass was awarded the school&#x27;s only George Cross during World War II after defusing an enemy mine over two days.

===Post-war years===

Lawrence Waddy took over as headmaster in 1949. The Tonbridge he inherited was still a largely Victorian institution; fagging and ritual caning were still in place, and sport was considered more important than academia. Over the next 40 years personal fagging was abolished (ending in 1965), and the intellectual life of the school was revitalised (particularly under the headmastership of Michael McCrum). McCrum, headmaster from 1962 to 1970, abolished the right of senior boys to administer corporal punishment, taking over for himself the duty of administering routine canings. Boaters (known at the school as &quot;barges&quot;), straw hats worn by boys, were no longer compulsory uniform after a major town-gown fight in the 1970s. The headmaster until 2005 was Martin Hammond.

In 2005 the school was one of fifty leading independent schools found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by &quot;The Times&quot;, which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, and were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;

==Houses==

There are twelve houses at Tonbridge School: seven boarding and five day houses. Each house has its own house colours. The houses, in order of foundation, are:
Each house contains approximately 65 pupils. The names are drawn from the location of the house itself (e.g. Park House, Parkside, School House (originally located in the main school building) and Hill Side), or are names of benefactors, headmasters and others who have left their mark on the school over the years (e.g. Smythe House, named after Sir Thomas Smythe (see also Smythe Library), Judd House, named after the founder of the school, Whitworth and Welldon, both named after headmasters of the school, and Cowdrey House, named after Colin Cowdrey, arguably the most famous Tonbridge alumnus). The only exceptions are Ferox Hall, which takes its name from the Latin for ferocious, and Manor House which was named by a former housemaster.

== Chapel ==

The Chapel of St Augustine of Canterbury occupies a central position in the school next to the old buildings and Orchard Centre. The chapel is collegiate in layout with twelve blocks of pews and seats corresponding to the respective Houses. The focal point of the chapel is the stone high altar and there are two pulpits, one each on the north and south sides of the chapel. The narthex or outer lobby of the chapel is also the school war memorial. In addition the names of all Old Tonbridgians who died in the first or second world wars are displayed in stone or ironwork. In September 1988 it was severely damaged by fire with almost all objects in the building being destroyed except a 15th-century stone sculpture. Restoration took seven years to complete and the chapel was reconsecrated by the Bishop of Rochester in October 1995.

==Sport==
The school offers a diverse range of sports, from traditional rugby and cricket to niche activities like fives and water polo.

The school has produced a number of international rugby players throughout the history of rugby union. In 1871, in the first ever international rugby match, Tonbridge was represented by two players, J.E. Bentley and J.H. Luscombe. These players were also members of a team called the Gipsies Football Club, a London-based rugby football club for Old Tonbrigians founded in 1868. This club produced four other internationals including England captain Francis Luscombe, and was also one of the founding members of the Rugby Football Union.

Tonbridge alumni who have gone on to represent the England cricket team include Kenneth Hutchings, Colin Cowdrey, Roger Prideaux, Chris Cowdrey, Richard Ellison, Ed Smith and Zak Crawley. All seven also played for Kent County Cricket Club and there is a long association between the school and Kent with a number of other Old Tonbridgians playing first-class cricket for the county side. Former Kent professionals who have coached the school cricket team include Alan Dixon, whom Richard Ellison credits for developing his swing bowling abilities, and John Knott.

==Music==

The school has a strong musical tradition: around half the boys take regular music lessons and over 80 achieve grade 7 or above. About 12 music scholarships are awarded every year. Tonbridge is also a &quot;Steinway School&quot;, meaning that over 90% of pianos are designed or built by Steinway &amp; Sons.

The school chapel holds regular concerts for the various orchestras including a large symphony orchestra for the most accomplished players, conducted by the director of music. The chapel is also home to an internationally respected 4-manual tracker-action pipe organ with 67 speaking stops and 4,830 pipes, built by Marcussen &amp; Søn in 1995.

<text>Alan Hale Sr. (born Rufus Edward Mackahan; February 10, 1892 – January 22, 1950) was an American actor and director. He is best remembered for his many character roles, in particular as a frequent sidekick of Errol Flynn, as well as films supporting Lon Chaney, Wallace Beery, Douglas Fairbanks, James Cagney, Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, and Ronald Reagan. Hale was usually billed as Alan Hale and his career in film lasted 40 years. His son, Alan Hale Jr., also became an actor and remains most famous for playing &quot;the Skipper&quot; on the television series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

==Early life==
Hale was born Rufus Edward Mackahan in Washington, D.C. He studied to be an opera singer.

==Career==
His first film role was in the 1911 silent movie &quot;The Cowboy and the Lady&quot;. He became a leading man while working in 1913–1915 for the Biograph Company in their special feature film productions sponsored and controlled by Marc Klaw and Abraham Erlanger. Later, he became more of a character actor; he played &quot;Little John&quot; in the film &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1922), with Douglas Fairbanks and Wallace Beery, reprised the role 16 years later in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938) with Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone, then played him once more in &quot;Rogues of Sherwood Forest&quot; (1950) with John Derek as Robin Hood&#x27;s son, a unique 28-year string of portrayals of the same character in theatrical films. Hale played Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, in &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939), featuring a pivotal confrontation with the Earl of Essex, portrayed by Flynn.

His other films include the epic &quot;The Trap&quot; (1922) with Lon Chaney, &quot;Skyscraper&quot; (1928); as well as &quot;Fog Over Frisco&quot; with Bette Davis; &quot;Miss Fane&#x27;s Baby Is Stolen&quot; with Baby LeRoy and William Frawley; &quot;The Little Minister&quot; with Katharine Hepburn; and &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert; (all released in 1934); &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; with Barbara Stanwyck; &quot;High, Wide, and Handsome&quot; (both 1937) with Irene Dunne and Dorothy Lamour; &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot; with James Cagney and Pat O&#x27;Brien; &quot;They Drive By Night&quot; with George Raft and Humphrey Bogart; &quot;Virginia City&quot; (all 1940) with Errol Flynn, Randolph Scott, and Humphrey Bogart; &quot;Manpower&quot; (1941) with Edward G. Robinson, Marlene Dietrich, and George Raft; and as the cantankerous Sgt. McGee in the &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1943) with Irving Berlin. He also co-starred with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the successful western film &quot;Dodge City&quot; (1939) where he played the slightly dimwitted but likable and comical Rusty Hart, sidekick to Flynn&#x27;s character, Sheriff Wade Hatton. Hale co-starred with Errol Flynn in 13 movies.

Hale directed eight movies during the 1920s and 1930s and acted in 235 theatrical films in total.

Hale also had success as an inventor. Among his innovations were a sliding theater chair (to allow spectators to slide back to admit newcomers rather than standing), the hand fire extinguisher, and greaseless potato chips.

==Personal life==

Hale&#x27;s wife of over 30 years was Gretchen Hartman (1897–1979), a former child actress, silent film player, and mother of the couple&#x27;s three children.

He was the father of actor Alan Hale Jr., best known as &quot;the Skipper&quot; in the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; television series. Father and son closely resembled one another, leading to occasional confusion after Hale Sr.&#x27;s death when Hale Jr. dropped the Jr. from his name. Hale Sr. and Hale Jr. both played the same character, Porthos the musketeer, in movies 40 years apart. Alan Hale Sr. played the character in the 1939 film &quot;Man in the Iron Mask&quot;, while Alan Hale Jr. played him in &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot; in 1979.

Alan Hale Sr. died at age 57 in Hollywood, California, on January 22, 1950, following a liver ailment and viral infection. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, next to his wife.

There is a street named after Hale in San Antonio, Texas.

<text>The Cauca River () is a river in Colombia that lies between the Occidental and Central cordilleras. From its headwaters in southwestern Colombia near the city of Popayán, it joins the Magdalena River near Magangué in Bolívar Department, and the combined river eventually flows out into the Caribbean Sea. It has a length of to its junction with the Magdalena, for a total length of . The river is under the supervision of the &quot;Cauca Regional Corporation&quot; and the &quot;Cauca Valley Regional Autonomous Corporation&quot;, and is navigable for above its junction with the Magdalena.

==Environmental issues==
On November 18, 2007, Colombian newspaper &quot;El Tiempo&quot; reported that the river was receiving an average of 500 tons of residual waste a day. Pollution from the city of Popayán, seven gold mines that also add industrial pollutants such as mercury, some 8 sand mills, plus a couple of mines of coal and bauxite. Cali, the largest city on the river, depends on the river in a 76 percent. Adding to these other affluent rivers collect residual waters from other major cities and deposit an approximate of 330 tons of residual waste into the river. By the time it gets to Yumbo the river has no oxygen.

The Hidroituango energy dam project has seriously affected the Cauca River. The dam has decreased its flow in some parts, up to 80%.

<doc id="590346" wikidata="Q296828" url="?curid=590346" title="Jacques Ibert">
<text>Jacques François Antoine Marie Ibert (15 August 1890 – 5 February 1962) was a French composer of classical music. Having studied music from an early age, he studied at the Paris Conservatoire and won its top prize, the Prix de Rome at his first attempt, despite studies interrupted by his service in World War I.

Ibert pursued a successful composing career, writing (sometimes in collaboration with other composers) seven operas, five ballets, incidental music for plays and films, works for piano solo, choral works, and chamber music. He is probably best remembered for his orchestral works including &quot;Divertissement&quot; (1930) and &quot;Escales&quot; (1924).

As a composer, Ibert did not attach himself to any of the prevalent genres of music of his time, and has been described as an eclectic. This is seen even in his best-known pieces: &quot;Divertissement&quot; for small orchestra is lighthearted, even frivolous, and &quot;Escales&quot; (1922) is a ripely romantic work for large orchestra.

In tandem with his creative work, Ibert was the director of the Académie de France at the Villa Medici in Rome. During World War II he was proscribed by the pro-Nazi government in Paris, and for a time he went into exile in Switzerland. Restored to his former eminence in French musical life after the war, his final musical appointment was in charge of the Paris Opera and the Opéra-Comique.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Ibert was born in Paris. His father was a successful businessman, and his mother a talented pianist who had studied with Antoine François Marmontel and encouraged the young Ibert&#x27;s musical interests. From the age of four, he began studying music, first learning the violin and then the piano from his mother, despite his father&#x27;s wishes that his son would follow in his business profession. After leaving school, he earned a living as a private teacher, as an accompanist, and as a cinema pianist. He also started composing songs, sometimes under the pen name William Berty, and helped his father&#x27;s business, which had suffered a financial setback. In 1910, Ibert became a student at the Paris Conservatoire, studying with Émile Pessard (harmony), André Gedalge (counterpoint) and Paul Vidal (composition). Gédalge also gave him private lessons in orchestration; Ibert&#x27;s fellow-students at these private classes included Arthur Honegger and Darius Milhaud.

Ibert&#x27;s musical studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, in which he served as a naval officer. After the war he married Rosette Veber, daughter of the painter Jean Veber. Resuming his studies, he won the Conservatoire&#x27;s top prize, the Prix de Rome at his first attempt, in 1919. The prize gave him the opportunity to pursue further musical studies in Rome. In the course of these, Ibert composed his first opera, &quot;Persée et Andromède&quot; (1921), to a libretto by his brother-in-law, the author Michel Veber, writing under the pen name &quot;Nino&quot;.

===Composer and administrator===

Among Ibert&#x27;s early orchestral compositions were &quot;La Ballade de la geôle de Reading&quot;, inspired by Oscar Wilde&#x27;s poem, and &quot;Escales&quot; (&quot;Ports of Call&quot;), inspired by his experiences of Mediterranean ports. The first of these works was played at the Concerts Colonne in October 1922, conducted by Gabriel Pierné; the second was performed in January 1924 with Paul Paray conducting the Orchestre Lamoureux. The two works made Ibert an early reputation both at home and abroad. His publisher Alphonse Leduc commissioned two collections of piano music from him, &quot;Histoires&quot; and &quot;Les Rencontres&quot;, which enhanced his popularity. In 1927 his opéra-bouffe &quot;Angélique&quot; was produced; it was the most successful of his operas, a musical farce, displaying eclectic style and flair.

In addition to composing, Ibert was active as a conductor and in musical administration. He was a member of professional committees, and in 1937 he was appointed director of the Académie de France at the Villa Medici in Rome. Ibert, with the enthusiastic support of his wife &quot;threw himself wholeheartedly into his administrative role and proved an excellent ambassador of French culture in Italy.&quot; He held the post until the end of 1960, except for an enforced break while France and Italy were at war during World War II.

===Later years===
The war years were difficult for Ibert. In 1940 the Vichy government banned his music and he retreated to Antibes, in the south of France, and later to Switzerland and the Haute-Savoie. In August 1944, he was readmitted to the musical life of the country when General de Gaulle recalled him to Paris. In 1955 Ibert was appointed administrator of the Réunion des Théâtres Lyriques Nationaux, which ran both the Paris Opera and the Opéra-Comique. After less than a year, his health obliged him to retire. Shortly afterwards he was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts.

Ibert died in Paris aged 71, and is buried at Passy Cemetery in the city&#x27;s 16th arrondissement.

==Music==
Ibert refused to ally himself to any particular musical fashion or school, maintaining that &quot;all systems are valid&quot;, a position that has caused many commentators to categorise him as &quot;eclectic&quot;. His biographer Alexandra Laederich writes, &quot;His music can be festive and gay … lyrical and inspired, or descriptive and evocative … often tinged with gentle humour … all the elements of his musical language bar that of harmony relate closely to the Classical tradition.&quot; The early orchestral works, such as &quot;Escales&quot;, are in &quot;a lush Impressionist style&quot;, but Ibert is at least as well known for lighthearted, even frivolous, pieces, among which are the &quot;Divertissement&quot; for small orchestra and the Flute Concerto.

Ibert&#x27;s stage works similarly embrace a wide variety of styles. His first opera, &quot;Persée et Andromède&quot;, is a concise, gently satirical piece. &quot;Angélique&quot; displays his &quot;eclectic style and his accomplished writing of pastiche set pieces&quot;. &quot;Le roi d&#x27;Yvetot&quot; is written, in part in a simple folklike style. The opéra bouffe &quot;Gonzague&quot; is another essay in the old opera bouffe style. &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;, composed jointly with Honegger, employs commedia dell&#x27;arte characters and much musical pastiche in a style both accessible and sophisticated. For the farcical &quot;Les petites Cardinal&quot; the music is in set pieces in the manner of an operetta. By contrast &quot;Le chevalier errant&quot;, a choreographic piece incorporating chorus and two reciters, is in an epic style. Ibert&#x27;s practice of collaborating with other composers extended to his works for the ballet stage. His first work composed expressly for the ballet was a waltz for &quot;L&#x27;éventail de Jeanne&quot; (1929) to which he was one of ten contributors, others of whom were Ravel and Poulenc. He was the sole composer of four further ballets between 1934 and 1954.

For the theatre and cinema, Ibert was a prolific composer of incidental music. His best-known theatre score was music for Eugène Labiche&#x27;s &quot;Un chapeau de paille d&#x27;Italie&quot;, which Ibert later reworked as the suite &quot;Divertissement&quot;. Other scores ranged from music for farce to that for Shakespeare productions. His cinema scores covered a similarly broad range. He wrote the music for more than a dozen French films, and for American directors he composed a score for Orson Welles&#x27;s 1948 film of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and the &quot;Circus&quot; ballet for Gene Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; in 1952.

<text>Soni (1601–1667), also known as Sonin, and rarely Sony (; ), was a Manchu noble of the Hešeri clan who served as one of the Four Regents of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722) during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). His clan belonged to the Plain Yellow Banner.

==Early life==
Soni&#x27;s father Šose (Chinese: Shuose 硕色) and uncle Hife (Xifu 希福), who were both fluent in Mandarin, Mongolian and Manchu, served as high officials under Manchu patriarch Nurhaci (1559–1626). Like them, Soni was valued for his linguistic abilities. In 1628, under Nurhaci&#x27;s successor Hong Taiji (1592–1643), Soni led a successful diplomatic mission to convince the recently surrendered Khorchin Mongols to honor their pledge to help the Manchus militarily. In 1629 he was named to the newly created &quot;Literary Office&quot; (Chinese: &quot;wenguan&quot; 文館), an institution that kept a detailed record of Manchu history and translated Chinese books about statecraft and Chinese and Korean state documents into Manchu. In 1630 Soni was ordered to remain in recently conquered Chinese cities to supervise surrendered Chinese leaders and commanders.

By 1643, Soni had become &quot;grand minister of the imperial bodyguard,&quot; and when Hong Taiji died in September of that year, Soni used his allies in the guards unit and the yellow banners to ensure that only a son of Hong Taiji would succeed to the Qing throne. Soon after Dorgon (1612–1650) was chosen as Prince Regent for Hong Taiji&#x27;s son Fulin—who reigned as the Shunzhi Emperor from 1643 to his death in 1661—the Manchu victory at the Battle of Shanhai Pass in late May 1644 allowed the Qing to take control of north China and to move their capital from Mukden to Beijing. Despite repeated military successes in the south, in 1645 factional struggles started around Dorgon. Deeply involved in many of the factional struggles of the second half of the 1640s, Soni was in turn favored, sentenced to death, pardoned, dismissed from office, reinstated, and dismissed again in 1648, the last time for good.

==As regent==
Before the Shunzhi Emperor died, Soni was appointed as one of the four regents to support the young Kangxi Emperor, along with Suksaha, Ebilun and Oboi. Soni was the top of these four regents and ably helped the young emperor defend against Oboi, who wanted to increase his own power over the emperor. During the first years of Kangxi&#x27;s reign, a power struggle ensued among the regents. Soni was too old to exert his leadership. His son Songgotu helped the young emperor to get rid of Oboi.

On 16 October 1665, the eleven-year-old Kangxi Emperor took Soni&#x27;s grand daughter, Lady Hešeri (1653–1674), who was a few months older than him, as his Empress. Because Soni&#x27;s powerful family would now presumably support the emperor, this marriage split the regency.

==Death==
Sonin died on 12 August 1667. His death provoked a series of changes in the regency: just as the other regents, led by Oboi, tried to consolidate their power, the emperor vied to assert his own power.

<text>Denemarken is a hamlet in the municipality of Midden-Groningen, in the Dutch province of Groningen. It consists of some ten dwellings, mostly farms. The name does not reference the Scandinavian country but means &quot;wild lands&quot; in the local dialect. It is notable for laying on top of the Groningen gas field, the largest natural gas field in Europe. In 2015 the nature reserve &#x27;t Roegwold (&quot;wild swamp forest&quot;) was opened, overlapping partly with Denemarken. The award-winning semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Kinderen van het Ruige Land&quot; (&quot;Children of the Savage Land&quot;, 2012) by Auke Hulst is situated in the hamlet.

<text>Knoebels Amusement Resort () is a family-owned and operated amusement park, picnic grove, and campground in Elysburg, Pennsylvania. Opened in 1926, it is the United States&#x27;s largest free-admission park. The park has more than 60 rides including three wooden roller coasters, three steel roller coasters, a 1913 carousel, and two haunted house dark rides.

The amusement park is owned and operated by the Knoebel (pronounced &quot;kuh-NO-bel&quot;) family. The park&#x27;s name has traditionally been spelled &quot;Knoebels&quot; without the apostrophe, and appears that way on all official park advertising and correspondence.

The park and its rides have won awards from organizations such as &quot;Amusement Today&quot;, American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE), and the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. In 2014, Travel Channel rated Knoebels one of their Top 10 Family Friendly Amusement Parks in the United States.

== History ==
Knoebels is located in a small wooded valley in central Pennsylvania. In 1828, a local man by the name of Henry Knoebel purchased the land for $931 (equivalent to $26,638 in 2024). The valley, originally known as &quot;Peggy&#x27;s Farm&quot;, was used as farming land until the early 1900s, when a creek-fed swimming hole was introduced. Knoebel turned the property into a popular picnic destination, attracting Sunday travelers and horse-drawn hayride wagons. Soft drinks, ice cream, and snacks were sold to visitors. As the popularity of &quot;Knoebels Grove&quot; grew, Knoebel leased plots of land along the creeks for use as summer cottage sites. Some of these privately owned cottages, as well as cottages Knoebel built and rented, still exist on the property today.

In 1926, Knoebels added a restaurant, a steam-powered Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) carousel, and a few simple games to the grove, marking the beginning of Knoebels Amusement Park. On July 4, 1926, a large concrete swimming pool was opened at the site of the old swimming hole. Featuring a filtration system that provided clean water instead of muddy creek water, the pool was named &quot;The Crystal Pool&quot;. Since then, the park has developed around the pool, adding over 50 rides, assorted games, concession stands, and other attractions. A campground with six sites opened behind the amusement park in 1962, and as of 2004, the campground covered with 500 sites.

On June 22, 1972, both South Branch Roaring Creek and Mugser Run, creeks that run through Knoebels, rose over their banks, swollen with heavy rains from Hurricane Agnes. The flood destroyed six cottages and damaged many other buildings, including 24 of the park&#x27;s 25 rides, as well as the roller rink. The roller rink building was re-floored and used as a skating rink until the mid-1980s, when it was converted into the &quot;Roaring Creek Saloon&quot;, which now contains a concession stand, an arcade, the XD Theater, and performances. A new building constructed after the flood became the Haunted Mansion dark ride, which opened in 1973. The ride has been recognized as one of America&#x27;s best dark rides by organizations such as Dark Ride and Funhouse Enthusiasts (DAFE) and the National Amusement Park Historical Association.

The park again suffered major flooding in 1975, 1996, 2004, 2006, and 2011. Each caused substantial damage, but the 1975 and 1996 floods occurred during the off-season. Although the January 1996 flood left substantial damage, the worst occurred after the waters receded, when everything froze, making cleanup and repair throughout the amusement park difficult. The September 2004 flood, caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ivan, was only a half-day affair, and the amusement park partially reopened by mid-afternoon.

On June 28, 2006, another large flood struck Knoebels. About 90 percent of the amusement park was underwater just prior to the July 4th weekend. As the waters began to recede, 60 percent of the park&#x27;s attractions were reopened within two days, and 90 percent within four days. Because over 100 tons of mud had to be dug out of the Crystal Pool, it was closed for 10 days. The last ride to return to operation was the Kiddie Panther Cars, whose repairs took almost three weeks.

In 2008, the park’s dark ride was the subject of a one-hour documentary, &quot;Laff In The Dark’s Behind The Scenes At Knoebel’s Haunted House&quot;.

On September 7, 2011, Knoebels experienced another flood, this time caused by Tropical Storm Lee. Water levels neared those of the flood of 1972, and damages exceeded that flood. The majority of the park reopened the following weekend, having missed only two days of operation.

For the 2013 season, Knoebels added StratosFear, the park&#x27;s tallest ride at . In 2015, a new roller coaster opened named Impulse, which replaced two former rides, the bumper boats and boat tag.

On July 23, 2018, Knoebels was flooded when a creek overflowed and flooded the park. About 150 employees aided in cleaning up the park. The park then flooded again on July 25, 2018. The park reopened on July 27, 2018.

In 2023, the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum acquired a trolley that had been converted into a cottage at Knoebels.

== Admissions ==
The park offers free admission, free parking, and free entertainment. Visitors are able to ride the park&#x27;s attractions by purchasing either pay-one-price, all-day/unlimited-access wristbands (which are not usually available on weekends, except near the beginning and end of each season), limited-access hand stamps, or books of tickets, with hand stamp costs varying depending on the height of the rider. Knoebels has several hand stamp options, such as &quot;Sundown Plan&quot; and &quot;Bargain Nights&quot;, when the park offers discounts on regular ride passes. Knoebels all-day passes do not include the Haunted Mansion or the Crystal Pool, which are additional fees.

== Rides and attractions ==
=== Roller coasters ===
Knoebels has six operating roller coasters. Knoebels&#x27; two main wooden roller coasters are well known, with Phoenix consistently rated in top ten lists and Twister ranking high as well.

=== Carousels ===
Knoebels has two carousels: one small merry-go-round in Kiddieland (added in 1976) which was built by Stein &amp; Goldstein in 1910 of which is one of only two Stein &amp; Goldstein carousels still standing; and Grand Carousel, a 1913 carousel built by Kremer&#x27;s Carousel Works in Long Island City, with a frame by Charles I. D. Looff, and 63 hand-carved horses by Charles Carmel. It was purchased on January 26, 1942 from Riverside Park in Piscataway Township, New Jersey, for $4,000 (equal to $ today) and relocated to Knoebels. Today, Knoebels&#x27; Grand Carousel is one of the largest carousels in the world, with 63 horses and 3 chariots. It is one of the few carousels remaining with a working ring dispenser, allowing riders on the outside row of horses to reach out and grab steel rings as they pass. The rider who grabs the brass ring has the fee of the ride waived. Three band organs provide music for the riders. The largest, &quot;Frati&quot;, was built in Germany in 1888 by Frati &amp; Co. Berlin, and was converted to Artizan rolls in the 1920s. The smaller, outside organ is &quot;Berni&quot;, a 1910 Gebruder Bruder, style 107, sold in the US by the August Berni Organ Company in New York. Frati and Berni have operated at Knoebels since their purchase in 1942. The smallest organ is a Wilhem Bruder organ, model 79, converted to a Wurlitzer 125 duplex roll system, and restored in 1996. Grand Carousel has consistently been voted the best carousel in the Golden Ticket Awards competition held by &quot;Amusement Today&quot; since 2007. The carousel competition was retired in 2019, because the Grand Carousel was undefeated. Today, Grand Carousel is the second-oldest ride in the park. The S&amp;G Carousel is the oldest at 113 years old in the 2023 season.

=== Restaurants and food ===
Knoebels has restaurants throughout the park, both sit-down and counter service in nature. These eateries have contributed toward the park winning awards from organizations which judge amusement park food, including &quot;Amusement Today&#x27;s&quot; Golden Ticket Award for Best Food every year from 2000 to 2012. The park tied with Dollywood in 2013, but Knoebels reclaimed the prize in 2015, 2016, and 2018.

The park&#x27;s Cesari&#x27;s Pizza, now simply named Pizza, and the International Food Court were featured on a Food Network special. The alligator bites served at the International Food Court were selected by Delish.com as one of the top seven daring amusement park foods.

==== Three Ponds Golf Course ====
Knoebels Three Ponds Golf Course is located on Pennsylvania Route 487, roughly a quarter mile from the park and campground. It is a par 71 eighteen-hole golf course which provides two nine-hole layouts. There is also a restaurant on the golf course grounds.

== Incidents ==
In 1999, an attorney representing two girls who sustained injuries while riding Speed Slide discovered 15 injuries had been reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Bureau of Ride and Measurement Standards in recent years. Both girls underwent emergency surgery. The park was charged with negligence, failure to monitor the amount of force of the water and its effect on riders, failure to fix defects, and failure to provide adequate warnings to riders. Both of the plaintiffs fully recovered.

<doc id="590370" wikidata="Q323610" url="?curid=590370" title="Stephen Van Rensselaer">
<text>Stephen Van Rensselaer III (; November 1, 1764January 26, 1839) was an American landowner, businessman, militia officer, and politician. A graduate of Harvard College, at age 21, Van Rensselaer took control of Rensselaerswyck, his family&#x27;s manor. He developed the land by encouraging tenants to settle it and granting them perpetual leases at moderate rates, which enabled the tenants to use more of their capital to make their farms and businesses productive.

Active in politics as a Federalist, Van Rensselaer served in the New York State Assembly and New York State Senate, and as the lieutenant governor of New York. After the demise of the Federalist Party, Van Rensselaer was a John Quincy Adams supporter and served in the United States House of Representatives for one partial term and three full ones. Van Rensselaer was a supporter of higher education; he served on the board of trustees for several schools and colleges and was the founder of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He was also a civic activist and philanthropist and was a founder of Albany&#x27;s public library and the city&#x27;s Institute of History &amp; Arts.

Long active in the militia, Van Rensselaer attained the rank of major general; he commanded troops on the New York–Canada border during the War of 1812, but resigned his commission after defeat at the Battle of Queenston Heights. After Van Rensselaer&#x27;s 1839 death, efforts by his sons to collect past due lease payments led to the Anti-Rent War, and the break up and sale of the manor. As the heir to and then owner of one of the largest estates in New York, Van Rensselaer&#x27;s holdings made him the tenth richest American of all time, based on the ratio of his fortune to contemporary GDP.

==Early life==
Van Rensselaer was born in New York City, the eldest child of Stephen van Rensselaer II, the ninth patroon of Rensselaerswyck, a large land grant in Upstate New York awarded to his ancestor Kiliaen Van Rensselaer by the Dutch Republic born in Massachit or Leukwaken when the region was part of the colony of New Netherland. His mother was Catharina Livingston, daughter of Philip Livingston, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His family was very wealthy, and the Van Rensselaer Manor House was a rich childhood environment for the young boy to grow up in. However, his father died in 1769 when Van Rensselaer was only five. He grew up with the men on his maternal side and became very interested in the sciences such as mathematics, biology and chemistry.

Van Rensselaer was raised by his mother and stepfather, the Rev. Eilardus Westerlo, whom his mother married in 1775, and his Livingston grandfather. His uncle, Abraham Ten Broeck, administered the Van Rensselaer estate after the untimely death of Van Rensselaer&#x27;s father. From an early age, Van Rensselaer was raised to succeed his father as lord of the manor. Stephen&#x27;s younger brother Philip S. Van Rensselaer (1767–1824), later served as Mayor of Albany from 1799 to 1816 and again from 1819 to 1820.

Van Rensselaer began attending the College of New Jersey (later Princeton); since it was near to battles of the ongoing American Revolution, he was later sent to Harvard College, from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with an A.B. degree in 1782.

==Early career==
On his 21st birthday, Van Rensselaer took possession of Rensselaerswyck, his family&#x27;s 1,200 square mile (3,072 km2) estate, and began a long tenure as lord of the manor. Van Rensselaer desired to profit from the land, but was extremely reluctant to sell it off. Instead, he developed the land by granting perpetual leases at moderate rates; Van Rensselaer derived a steady rental income from his property, while tenants were able to become successful farmers without having to pay a large purchase price up front. This meant that they could invest more in their operations, which led to increased productivity in the area. Over time, Van Rensselaer became landlord to more than 80,000 tenants. He generally proved to be a lenient landlord; he accepted produce such as grain and firewood in place of cash for rent payments, and when tenants found themselves in financial difficulty, he usually preferred to accept late or partial payments rather than evict them. One facet of the leases Van Rensselaer granted was the &quot;quarter-sale&quot;—tenants who sold their leases were required to pay Van Rensselaer one fourth of the sale price or one additional year&#x27;s rent. Over time, this requirement became a point of contention between Van Rensselaer and the tenants, which in part led to the Anti-Rent War.

In the 1790 United States census, it was recorded that he owned fifteen slaves. By the time of the 1830 census, he had none, in keeping with New York&#x27;s gradual emancipation law, under which all enslaved people in the state were freed by 1827. Van Rensselaer later became an advocate of enabling African Americans to emigrate to colonies in Africa, such as Liberia, and he served as a vice president of the Albany Auxiliary Society and the American Colonization Society.

In 1791, Van Rensselaer was one of the incorporators of the Albany Library, which evolved over time into the Albany Public Library, and he was chosen to serve on the board of trustees. In 1797, Van Rensselaer was an organizer of the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike Company, and served on its board of directors.

==Political career==
A Federalist, Van Rensselaer was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1789 to 1791, and the New York State Senate from 1791 to 1796.

He was Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1795 to 1801, elected with Governor John Jay. Van Rensselaer, over his time in politics, acquired a reputation as something of a reformer, voting in favor of extending suffrage and going against much of New York&#x27;s upper class in doing so. In 1801, Van Rensselaer presided over the state constitutional convention, was the Federalist nominee for Governor of New York, and lost to George Clinton, 24,808 votes to 20,843.

He was one of the first to advocate for a canal from the Hudson River to the Great Lakes and was appointed to a commission to investigate the route in 1810, reporting favorably to the Assembly in 1811. Van Rensselaer served on the Erie Canal Commission for 23 years (1816–1839), fourteen of which he served as its president. In 1821, he was a member of the New York State Constitutional Convention.

In 1822, he won the special election for the seat in the House of Representatives from which his cousin Solomon had resigned. He served from February 27, 1822, to March 3, 1829, during the Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth Congresses; during the last three sessions, he was the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture.

===Role in deciding 1824 presidential election===
In 1825 Van Rensselaer cast the vote that likely decided the presidential election in favor of John Quincy Adams. Because none of the four candidates received a majority of electoral votes in the 1824 presidential election, the U.S. House had to choose from the top three finishers—Adams, Andrew Jackson, and William H. Crawford. House members voted first individually by state, and then each state cast one ballot for the candidate who received a majority of the state&#x27;s House delegation; a candidate had to carry 13 state delegations to win the election. Van Rensselaer had intended to vote for Crawford, but changed his mind and voted for Adams. His vote gave Adams a majority of the New York delegation; winning New York gave Adams 13 states in the House vote, to seven for Jackson and four for Crawford.

==Military career==
In 1786, Van Rensselaer was appointed a major in the Albany County Regiment of the New York Militia. He became commander of the regiment two years later as a lieutenant colonel, and was subsequently promoted to colonel. In 1801 he was promoted to major general as commander of the state militia&#x27;s cavalry division.

===War of 1812===
Van Rensselaer&#x27;s militia experience led to an appointment to command troops during the War of 1812. When war was declared on Great Britain in June 1812, Van Rensselaer was a leading Federalist candidate for Governor of New York. Democratic-Republican Party leaders, including President James Madison and incumbent New York Governor Daniel D. Tompkins, devised a way to remove Van Rensselaer from the campaign by offering him command of the Army of the Centre—U.S. militia and regular Army troops massing in upstate New York for an invasion of Canada. If Van Rensselaer declined a military leadership role during a time of war, he would lose esteem in the eyes of the voters. If he accepted, he would likely be unable to run for governor.

Van Rensselaer accepted; despite having held high rank in the militia, he was largely inexperienced at leading large bodies of troops. As a condition of his acceptance, his cousin Solomon, who had more military experience, was appointed his aide-de-camp. But the Army of the Centre consisted largely of untrained, inexperienced militiamen; under the Constitution, which stressed that the role of the militia was to enforce laws, prevent insurrection, and repel invasion, they did not have to cross into Canada to fight.

The British were in the process of fortifying the Queenston Heights that Van Rensselaer would have to attack, and his officers were itching for action despite their general&#x27;s desire to delay until his troops were better trained and organized. To make matters worse, Brigadier General Alexander Smyth, Van Rensselaer&#x27;s subordinate, had a large force of regular Army troops that was theoretically under Van Rensselaer&#x27;s command, but Smyth refused to subordinate himself to a militia officer. With some of his officers planning to try and force him from command, Van Rensselaer decided to act without Smyth.

On October 13, 1812, Van Rensselaer launched an attack on the British position that would evolve into the Battle of Queenston Heights. Though initially successful, Van Rensselaer&#x27;s inadequate preparations and his plan of attack were clearly main reasons for what became a major defeat. He was unable to secure the element of surprise, he did not procure enough boats for his men to cross the Niagara River easily, and he was even unable to supply his soldiers with sufficient ammunition. Despite significantly outnumbering the British in the early stages of the battle, the American soldiers, untried and untrained, sometimes refused to cross to the Canadian side of the river. Once the tide of the battle turned, Van Rensselaer was not even able to coax the boatmen into going back over to rescue the doomed attack force. His forces were badly beaten by British troops under generals Isaac Brock and, after Brock&#x27;s death, Roger Hale Sheaffe.

The defeat at Queenston Heights spelled the end to Van Rensselaer&#x27;s active military career; after the battle, he resigned his post. He continued to serve in the militia and was the senior major general in the state at the time of his death. Despite his military setback, Van Rensselaer was still the Federalist candidate for governor in April 1813; he lost to Tompkins 43,324 votes to 39,713.

==Later career==
After the war, Van Rensselaer continued his service on the Erie Canal Commission, and between 1820 and 1823 commissioned an agricultural and geological survey of the canal&#x27;s surroundings, at his own expense. He also held many significant posts after the war. In 1820, he was elected president of the state Board of Agriculture. Also in 1820, he was an incorporator of the Albany Savings Bank, and was elected to serve as the bank&#x27;s president.

In 1824, Van Rensselaer was one of the organizers of the Albany Institute, and was elected its president. This organization later merged with another to form the Albany Institute of History &amp; Art. He was also active in the American Lyceum organization, and served as its president.

When the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company received its corporate charter from the State of New York in 1830, Van Rensselaer was an original incorporator, and he went on to serve as a member of the company&#x27;s board of directors. New York Life Insurance and Trust operated until 1922, when it merged with the Bank of New York to become the Bank of New York &amp; Trust Company.

Following the 1834 death in France of the Marquis de Lafayette, Van Rensselaer was appointed marshal for the Albany-area commemorations. He led the parade of militia members, fire fighters, Revolutionary War veterans and others, which culminated in speeches and a eulogy by William Buell Sprague.

===Higher education advocate===
Van Rensselaer was elected one of the members of the Williams College Corporation in 1794.

In 1812, Van Rensselaer took part in the incorporation of Albany&#x27;s Lancaster School, an institution dedicated to providing an education for children whose parents could not afford to send them to school, and he served on the school&#x27;s board of trustees. In 1813, Van Rensselaer was one of the organizers of The Albany Academy, and was chosen to serve as the first president of the school&#x27;s board of trustees.

Van Rensselaer was a member of the University of the State of New York Board of Regents from 1819 to 1839, and from 1835 to 1839 he was the board&#x27;s chancellor.

In 1824 Van Rensselaer and Amos Eaton established the Rensselaer School (now known as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, or RPI) &quot;for the purpose of instructing persons, who may choose to apply themselves, in the application of science to the common purposes of life&quot;. Since its founding, RPI has developed a reputation for academic excellence, particularly in the field of engineering.

From 1829 to 1839, Van Rensselaer served as a member of the Rutgers College board of trustees.

===Religious activities===
Van Rensselaer was long active in the Dutch Reformed Church; he served several terms as a deacon and elder of the First Reformed Church in Albany, and attended numerous synod meetings and similar gatherings as a delegate. He was active in the American Home Missionary Society, and served as the organization&#x27;s president in the 1820s. In 1834, he donated a lot at the corner of Green and South Ferry Streets in Albany for construction of the Third Reformed Church. For many years, Van Rensselaer was a member of the Albany Bible Society, and he served on its board of managers. He was also active on the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, and served as vice president.

===Masonic Grand Master===
Van Rensselaer was an active Mason beginning early in his adulthood; from 1825 to 1829 he served as the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New York. His leadership of the statewide organization coincided with the rise of the Anti-Masonic Party in Western New York, and Van Rensselaer forged an alliance with the Democrats of the Albany Regency led by Martin Van Buren and Enos T. Throop as a way to blunt the political influence of the Anti-Masons.

==Personal life==
Several members of Van Rensselaer&#x27;s extended family served in Congress including Jeremiah Van Rensselaer (1741–1810), Killian K. Van Rensselaer (1763–1845), and Solomon Van Rensselaer (1774–1852).

In June 1783, Van Rensselaer married Margarita &quot;Peggy&quot; Schuyler (1758–1801), a distant cousin and the daughter of Revolutionary War general Philip Schuyler, and sister-in-law of Alexander Hamilton. Their marriage resulted in three children, all of whom were baptized at the First Dutch Reformed Church in Albany. Only one of their children survived to adulthood:

* Catherine Schuyler Van Rensselaer (1784–1797), who died young
* Stephen Van Rensselaer (1786–1787), who died young
* Stephen Van Rensselaer IV (1789–1868), inherited the east side of Rensselaerwyck and inherited the manor in 1839 by his father&#x27;s will. He graduated from Princeton in 1808. He served as major general of militia. During the anti-rent troubles in 1839 he sold his townships, and at his death the manor passed out of the hands of his descendants.

After Schuyler&#x27;s death in 1801, in 1802 Van Rensselaer married Cornelia Bell Paterson, the daughter of William Paterson. Together, they had:

* Catherine Van Rensselaer (1803–1874), who married Gouverneur Morris Wilkins (d. 1871)
* William Paterson Van Rensselaer (1805–1872), who married Eliza Bayard Rogers (1811–1835), and after her death, her sister, Sarah Rogers (1810–1887), both were granddaughters of William Bayard Jr.
* Philip Stephen Van Rensselaer (1806–1871), who married Mary Rebecca Tallmadge (1817–1872), daughter of James Tallmadge Jr.
* Cortlandt Van Rensselaer (1808–1860), a noted Presbyterian clergyman.
* Henry Bell Van Rensselaer (1810–1864), a politician and general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, who married Elizabeth Ray King, a granddaughter of Rufus King.
* Cornelia Paterson Van Rensselaer (1812–1890), who married Robert James Turnbull Jr. (1807–1854), son of Robert James Turnbull.

===Descendants===

His granddaughter, Justine Van Rensselaer (1828–1912), married Dr. Howard Townsend, a noted physician at Albany Medical College. His grandson, Stephen Van Rensselaer Cruger married Julia Grinnell Storrow, a popular American novelist.

His great-grandson was John Eliot Thayer (1862–1933), an amateur ornithologist. His great-granddaughter, Cornelia Van Rensselaer Thayer (1849–1903) married J. Hampden Robb (1846–1911), a New York State Senator, in 1868. Their daughter—Van Rensselaer&#x27;s 2× great-granddaughter, Cornelia Van Rensselaer Thayer (b. 1881)—married Danish Count Carl Moltke (1869–1935) in 1907.

Through his great-grandson, Stephen Van Rensselaer Crosby (1868–1959), he was the 2× great-grandfather of Henry Sturgis Crosby (1898–1929), a bon vivant, poet, and publisher who for some epitomized the Lost Generation in American literature, who was married to Mary Phelps Jacob (1891–1970).

<text>Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth (4 April 1892 in Heidelberg – 6 May 1979 in Heidelberg) was a German astronomer and a prolific discoverer of 395 minor planets.

== Scientific career ==
From 1912 to 1957, Reinmuth was working as an astronomer at the Heidelberg Observatory () an astronomical observatory on the Königstuhl hill above Heidelberg in southern Germany. He was a member at the minor planet studies group at Astronomisches Rechen-Institut between 1947 and 1950, and later became &quot;Oberobservator&quot; or chief-observer at Heidelberg Observatory until his retirement in 1957. Reinmuth obtained more than 12,500 precise astrometric measurements of minor planets&#x27; positions on photographic plates, an enormous accomplishment before computer-based assistance existed.

== Honours ==
The outer main-belt asteroid 1111 Reinmuthia, discovered by himself at Heidelberg in 1912, was named in his honour ().

== Discoveries ==
Among his most notable discoveries are the two near-Earth objects (NEOs) 1862 Apollo, the namesake of the Apollo group which became the largest group of asteroids within the NEO category with nearly 8,000 members, and 69230 Hermes, famous for being a lost asteroid for more than half a century until its recovery in 2003, and for being the only unnumbered but named asteroid during that period.

He also discovered several large Jupiter trojans including 911 Agamemnon, 1143 Odysseus, 1172 Äneas, 1173 Anchises, 1208 Troilus, 1404 Ajax, 1437 Diomedes and 1749 Telamon. The main-belt asteroid 5535 Annefrank, which he discovered in 1942 during World War II, was later visited by the Stardust spacecraft in 2002. His lowest numbered minor planet discovery is 796 Sarita, an asteroid from the middle region of the main-belt. Reinmuth also discovered two periodic comets of the Jupiter family, namely 30P/Reinmuth and 44P/Reinmuth.

=== Meta-naming ===
The initials of the minor planets through , all discovered by Reinmuth, spell out &quot;G. Stracke&quot;. Gustav Stracke was a German astronomer and orbit computer, who had asked that no planet be named after him. In this manner Reinmuth was able to honour the man whilst honouring his wish:
* 1227 Geranium 
* 1228 Scabiosa
* 1229 Tilia 
* 1230 Riceia 
* 1231 Auricula
* 1232 Cortusa
* 1233 Kobresia
* 1234 Elyna

Later 1019 Strackea, also discovered by Reinmuth, was named after Stracke.

=== List of discovered minor planets ===
Karl Reinmuth is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 395 minor planets made during 1914–1957, with an interruption from April 1943 to July 1949 due to the end and the aftermath of WWII.

<doc id="590389" wikidata="Q558305" url="?curid=590389" title="Baybars II">
<text>Baybars al-Jashankir (; died 1310) or Baybars II, royal name al-Malik al-Muzaffar Rukn ad-Din Baybars aj-Jashankir al-Mansuri (), also known as Abu al-Fath (), was the 12th Mamluk sultan of Egypt in 1309–1310.

==Background==

He was a Circassian Mamluk of Sultan Qalawun and served at the court of Qalawun&#x27;s Sons Al-Ashraf Khalil and Al-Nasir Muhammad. He became an Emir (a prince) then a Jashnakir. During the second reign of Sultan Al-Nasir Mohammed from 1299 to 1309 he was the Vice-Sultan of Egypt. In 1302 he took part in suppressing a rebellion in upper Egypt and in 1303 he was a commander in the Egyptian army that defeated the Mongols led by Qutlugh-Shah at the Battle of Shaqhab.

In 1302, the Mamluk army of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad crushed a Bedouin rebellion in Upper Egypt and &quot;slew mercilessly every Bedouin in the land and carried off their women captive&quot;. G. W. Murray said that &quot;This drastic solution of the Bedouin question removed the pure Arab descendants of the Conquerors from the scene and so enabled the Beja to preserve themselves as an African race practically uninfluenced by Arab blood, while leaving the desert edges of Upper Egypt free for settlement by the Western Bedouin.&quot; The army was led by the Oirat Mongol Mamluk Sayf al-Din Salar and Circassian Mamluk al-Baibars al-Jashnakir (Beibars).

==Etymology of the name==

The monarch&#x27;s name was a combination of Turkic, Persian and Arabic terms. The given name Baibars was a Turco-Mongolian name, meaning &quot;Chosen by the chief/lord&quot;. The title of al-Malike al-Muzaffar was an Arabic honorific title that meant &quot;the victorious king&quot;, and the title Rukn ad-Din was an Arabic honorific title meaning the &quot;pillar of faith&quot;. The second portion, &quot;Jashangir&quot;, is Persian, meaning &quot;Food connoisseur&quot;: the mamluk prince who tastes the Sultan&#x27;s food to make sure it is not poisoned.

==Rise to power and fall==

With Emir Sayf al-Din Salar he dominated the young Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad who, feeling distressed, moved to Al Karak and resigned in 1309. Baibars al-Jashnakir became a Sultan after the position was imposed on him by Emir Sayf al-Din Salar and the Burji Mamluks.

The brief period of his reign (ten months and 24 days) was marked by economical and political unrest in addition to threats from Crusaders and Mongols. The Crusaders who had allied with the Mongol Empire continued to harass Mamluk outposts in the Levant. The poverty-stricken commons kept rampaging the streets of Cairo, calling him &quot;Rakin&quot; (useless) instead of &quot;Rukn&quot; (principal) demanding the return of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad to Egypt. In 1310 Baibars al-Jashnakir stepped down and fled with his Mamluks from the angry mob. Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad returned to Egypt and Baibars al-Jashnakir was arrested and executed on his orders.

==History==
===Mid-twentieth century===
Wilkes University was first established in 1933 by Bucknell University under the name Bucknell University Junior College (BUJC) in Wilkes-Barre. Frank G. Davis, chair of the Education department at Bucknell, first developed the idea of BUJC and served as an early liaison between BUJC and Bucknell. BUJC attracted many students who were the first members of their families to benefit from higher education as the need for junior colleges arose in urban areas. The college opened in downtown Wilkes-Barre, where the first classes were held on the third floor of the Wilkes-Barre Business College building. By 1934, the business college moved out of the building and BUJC had taken it over and continued to grow over the years, acquiring old mansions for student housing, classrooms, and administration offices along the streets of South River and South Franklin. By 1945, the board of trustees formally moved to develop the junior college into a four-year institution.

In 1947, Wilkes College was instituted as an independent, nondenominational four-year college, with programs in the arts, sciences, and a number of professional fields, as well as numerous extracurricular activities. The student body in the postwar period was primarily composed of Luzerne County residents, especially G.I. bill recipients. In the 1950s, increasing numbers of students elected to live on campus, which led to a rapid expansion in on-campus student housing. Increased federal funding for science and engineering in the 1950s led the college to develop academic programs in those areas, build the Stark Learning Center, and increase enrollment.

In 1972, the Wilkes Barre area experienced the devastation of Hurricane/Tropical Storm Agnes that flooded much of the campus and downtown region.
===Late twentieth century===
Wilkes College became Wilkes University in December 1989, and the school officially received university status a month later, in January 1990.

Wilkes University opened the School of Pharmacy in 1996, and in 1999, through a donation from Mrs. Geraldine Nesbitt Orr, the Nesbitt School of Pharmacy was established.

The Thomas P. (Pettus) Shelburne Jr. Telecommunications Center was built under the guidance of chief engineer Carl Brigido and dedicated by Wilkes University in the lower level of the Stark Learning Center in 1996. Secured after a major gift from Shelburne&#x27;s widow Catherine and family and fundraising efforts of long time Communication Studies professors, Bradford L. Kinney and Thomas Bigler. This was the second television studio on campus, previously located in two small rooms on the second floor of the Stark Learning Center. The Shelburne Center became the first dedicated space built with first use equipment for the direct purpose of media education with multiple editing bays, two studio spaces, educational break out teaching space and director offices and storage. The Shelburne Center served for twenty years as the precursor to the Clayton and Theresa Karambelas Media and Communications Center dedicated in 2017 that consolidated all of the university media holdings for instruction.

===Early twenty-first century===
The Jay S. Sidhu School of Business &amp; Leadership was created in 2004 and the university purchased a building in downtown Wilkes-Barre. to house the expanding school. Initially named the Center on Main, the building houses the Sidhu School of Business and Leadership, an indoor track and field, and ropes course. In 2021 the Center on Main was formally named after Ron and Rhea Simms to be known as Simms Center on Main.

The Henry Student Center was expanded in 2005.

By 2014, Wilkes University grew to include eight academic buildings, 20 residence halls, nine administrative buildings, and other facilities such as the Eugene S. Farley Library, the Henry Student Center, and athletic complexes.

On April 17, 2015, Wilkes University dedicated the main university mailroom facility located on the second floor of the Henry Student Center as the Edward Elgonitis Sr. Mailroom or simply &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Mailroom&quot; in honor of the thirty-three year dedicated Wilkes University staff member.

On August 31, 2017, the university dedicated the Clayton and Theresa Karambelas Media and Communication Center, built within the structure of the original Bartikowsky Jewelers building on 25 West South Street by the Sordoni Contractors to be the first constructed to hold all the university media instruction holdings into one consolidated building. The building also houses the Sordoni Art Gallery that moved from its original location on the first level of the Stark Learning Center.

In March 2020, Wilkes University temporarily suspended in-person instruction and evacuated the campus as a safety measure to address the global COVID-19 pandemic. Under the leadership of interim president Paul S. Adams, the university continued basic operations and was able to safely re-open following strict protocols. Commencement for the Class of 2020 was postponed and eventually held in-person along with the Class of 2021.

<doc id="590397" wikidata="Q1178627" url="?curid=590397" title="David Gareji monastery complex">
<text>David Gareji () is a rock-hewn Georgian Orthodox monastery complex located in the Kakheti region of Eastern Georgia, on the half-desert slopes of Mount Gareja on the edge of Iori Plateau, some 60–70 km southeast of Georgia&#x27;s capital Tbilisi. The complex includes hundreds of cells, churches, chapels, refectories and living quarters hollowed out of the rock face.

Part of the complex of David Gareji (Bertubani Monastery) is located on the Azerbaijan–Georgia border and has become subject to a border dispute between the two countries. The area is also home to protected animal species and evidence of some of the oldest human habitations in the region.

==History==
The complex was founded in the 6th century by David of Gareji, one of the thirteen Assyrian monks who arrived in the country at the same time. His disciples Dodo and Luciane expanded the original lavra and founded two other monasteries known as Dodo&#x27;s Rka (literally, &quot;the horn of Dodo&quot;) and Natlismtsemeli (&quot;the Baptist&quot;). The monastery saw further development under the guidance of the 9th-century Georgian saint Hilarion the Iberian. The convent was particularly patronized by the Georgian royal and noble families. The 12th-century Georgian king Demetre I, the author of the famous Georgian hymn &quot;Thou Art a Vineyard&quot;, even chose David Gareji as a place of his confinement after he abdicated the throne.

Despite the harsh environment, the monastery remained an important centre of religious and cultural activity for many centuries; at certain periods the monasteries owned extensive agricultural lands and many villages. The renaissance of wall painting chronologically coincides with the general development of the life in the David Gareja monasteries. The high artistic skill of David Gareja wall paintings made them an indispensable part of world treasure. From the late 11th to the early 13th centuries, the economic and cultural development of David Gareja reached its highest phase, reflecting the general prosperity of the medieval Kingdom of Georgia. New monasteries Udabno, Bertubani and Chichkhituri were built, the old ones were enlarged and re-organized.

With the downfall of the Georgian monarchy, the monastery suffered a lengthy period of decline and devastation by the Mongol army (1265), but was later restored by the Georgian kings. It survived the Safavid attack of 1615, when the monks were massacred and the monastery&#x27;s unique manuscripts and important works of Georgian art destroyed, to be resurrected under Onopre Machutadze, who was appointed Father Superior of David Gareja in 1690.
After the violent Bolshevik takeover of Georgia in 1921, the monastery was closed down and remained uninhabited. In the years of the Soviet–Afghan War, the monastery&#x27;s territory was used as a training ground for the Soviet military that inflicted damage to the unique cycle of murals in the monastery. In 1987, a group of Georgian students led by the young writer Dato Turashvili launched a series of protests. Although, the Soviet defense ministry officials finally agreed to move a military firing range from the monastery, the shelling was resumed in October 1988, giving rise to generalized public outrage. After some 10,000 Georgians demonstrated in the streets of Tbilisi and a group of students launched a hunger strike at the monastery, the army base was finally removed.

After the restoration of Georgia&#x27;s independence in 1991, the monastery life in David Gareja was revived. However, in 1996, the Georgian defense ministry resumed military exercises in the area, leading to renewed public protests. In May 1997, hundreds of Georgian NGO activists set up their tents in the middle of the army&#x27;s firing range and blocked the military maneuvers. The army officials finally bowed to the public pressure and the exercises were banned.

The monastery remains active today and serves as a popular destination of tourism and pilgrimage.

==Georgian monastery complex ==
Because the complex is partially located on the territory of Azerbaijan, it has become subject to a border dispute between Georgia and Azerbaijan, with ongoing talks since 1991. Georgian monks at the monastery say that &quot;they see the dispute as the result of Soviet scheming to undermine relations between Christian Georgians and Muslim Azerbaijanis.&quot; Giorgi Manjgaladze, Georgia&#x27;s deputy foreign minister proposed that Georgia would be willing to exchange other territory for the remainder of David Gareja because of its historical and cultural significance to the Georgians. Baku disapproves of this land swap because of David Gareja&#x27;s strategic military importance. &quot;There is no room for territorial exchange. There are no negotiations over this issue,&quot; stated Azerbaijan&#x27;s deputy foreign minister Khalaf Khalafov.
In April 2007, Khalafov told a press conference in that it was &quot;out of the question&quot; for Georgia to &quot;give up its claims to the borderlands&quot; including David Gareja. He then made a controversial statement that the monastery &quot;was home to the Caucasian Albanians, who are believed to have been the earliest inhabitants of Azerbaijan.&quot; This prompted a response from Georgian foreign minister Gela Bezhuashvili. &quot;It is absolutely unclear to me why my colleague made these remarks,&quot; he told reporters in Tbilisi. &quot;His history lessons are absolutely incomprehensible. He should read up on world history.&quot;

The Albanian theory is also supported by some Azerbaijani historians who are strongly opposed to transferring any part of their territory to Georgia. &quot;The monastery was inside Georgia only in the 12th century,&quot; stated Ismail Umudlu, an Azerbaijani journalist and historian. &quot;Both before and after this period, the area was part of a state to which Azerbaijan is a successor.&quot; Georgian art historian Dimitri Tumanishvili dismissed this claim and stated that the complex &quot;is covered in the work of Georgian masters.&quot; &quot;There are Georgian inscriptions everywhere dating back to the sixth century,&quot; he said &quot;There are no traces of another culture there. After that, I don’t think you need any further proof.&quot; &quot;The idea that this monastery was founded by the Caucasus Albanians is simply absurd,&quot; said Zaza Datunashvili, a monk from David Gareja. &quot;You might as well say that Georgians built the Great Wall of China.&quot;

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili downplayed the dispute and said that &quot;it can be resolved through friendly dialogue.&quot; However, Giga Bukia, a member of the Georgian parliament with the Rightist Opposition stated that &quot;Georgians will never, under any circumstances, give up this territory&quot; and also accused the government of softening its position on the complex in order to secure financial aid from Azerbaijan. &quot;Azerbaijan has absolutely no historical rights to this land,&quot; he said. &quot;And what is this talk of it being a strategic location? Are they planning to go to war with Georgia?&quot;

Azerbaijani officials confirmed that Azerbaijan &quot;is open to implementation of joint projects with Georgia for the restoration of the complex.&quot; However, official suggestions that the complex could be a &quot;shared tourist zone&quot; have sparked indignation from the Georgian public. Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia Ilia II said that &quot;the monastery was a holy shrine that should lie entirely on Georgian soil.&quot; A number of fresh rounds of &quot;border delimitation&quot; talks have been conducted between Azerbaijani and Georgian authorities (in Tbilisi and then in Baku).

== Keshikchidag Reserve ==
The part of David Gareji monastery complex that is located in Azerbaijan has a historical and cultural reserve status according to the presidential order No.2563 dated December 19, 2007 and named as State Historical and Cultural Reserve &quot;Keshikcidag&quot;. There are 70 caves, 2 temples, one fortress, a sacred place, approximately 100 grave reminds kurgan, 23 water wells, 14 food stores, and about 30 shelters. One of the highest altitudes in the State Historical and Cultural Reserve &quot;Keshikcidag was named &quot;Ilham Aliyev peak&quot; in honor of the President of Azerbaijan. The reserve covers approximately stretches Azerbaijani-Georgian border in Jeyranchol, Gatardagh chain, north-east from Jandar lake, on the mountainous area that are above sea level. The reserve consists of natural and artificial caves, castle and monastery carved in Early and Middle Ages. According to the Azerbaijani side, Keshikchi gala (Guardian castle) was built by the native population of Caucasus Albania in the 5th century AD and meant “guardian”. Therefore, it is considered as similar to the other castles in Azerbaijan territory because of its architectural structure characteristics. It was discovered that the Keshikchi gala in the area was originally built for defense purposes in the Middle Ages, where it was inhabited by the ancient Caucasian Albanian. The natural caves date back in the early stages and the artificial caves are considered to be found between in 9th and 15th centuries.

== Delimitation process ==
Delimitation and demarcation process between Azerbaijan and Georgia affects the David Gareji Monastery Complex. As the complex lies along the borders, it causes a debate between the two nations. On May 14, 2019, Deputy Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Khalaf Khalafov and Deputy Foreign Minister of Georgia Lasha Darsaliya held a meeting in Baku based on the delimitation of the state border between the two countries. Following the independence of the two countries, relevant state commissions on delimitation and demarcation of the state border between Azerbaijan and Georgia were established and 11 meetings of the Commission were held so far. Within the framework of this process, an agreement was reached on the delimitation of the most part of the Azerbaijani-Georgian border (in total ). Currently, a section including the area that the monastery complex located is the main objective for both countries. Because of strong economic and cultural ties between Azerbaijan and Georgia, both countries have peaceful intentions in the determination of borders. During a meeting held in Azerbaijan, on 27 February 2019 between President of Georgia, Salome Zurabishvili and the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, both sides clearly emphasized consensus on delimitation process to be done by considering the existing bonds between the two countries.

<text>The African American National Biography Project is a joint project of the Hutchins Center for African &amp; African American Research at Harvard University and Oxford University Press. The object of the project is to publish and maintain a database of African Americans similar in scope to the &quot;American National Biography&quot;.

The African American National Biography (AANB) was published in print in 2008, with a supplement published in 2013.

The database, which is continually updated, includes many entries by noted scholars, among them Sojourner Truth by Nell Irvin Painter; W. E. B. Du Bois by Thomas Holt; Rosa Parks by Darlene Clark Hine; Miles Davis by John Szwed; Muhammad Ali by Gerald Early; and President Barack Obama by Randall Kennedy. In 2008 the AANB was selected as a CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title, was named a &quot;Library Journal&quot; Best Reference work, and awarded Booklist Editors’ Choice — Top of the List.

The general editors of the project are Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, while the executive editor is Steven J. Niven of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute.

<doc id="590423" wikidata="Q530496" url="?curid=590423" title="Viva Hate">
<text>Viva Hate is the debut solo studio album by English singer Morrissey. It was released on 14 March 1988 by His Master&#x27;s Voice, six months after the final studio album by the Smiths, &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot; (1987).

Vini Reilly, the leader of the English post-punk band the Durutti Column, played guitar on the album. Producer Stephen Street, who had contributed to multiple Smiths releases, served as the bassist and wrote the music.

==Background==
&quot;Viva Hate&quot; origins date to when Smiths co-producer Stephen Street sent Morrissey demos that could potentially be used for Smiths B-sides released after Johnny Marr&#x27;s departure from the band. Morrissey liked the demos and decided to collaborate with Street for a debut solo album. Morrissey commented on his and Street&#x27;s partnership in a 1988 interview, &quot;Working with Stephen as a producer is quite different from writing with him, and even his personality has changed dramatically, within this sphere; he&#x27;s more relaxed, and more exciting.&quot; Morrissey also contrasted the &quot;aggressive&quot; musicianship of Marr with Street&#x27;s &quot;gentle side,&quot; describing the latter as &quot;something I find totally precious.&quot;

&quot;Viva Hate&quot; was recorded between October and December 1987. For the album, Street played bass and recruited drummer Andrew Paresi and Durutti Column guitarist Vini Reilly. Morrissey praised the &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;erotic&quot; quality of Reilly&#x27;s guitar work while also noting his sense of humor.

After the album was released, Reilly claimed every song on the album except &quot;Suedehead&quot; had been composed by Morrissey and Reilly. Street has denied this. In an interview in 2014 Vini Reilly said &quot;I want to talk about Stephen Street about whom I&#x27;ve said wrong things in the past; this is not an excuse, this is fact, I have suffered from what they call &#x27;displaced anger&#x27; and this is where you&#x27;re very angry with yourself and you don&#x27;t understand, you just shout at people you really care about.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Viva Hate&quot; was released on 14 March 1988 by record label His Master&#x27;s Voice.

EMI Australia considered &quot;Viva Hate&quot; too harsh a title and renamed the album &quot;Education in Reverse&quot; for LP release in Australia and New Zealand, the same title appearing as an etching on the vinyl.

The American release included the track &quot;Hairdresser on Fire&quot;, which had been released in the UK as a B-side to &quot;Suedehead&quot;, as track 9. This same track was released on a 7&quot; single that was sold with the album in Japan.

The track &quot;Margaret on the Guillotine&quot;, which described the death of then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher as a &quot;wonderful dream&quot;, led to Morrissey briefly being questioned by the Special Branch.

It was certified Gold by the RIAA on 16 November 1993.

In 1997, EMI, in celebration of their 100th anniversary, released a remastered special edition of this album in the UK. It features different cover art and a different booklet (it has a photograph of a billboard for the 1993 live album &quot;Beethoven Was Deaf&quot; and drops the lyrics) as well as eight bonus tracks – only one of which was contemporaneous with the album. &quot;Hairdresser on Fire&quot; does not appear on this version.

A newly remastered, special edition of &quot;Viva Hate&quot;, supervised by Stephen Street, was released on 2 April 2012. This edition controversially omits, along with the name of Vini Reilly, one of the original album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;The Ordinary Boys&quot;, and includes the session outtake &quot;Treat Me Like a Human Being&quot;. Also, the extended fadeout of &quot;Late Night, Maudlin Street&quot; has been changed. Stephen Street has said that he felt these changes were a mistake but that the track selection was changed at Morrissey&#x27;s insistence. &quot;Hairdresser on Fire&quot;, again, is also not included on this edition. Additionally, the typeface font on the front cover had been changed.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Viva Hate&quot; was generally well received by music critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which had expected the now solo artist to &quot;wallow&quot;, called the album &quot;a tight, fairly disciplined affair&quot;. In its retrospective review, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the album &quot;one of Morrissey&#x27;s most interesting records, and certainly his riskiest&quot;, and that its &quot;strange mix of pomp and minimal languor makes &quot;Viva Hate&quot; the only Morrissey LP you&#x27;d consider listening to just for its music&quot;.

A negative review came from &quot;Spin&quot;, who wrote &quot;without guitarist/composer Johnny Marr at his side, the mahatma of mope rock seems to have gone out for a nice depressing stroll without noticing that he didn&#x27;t have a stitch to wear&quot;.

&quot;Viva Hate&quot; was listed by &quot;Q&quot; as one of the top 50 albums of 1988. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2005).

<doc id="590432" wikidata="Q1677361" url="?curid=590432" title="Jackson Hole">
<text>Jackson Hole (originally called Jackson&#x27;s Hole by mountain men) is a valley between the Gros Ventre and Teton mountain ranges in the U.S. state of Wyoming, near the border with Idaho, in Teton County. The term &quot;hole&quot; was used by early trappers, or mountain men, as a term for a large mountain valley. These low-lying valleys, surrounded by mountains and containing rivers and streams, are good habitat for beavers and other fur-bearing animals. Jackson Hole is 55 miles (89 km) long by 6-to-13 miles (10-to-21 km) wide and is a graben valley with an average elevation of 6,800 ft (2,100 m), its lowest point being near the southern park boundary at 6,350 ft (1,940 m).

==History==
The valley was used by Native Americans for hunting and ceremonial purposes. It was not known to harbor year-round human settlement prior to the 1870s. Descriptions of the valley and its features were recorded in the journals of John Colter, who had been a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. After returning to the Rocky Mountains, Colter entered the region in 1807 in the vicinity of Togwotee Pass and became the first European-American to see the valley. 

The town of Jackson was named in late 1893 by Margaret Simpson, who, at the time, was receiving mail at her home as there was no post office. She named the area in order for easterners to be able to forward mail west. Jackson, which became incorporated in 1914, was named after David Edward &quot;Davy&quot; Jackson, who trapped beaver in the area in the late 1820s with a partner in the firm of Smith, Jackson &amp; Sublette. Jackson, of Irish and Scottish descent, was one of the first European-Americans to spend an entire winter in the valley.

Because the soil is not ideal for raising crops, the valley was used for cattle grazing, and tourism quickly became popular with the establishment of dude ranches.

==Settlements==
The only incorporated area in the valley is Jackson, located at its southern end. Other communities in the valley include Hoback, Kelly, Moose (Moose Wilson Road), Moran Junction, Teton Village, and Wilson. West of Jackson, Teton Pass crosses the southern end of the Teton Range, providing access to Alta on the western side of the Tetons, as well as Victor and Driggs in Idaho. This area was known as Pierre&#x27;s Hole and hosted the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous in 1832. Numerous elk use the valley for grazing during the winter, and sleigh rides are offered to tourists. The Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, Snow King, and Grand Targhee Resort ski areas, as well as the nearby Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks, are major year-round tourist attractions.

==Geography==
The valley is formed by the Teton Range to the west and the Gros Ventre Range to the east. Grand Teton National Park occupies the northwestern part of the valley, encompassing much of the Teton Range and Jackson Lake. The city of Jackson is at the southern end. Between them lies, on U.S. Route 26, &quot;Glacier View Turnout&quot; offering a view of Teton Glacier on the north of Grand Teton, and the National Elk Refuge, home of the largest elk herd on earth. The Snake River threads through the entire valley from its headwater in Yellowstone in the north to the mouth of the Snake River Canyon at the southern tip of the valley. Blacktail Butte is a prominent landform rising from the valley floor. The average elevation of the valley is over above sea level.

High altitude and steep mountain slopes on all sides of the valley often cause calm winter nights to be very cold, as radiational cooling from snow-covered ground creates cold air near the surface, which then slides down into the valley due to the higher density of the air. In 1993, this effect during an already severe cold snap plunged the morning low temperature down to in the valley, officially recorded by the National Weather Service. The state record low temperature was also recorded in the valley at Moran at in 1933. Summers are warm to mild, due to the surrounding mountains.

==Economy==
Jackson Hole Airport is the largest and busiest commercial airport in Wyoming. The Jackson Hole Airport is also the only airport in the US that is located inside a National Park. Strict noise abatement regulations and the terminal building&#x27;s low profile allow for the airport to operate within federal guidelines inside Grand Teton National Park. However, it becomes difficult to fly in the winter months. Major airlines serve the valley with jet service, some of which are seasonal (summer and winter).

In 2016, the Jackson Hole Tourism website put up 20 live webcams of Jackson&#x27;s town square to boost tourism. Since then, the audience of the live screening has grown rapidly, with up to 2,000 people watching at any one time.

The community is also home to the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, an annual gathering by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City that includes &quot;prominent central bankers, finance ministers, academics, and financial market participants from around the world,&quot; according to its description. &quot;The participants convene to discuss the economic issues, implications, and policy options about the symposium topic. The symposium proceedings include papers, commentary, and discussion.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
Films set and/or shot in Jackson Hole include &quot;3 Bad Men&quot; (1926), &quot;The Big Sky&quot; (1952), &quot;The Wild North&quot; (1952), &quot;Shane&quot; (1953), &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (1963), &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; (1980), &quot;The Mountain Men&quot; (1980), &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985), &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990), and &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012). It is also a major location in the video games &quot;The Last of Us&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot; (2020), in which Jackson itself is home to a large community of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world.

Rapper Kanye West recorded his album &quot;Ye&quot; (2018) while living in Jackson Hole; the album cover features a picture of the Teton mountains he had taken on his iPhone a few hours before the album&#x27;s release. Other albums West recorded here include his and Kid Cudi&#x27;s &quot;Kids See Ghosts&quot;, Nas&#x27;s &quot;Nasir&quot;, Pusha T&#x27;s &quot;Daytona&quot;, and Teyana Taylor&#x27;s &quot;K.T.S.E.&quot;. These albums are collectively known as the Wyoming Sessions.

===Notable people===
Jackson has become a second home for various celebrities, often due to Wyoming&#x27;s income tax regime, including Sandra Bullock, RuPaul Charles, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Nikki Sixx, and Harrison Ford.

Natives include Kyle Mills, a novelist

<doc id="590440" wikidata="Q110852693" url="?curid=590440" title="Union suit">
<text>A union suit is a type of one-piece long underwear, most often associated with menswear in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==History==
Created in Utica, New York, United States, it originated as women&#x27;s wear during the 19th-century United States clothing reform efforts, as an alternative to constricting garments, and soon gained popularity among men as well. The first union suit was patented in 1868 as &quot;emancipation union under flannel&quot;. Its etymology is unclear. Possibilities include a &quot;union&quot; of top and bottom clothing, the Union Army, and an unknown older brand. The topic may have been considered taboo, limiting recordkeeping. 

Traditionally made of red flannel with long arms and long legs, it buttoned up the front and had a button-up flap in the rear covering the buttocks (colloquially known as the &quot;access hatch&quot;, &quot;drop seat&quot;, &quot;fireman&#x27;s flap&quot;, &quot;crap flap&quot;, and other names). Depending on the size, some union suits can have a dozen buttons on the front to be fastened through buttonholes from the neck down to the groin area.

In Britain, this garment has often been known as &quot;combinations&quot;. When made from the traditional wool as recommended by Gustav Jäger, these are &quot;woolly combinations&quot;—sometimes abbreviated to &quot;woolly coms&quot;. In the Western US, they are known as &quot;long handles&quot; or &quot;long johns&quot;.

Union suits are still commercially available, and come in both summer weight (white) and thermal-wear winter weight (red), but because of their long association with &quot;old fashioned&quot; usage, and presumed &quot;unsophisticated&quot; rural wearers, they may also considered somewhat comical. The rear flap is particularly associated with humor, and in film and television the appearance of a red union suit, viewed from behind, is a form of mild toilet humor.

==Cultural references==

The union suit makes an appearance in Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s 1875 book &quot;Eight Cousins&quot;, as a preferred alternative to corsetry under the name &#x27;Liberty Suit&#x27;

In Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s 1930 novel The Maltese Falcon, private-eye Sam Spade &quot;put(s) on a thin white union-suit&quot;.

Union suits are referred to several times in Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s Little House on the Prairie books (1932-1971) about her family&#x27;s pioneer life during the late 19th century in the United States.

The union suit is mentioned in Harper Lee&#x27;s 1960 novel, &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, which is set in the rural American South in the years 1933–35. 

Buddy Ebsen wore a red union suit in the 1964 comedy Western film Mail Order Bride. 

Dave Lister, a character from the British sci-fi sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, which aired on BBC Two between 1988 and 1999, can be seen wearing a union suit at various points throughout the series.

The union suit appears in the 2003 film &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, which is set during the American Civil War ((1861–1865)).

In the HBO series &quot;Deadwood&quot; (2004–2006), which won an Emmy for costume design, and the sequel film &quot;&quot; (2019), the character of Al Swearengen (played by Ian McShane) is frequently seen in a union suit. He wears only the union suit in private, and when getting dressed in the morning, dons a matching three-piece suit over it. Although the union suit is visible even with the vest, this appears to be adequate for daily wear. For more formal occasions, the character added a dress shirt over the union suit, and a cravat or bow tie.

In the 2010 expansion &quot;Undead Nightmare&quot; for the19th century Western-themed game &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;, the player begins play wearing a union suit and can continue to wear it throughout the game, if desired. The outfit is available in the prequel &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;. 

In the opening to the second season of the Apple TV+ series Severance in 2025, the character of Mark Scout wears a red union suit. In the first season opening, in 2022, he wore red two-piece pajamas, echoing the procedure that severed his &quot;innie&quot; life as an office worker from his &quot;outie&quot; waking life. The series&#x27; wintry landscapes and backstory about a 19th century man named Keir Eagan are appropriate to 19th century red thermal union suit, which echoes Mark&#x27;s increasing desire to reintegrate or unify his severed personality.

Union suits, especially the rear flap, are used for comedic effect in &#x27;Back to the Future Part III&quot; (1990), in the 1999 movie adaptation of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, in &#x27;the TV series &quot;Rugrats&quot; (1991-2021), and in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;No Meals on Wheels&quot; which originally aired in 2007.

<doc id="590444" wikidata="Q314569" url="?curid=590444" title="Ben McKenzie">
<text>Benjamin McKenzie Schenkkan (born September 12, 1978) is an American actor, author and commentator. He is best known for his starring television roles as Ryan Atwood on the teen drama &quot;The O.C.&quot; (2003–2007), Ben Sherman on the crime drama &quot;Southland&quot; (2009–2013), and James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon on the crime drama &quot;Gotham&quot; (2014–2019). McKenzie made his film debut in the Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Junebug&quot; (2005), before appearing in films including &quot;88 Minutes&quot; (2007), &quot;Goodbye World&quot; (2013), &quot;Some Kind of Beautiful&quot; (2014), and &quot;Line of Duty&quot; (2019). In 2020, he made his Broadway debut in the Bess Wohl play &quot;Grand Horizons&quot;. 

Outside of acting, McKenzie is noted for his critical commentary on the cryptocurrency bubble and fraud with journalist Jacob Silverman. Their book on the subject, &quot;Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud&quot;, was published in July 2023.

==Early life==
McKenzie was born in Austin, Texas. He is one of three sons born to Frances Schenkkan, a poet, and Pete Schenkkan, an attorney. He has two younger brothers, both of whom are former actors. He is the brother-in-law of photojournalist Scout Tufankjian.

His grandfather, Robert F. Schenkkan, was a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and worked on passing the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. He is a nephew of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Robert Schenkkan; McKenzie appeared in his 2019 work &quot;The Investigation&quot;. His middle name, McKenzie, is his paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name; he uses it as part of his stage name to avoid confusion with actor Ben Shenkman. His second cousin is actress Sarah Drew.

For middle school, he attended St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal School, where he was friends and flag football teammates with future Super Bowl MVP Drew Brees. He attended Stephen F. Austin High School, playing wide receiver and defensive back for the school&#x27;s football team. From 1997 to 2001 he attended the University of Virginia, his father and paternal grandfather&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;, where he majored in foreign affairs and economics.

==Acting career==
===2001–2007: Early career and &quot;The O.C.&quot;===
After graduating from college in 2001, McKenzie moved to New York City where he worked in part-time jobs and performed in some off-off-Broadway productions. During this period, he also participated in summer stock theater and the Williamstown Theatre Festival.

At age twenty-three, he moved to Los Angeles where he waited tables and slept on the floor of his friend Ernie Sabella&#x27;s apartment. He was soon cast as Ryan Atwood in &quot;The O.C.&quot; On August 5, 2003, Fox premiered the television series, about affluent teenagers with stormy personal lives in Orange County, California. The show became an overnight success and made McKenzie famous. His performance in &quot;The O.C.&quot; earned him &quot;Choice Breakout TV Star – Male&quot; and &quot;Choice TV Chemistry&quot; nominations in the Teen Choice Awards as well as &quot;Choice TV Actor – Drama/Action Adventure&quot; and &quot;Choice TV Actor – Drama&quot; wins. McKenzie reportedly earned between about $15,000 and $25,000 per episode throughout the show&#x27;s run.

&quot;The O.C.&quot; was the first time McKenzie played what &quot;The New York Times&quot; later described as the &quot;quiet, guarded leading man&quot; role he would repeatedly portray. As a result of the show&#x27;s success, McKenzie appeared in magazines including &quot;People, In Touch Weekly&quot; and &quot;Us Weekly&quot;. He was ranked No. 5 in Independent Online&#x27;s &quot;100 Sexiest Men Alive&quot; and twice appeared on &quot;Teen People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual list of &quot;25 Sexiest Stars under 25&quot;. McKenzie was also voted one of &quot;InStyle&quot;&#x27;s &quot;10 Hottest Bachelors of Summer&quot; in July 2005. &quot;The O.C.&quot; dropped in ratings dramatically during its third and fourth seasons, and ended in early 2007.

While appearing in &quot;The O.C.&quot;, McKenzie made his feature film debut in the Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Junebug&quot; alongside Amy Adams and Embeth Davidtz. The film was nominated for &quot;Best International Film&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Ensemble Acting&quot; in the Amanda Awards and won the Sarasota Film Festival award for &quot;Outstanding Ensemble Acting&quot;. It also received high praise at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. According to &quot;Production Weekly&quot;, McKenzie was set to star in the thriller &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Pacific Air 121&quot;, but later dropped out to film &quot;88 Minutes&quot;, which starred Al Pacino.

===2007–2019: &quot;Southland&quot; and &quot;Gotham&quot;===
In 2008, McKenzie earned critical acclaim for his solo performance in the &quot;live on stage, on film&quot; version of Dalton Trumbo&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;, his first starring role in a film. He stars as Joe Bonham, a role previously played by James Cagney, Jeff Daniels, and Timothy Bottoms. The movie premiered at the Paramount Theater in Austin, McKenzie&#x27;s hometown, while he was filming the pilot for &quot;Southland&quot;. In 2009, he appeared in the short film &quot;The Eight Percent&quot;. The movie won the Delta Air Lines Fly-in Movie Contest and entered as an official selection on the Tribeca Film Festival&#x27;s Short film category. 

McKenzie starred as rookie police officer Ben Sherman on the NBC drama &quot;Southland&quot;, which premiered on April 9, 2009. The show was canceled while in production on its second season. TNT bought the rights for the show and showed the seven episodes that had been produced. The show was subsequently renewed and ran for five seasons before being canceled in 2013. From September to October 2010, he starred in an off-Broadway transfer of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.

Following the end of &quot;Southland&quot;, McKenzie was cast in the CBS drama television pilot &quot;The Advocates&quot;, opposite Mandy Moore. The show was not produced. In late 2013, he was cast in the drama film &quot;The Swimmer&quot;, a Norwegian production that was not produced. In October 2013, he signed an exclusive talent deal with Warner Bros. Television Studios, the home of &quot;The O.C.&quot; and &quot;Southland&quot;. A few months later, in February 2014, it was announced that McKenzie was cast in the pilot of &quot;Gotham&quot;.

McKenzie returned to Fox in the Batman prequel television show &quot;Gotham&quot;, which premiered on September 22, 2014. In the series, he portrayed James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon as a young detective new to Gotham City. After five seasons and 100 episodes, the show concluded in April 2019. In the same series, he made his directorial debut with the season 3 episode &quot;These Delicate and Dark Obsessions&quot;. McKenzie went on to direct &quot;One of My Three Soups&quot; and write &quot;The Demon&#x27;s Head&quot; from the fourth season. 

In 2017, he appeared in the first season of &quot;The Accidental Wolf&quot;, a miniseries series created by Arian Moayed and the theater production company Waterwell. He shot &quot;Line of Duty&quot;, a real-time action thriller, in Birmingham, Alabama in early summer 2018; it was released in 2019.

===2019–present: new projects and theater===
Following the conclusion of &quot;Gotham&quot; in 2019, McKenzie indicated the end of one chapter in his career, turning to new efforts including writing and directing.

On June 24, 2019, McKenzie, along with an ensemble cast, presented &quot;The Investigation: A Search for the Truth in Ten Acts&quot;, a dramatic reading of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III&#x27;s Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election. McKenzie portrayed President Donald Trump&#x27;s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, as well as Donald Trump Jr.

McKenzie made his Broadway debut on January 23, 2020, in the Second Stage production of &quot;Grand Horizons&quot; at the Hayes Theater. McKenzie starred as Ben, one of two sons struggling with their elderly parents&#x27; divorce. A limited-run production, the play began previews on December 23, 2019 and closed on March 1, 2020. In February 2022, it was announced that McKenzie would star in and produce &quot;Bloat&quot;, an internationally produced J-horror film. In February 2023, he was announced as a star in the ABC medical drama pilot &quot;The Hurt Unit&quot; which was not picked up to series.

==Criticism of cryptocurrency==
Since 2021, McKenzie has been an outspoken critic of cryptocurrency. He is noted as one of the few celebrity skeptics of the technology. As such, he has been particularly critical of the proliferation of celebrity endorsements of unstable cryptocurrencies, their speculation, and NFTs. McKenzie testified at the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs hearing &quot;Crypto Crash: Why the FTX Bubble Burst and the Harm to Consumers” in December 2022.

McKenzie&#x27;s debut book &quot;Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud&quot; with journalist Jacob Silverman was released by Abrams Press on July 18, 2023. The book includes a claim from McKenzie that the CIA &quot;begged&quot; him to explain cryptocurrency to them. With Silverman, he has written a number of critical articles on crypto for publications including &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The Intercept&quot;. They had a featured session on the topic at the 2022 SXSW Festival and McKenzie at WSJ Tech Live 2022 and the 2022 Web Summit. As of 2023, he is working on a documentary on the subject. 

As a pundit, McKenzie has also appeared on CNN Business, CNBC, CBS News, and Real Time with Bill Maher to discuss the topic. He has been a guest on podcasts like &quot;What Next: TBD&quot;, &quot;Deconstructed&quot;, and &quot;Chapo Trap House&quot;, and radio programs &quot;Marketplace Tech&quot; and &quot;Morning Edition&quot;.

McKenzie attributes his initial interest in the subject to his undergraduate degree in economics and friends&#x27; interest in cryptocurrency, as well as coursework on the blockchain from MIT professor and SEC chairman Gary Gensler and &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot; by economist Thomas Piketty.

==Personal life==
In September 2015, actress Morena Baccarin said in a legal declaration involving her divorce from Austin Chick that she planned to marry her &quot;Gotham&quot; co-star, McKenzie, adding that she was pregnant with their child. Their daughter Frances Laiz Setta was born on March 2, 2016. Sixteen days later, on March 18, Baccarin and Chick&#x27;s divorce became official. Baccarin and McKenzie announced their engagement in November 2016. They were married on June 2, 2017 (Baccarin&#x27;s 38th birthday) in Brooklyn, New York. They announced the birth of their son Arthur in March 2021. With Baccarin, McKenzie has one step-son, Julius.

<text>Long underwear, also called long johns or thermal underwear, is underwear with long legs and long sleeves that is normally worn during cold weather. It is commonly worn by people under their clothes in colder climates.

In the United States, it is usually made from a cotton or cotton-polyester-blend fabric with a waffle weave texture, although some varieties are also made from flannel, particularly the union suit, while many newer varieties are made from polyester, such as the Capilene trade name.

European manufacturers use wool blends or even 100% wool, usually Merino or other high-quality wool. Some models might include a thin layer of polyester to transport moisture away from the skin. Wool, in addition to being fire retardant, provides highly effective insulation and will keep its insulating properties even when wet, unlike cotton. 
The type known as &quot;thermal underwear&quot; is made from two-ply fabric of either a wool layer and an artificial fibre, only wool or – again mostly in the U.S. – two layers of only artificial fibres, which uses trapped body heat to insulate against cold air.

== Etymology of &quot;long johns&quot;==
The manufacturing foundations of long johns may lie in Derbyshire, England, at John Smedley&#x27;s Lea Mills, located in Matlock. The company has a 225-year heritage and is said to have created the garment, reputedly named after the late-19th-century heavyweight boxer John L. Sullivan; the company still produces long johns. 

In 2004, Michael Quinion, a British etymologist and writer, postulated that the &quot;john&quot; in the item of apparel may be a reference to Sullivan, who wore a similar-looking garment in the ring. This explanation, however, is uncertain and the term&#x27;s origin is ultimately unknown. 

It has also been posed that the term is an approximation of the French , which translates to &#x27;long legs.&#x27;

==History of long johns==
Long johns were first introduced into England in the 17th century, but did not become popular as sleepwear until the 18th century. 

It was first used as loungewear but later became popular in Truro, Nova Scotia. In 1898, Myles and his brother John had developed a product called Stanfield&#x27;s Unshrinkable Underwear for their garment manufacturing company. He and his brother started with non-shrinking cotton underwear and applied for a patent for long johns on December 7, 1915.

From 1914 to mid-1918, the item of underwear most purchased by various military forces was a garment known as a union suit; it is a one-piece form of underwear covering body and legs and was the prototype of the Chinese (), the top part, and (), the bottom part. After 1918, countries returned to producing for civilians.

Demand declined following the spread of central heating and more frequent baths or showers.

== Long underwear in other countries ==

=== China ===
In China, people use separate words to refer to the two parts of long underwear, and the terms vary across the country. In the northern part, people refer to the top as and the bottom as . People living south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River refer to the top as and the bottom as . People living south of the Yangtze River call the top and the bottom .

In the early 2010s, a myth spread through Chinese social media that long underwear was part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s conspiracy to prevent Chinese military powers from invading Soviet soil in the far east. The myth suggested that the Soviet Union believes that long underwear reduces Chinese soldiers&#x27; adaptability in cold climates based on the since-debunked theory of Lysenkoism popular in the mid-20th century.

<text>Eugène Joseph Delporte (10 January 1882 – 19 October 1955) was a Belgian astronomer born in Genappe.

He discovered a total of sixty-six asteroids. Notable discoveries include 1221 Amor (which lent its name to the Amor asteroids) and the Apollo asteroid 2101 Adonis. He discovered or co-discovered some comets as well, including periodic comet 57P/du Toit-Neujmin-Delporte. He worked in the Observatoire Royal de Belgique (Belgian Royal Observatory), situated in the town of Uccle (after which the asteroid 1276 Ucclia is named). He started there in 1903 after receiving his doctorate that year from the Free University of Brussels.

In 1930, he drew the modern boundaries between all of the constellations in the sky, along lines of right ascension and declination for the epoch B1875.0.

The Florian asteroid 1274 Delportia (discovered by himself) and the lunar impact crater &quot;Delporte&quot; were named after him.

<text>57P/[[Daniel du Toit|du Toit]]–[[G. N. Neujmin|Neujmin]]–[[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Delporte]] is the designation of a periodic comet. It is a member of the Jupiter family of comets whose orbits and evolution are strongly influenced by the giant planet. In 2002 it was discovered to have broken up into at least 20 fragments. At the time of their discovery, these shed fragments were spread out along the orbital path subtending an angle of 27 arcminutes from the comet&#x27;s surviving head.

== Discovery ==
The comet has many co-discoverers and a complicated discovery history due to unreliable communications during World War II. Daniel du Toit discovered the comet (retrospectively designated as P/1941 O1) on July 18, 1941, working at Boyden Station, South Africa. His cabled message about the comet did not reach his employer, Harvard College Observatory, until July 27. During a routine asteroid search, Grigory N. Neujmin (Simeis Observatory, Soviet Union) found the comet on a photographic plate exposed July 25. He confirmed his own observation on July 29, but the radiogram from Moscow took 20 days to reach Harvard. The official announcement of the new comet finally happened on August 20, 1941. A few days later, it became known that Eugène Joseph Delporte at the Royal Observatory, Belgium, also had found the comet on August 19, so he was added to the list of discoverers.

A few weeks later, news from Paul Ahnert at Sonneberg, Thuringia, Germany, reached Harvard that he also observed the new comet on July 22, but it was too late to recognize his contribution.

Fragment A was last observed in 2002.

<doc id="590457" wikidata="Q1911677" url="?curid=590457" title="Brass Era car">
<text>The Brass Era is an American term for the early period of automotive manufacturing, named for the prominent brass fittings used during this time for such features as lights and radiators. It is generally considered to encompass 1896 through 1915, a time when cars were often referred to as horseless carriages.

Elsewhere in the world, this period would be considered by antique car enthusiasts to consist of the veteran (pre-1904), and Edwardian eras, although these terms are really not meaningful outside the former British Empire.

==Overview==
Early automakers turned to brass for their vehicles for both its looks and function. It held up well against tarnishing and bad weather, but required regular polishing to maintain its appearance.

Though the automobile was invented a few years before the start of the Brass Era, the 20 years that make up this era represent the beginning of the automotive industry. It was a period of small-scale manufacturing, experimental designs, and alternative power systems. The middle of this period saw the introduction of Panhard et Levassor&#x27;s &quot;Système Panhard,&quot; a front-engine, rear-drive design that became the industry standard for decades.

Through this period, electric, gasoline, and steam propulsion power were the powertrains of choice, though gas-powered internal combustion engines were dominant by the end of this period. Various body styles were also in vogue at the time, including the high-wheel motor buggy (resembling the horse buggy of before 1900), runabouts, tonneaus, and other more expensive closed bodies. 

The vehicles most closely associated with the Brass Era were larger, more expensive luxury vehicles, such as those built by Packard, Peerless, Pierce-Arrow, Cadillac, and other premium manufacturers. 

1915, the agreed-upon cutoff of the Brass Era, was the final year the Ford Model T was available with brass fitments. At this point the style had also begun to be considered outdated, and by the 1920s few if any vehicles continued to employ brass in their designs.

==Technology==
In the early part of this period, steam-car development had advanced, making steam cars some of the fastest road vehicles of their day. Electric cars also held a market share throughout the era.

Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world&#x27;s attention. Key developments included the electric ignition system (by dynamotor on the Arnold in 1898, though Robert Bosch, 1903, tends to get the credit), independent suspension (actually conceived by Bollée in 1873), and four-wheel brakes (by the Arrol-Johnston Company of Scotland in 1909). Leaf springs were widely used for suspension, though many other systems were still in use.

Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds, though vehicles generally still had discrete speed settings, rather than the infinitely variable system familiar in cars of later eras. Safety glass also made its debut, patented by John Wood in England in 1905, but would not become standard equipment until 1926 on a Rickenbacker. Angle steel took over from armored wood as the frame material of choice, and in 1912, Hupp pioneered the use of all-steel bodies, joined in 1914 by Dodge.

<doc id="590459" wikidata="Q335300" url="?curid=590459" title="George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll">
<text>George John Douglas Campbell, 8th and 1st Duke of Argyll (30 April 1823 – 24 April 1900; styled Marquess of Lorne until 1847), was a Scottish polymath and Liberal statesman. He made a significant geological discovery in the 1850s when his tenant found fossilized leaves embedded among basalt lava on the Island of Mull. He also helped to popularize ornithology and was one of the first to give a detailed account of the principles of bird flight in the hopes of advancing artificial aerial navigation (i.e. flying machines). His literary output was extensive writing on topics varying from science and theology to economy and politics. In addition to this, he served prominently in the administrations of Lord Aberdeen, Lord Palmerston, John Russell and William Gladstone.

==Background==
Argyll was born at Ardencaple Castle, Dunbartonshire, the second but only surviving son of John Campbell, 7th Duke of Argyll, and his second wife Joan Glassel, the only daughter of John Glassel. Argyll succeeded his father as Duke of Argyll (Peerage of Scotland) in 1847. With his death he became also hereditary Master of the Household of Scotland and Sheriff of Argyllshire.

He owned 175,000 acres in Argyll and Dumbarton.

==Political career==

By the time of his succession, Argyll had already obtained notice as a writer of pamphlets on the disruption of the Church of Scotland, which he strove to avert, and he rapidly became prominent on the Liberal side in parliamentary politics via the Peelite Conservative Party faction. He was a frequent and eloquent speaker in the House of Lords. A close associate of Prince Albert, he served as Lord Privy Seal between 1852 and 1855 in the cabinet of Lord Aberdeen, and then as Postmaster General between 1855 and 1858 in Lord Palmerston&#x27;s first cabinet. 

He was again Lord Privy Seal between 1859 and 1866 in the second Palmerston administration, and then under Lord Russell&#x27;s second administration, in which position he was notable as a strong advocate of the Northern cause in the American Civil War.

Argyll was a major catalyst of the Education (Scotland) Act of 1872. Under his leadership in 1866, the Argyll Commission looked into the Scottish schooling system and found it severely inadequate. The report – eventually finished in 1869 – was used to call for education reforms. As a result of this lobbying, the Education Act (Scotland) 1872 was passed making primary school education mandatory in Scotland for children aged between 5 and 13.

In William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s first government of 1868 to 1874, Argyll became Secretary of State for India, in which role his refusal to promise support against the Russians to the emir of Afghanistan helped lead to the Second Afghan War. 

Argyll&#x27;s wife (née Lady Elizabeth Georgiana Leveson-Gower), served as Mistress of the Robes in this government. 

Argyll also played a key role in the establishment of the Royal Indian Engineering College which functioned from 1872 to 1906. This college which was located on the Coopers Hill estate, near Egham was set up in order to train civil engineers for service in the Indian Public Works Department. In 1871, while actually serving in the Cabinet, his son and heir, Lord Lorne, married one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughters, Princess Louise, enhancing his status as a leading grandee.

In 1880 he again served under Gladstone, as Lord Privy Seal, but resigned on 31 March 1881 in protest at Gladstone&#x27;s Land Bill, claiming it would interfere with the rights of landlords and had been brought in response to terrorism. In 1886, he fully broke with Gladstone over the question of the prime minister&#x27;s support for Irish Home Rule, although he did not join the Liberal Unionist Party, but pursued an independent course. Having been already Vice Lord Lieutenant from 1847, Argyll held the honorary post of Lord Lieutenant of Argyllshire from 1862 until his death in 1900. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1853, appointed a Knight of the Thistle in 1856 and a Knight of the Garter in 1883. In 1892 he was created Duke of Argyll in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Scholarship==

Argyll was also an amateur scientist dedicated to many areas of science. Aside from his own work in ornithology, he wrote on anthropology, evolution, glaciology and economics. He was a leader in the scholarly opposition against Darwinism (1869, 1884b) although he was not against the theory of evolution, Argyll argued instead for theistic evolution. He did argue against the erosive capability of glaciers (1873) and was an important economist (1893) and institutionalist (1884a), in which latter capacity he was quite similar to his political opponent, Benjamin Disraeli.
In 1851, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and was appointed Chancellor of the University of St Andrews. Three years later, he became additionally Rector of the University of Glasgow. In 1849 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and served as its president from 1860 to 1864. In 1855 he became president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. From 1872 to 1874 he was President of The Geological Society. In 1866, he was a founding member of Britain&#x27;s first aeronautical society, the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain (later renamed the Royal Aeronautical Society), and served as its president from 1866 to 1895. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1869. In 1886, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.
==Private life==
Argyll was married three times. He married firstly Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower, eldest daughter of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland, in 1844. They had five sons and seven daughters, being:

*John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll (6 August 1845 – 2 May 1914), married Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria on 21 March 1871.
*Lord Archibald Campbell (18 December 1846 – 29 March 1913), married Janey Callander on 12 January 1869. They had two children, including Niall Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll.

*Lady Frances Campbell (22 February 1858 – 25 February 1931), married Eustace Balfour on 12 May 1879. They had five children.
*Lady Mary Emma Campbell (22 September 1859 – 22 March 1947), married Rt. Rev. Hon. Edward Carr Glyn on 4 July 1882. They had three children.
*Lady Constance Harriett Campbell (11 November 1864 – 9 February 1922), married Charles Emmott on 27 June 1891.

The Duchess of Argyll died aged 53 in May 1878. In 1881, Argyll married Amelia Maria (born 1843), daughter of the Right Reverend Thomas Claughton, Bishop of St Albans, and widow of Augustus Anson. She died aged 50 in January 1894. In 1895, Argyll married a third time, to Ina, daughter of Archibald McNeill. Ina survived the duke by a quarter of a century, dying in December 1925. There were no children from either the second or third marriages.

Argyll died at Inveraray Castle in April 1900, six days before his 77th birthday, and is buried at Kilmun Parish Church. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son John.

<text>Opus Dei is the third studio album by the Slovenian and Yugoslav avant-garde music group Laibach, released on March 23, 1987 by Mute Records. It features &quot;Geburt einer Nation&quot; (&quot;birth of a nation&quot;), a German language cover version of Queen&#x27;s &quot;One Vision&quot;, and two reworkings of &quot;Live Is Life&quot; by the Austrian pop rock band Opus&#x27;. The Opus song became the German language &quot;Leben heißt Leben&quot; and the English language &quot;Opus Dei&quot;. &quot;The Great Seal&quot; is the national anthem of the NSK State, the lyrics taken from Winston Churchill&#x27;s 1940 &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; speech. A new arrangement of the song appears on Laibach&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Volk&quot; (2006), with the title &quot;NSK&quot;. On &quot;Volk&quot;, the song is credited to Laibach and Slavko Avsenik Jr.

There are two further connections with Queen&#x27;s &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; studio album. Although the drum loop in &quot;Trans-National&quot; is nearly identical to that in Queen&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot;, it is composed in fact from samples from the introduction musical theme from the Yugoslavian epic partisan film &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot; (1969), composed by Bernard Herrmann. The elements of &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (specifically the rhythm and harmonised guitars) are inspired by Queen&#x27;s &quot;Gimme the Prize (Kurgan&#x27;s Theme)&quot;.

The album was included in the musical reference book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2006). In 2023, &quot;Consequence&quot; ranked it at number 6 in its list of the &quot;50 Best Industrial Albums of All Time&quot;. Al Jourgensen of the American industrial metal band Ministry named it one of the ten essential industrial records.

In December 2024, Laibach released &quot;Opus Dei Revisited&quot;, a &quot;collection of new versions which radically interrogate the source material&quot;. The release consists of two complete versions, the first reworked by the band themselves and the second by Rico Conning, who produced and mixed the original album.

<doc id="590462" wikidata="Q93853" url="?curid=590462" title="Once Upon a Time in Mexico">
<text>Once Upon a Time in Mexico is a 2003 American neo-Western action film written, directed, produced, photographed, scored, and edited by Robert Rodriguez. It is the sequel to &quot;Desperado&quot; (1995) and the third and final installment in the &quot;Mexico Trilogy&quot;. The film features Antonio Banderas in his second and final performance as El Mariachi. In the film, El Mariachi is recruited by CIA agent Sheldon Sands (Johnny Depp) to kill a corrupt general responsible for the death of his wife, Carolina (Salma Hayek).

&quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; was released in the United States on September 12, 2003, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Depp&#x27;s performance, but criticism for reducing its protagonist to an almost secondary character in his own trilogy and a convoluted plot. In the special features of the film&#x27;s DVD, Rodriguez explained this was intentional, as he wanted this to be his &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; of the trilogy. It grossed over $98 million against a $29 million production budget.

==Plot==
El Mariachi is recruited by CIA officer Sheldon Jeffrey Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt Mexican Army officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the President of Mexico and overthrow the government during a period of unrest in Culiacán (the capital of Sinaloa) testing the presidency. Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo.

While monitoring Barillo&#x27;s activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he&#x27;s been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers&#x27;s pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands&#x27;s agent, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead turns and tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands&#x27;s plan. Cucuy, however, is promptly killed by Chambers while El Mariachi escapes from captivity and calls his friends Lorenzo and Fideo to assist him in his mission.

While monitoring Barillo&#x27;s activity outside a hospital, Ramírez notices armed men storming the building and follows suit. He discovers that a group of doctors has been gunned down and Barillo has bled to death as a result of a botched facial reconstruction but realizes that the corpse on the operating table is a body double before he is knocked out and kidnapped by the real Barillo and Ajedrez, who reveals herself to be Barillo&#x27;s daughter. Sands realizes that his mission has been compromised but is too late, as he is captured by Barillo and Ajedrez — who drill out his eyes before sending him out. Despite his blindness, he manages to gun down a hitman tailing him with the aid of a &quot;chicle&quot; boy.

As Culiacán celebrates the Day of the Dead during the President&#x27;s visit, Marquez and his army storm in and attack the presidential palace. Marquez&#x27;s troops, however, are met with resistance from not only the President&#x27;s bodyguards but also the citizens of Culiacán and the Mariachis. Sands had instructed El Mariachi to allow the President to be killed before attacking Marquez, but the Mariachis, concluding that the President is a good man, intervene early and protect him. Marquez enters the presidential palace, only to once again confront El Mariachi, who shoots out his kneecaps before killing him with a headshot. Ramírez, who was released from captivity by Chambers, faces Barillo. After Barillo guns down Chambers, Ramírez and El Mariachi kill the drug lord. Sands manages to shoot the sadistic Ajedrez dead outside the presidential palace. Ultimately, Lorenzo and Fideo walk away with the cash that Barillo was using to pay Marquez and help the president safely escape the attempted coup. Ramírez says goodbye to Sands and walks away, having avenged his partner&#x27;s death. El Mariachi then gives his share of the cash to his home village before walking into the sunset.

==Cast==

In a 2003 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Depp was named as one of its &quot;People of the Year&quot;, and gave an interview in which he briefly discussed his role as Sands:

The idea behind him is there was this guy I used to know in Hollywood, in the business, who on the outside was very charming – soft-spoken and almost hypnotic in the rhythm he used to speak. He refused to call me Johnny – always called me John. You knew this guy was aiming to fuck you over, but somehow you stuck around because he was just so fascinating to watch.

Depp also said in an &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; article that he &quot;imagine[d] this guy wore really cheesy tourist shirts&quot;, that he had a &quot;sideline obsession with Broadway&quot;, and that he favored strange, obvious disguises; all three qualities can be observed in the film. It was also revealed in the director&#x27;s commentary on the DVD that Depp himself came up with the character&#x27;s first and middle names.

==Production==
Made on a US$29 million budget, the film was shot in May 2001 before &quot;Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams&quot; (2002) and &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot; (2003) in order to avoid a potential Screen Actors Guild strike. Shooting took place over seven weeks in Querétaro, San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato, Mexico. It was the first big-budget film to be shot in high-definition digital video. Robert Rodriguez chose to shoot on digital after George Lucas, who was shooting &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), showed him early footage shot digitally. Impressed, Rodriguez chose to shoot digitally, but he knew he did not have enough time to shoot &quot;Spy Kids 2&quot;. Instead, he pitched a sequel to &quot;Desperado&quot; (1995) to Miramax Films and wrote a script in six days. The initial draft was 65 pages long, which he padded with a subplot borrowed from an unproduced short film. When Miramax expressed hesitation over the added subplot, he readily removed it. His primary influence was Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;, specifically &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot; (1996). Rodriguez said shooting digitally saved time and money, simplified the filming process, and rendered 35 mm film obsolete for him.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s score includes songs composed by Rodriguez, and performed by a group of musicians gathered specifically for the soundtrack recording. Tracks performed by the group include &quot;Malagueña&quot; with guitar by Brian Setzer, and &quot;Siente Mi Amor&quot;, with singing by Salma Hayek. Track 9, &quot;Sands Theme&quot;, credited to &quot;Tonto&#x27;s Giant Nuts&quot;, was written by Johnny Depp. Additional music includes Juno Reactor&#x27;s &quot;Pistolero&quot;, &quot;Me Gustas Tú&quot; by Manu Chao, and &quot;Cuka Rocka&quot; by Rodriguez&#x27; own rock band, Chingon. On the DVD director commentary, Rodriguez states that he requested that each of the main actors give him four or eight notes of a melody for their character, but Depp presented him with the entire track.

===Track listing===
==Release==
&quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; was released in the United States on September 12, 2003 by Sony Pictures Releasing through Columbia Pictures, and internationally by Miramax International through Buena Vista International, in 3,282 theaters with an opening weekend gross of US$23.4 million. It went on to make $56.4 million in North America and $41.8 in the rest of the world for a combined total of $98.2 million on a $29 million budget.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; holds an approval rating of 66% based on 168 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Violent, pulpy, loopy fun, with Depp stealing the show.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;
. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, &quot;Like Leone&#x27;s movie, the Rodriguez epic is more interested in the moment, in great shots, in surprises and ironic reversals and closeups of sweaty faces, than in a coherent story.&quot; A. O. Scott wrote in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;But in the end, the punched-up editing and vibrant color schemes start to grow tiresome, and Mr. Rodriguez, bored with his own gimmickry and completely out of ideas, responds by pushing the violence to needlessly grotesque extremes.&quot;

In her review for &quot;USA Today&quot;, Claudia Puig wrote, &quot;In &quot;Mexico&quot;, Rodriguez has fashioned a swaggering fantasy that pays homage to spaghetti Westerns such as Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;. Plenty of blood is shed, much powerful artillery is fired, and action sequences provide astounding car crashes and fiery explosions.&quot; Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a &quot;B&quot; rating and praised Depp&#x27;s performance with its &quot;winking grace notes of Brandoesque flakery ... is as minimal and laid-back as his &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; turn was deep-dish theatrical&quot;.

==Television adaptation==
Sony&#x27;s AXN channel confirmed that it will be airing a TV series adaptation of the &quot;Mexico Trilogy&quot;. The series, entitled &quot;El Mariachi&quot;, premiered on March 20, 2014.

<doc id="590464" wikidata="Q1003780" url="?curid=590464" title="Freedom of Information Act (United States)">
<text>The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA ), , is the United States federal freedom of information law that requires the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased or uncirculated information and documents controlled by the U.S. government upon request. The act defines agency records subject to disclosure, outlines mandatory disclosure procedures, and includes nine exemptions that define categories of information not subject to disclosure. The act was intended to make U.S. government agencies&#x27; functions more transparent so that the American public could more easily identify problems in government functioning and put pressure on Congress, agency officials, and the president to address them. The FOIA has been changed repeatedly by both the legislative and executive branches.

The FOIA is commonly known for being invoked by news organizations for reporting purposes, though such uses make up less than 10% of all requests—which are more frequently made by businesses, law firms, and individuals.

== Background ==
As indicated by its long title, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was moved from its original home in Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Section 3 of the APA, as enacted in 1946, gave agencies broad discretion concerning the publication of governmental records. Following concerns that the provision had become more of a withholding than a disclosure mechanism, Congress amended the section in 1966 as a standalone act to implement &quot;a general philosophy of full agency disclosure.&quot; The amendment required agencies to publish their rules of procedure in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(1)(C), and to make available for public inspection and copying their opinions, statements of policy, interpretations, and staff manuals and instructions that are not already published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;, § 552(a)(2). In addition, § 552(a)(3) requires every agency, &quot;upon any request for records which ... reasonably describes such records&quot; to make such records &quot;promptly available to any person.&quot; By § 552(a)(4)(B) if an agency improperly withholds any documents, the district court has jurisdiction to order their production. Unlike the review of other agency action that must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious, FOIA expressly places the burden &quot;on the agency to sustain its action,&quot; and directs the district courts to &quot;determine the matter de novo.&quot;

With the ongoing stress on both constitutional and inherent rights of American citizens and the added assertion of government subservience to the individual, some, particularly representative John E. Moss, thought that it was necessary for government information to be available to the public. This push built on existing principles and protocols of government administration already in place.

Others, though—most notably President Lyndon B. Johnson—believed that certain types of unclassified government information should nonetheless remain secret. Notwithstanding the White House&#x27;s opposition, Congress expanded Section 3 of the APA as a standalone measure in 1966 to further standardize the publication of government records, consistent with the belief that the people have the &quot;right to know&quot; about them. The Privacy Act of 1974 was passed as a countervailing measure to ensure the security of government documents increasingly kept on private citizens.

== Scope ==
The act explicitly applies only to government agencies under the executive branch. These agencies are required by several mandates to comply with public solicitation of information. Along with making public and accessible all bureaucratic and technical procedures for applying for documents from that agency, agencies are also subject to penalties for hindering the process of a petition for information. According to the act, if &quot;agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, the Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the withholding.&quot; In this way, there is recourse for one seeking information to go to a federal court if suspicion of illegal tampering or delayed sending of records exists. However, nine exemptions address issues of sensitivity and personal rights. They are (as listed in ):

#(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;
# related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;
# specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; FOIA Exemption 3 Statutes
# trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
# inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;
# personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
# records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information (A) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, (B) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source, (E) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or (F) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;
# contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or
# geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 (at ) exempts the U.S. Postal Service from disclosure of &quot;information of a commercial nature, including trade secrets, whether or not obtained from a person outside the Postal Service, which under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed&quot;.

A federal court has concisely described the vital role of the FOIA in democracy:
== Legislative history ==
The law came about because of the determination of U.S. House of Representatives member John E. Moss of California, who was chairman of the House Government Information Subcommittee. It took Moss 12 years to get the FOIA through Congress. Much of the desire for government transparency stemmed from the Department of Defense and Congressional committees evaluation of the nation&#x27;s classification system in the late 1950s. They determined that the misuse of government classification of documents was causing insiders to leak documents that were marked &quot;confidential&quot;. The committee also determined that the lowest rung of the confidentiality ladder &quot;confidential&quot; should be removed. They deemed that &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;top secret&quot; covered national security adequately. The Moss Committee took it upon itself to reform confidentiality policy and implement punishments for the overuse of classification by officials and departments.

=== Initial enactment ===
The FOIA was initially introduced as the bill in the 89th Congress. When the two-page bill was signed into law, it became , but had an effective date of one year after the date of enactment, or July 4, 1967. The law set up the structure of FOIA as we know it today. President Lyndon B. Johnson, despite his misgivings, signed the FOIA into law.

That law was initially repealed. During the period between the enactment of the act and its effective date, Title 5 of the United States Code was enacted into positive law. For reasons now unclear but which may have had to do with the way the enactment of Title 5 changed how the law being amended was supposed to be cited, the original Freedom of Information Act was replaced. A new act in (originally in the 90th Congress), repealed the original and put in its place a substantively identical law. This statute was signed on June 5, 1967, and had the same effective date as the original statute: July 4, 1967.

== Amendments and executive actions ==

=== Privacy Act Amendments of 1974 ===
Following the Watergate scandal, President Gerald R. Ford wanted to sign FOIA-strengthening amendments in the Privacy Act of 1974, but White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld and deputy Dick Cheney were concerned about leaks. Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Antonin Scalia advised the bill was unconstitutional and even telephoned the CIA asking them to lobby a particular White House staffer. President Ford was persuaded to veto the bill on October 17, 1974, according to documents declassified in 2004. However, on November 21, the lame-duck Congress overrode President Ford&#x27;s veto, giving the United States the core Freedom of Information Act still in effect today, with judicial review of executive secrecy claims.

Scalia remained highly critical of the 1974 amendments, writing years later that &quot;It is the Taj Mahal of the Doctrine of Unanticipated Consequences, the Sistine Chapel of Cost-Benefit Analysis Ignored.&quot; Scalia particularly disliked the availability of judicial review, decrying that if &quot;an agency denies a freedom of information request, shazam!—the full force of the Third Branch of the government is summoned to the wronged party&#x27;s assistance.&quot;

Those amendments to the FOIA regulate government control of documents that concern a citizen. They give one &quot;(1) the right to see records about [one]self, subject to the Privacy Act&#x27;s exemptions, (2) the right to amend that record if it is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete, and (3) the right to sue the government for violations of the statute including permitting others to see [one&#x27;s] records unless specifically permitted by the Act.&quot; In conjunction with the FOIA, the Privacy Act is used to further the rights of an individual gaining access to information held by the government. The Justice Department&#x27;s Office of Information and Privacy and federal district courts are the two channels of appeal available to seekers of information.

=== 1976 Government in the Sunshine Act amendments ===
In 1976, as part of the Government in the Sunshine Act, Exemption 3 of the FOIA was amended so that several exemptions were specified:
#Information relating to national defense,
#Related solely to internal personnel rules and practices,
#Related to accusing a person of a crime,
#Related to information where disclosure would constitute a breach of privacy,
#Related to investigatory records where the information would harm the proceedings,
#Related to information which would lead to financial speculation or endanger the stability of any financial institution, and
#Related to the agency&#x27;s participation in legal proceedings.

=== 1982 Executive Order limiting the FOIA ===
Between 1982 and 1995, President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s allowed federal agencies to withhold enormous amounts of information under Exemption 1 (relating to national security information), claiming it would better protect the country and strengthen national security.

The outcry from the effect that the Reagan Order had on FOIA requests was a factor in leading President Clinton to dramatically alter the criteria in 1995.

=== 1986 Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act amendments to the FOIA ===
The FOIA amendments were a small part of the bipartisan Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. Congress amended FOIA to address the fees charged by different categories of requesters and the scope of access to law enforcement and national security records. The amendments are not referenced in the congressional reports on the Act, so the floor statements provide an indication of Congressional intent.

=== 1995–99 expansion ===
Between 1995 and 1999, President Bill Clinton issued executive directives (and amendments to the directives) that allowed the release of previously classified national security documents more than 25 years old and of historical interest, as part of the FOIA. This release of information allowed many previously publicly unknown details about the Cold War and other historical events to be discussed openly.

=== Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 ===
The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA) stated that all agencies are required by statute to make certain types of records, created by the agency on or after November 1, 1996, available electronically. Agencies must also provide electronic reading rooms for citizens to use to have access to records. Given the large volume of records and limited resources, the amendment also extended the agencies&#x27; required response time to FOIA requests. Formerly, the response time was ten days and the amendment extended it to twenty business days.

=== 2001 Executive Order limiting the FOIA ===
Executive Order 13233, drafted by Alberto R. Gonzales and issued by President George W. Bush on November 1, 2001, restricted access to the records of former presidents.

This order was revoked on January 21, 2009, as part of President Barack Obama&#x27;s . Public access to presidential records was restored to the original extent of five years (12 for some records) outlined in the Presidential Records Act.

=== Intelligence Authorization Act of 2002 amending the FOIA ===
In 2002, Congress passed the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, . Within this omnibus legislation were amendments to the FOIA (pertaining mainly to intelligence agencies) entitled &quot;Prohibition on Compliance with Requests for Information Submitted by Foreign Governments&quot;:

In effect, this new language precluded any covered U.S. intelligence agency from disclosing records in response to FOIA requests made by foreign governments or international governmental organizations. By its terms, it prohibits disclosure in response to requests made by such non-U.S. governmental entities either directly or through a &quot;representative&quot;. This means that for any FOIA request that by its nature appears as if it might have been made by or on behalf of a non-U.S. governmental entity, a covered agency may inquire into the particular circumstances of the requester in order to properly implement this new FOIA provision.

The agencies affected by this amendment are those that are part of, or contain &quot;an element of&quot;, the &quot;intelligence community&quot;. As defined in the National Security Act of 1947 (as amended), they consist of the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office (and certain other reconnaissance offices within the Department of Defense), the intelligence elements of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps, the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Energy, and the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the Department of State, and &quot;such other elements of any other department or agency as may be designated by the President, or designated jointly by the Director of Central Intelligence and the head of the department or agency concerned, as an element of the intelligence community&quot;.

=== OPEN Government Act of 2007 ===
President George W. Bush signed the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007, , on December 31, 2007. This law, also known as the &quot;OPEN Government Act of 2007&quot;, amended the federal FOIA statute in several ways. According to a White House press release, it does so by:
#establishing a definition of &quot;a representative of the news media;&quot;
#directing that required attorney fees be paid from an agency&#x27;s own appropriation rather than from the Judgment Fund;
#prohibiting an agency from assessing certain fees if it fails to comply with FOIA deadlines; and
#establishing an Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) in the National Archives and Records Administration to review agency compliance with FOIA.

Changes include the following:
* it recognizes electronic media specifically and defines &quot;News Media&quot; as &quot;any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.&quot;
*it extends the 20-day deadline by allowing for up to 10 days between the FOIA office of the agency and the component of the agency holding the records and specifically allows for clarification of requests by the FOIA office (Effective 12/31/2007).
*it calls for each agency to designate a FOIA Public Liaison, &quot;who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes&quot; (Effective 12/31/2008).
* it requires agencies to assign tracking numbers to FOIA requests that take longer than 10 days, and to provide systems determining the status of a request.
* it codifies and defines annual reporting requirements for each agency&#x27;s FOIA program.
* it specifically addresses data sources used to generate reports; &quot;shall make the raw statistical data used in its reports available electronically ...&quot;
* it redefines the definition of an agency &quot;record&quot; to include information held for an agency by a government contractor.
* it establishes an Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which will offer mediation services to resolve disputes as non-exclusive alternative to litigation.
* it requires agencies to make recommendations personnel matters related to FOIA such as whether FOIA performance should be used as a merit factor.
* it requires agencies to specify the specific exemption for each deletion or redaction in disclosed documents.

=== 2009 Executive Order permitting retroactive classification ===
On December 29, 2009, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13526, which allows the government to classify certain specific types of information relevant to national security after it has been requested. That is, a request for information that meets the criteria for availability under FOIA can still be denied if the government determines that the information should have been classified, and unavailable. It also sets a timeline for automatic declassification of old information that is not specifically identified as requiring continued secrecy.

=== 2010 repeal of FOIA amendments in Wall Street reform act ===
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law in July 2010, included provisions in section 929I that shielded the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from requests under the Freedom of Information Act. The provisions were initially motivated out of concern that the FOIA would hinder SEC investigations that involved trade secrets of financial companies, including &quot;watch lists&quot; they gathered about other companies, trading records of investment managers, and &quot;trading algorithms&quot; used by investment firms.

In September 2010, the 111th Congress passed an act repealing those provisions. The act was introduced in the Senate on August 5, 2010 as S.3717 and given the name &quot;A bill to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to provide for certain disclosures under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for other purposes.&quot;

== Notable cases ==
A major issue in released documentation is government &quot;redaction&quot; of certain passages deemed applicable to the Exemption section of the FOIA. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officers in charge of responding to FOIA requests &quot;so heavily redacted the released records as to preclude needed research.&quot; This has also brought into question just how one can verify that they have been given complete records in response to a request.

=== J. Edgar Hoover ===
This trend of unwillingness to release records was especially evident in the process of making public the FBI files on J. Edgar Hoover. Of the 164 files and about eighteen thousand pages collected by the FBI, two-thirds were withheld from Athan G. Theoharis, most notably one entire folder entitled the &quot;White House Security Survey&quot;. Despite finding out that the Truman Library had an accessible file which documented all the reports of this folder, the FBI and Office of Information and Privacy put forth &quot;stony resistance&quot; to the FOIA appeal process.

=== &quot;Department of Justice v. Landano&quot; murder trial ===
A murder trial decided in 1993, &quot;Department of Justice v. Landano&quot;, , involved what was alleged to be a felony murder committed during a group burglary by defendant Landano. Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor wrote the unanimous opinion. &quot;In an effort to support his claim in subsequent state court proceedings that the prosecution violated &quot;Brady v. Maryland&quot;, , by withholding material exculpatory evidence, he filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the FBI for information it had compiled in connection with the murder investigation.&quot;

In defense, the FBI put forth a claim that the redacted sections of the documents requested were withheld in accordance with FOIA regulations protecting the identity of informants who gave information regarding case details. However, O&#x27;Connor ruled that those who supplied information had no need to remain anonymous in the court setting. &quot;To the extent that the Government&#x27;s proof may compromise legitimate interests, the Government still can attempt to meet its burden with in camera affidavits.&quot; The court thus remanded the case to the Circuit Courts and rejected the FBI&#x27;s claim of confidentiality as being a valid reason to withhold information.

&quot;While most individual sources may expect confidentiality, the Government offers no explanation, other than administrative ease, why that expectation always should be presumed.&quot; Thus, when Theoharis and company were in the middle of fighting in court to obtain J. Edgar Hoover files, they may well have benefited from &quot;Landano&quot; and also Janet Reno&#x27;s assertions of the government&#x27;s need for &quot;greater openness&quot; and &quot;discretionary releases&quot; in 1993.

=== Iran–Contra affair e-mails ===
In the case of &quot;Scott Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, et al.&quot;, the White House used the PROFS computer communications software. With encryption designed for secure messaging, PROFS notes concerning the Iran–Contra affair (arms-for-hostages) under the Reagan Administration were insulated. However, they were also backed up and transferred to paper memos. The National Security Council, on the eve of President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s inauguration, planned to destroy these records. The National Security Archive, Armstrong&#x27;s association for the preservation of government historical documents, obtained an injunction in Federal District Court against the head, John Fawcett, of the National Archives and Records Administration and the National Security Council&#x27;s purging of PROFS records. A Temporary Restraining Order was approved by Senior U.S. District Court Judge Barrington D. Parker. Suit was filed at District Court under Judge Richey, who upheld the injunction of PROFS records.

Richey gave a further injunction to prevent a purging of the George H.W. Bush&#x27;s administration&#x27;s records as well. On counts of leaving the White House clean for the new Clinton Administration, the Bush group appealed but was denied its request. Finally, the Clinton Administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, stating that the National Security Council was not truly an agency but a group of aides to the President and thus not subject to FOIA regulations. Under the Presidential Records Act, &quot;FOIA requests for NSC [could] not be filed until five years after the president ha[d] left office ... or twelve years if the records [were] classified.&quot; The Clinton administration won, and the National Security Archive was not granted a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court on these grounds. According to Scott Armstrong, taking into account labor and material costs, the three presidential administrations spent almost $9.3 million on contesting the National Security Archive FOIA requests for PROFS e-mail records.

=== Secret e-mail accounts and abusive fees ===
In 2013, the Associated Press uncovered several federal agencies where staff regularly used fictitious identities and secret or unlisted email accounts to conduct government business. The use of these email accounts stymied FOIA requests. In some cases, the government demanded exorbitant (greater than $1 million) fees for records that appeals showed should be available for minimal cost.

==Processing time==
The act contains a provision legally requiring agencies to respond to FOIA requests within 20 days, but for two main reasons, many agencies rarely meet this requirement. First, the task of screening requests for sensitive or classified information is often arduous and lengthy at agencies like the FBI and the CIA. Second, congressional funding for agency staff to handle FOIA requests is usually far less than the necessary amount to hire sufficient employees. As a result, parties who request information under FOIA often end up filing lawsuits in federal court seeking judicial orders forcing the agencies to comply with their FOIA requests.

The first major case of this type was the 1976 case &quot;Open America v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force&quot;, in which Open America had filed a FOIA request with the U.S. Attorney General and the FBI requesting copies of all their documents relating to the role of former FBI Director L. Patrick Gray in the Watergate scandal. The FBI had over 5,000 pending FOIA requests at the time and did not respond within the statutory 20-day limit. Open America sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and the court issued an order commanding the FBI to either immediately comply with or deny Open America&#x27;s request. The government appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which found that FOIA requests could be categorized into &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;difficult&quot; requests, and that although Open America&#x27;s request was &quot;difficult&quot;, the FBI had been using &quot;due diligence&quot; in responding to it. The court held that because there was no pressing urgency to Open America&#x27;s request, its lawsuit did not move it to the head of the queue, and it would have to wait its turn. This legal reasoning and holding has been adopted by all other American circuits, though courts continue to complain that FOIA request delays are too long. In the 1983 case &quot;McGehee v. CIA&quot; the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals stated:
In 2015, the Center for Effective Government analyzed 15 federal agencies which receive the most FOIA requests in-depth. The organization used a scale considering three factors: the clarity of agency rules regarding FOIA requests, quality or &#x27;friendliness&#x27; of an agency&#x27;s FOIA webpage, and the timely, complete manner of processing requests. With this metric, it concluded that federal agencies are struggling to implement public disclosure rules. Using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available, ten of the 15 did not earn satisfactory overall grades, scoring less than 70 out of a possible 100 points. Eight of the ten earned Ds, including the Department of Homeland Security (69 percent), Department of Transportation (68 percent), United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) (68 percent), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (67 percent), the United States Department of Labor (63 percent), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (64 percent), the United States Department of Defense (61 percent), the Securities and Exchange Commission (61 percent). The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State earned an F. The State Department&#x27;s score (37 percent) was dismal due to its extremely low processing score of 23 percent, which was completely out of line with any other agency&#x27;s performance. Scores of five agencies, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services, the SEC, the DOJ, and the EPA, even decreased marginally.

== Abuse of FOIA requests ==
Since 2020, election officials across the U.S. have reported an overwhelming increase in records requests from apparent election deniers attempting to disrupt the functioning of local and county election offices. Often unreasonably broad, repetitive, or based on misinformation, the high volume of requests has led to what a Colorado official said amounts to &quot;a denial-of-service attack on local government.&quot; Local election officials in Florida and Michigan have reported spending 25–70% of staff time in recent years on processing public records requests. In 2022, officials in Maricopa County, Arizona reported one request that required nearly half the election office&#x27;s staff to spend four days sorting and scanning 20,000 documents.

A review of recent state laws by the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research found at least 13 states that have sought to protect election staff from the abuse of FOIA requests in several ways, such as creating publicly accessible databases that do not require staff assistance and giving election staff the authority to deny unreasonable or clearly frivolous requests.

== Implementation by government agencies ==
Starting in 2012, the Federal government job title Government Information Specialist was established for professionals focused on FOIA or privacy matters. Agencies sometimes track or process FOIA requests on websites or systems shared across organizations, such as FOIA.gov and eFOIA.

<doc id="590469" wikidata="Q5477055" url="?curid=590469" title="Fox in Socks">
<text>Fox in Socks is a children&#x27;s book by Theodor Seuss Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss. It was published by Random House on January 12, 1965. The book features Mr. Fox as he tries to convince Mr. Knox to repeat tongue twisters about the things happening around them while Knox becomes increasingly frustrated with Fox&#x27;s efforts. The wording of &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; emphasizes the sounds and structure of the words more than their intended meanings, leading the book to include many nonsense phrases and complex arrangements of similar-sounding words. Geisel was working on &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; when he met his future wife Audrey Dimond, and found she was able to repeat the tongue twisters that others could not. In 2001, &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; was listed as the 31st best-selling hardcover children&#x27;s book in the United States.

== Summary ==
&quot;Fox in Socks&quot; begins with a note that the book is dangerous and should be read slowly. It then introduces Fox and Knox, who interact with socks and a box. Fox sees chicks with bricks, blocks, and clocks. He suggests that he and Knox do tricks with them, and he stacks them in different arrangements while speaking in rhyme. Knox complains that his tongue cannot manage the rhymes that Fox is asking him to say. Fox tries a new rhyme about Sue and Slow Joe Crow sewing, but this too frustrates Knox. Fox then rhymes about chewing goo with a Goo-Goose, but Knox refuses to chew the goo or repeat the rhyme.

Fox rhymes about Ben and Bim fighting with brooms and accompanying a pig band, but this further upsets Knox. Knox also rejects Fox&#x27;s rhyme about Luke Luck and his duck licking a lake, then about fleas, cheese trees, and a freezy breeze. When Fox describes tweetle beetles battling with paddles in a bottle on a poodle eating noodles, Knox expresses his anger by shoving Fox into the bottle and giving his own rhyming description of Fox&#x27;s predicament. Knox then leaves, thanking Fox for the fun. The book ends with another note asking whether the reader&#x27;s tongue is numb.

== Writing and publication ==
&quot;Fox in Socks&quot; was written by Theodor Seuss Geisel, using his pen name Dr. Seuss. He wrote the book through most of 1964, also working on &quot;I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew&quot; at the same time. Geisel met Audrey Dimond while he was working on &quot;Fox in Socks&quot;, and she was the only one of the adults who could read the tongue twisters aloud. He married Dimond in 1968.

The main characters Geisel created for &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; are Mr. Knox and Mr. Fox, also called Mr. Socks Fox. Other named characters include Ben and Bim, Luke Luck, Slow Joe Crow, and Sue. They are accompanied by several animals, including chicks, a duck, pigs, a poodle, and fictional animals Goo-Goose and tweetle beetles.

To test his editor Bennett Cerf, Geisel added the inappropriate line &quot;Moe blows Joe&#x27;s nose, Joe blows Moe&#x27;s nose&quot; to his manuscript of &quot;Fox in Socks&quot;. This followed a similar incident two years prior when he added the word &quot;contraceptive&quot; to his manuscript of &quot;Hop on Pop&quot;. &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; was published by Random House on January 12, 1965, as part of its Beginner Books series. Geisel dedicated the book to Audrey Dimond and Mitzi Long, describing them as members of the Mt. Soledad Lingual Laboratories despite no such place existing.

== Analysis ==
&quot;Fox in Socks&quot; was one of two tongue twister books written by Dr. Seuss, alongside &quot;Oh Say Can You Say?&quot; (1979). When writing &quot;Fox in Socks&quot;, Geisel prioritized the sound and structure of the tongue twisters over coherence, resulting in heavy use of nonsensical phrases. In one instance, &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; describes a &quot;tweetle beetle noodle poodle bottled paddled muddled duddled fuddled wuddled fox in socks&quot;. Such phrases retain appropriate word order. When describing a &quot;tweetle beetle puddle paddle battle&quot;, Geisel couples &quot;paddle&quot; and &quot;battle&quot; to describe a &quot;paddle battle&quot; within the larger phrase. The word &quot;puddle&quot; then describes the setting of the battle, and &quot;tweetle beetle&quot; adds a descriptor for the type of &quot;puddle paddle battle&quot;. The rhymes are accompanied by a challenge on the front cover for readers to &quot;read aloud to find out just how smart your tongue is&quot;. In the story, Mr. Knox describes the tongue twisters as &quot;blibber blubber&quot;.

&quot;Fox in Socks&quot; presents readers with the change of words&#x27; meanings in different contexts. This includes how a list of stacked items is harmless when stacked on the ground, but that they indicate a negative consequence when stacked on a character&#x27;s head. The book expresses a common Seuss theme of optimism. The phrase &quot;you can make&quot; appears as a refrain at the beginning of several sentences. It also features Seuss&#x27;s respect for manners, having Mr. Knox refer to the Fox as &quot;Mr. Fox, sir&quot;. Like many books by Dr. Seuss, &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; includes joyous feasting, in this case portrayed with the Gooey Gluey Blue Goo being chewed on by the Goo-Goose. Philosophy professor Sharon Kaye comments on the relationship of the characters Sue and Slow Joe Crow, suggesting they are an example of a friendship of utility as described by Aristotle, as they have little in common but both benefit from sewing one another&#x27;s clothes.

The book is one of several by Dr. Seuss in which younger characters teach older ones, along with books like &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; (1940), &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; (1960), and &quot;Hop on Pop&quot; (1963). In this case, Mr. Fox is more skilled with tongue twisters and tries to instruct Mr. Knox. The end of the book subverts this theme when Mr. Knox grows frustrated with Mr. Fox and strikes back at him. Literary scholar Philip Nel likened this to the moral of &quot;Sam and the Firefly&quot; by P. D. Eastman and Geisel&#x27;s earlier &quot;Private Snafu&quot; cartoons, which teach that knowledge should not be flaunted or abused. Nel considered &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; to be an example of a book that is &quot;avant-garde&quot; for adults but not for children. Under his reasoning, the deconstruction of language present in the book only works for those familiar with more typical linguistic structure, but young children lack the literary experience to be confused by this. Conversely, adults will expect the simple words to be easily read and be taken by surprise. A child will read the tongue twisters more carefully than adults, causing the book to be easier for children in a relative sense.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Fox in Socks&quot; ranked 31st in a 2001 list of best-selling children&#x27;s hardcover books in the United States by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and was the 8th best-selling book by Dr. Seuss. By this time, it had sold over three million copies. The &quot;Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot; (1992) cites fourteen lines of &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; in its coverage of &quot;compounds in context&quot;.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; considered &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; an &quot;amusing exercise for beginning readers&quot; as it requires focus on each word, but it said that the tongue twisters made little sense when removed from the context of their illustrations. Roderick Nordell wrote for the Christian Science Monitor that the book is sufficiently enjoyable to read that it encourages children to work with more challenging material. However, Donald Barr of &quot;Book Week&quot; criticized the book for being charmless and unnecessarily elaborate.

Journalist Jonathan Cott listed &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; among Dr. Seuss&#x27;s best examples of books that balance entertainment with educational value. Children&#x27;s literature professor Francelia Butler praised the book as having the best examples of Geisel&#x27;s nonsense rhymes. Children&#x27;s literature professor David Rudd likened the use of words&#x27; construction in &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; to its contemporaries &quot;The Wonderful O&quot; by James Thurber and &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; by Norton Juster. He described these works as successors of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear in the genre of literary nonsense.

<doc id="590473" wikidata="Q126473" url="?curid=590473" title="Contraction (grammar)">
<text>A contraction is a shortened version of the spoken and written forms of a word, syllable, or word group, created by omission of internal letters and sounds.

In linguistic analysis, contractions should not be confused with crasis, abbreviations and initialisms (including acronyms), with which they share some semantic and phonetic functions, though all three are connoted by the term &quot;abbreviation&quot; in layman’s terms. Contraction is also distinguished from morphological clipping, where beginnings and endings are omitted.

The definition overlaps with the term portmanteau (a linguistic &quot;blend&quot;), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as &quot;do&quot; and &quot;not&quot;, whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept that the portmanteau describes.

== English ==
English has a number of contractions, mostly involving the elision of a vowel, which is replaced by an apostrophe in writing, as in &quot;I&#x27;m&quot; for &quot;I am&quot;, and sometimes other changes as well. Contractions are common in speech and in informal writing but tend to be avoided in more formal writing (with limited exceptions, such as the now-standard form &quot;o&#x27;clock&quot;).

The main contractions are listed in the following table.

Although &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot; and other forms ending &quot;n&#x27;t&quot; clearly started as contractions, &quot;n&#x27;t&quot; is now neither a contraction (a cliticized form) nor part of one but instead a negative inflectional suffix. Evidence for this is (i) &quot;n&#x27;t&quot; occurs only with auxiliary verbs, and clitics are not limited to particular categories or subcategories; (ii) again unlike contractions, their forms are not rule-governed but idiosyncratic (e.g., &quot;will&quot; → &quot;won&#x27;t, can&quot; → &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;); and (iii) as shown in the table, the inflected and &quot;uncontracted&quot; versions may require different positions in a sentence.

== Chinese ==
The Old Chinese writing system (oracle bone script and bronzeware script) is well suited for the (almost) one-to-one correspondence between morpheme and glyph. Contractions in which one glyph represents two or more morphemes are a notable exception to that rule. About 20 or so are noted to exist by traditional philologists and are known as &quot;jiāncí&quot; (兼詞, lit. &#x27;concurrent words&#x27;), and more words have been proposed to be contractions by recent scholars, based on recent reconstructions of Old Chinese phonology, epigraphic evidence, and syntactic considerations. For example, 非 [fēi] has been proposed to be a contraction of 不 (bù) + 唯/隹 (wéi/zhuī). The contractions are not generally graphically evident, and there is no general rule for how a character representing a contraction might be formed. As a result, the identification of a character as a contraction, as well as the word(s) that are proposed to have been contracted, is sometimes disputed.

As vernacular Chinese dialects use sets of function words that differ considerably from Classical Chinese, almost all of the classical contractions that are listed below are now archaic and have disappeared from everyday use. However, modern contractions have evolved from the new vernacular function words. Modern contractions appear in all major modern dialect groups. For example, 别 (bié) &#x27;don&#x27;t&#x27; in Standard Mandarin is a contraction of 不要 (bùyào), and 覅 (fiào) &#x27;don&#x27;t&#x27; in Shanghainese is a contraction of 勿要 (wù yào), as is apparent graphically. Similarly, in Northeastern Mandarin 甭 (béng) &#x27;needn&#x27;t&#x27; is a phonological and graphical contraction of 不用 (bùyòng). Finally, Cantonese contracts 乜嘢 (mat1 ye5) &#x27;what?&#x27; to 咩 (me1).

;Table of Classical Chinese contractions


== Dutch ==
Here are some of the contractions in Standard Dutch:
Informal Belgian Dutch uses a wide range of non-standard contractions such as &quot;hoe&#x27;s&#x27;t&quot; (from &quot;hoe is het?&quot; - how are you?), &quot;hij&#x27;s d&#x27;r&quot; (from &quot;hij is daar&quot; - he&#x27;s there), &quot;w&#x27;ebbe&#x27; goe&#x27; g&#x27;ete&#x27;&quot; (from &quot;we hebben goed gegeten&quot; - we had eaten well) and &quot;wa&#x27;s da&#x27;?&quot; (from &quot;wat is dat?&quot; - what is that?. Some of these contractions:

== French ==

French has a variety of contractions like in English except that they are mandatory, as in &quot;&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s life&quot;) in which &quot;c&#x27;est&quot; stands for &quot;ce&quot; + &quot;est&quot; (&quot;that is&quot;). The formation of such contractions is called elision.

In general, any monosyllabic word ending in &quot;e caduc&quot; (schwa) contracts if the following word begins with a vowel, &quot;h&quot; or &quot;y&quot; (as &quot;h&quot; is silent and absorbed by the sound of the succeeding vowel; &quot;y&quot; sounds like &quot;i&quot;). In addition to &quot;ce&quot; → &quot;c&#x27;-&quot; (demonstrative pronoun &quot;that&quot;), these words are &quot;que&quot; → &quot;qu&#x27;-&quot; (conjunction, relative pronoun, or interrogative pronoun &quot;that&quot;), &quot;ne&quot; → &quot;n&#x27;-&quot; (&quot;not&quot;), &quot;se&quot; → &quot;s&#x27;-&quot; (&quot;himself&quot;, &quot;herself&quot;, &quot;itself&quot;, &quot;oneself&quot; before a verb), &quot;je&quot; → &quot;j&#x27;-&quot; (&quot;I&quot;), &quot;me&quot; → &quot;m&#x27;-&quot; (&quot;me&quot; before a verb), &quot;te&quot; → &quot;t&#x27;- &quot; (informal singular &quot;you&quot; before a verb), &quot;le&quot; or &quot;la&quot; → &quot;l&#x27;-&quot; (&quot;the&quot;; or &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot; before a verb or after an imperative verb and before the word &quot;y&quot; or &quot;en&quot;), and &quot;de&quot; → &quot;d&#x27;-&quot; (&quot;of&quot;). Unlike with English contractions, however, those contractions are mandatory: one would never say (or write) &quot;*ce est&quot; or &quot;*que elle&quot;.

&quot;Moi&quot; (&quot;me&quot;) and &quot;toi&quot; (informal &quot;you&quot;) mandatorily contract to &quot;m&#x27;-&quot; and &quot;t&#x27;-&quot;, respectively, after an imperative verb and before the word &quot;y&quot; or &quot;en&quot;.

It is also mandatory to avoid the repetition of a sound when the conjunction &quot;si&quot; (&quot;if&quot;) is followed by &quot;il&quot; (&quot;he&quot;, &quot;it&quot;) or &quot;ils&quot; (&quot;they&quot;), which begin with the same vowel sound &quot;i&quot;: &quot;*si il&quot; → &quot;s&#x27;il&quot; (&quot;if it&quot;, if he&quot;); &quot;*si ils&quot; → &quot;s&#x27;ils&quot; (&quot;if they&quot;).

Certain prepositions are also mandatorily merged with masculine and plural direct articles: &quot;au&quot; for &quot;à le&quot;, &quot;aux&quot; for &quot;à les&quot;, &quot;du&quot; for &quot;de le&quot;, and &quot;des&quot; for &quot;de les&quot;. However, the contraction of &quot;cela&quot; (demonstrative pronoun &quot;that&quot;) to &quot;ça&quot; is optional and informal.

In informal speech, a personal pronoun may sometimes be contracted onto a following verb. For example, &quot;je ne sais pas&quot; (, &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;) may be pronounced roughly &quot;chais pas&quot; (), with the &quot;ne&quot; being completely elided and the of &quot;je&quot; being mixed with the of &quot;sais&quot;. It is also common in informal contexts to contract &quot;tu&quot; to &quot;t&#x27;-&quot; before a vowel: &quot;t&#x27;as mangé&quot; for &quot;tu as mangé&quot;.

In Modern Hebrew, the prepositional prefixes -בְּ /bə-/ &#x27;in&#x27; and -לְ /lə-/ &#x27;to&#x27; contract with the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) to form the prefixes -ב /ba/ &#x27;in the&#x27; and -ל /la/ &#x27;to the&#x27;. In Colloquial Israeli Hebrew]], the preposition את (/ʔet/), which indicates a definite direct object, and the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) are often contracted to &#x27;ת (/ta-/) when the former immediately precedes the latter; thus, ראיתי את הכלב (/ʁaˈʔiti ʔet haˈkelev/, &quot;I saw the dog&quot;) may become ראיתי ת&#x27;כלב (/ʁaˈʔiti taˈkelev/).

== Italian ==
In Italian, prepositions merge with direct articles in predictable ways. The prepositions &quot;a&quot;, &quot;da&quot;, &quot;di&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;su&quot;, &quot;con&quot; and &quot;per&quot; combine with the various forms of the definite article, namely &quot;il&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;,&quot; &quot;i&quot;, &quot;gli&quot;, &quot;gl&#x27;,&quot; and &quot;le&quot;.

* Contractions with &quot;a&quot;, &quot;da&quot;, &quot;di&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, and &quot;su&quot; are mandatory, but those with &quot;con&quot; and &quot;per&quot; are optional.
* Words in parentheses are no longer very commonly used. However, there&#x27;s a difference between &quot;pel&quot; and &quot;pei&quot;, which are old-fashioned, and the other contractions of &quot;per&quot;, which are frankly obsolete. &quot;Col&quot; and &quot;coi&quot; are still common; &quot;collo&quot;, &quot;colla&quot;, &quot;cogli&quot; and &quot;colle&quot; are nowadays rare in the written language, but common in speaking.
* Formerly, &quot;gl&quot;&#x27; was often used before words beginning with &quot;i&quot;, however it is no longer in very common (written) use.

The words &quot;ci&quot; and &quot;è&quot; (form of &quot;essere&quot;, to be) and the words &quot;vi&quot; and &quot;è&quot; are contracted into &quot;c&#x27;è&quot; and &quot;v&#x27;è&quot; (both meaning &quot;there is&quot;).
* &quot;&quot;C&#x27;è&quot; / &quot;V&#x27;è&quot; un problema&quot; – There is a problem

The words &quot;dove&quot; and &quot;come&quot; are contracted with any word that begins with &quot;e&quot;, deleting the &quot;-e&quot; of the principal word, as in &quot;Com&#x27;era bello!&quot; – &quot;How handsome he / it was!&quot;, &quot;Dov&#x27;è il tuo amico?&quot; – &quot;Where&#x27;s your friend?&quot; The same is often true of other words of similar form, e.g. &quot;quale&quot;.

The direct object pronouns &quot;lo&quot; and &quot;la&quot; may also contract to form &quot;l&#x27;&quot; with a form of &quot;avere&quot;, such as &quot;L&#x27;ho comprato&quot; - &quot;I have bought it&quot;, or &quot;L&#x27;abbiamo vista&quot; - &quot;We have seen her&quot;.

== Spanish ==

Spanish has two mandatory phonetic contractions between prepositions and articles: &quot;al&quot; (to the) for &quot;a el&quot;, and &quot;del&quot; (of the) for &quot;de el&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;a él&quot;, meaning &quot;to him&quot;, and &quot;de él&quot;, meaning &quot;his&quot; or, more literally, &quot;of him&quot;).

Other contractions were common in writing until the 17th century, the most usual being &quot;de&quot; + personal and demonstrative pronouns: &quot;destas&quot; for &quot;de estas&quot; (of these, fem.), &quot;daquel&quot; for &quot;de aquel&quot; (of that, masc.), &quot;dél&quot; for &quot;de él&quot; (of him) etc.; and the feminine article before words beginning with &quot;a-&quot;: &quot;l&#x27;alma&quot; for &quot;la alma&quot;, now &quot;el alma&quot; (the soul). Several sets of demonstrative pronouns originated as contractions of &quot;aquí&quot; (here) + pronoun, or pronoun + &quot;otro/a&quot; (other): &quot;aqueste&quot;, &quot;aqueso&quot;, &quot;estotro&quot; etc. The modern &quot;aquel&quot; (that, masc.) is the only survivor of the first pattern; the personal pronouns &quot;nosotros&quot; (we) and &quot;vosotros&quot; (pl. you) are remnants of the second. In medieval texts, unstressed words very often appear contracted: &quot;todol&quot; for &quot;todo el&quot; (all the, masc.), &quot;ques&quot; for &quot;que es&quot; (which is); etc. including with common words, like d&#x27;ome (d&#x27;home/d&#x27;homme) instead de ome (home/homme), and so on.

Though not strictly a contraction, a special form is used when combining con with mí, ti, or sí, which is written as &quot;conmigo&quot; for *&quot;con mí&quot; (with me), &quot;contigo&quot; for *&quot;con ti&quot; (with you sing.), &quot;consigo&quot; for *&quot;con sí&quot; (with himself/herself/itself/themselves (themself).)

Finally, one can hear &quot;pa&quot;&#x27; for &quot;para&quot;, deriving as &quot;pa&#x27;l&quot; for &quot;para el&quot;, but these forms are only considered appropriate in informal speech.

== Portuguese ==

In Portuguese, contractions are common and much more numerous than those in Spanish. Several prepositions regularly contract with certain articles and pronouns. For instance, &quot;de&quot; (of) and &quot;por&quot; (by; formerly &quot;per&quot;) combine with the definite articles &quot;o&quot; and &quot;a&quot; (masculine and feminine forms of &quot;the&quot; respectively), producing &quot;do&quot;, &quot;da&quot; (of the), &quot;pelo&quot;, &quot;pela&quot; (by the). The preposition &quot;de&quot; contracts with the pronouns &quot;ele&quot; and &quot;ela&quot; (he, she), producing &quot;dele&quot;, &quot;dela&quot; (his, her). In addition, some verb forms contract with enclitic object pronouns: e.g., the verb &quot;amar&quot; (to love) combines with the pronoun &quot;a&quot; (her), giving &quot;amá-la&quot; (to love her).

Another contraction in Portuguese that is similar to English ones is the combination of the pronoun &quot;da&quot; with words starting in &quot;a&quot;, resulting in changing the first letter &quot;a&quot; for an apostrophe and joining both words. Examples: &quot;Estrela d&#x27;alva&quot; (A popular phrase to refer to Venus that means &quot;Alb star&quot;, as a reference to its brightness); &quot;Caixa d&#x27;água&quot; (water tank).

== German ==

In informal, spoken German prepositional phrases, one can often merge the preposition and the article; for example, &quot;von dem&quot; becomes &quot;vom&quot;, &quot;zu dem&quot; becomes &quot;zum&quot;, or &quot;an das&quot; becomes &quot;ans&quot;. Some of these are so common that they are mandatory. In informal speech, &quot;aufm&quot; for &quot;auf dem&quot;, &quot;unterm&quot; for &quot;unter dem&quot;, etc. are also used, but would be considered to be incorrect if written, except maybe in quoted direct speech, in appropriate context and style.

The pronoun &quot;es&quot; often contracts to &quot;″s&quot; (usually written with the apostrophe) in certain contexts. For example, the greeting &quot;Wie geht es?&quot; is usually encountered in the contracted form &quot;Wie geht&#x27;s?&quot;.

=== Local languages in German-speaking areas ===
Regional dialects of German, and various local languages that usually were already used long before today&#x27;s Standard German was created, do use contractions usually more frequently than German, but varying widely between different local languages. The informally spoken German contractions are observed almost everywhere, most often accompanied by additional ones, such as &quot;in den&quot; becoming &quot;in&#x27;n&quot; (sometimes &quot;im&quot;) or &quot;haben wir&quot; becoming &quot;hamwer&quot;, &quot;hammor&quot;, &quot;hemmer&quot;, or &quot;hamma&quot; depending on local intonation preferences. Bavarian German features several more contractions such as &quot;gesund sind wir&quot; becoming &quot;xund samma&quot;, which are schematically applied to all word or combinations of similar sound. (One must remember, however, that German &quot;wir&quot; exists alongside Bavarian &quot;mir&quot;, or &quot;mia&quot;, with the same meaning.) The Munich-born footballer Franz Beckenbauer has as his catchphrase &quot;Schau mer mal&quot; (&quot;Schauen wir einmal&quot; - in English &quot;We shall see.&quot;). A book about his career had as its title the slightly longer version of the phrase, &quot;Schau&#x27;n Mer Mal&quot;.

Such features are found in all central and southern language regions. A sample from Berlin: &quot;Sag einmal, Meister, kann man hier einmal hinein?&quot; is spoken as &quot;Samma, Meesta, kamma hier ma rin?&quot;

Several West Central German dialects along the Rhine River have built contraction patterns involving long phrases and entire sentences. In speech, words are often concatenated, and frequently the process of &quot;liaison&quot; is used. So, &quot;[Dat] kriegst Du nicht&quot; may become &quot;Kressenit&quot;, or &quot;Lass mich gehen, habe ich gesagt&quot; may become &quot;Lomejon haschjesaat&quot;.

Mostly, there are no binding orthographies for local dialects of German, hence writing is left to a great extent to authors and their publishers. Outside quotations, at least, they usually pay little attention to print more than the most commonly spoken contractions, so as not to degrade their readability. The use of apostrophes to indicate omissions is a varying and considerably less frequent process than in English-language publications.

== Indonesian ==
In standard Indonesian, there are no contractions applied, although Indonesian contractions exist in Indonesian slang. Many of these contractions are &quot;terima kasih&quot; to &quot;makasih&quot; (&quot;thank you&quot;), &quot;kenapa&quot; to &quot;napa&quot; (&quot;why&quot;), &quot;nggak&quot; to &quot;gak&quot; (&quot;not&quot;), &quot;sebentar&quot; to &quot;tar&quot; (&quot;a moment&quot;), and &quot;sudah&quot; to &quot;dah&quot; (&quot;done&quot;).

== Norwegian ==

The use of contractions is not allowed in any form of standard Norwegian spelling; however, it is fairly common to shorten or contract words in spoken language. Yet, the commonness varies from dialect to dialect and from sociolect to sociolect—it depends on the formality etc. of the setting. Some common, and quite drastic, contractions found in Norwegian speech are &quot;jakke&quot; for &quot;jeg har ikke&quot;, meaning &quot;I do not have&quot; and &quot;dække&quot; for &quot;det er ikke&quot;, meaning &quot;there is not&quot;. The most frequently used of these contractions—usually consisting of two or three words contracted into one word, contain short, common and often monosyllabic words like , , , , or . The use of the apostrophe (&#x27;) is much less common than in English, but is sometimes used in contractions to show where letters have been dropped.

In extreme cases, long, entire sentences may be written as one word. An example of this is &quot;Det ordner seg av seg selv&quot; in standard written Bokmål, meaning &quot;It will sort itself out&quot; could become &quot;dånesæsæsjæl&quot; (note the letters Å and Æ, and the word &quot;sjæl&quot;, as an eye dialect spelling of ). R-dropping, being present in the example, is especially common in speech in many areas of Norway , but plays out in different ways, as does elision of word-final phonemes like .

Because of the many dialects of Norwegian and their widespread use it is often difficult to distinguish between non-standard writing of standard Norwegian and eye dialect spelling. It is almost universally true that these spellings try to convey the way each word is pronounced, but it is rare to see language written that does not adhere to at least some of the rules of the official orthography. Reasons for this include words spelled unphonemically, ignorance of conventional spelling rules, or adaptation for better transcription of that dialect&#x27;s phonemes.

== Latin ==

Latin contains several examples of contractions. One such case is preserved in the verb &quot;nolo&quot; (I am unwilling/do not want), which was formed by a contraction of &quot;non volo&quot; (&quot;volo&quot; meaning &quot;I want&quot;). Similarly this is observed in the first person plural and third person plural forms (nolumus and nolunt respectively).

== Japanese ==

Some contractions in rapid speech include ～っす (&quot;-ssu&quot;) for です (&quot;desu&quot;) and すいません (&quot;suimasen&quot;) for すみません (&quot;sumimasen&quot;). では (&quot;dewa&quot;) is often contracted to じゃ (&quot;ja&quot;). In certain grammatical contexts the particle の (&quot;no&quot;) is contracted to simply ん (&quot;n&quot;).

When used after verbs ending in the conjunctive form ～て (&quot;-te&quot;), certain auxiliary verbs and their derivations are often abbreviated. Examples:
* this abbreviation is never used in the polite conjugation, to avoid the resultant ambiguity between an abbreviated &quot;ikimasu&quot; (go) and the verb &quot;kimasu&quot; (come).

The ending ～なければ (&quot;-nakereba&quot;) can be contracted to ～なきゃ (&quot;-nakya&quot;) when it is used to indicate obligation. It is often used without an auxiliary, e.g., 行かなきゃ（いけない） (&quot;ikanakya (ikenai)&quot;) &quot;I have to go.&quot;

Other times, contractions are made to create new words or to give added or altered meaning:
* The word 何か (&quot;nanika&quot;) &quot;something&quot; is contracted to なんか (&quot;nanka&quot;) to make a colloquial word with a meaning along the lines of &quot;sort of&quot;, but that can be used with almost no meaning. Its usage is as a filler word is similar to English &quot;like.&quot;
* じゃない (&quot;ja nai&quot;) &quot;is not&quot; is contracted to じゃん (&quot;jan&quot;), which is used at the end of statements to show the speaker&#x27;s belief or opinion, often when it is contrary to that of the listener, e.g., いいじゃん！ (&quot;ii jan!&quot;) &quot;What, it&#x27;s fine!&quot;
* The commonly used particle-verb phrase という (&quot;to iu&quot;) is often contracted to ～って／～て／～っつー (&quot;-tte/-te/-ttsū&quot;) to give a more informal or noncommittal feeling.
* といえば (&quot;to ieba&quot;), the conditional form of という (&quot;to iu&quot;) mentioned above, is contracted to ～ってば (&quot;-tte ba&quot;) to show the speaker&#x27;s annoyance at the listener&#x27;s failure to listen to, remember, or heed what the speaker has said, e.g., もういいってば！ (&quot;mō ii tte ba!&quot;), &quot;I already told you I don&#x27;t want to talk about it anymore!&quot;.
* The common words だ (&quot;da&quot;) and です (&quot;desu&quot;) are older contractions that originate from である (&quot;de aru&quot;) and でございます (&quot;de gozaimasu&quot;). These are fully integrated into the language now, and are not generally thought of as contractions; however in formal writing (e.g., literature, news articles, or technical/scientific writing), である (&quot;de aru&quot;) is used in place of だ (&quot;da&quot;).
* The first-person singular pronoun 私 is pronounced わたくし (&quot;watakushi&quot;) in very formal speech, but commonly contracted to わたし(&quot;watashi&quot;) in less formal speech, and further clipped in specifically younger women&#x27;s speech to あたし (&quot;atashi&quot;).

Various dialects of Japanese also use their own specific contractions that are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.

== Polish ==
In Polish, pronouns have contracted forms that are more prevalent in their colloquial usage. Examples are &quot;go&quot; and &quot;mu&quot;. The non-contracted forms are &quot;jego&quot; (unless it is used as a possessive pronoun) and &quot;jemu&quot;, respectively. The clitic &quot;-ń&quot;, which stands for &quot;niego&quot; (him), as in &quot;dlań&quot; (&quot;dla niego&quot;), is more common in literature. The non-contracted forms are generally used as a means to accentuate.

== Uyghur ==

Uyghur, a Turkic language spoken in Central Asia, includes some verbal suffixes that are actually contracted forms of compound verbs (serial verbs). For instance, &quot;sëtip alidu&quot; (sell-manage, &quot;manage to sell&quot;) is usually written and pronounced &quot;sëtivaldu&quot;, with the two words forming a contraction and the [p] leniting into a [v] or [w].

== Filipino/Tagalog ==

In Filipino, most contractions need other words to be contracted correctly. Only words that end with vowels can make a contraction with words like &quot;at&quot; and &quot;ay.&quot; In this chart, V represents any vowel.

<text>Daniel Stefanus du Toit (1917–1981) was a South African astronomer.

Daniel Stefanus du Toit was born in Springfontein, in the Free State, South Africa, on 15 December 1917, he was educated at the Sentraal High school Hoërskool Sentraal in Bloemfontein, after school he entered employment at the Boyden Observatory (Harvard College Observatory, Boyden station) at Maselspoort in 1936, and became the chief assistant to the director dr John S. Paraskevopoulos.

He discovered and co-discovered several comets, including 57P/du Toit–Neujmin–Delporte, 66P/du Toit, 79P/du Toit–Hartley. He worked at Boyden Observatory Maselspoort, Free State, South Africa (then administered by Harvard College Observatory, Boyden Station).

All comets were discovered whilst examining photographic plates taken by the Bache or Metcalf telescopes. It was their job to check the photographic plates taken on behalf of Harlow Shapley, then Director at Harvard. The exposures were generally 45 minutes on Cramer High Speed Blue plates, or later Kodak 103a, taken with the 10-inch Metcalf or 8-inch Bache telescopes.
It was during the examination of the exposure for image quality that Daniel du Toit discovered his comets.
Daniel du toit and his colleague Michiel Bester discovered several comets, with Michiel Bester ranked first with 6 comets discovered, and Daniel discovering 5 comets and dr J.S. Paraskevopoulos discovering 2 this gives the Boyden Observatory a total of 13 comets discovered.

Daniel du Toit, discovered his five comets between 1941 and 1945. Curiously, three of Du Toit&#x27;s five comets can still be observed today. His first comet is 57P/du Toit–Neujmin–Delporte (retrospectively designated as P/1941 O1), his second is 66P du Toit, and his third is 79P/du Toit–Hartley. The latter has been in the news recently due to the breakup of its nucleus. In 2002 it was discovered that 57P/du Toit–Neujmin–Delporte to have broken up into at least 19 fragments.

79P/du Toit–Hartley or du Toit 2 is a periodic comet, now divided into two parts, in the Solar System with an orbital period of 5.06 years.
Discovered: 9 April 1945 a Jupiter family comet, expected back 2018 September 13, The dust trail complex of comet 79P/du Toit-Hartley and meteor outbursts at Mars. Uncertainties in the calculation of the orbit meant the comet was lost until rediscovered by Malcolm Hartley of the UK Schmidt Telescope Unit, Siding Spring, Australia in 1982, when it was found to have broken into two parts, probably in 1976. Both parts had a brightness of magnitude 17. Observed in 1987, it was missed in 1992 but rediscovered by astronomers at Los Molinos Observatory, Uruguay on 4 March 2003 at magnitude 17.
Discoverers: Daniel du Toit, Malcolm Hartley
Discovered: on 9 April 1945 with a brightness of apparent magnitude 10.

The 1937 team consisted of Dr Paraskevopoulos, Bester, Du Toit, de Villiers and Steyn.

Daniel du Toit left the observatory post war 1946, to pursue a career in the building industry but was forced into early career change by an accident, losing his leg in later years.
He died on 28 September 1981 at the age of 63 in Bloemfontein, South Africa.

<text>Samuel George Gottlieb Gmelin (4 July 1744 – 27 July 1774) was a German physician, botanist, and explorer.

== Background ==
Gmelin was born at Tübingen as part of a well-known family of naturalists. His father was Johann Conrad Gmelin, an apothecary and surgeon. His uncle was Johann Georg Gmelin, who was also uncle to Johann Friedrich Gmelin (the naturalist publisher of the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; of Carolus Linnaeus). Samuel earned his medical degree in 1763 from the University of Leiden at the young age of 18. While living in the Dutch Republic, Gmelin developed a keen interest in marine algae. In 1766 he was appointed professor of botany at St Petersburg. In the following year he was sent on an expedition to study the natural history of the Russian Empire. He explored the rivers Don and Volga, and the western and eastern coasts of the Caspian Sea. Whilst travelling in the Caucasus he was taken hostage by Usmey Khan of Khaïtakes and died of ill treatment in captivity in Akhmedkent, Dagestan. He was only 30 years of age. His death led to a Russian punitive expedition which briefly conquered Derbent.

Gmelin was the author of &#x27; (1768), the first work dedicated to marine biology dealing exclusively with algae and the first using the binomial system of nomenclature. It includes elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves. However, algal specimens used by Gmelin in the &quot;Historia fucorum&quot; are thought to no longer exist (Dixon &amp; Irvine, 1970). The results of his travels were published in &#x27; (&quot;Trip Through Russia To Study the Three Natural Provinces&quot;) (1770–1784, 4 vols.). The final volume was to be completed by Güldenstädt, but was ultimately edited by Peter Simon Pallas after Güldenstädt&#x27;s death.

==Biography==
In 1772, he married Anna von Chappuzeau, granddaughter of the famous naval captain Jacob Chappuzeau (Iakov Shapizo), hero of the battle of Osel Island in 1719, when he commanded the &quot;Raphail&quot;.

<text>Let It Be is a cover album by the Slovenian avant-garde group Laibach. It was released in 1988 and is a cover of the Beatles&#x27; 1970 album &quot;Let It Be&quot;. It was recorded in Laibach style with military rhythms and choirs, although a few tracks deviate from this formula, most notably &quot;Across the Universe&quot; featuring Anja Rupel of Videosex. The title track is omitted and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; is replaced by the German folk song &quot;Auf der Lüneburger Heide&quot; in combination with &quot;Was gleicht wohl auf Erden&quot;. &quot;For You Blue&quot; begins with Moondog&#x27;s &quot;Crescent Moon March&quot;, which is subsequently used as a counter-melody. &quot;One After 909&quot; includes a small portion of &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, originally written and recorded by the band Deep Purple.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Lennon-McCartney, except where noted.
# &quot;Get Back&quot;  – 4:25
# &quot;Two of Us&quot;  – 4:04
# &quot;Dig a Pony&quot;  – 4:40
# &quot;I Me Mine&quot; (George Harrison)  – 4:41
# &quot;Across the Universe&quot;  – 4:15
# &quot;Dig It&quot; (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Richard Starkey)  – 1:32
# &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;  – 4:34
# &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;  – 1:49
# &quot;One After 909&quot;  – 3:20
# &quot;For You Blue&quot; (Harrison, Hardin)  – 5:10
# &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; (&quot;Auf der Lüneburger Heide&quot; &amp; &quot;Was gleicht wohl auf Erden&quot;) (composed by Ludwig Rahlfs with lyrics based on a poem by Hermann Löns)  – 3:41

&quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; are incorrectly listed on the CD packaging — their order is swapped.

==Production==
Producer Bertrand Burgalat tells about the song Dig a Pony: “I composed the music for ‘Dig a Pony’ entirely from the lyrics without having listened to the original. Even today I’m not sure if I know the original. When I started listening to rock music back when I was 10, The Beatles were too obvious.”

==Legacy==
In 2015 &quot;Let It Be&quot; album cover was ranked 16th on the list of 100 Greatest Album Covers of Yugoslav Rock published by web magazine Balkanrock.

<text>Angle Inlet is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Angle Township, Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota, United States. Its population was 54 as of the 2020 census. The community is part of the Northwest Angle, the only place in the contiguous United States north of the 49th parallel; it is the northernmost census-designated place in the contiguous United States. The French built Fort Saint Charles nearby in 1732.

Angle Inlet has the last one-room school in Minnesota and a post office with a sign stating that it is the &quot;Most Northerly P.O. in Contiguous U.S.&quot; To travel to Angle Inlet by road from other parts of Minnesota, or from anywhere in the United States, requires driving through Manitoba, Canada.

==Demographics==
In the 2020 US Census Angle Inlet&#x27;s population was approximately 54, down by 10% from 60 in the 2010 Census.

==Climate==

Angle Inlet has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), with a plant hardiness zone of 3B with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of . Due to its high latitude and its location near the center of the North American continent, the community experiences one of the most extreme winters in the contiguous United States.

There is no weather station in the area, but the PRISM Climate Group, a project of Oregon State University, provides interpolated data for the area based on the climates of nearby areas.

<doc id="590518" wikidata="Q4260294" url="?curid=590518" title="Yunsi">
<text>Yunsi (29 March 1680 – 5 October 1726), born as Yinsi, was a Manchu prince of the Qing dynasty in China. The eighth son of the Kangxi Emperor, Yunsi was a pivotal figure in the power struggle over the succession to his father&#x27;s throne. Yunsi was believed to be favoured by most officials in the imperial court to be the next emperor but ultimately lost the struggle to his fourth brother Yinzhen, who became the Yongzheng Emperor.

After the Yongzheng Emperor ascended the throne in 1723, Yunsi was named a top advisor to the new emperor and imperial chancellor, the head of the &quot;Lifan Yuan&quot;, in addition to being awarded the title &quot;Prince Lian of the First Rank&quot;. He was removed from office four years later, his titles stripped, then he was banished from the imperial clan. He was charged with a litany of crimes and sent to prison, where he died in disgrace. He was posthumously rehabilitated during the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign.

==Early life==
Yunsi was born to the Kangxi Emperor and Consort Liang, a Manchu woman of the Plain Yellow Banner, and raised by the Consort Hui, mother of Yinzhi, the first son of the Kangxi Emperor. Consort Liang was seen by some historians as coming from a disadvantaged background, because she was a member of the &quot;sin jeku&quot; slave caste before she became the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s consort. While the low status of her mother&#x27;s family affected Yinsi&#x27;s prestige within the ranks of the princes, it also gave Yinsi the impetus to overcome the odds through hard work and cultivating moral character. Over time, Yinsi became one of the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s favourite sons. He was popular with officials at court, and his uncle Fuquan would often praise him in front of his father, the Kangxi Emperor. At the age of only 18, Yinsi was granted the rank of &quot;doroi beile&quot;, the third highest rank of nobility.

==Succession struggle==
The Kangxi Emperor had initially chosen Yinreng, his second son to survive into adulthood, as crown prince. However, towards the later years of the emperor&#x27;s reign, Yinreng engaged in increasingly licentious activities and also established a strong political base revolving around his own authority, causing him to rapidly lose favour. In 1708, during a hunting trip to Rehe, the Kangxi Emperor grew suspicious that the crown prince was conspiring to oust him in a coup. Yinreng was stripped of his position as crown prince and then placed under house arrest. Four days later, in an apparent sign of trust, the Kangxi Emperor commissioned Yinsi to oversee the imperial household department to &#x27;clean house&#x27; and remove some vestiges of Yinreng&#x27;s influence. However, Yinsi used this unique vantage point as an opportunity to curry favour with those previously loyal to Yinreng. Yinsi, widely known to have a strong base of support among the officials of court due to his moral character and wide range of talents, emerged as a serious contender for crown prince. The breadth of his support was his downfall, as it aroused suspicion from the emperor that Yinsi was competing for influence not against other princes but against the emperor himself.

Yinsi&#x27;s support network, which included many top-ranking officials, the Ninth Prince Yintang, Tenth Prince Yin&#x27;e, and the 14th Prince Yinti, became a formidable clique in imperial affairs, bound together by their desire to see Yinsi become the next emperor. Collectively, this group became known as the &quot;Baye Dang&quot;, or the Eighth Lord Party (). The &quot;Baye Dang&quot; often saw itself at odds with the Crown Prince Party (), a similarly influential group bound by their interest of maintaining the position of the crown prince. Once Yinreng was removed as heir apparent, some supporters of Yinsi engaged in conspiracies to murder Yinreng.

Shortly after Yinreng was deposed as crown prince, Yinzhi, the eldest son of Kangxi, had run afoul of the emperor for casting sorcery spells against Yinreng. Yinzhi, seeing his own hopes of attaining the crown prince position evaporate, gave his backing to Yinsi, who had been raised in the household of his mother. At the behest of Yinzhi, a fortune teller by the name of Zhang Mingde was sent to Yinsi. Zhang foretold that Yinsi was predestined for greatness. Yinzhi, long pre-occupied with supernatural ways to influence temporal affairs, relayed Zhang&#x27;s seemingly auspicious predictions about Yinsi&#x27;s future to the emperor in an attempt bolster Yinsi&#x27;s case for becoming crown prince. In response, the emperor, rather than rewarding Yinsi, sentenced Zhang to death by &quot;lingchi&quot; in order to discourage others from becoming involved in the struggle for succession. The Zhang Mingde episode was a huge blow to Yinsi politically and resulted in his own house arrest.

The Kangxi Emperor, disillusioned by ambitions of his remaining sons and the ferocity with which they were plotting against one another, reinstated Yinreng in the crown prince position in 1709. However, the latter was once again stripped of his Crown Prince title a few years later. After the second removal, Kangxi became determined to select another prince as his successor. He issued an order for officials at court to divulge their own preferences on which of his sons should be the next crown prince. In what became essentially a straw-poll vote, the majority of court officials petitioned to the Kangxi Emperor that Yinsi should assume the position of Crown Prince. The breadth of support for Yinsi had ostensibly caught the Kangxi emperor off guard. The emperor, in a stark about-face, declared the results of the mandarin vote tally invalid. The emperor became incensed at Yinsi&#x27;s self-promotion in the struggles that ensued, and stripped him of his &quot;doroi beile&quot; title and stipend (later restored). Many other princes also became disgraced in the lengthy battle for succession. According to some historians, the Kangxi emperor had sensed that Yinsi had amassed greater clout than himself, ultimately pushing him to suppress any further ambition by Yinsi for the throne. Thereafter, Yinsi threw his weight behind the 14th Prince Yinti, who was seen by most observers as being destined for the throne.

==Yongzheng reign==
After his fourth brother, Yinzhen, succeeded their father and became known as the Yongzheng Emperor in 1722, Yinsi changed his name to &quot;Yunsi&quot; to avoid using the same character as the Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s personal name, considered taboo.

A few weeks after the death of the Kangxi Emperor, the Yongzheng Emperor enfeoffed Yunsi as &quot;Prince Lian of the First Rank&quot; (; Manchu: &quot;hošoi hanja cin wang&quot;) and he sat on the emperor&#x27;s top advisory board along with Yinxiang, Maci, and Longkodo. Yinsi was charged with overseeing the &quot;Lifan Yuan&quot;, the bureaucratic organ in charge of the affairs of the Qing dynasty suzerain lands such as Mongolia. Despite bestowing Yunsi with the highest honors, the Yongzheng Emperor targeted those court officials who were Yunsi allies. The Yongzheng Emperor frequently criticised Yunsi for not performing his duties properly. In 1724, for example, the emperor ordered Yunsi to kneel in the inner reaches of the Forbidden City for an entire night, ostensibly for an infraction committed during his oversight of the &quot;Lifan Yuan&quot;. In early 1725, the emperor forcibly exiled Yunsi&#x27;s wife to the interior, and forbid all communication between the two. By 1725, Yunsi had completely lost favour with the emperor, and became the target of trumped-up charges and accusations that eventually led to the stripping of Yunsi&#x27;s princely title, along with his banishment from the imperial clan.

After his banishment, Yunsi was forced to rename himself &quot;Akina&quot; (Manchu: ; ).

Yunsi died in captivity, four years after the Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s coronation. He was posthumously rehabilitated and restored to the imperial clan under the name &quot;Yunsi&quot; during the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign.

===Meaning of &quot;Akina&quot;===
&quot;Āqínà&quot; () is a Chinese transliterating words of a Manchu term which has traditionally been translated as &quot;pig&quot; in Chinese. However it is a false rumour. Some scholars suggest the original Manchu term is &quot;Acina&quot; (), which actually means &quot;to carry (with your crime)&quot;. But according to &quot;Hei tu dang&quot; (黑图档), a Manchu script document now kept in Liaoning Provincial Museum, the original term is &quot;Akina&quot; (). There is some dispute as to whether that is an accurate translation: &quot;frozen fish&quot;, &quot;fish on the chopping block&quot;, or &quot;meat on the chopping block&quot;.

==Location of residence==
According to the &quot;Jingshi Fangxiang Zhigao&quot; (京师坊巷志稿), the Prince Lian family compound was located near Taijichang Road southeast of the Forbidden City, due west of the family compound of Fuquan, the Prince Yu. Its interior structure was altered shortly after Yunsi&#x27;s expulsion from the imperial clan in 1725, and converted to a storehouse during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. Nevertheless, some parts of the original structure may have survived to the present day. Its approximate location is near the present-day Wangfujing Station of the Beijing Subway, near the Ministry of Commerce of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

<doc id="590521" wikidata="Q911315" url="?curid=590521" title="Suksaha">
<text>Suksaha (Manchu: ; ; died 1667) was a Manchu official of the early Qing dynasty from the Nara clan. A military officer who participated in the Manchu conquest of China, Suksaha became one of the Four Regents during the early reign of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722) in the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). He eventually fell out with another regent, Oboi, and was sentenced to death. 

==Biography==
Suksaha was from the Nara clan of the Plain White Banner, hailing from the same tribal affiliation as Gintaisi. His name was Manchu language for &quot;calf&quot; or &quot;big leg&quot;. He was the son of Suna. Suksaha spoke Manchu, Mongolian, and Chinese. He distinguished himself in military campaigns against Joseon Korea and Ming China in the 1630s and 1640s. Notably, he fought at Songshan and Jinzhou in 1641, a series of battles that led to the surrender of Ming commander Hong Chengchou to the Qing cause in 1642.

During the Manchu conquest of China led by Prince Regent Dorgon (1612–1650), who headed the Plain Yellow Banner, Suksaha was rewarded for his military successes and was made a member of the Deliberative Council, the main policy-making organ of the early Qing dynasty. After the accession of the Shunzhi Emperor, Suksaha became a trusted advisor to the Empress Dowager Zhaosheng.

After the death of the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, a modified imperial will was made public which named four regents for the newly enthroned Kangxi Emperor, who was only six years old. The four regents—Soni, Oboi, Suksaha, and Ebilun—had all helped Jirgalang and the Shunzhi Emperor to purge the court of Dorgon&#x27;s supporters in 1651. The four were appointed due to the Empress Dowager&#x27;s wishing to avoid accruing further power in the hands of imperial relatives, which led to a diffusion of imperial power during the Shunzhi reign. Suksaha was the youngest of the four regents.

Suksaha played a decisive role with the execution of Ming loyalist Zheng Zhilong in the early years of the Kangxi reign. Later, he became entangled in political and personal disputes with Oboi during the Emperor&#x27;s minority. Eventually, he split decisively with Oboi. Oboi was looking to consolidate power in his own hands through discrediting the other three regents; Soni was old and frail, and Ebilun was seen as weak. Suksaha thus became Oboi&#x27;s only serious political rival. A few days after Soni died in August 1667 and was no longer able to mediate these conflicts, Suksaha asked to retire on account of old age and illness. 

Possibly on the advice of Oboi, the Kangxi Emperor immediately ordered the Deliberative Council to investigate Suksaha&#x27;s motives. Two days later on September 2, the Council ordered Suksaha and all his male kin arrested; on September 4, it found Suksaha guilty of twenty-four &quot;grave crimes&quot; and recommended that he be executed by slow slicing. They also suggested that many of his male relatives be executed, along with many members of the imperial guard who had supposedly connived in Suksaha&#x27;s schemes. Suksaha&#x27;s sentence was commuted to death by hanging. Several years later, the imperial court recognized that his prior sentencing had been conducted in haste, and rescinded the order to penalize his sons and male kin. One of Suksaha&#x27;s sons, Su Changshou, was allowed to inherit the noble title that the former held prior to his disgrace.

<text>The Revolutionary Command Council () was the ultimate decision-making body in Ba&#x27;athist Iraq. Established after the 1968 Iraqi coup, It exercised both executive and legislative authority in the country, with the Chairman and Vice Chairman chosen by a two-thirds majority of the council. The Chairman was also then declared the President of Iraq and he was then allowed to select a Vice President. After Saddam Hussein became President of Iraq in 1979 the council was led by deputy chairman Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri, deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, and Taha Yassin Ramadan, who had known Saddam since the 1960s. 

The legislature was composed of the RCC, the National Assembly and a 50-member Kurdish Legislative Council which governed the country. During his presidency, Saddam was Chairman of the RCC and President of the Republic. Other members of the RCC included Salah Omar Al-Ali who held the position between 1968 and 1970, Abd al-Khaliq al-Samarra&#x27;i who was a Council member between 1968 and 1973, one of Saddam&#x27;s half-brothers, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Taha Yasin Ramadan, Adnan Khairallah, Sa&#x27;adoun Shaker Mahmoud, Tariq Aziz Isa, Hasan Ali Nassar al-Namiri, Naim Hamid Haddad and Taha Mohieddin Maruf. It was officially dissolved in 2003 by Paul Bremer per Order Number 2 of the Coalition Provisional Authority.

==History==

===Origins===
The Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) was established as the de facto ruling power in Iraq after the military coup of 1968. However, its foundation materialized much earlier. The Revolution of 1958 mobilized a small group of young military officers known as the Free Officers. The Free Officers, headed by &#x27;Abd al-Karim Qasim, agreed that Iraq should become a republic and that army officers should occupy all senior posts in the administration in hopes of keeping civilians subordinate to the officers. As Charles R. H. Tripp explains &quot;the officers&#x27; power would be institutionalized in a Revolutionary Command Council, formed from the membership of the Supreme Committee [an organization of eleven ranking officers who helped plan the coup], and this body would wield supreme executive power in the wake of the overthrow of the monarchy.&quot; The capture of power by the military in 1958 greatly altered the political landscape in Iraq&#x27;s government as military officers gained massive control over civilian and governmental affairs. &#x27;Abd al-Karim Qasim formed a popular government that consolidated its power and redirected oil revenues. However, Qasim was overthrown in 1963 as the Ba’ath Party attempted to gain control. The Ba’thist contingent formed the National Council of the Revolutionary Command which exercised supreme power replacing the RCC. This regimes power was short-lived as new Ba’thists regained the upper hand and brothers Abd al-Salam ‘Arif and ‘Abd al-Rahman ruled Iraq for the next five years.

The coup in 1968 led to the rise of the Ba’ath Party as it regained control. The coup in 1968 led to the establishment of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council which became the ultimate decision-making body in Iraq during the Ba’ath’s rule from 1968 to 2003. Accordingly &quot;under a provisional constitution adopted by the party in 1970, Iraq was confirmed as a republic, with legislative power theoretically vested in an elected legislature but also in the party-run RCC, without whose approval no law could be promulgated.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;second to the council in political importance was the Regional Command of the Baath, the party executive, and third was the Council of Ministers.&quot; The legislature also included the National Assembly and a 50-member Kurdish Legislative Council.

The RCC was composed of a selective group of legislative leaders. The Ba’ath Party supported the RCC but it was not completely Ba’ath led. Under the Provisional Constitution, &quot;article 43 assigns to the RCC, by a vote of two-thirds of its members, authority to promulgate laws and regulations, to deal with national security, to declare war and conclude peace, and to approve the government&#x27;s budget. Article 38 stipulates that all newly elected members of the RCC must be members of the Baath Party Regional Command. The Constitution also provides for an appointed Council of Ministers that has responsibility for carrying out the executive decisions of the RCC.

&quot;The chief executive of the RCC is the president, who serves as the commander in chief of the armed forces and as the head of both the government and the state.&quot; Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr became president, prime minister, chairman of the RCC and secretary-general of the Ba’ath Party, all these positions gave Bakr immense powers of patronage at his disposal. Al-Bakr maintained power until 1979 and then Saddam became the president of Iraq.

===Leaders===
Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, President and Prime Minister of Iraq from 1968 to 1979, also held the position of Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council. Al-Bakr&#x27;s role as Chairman of the RCC strengthened and maintained his power and control of the decision-making process. Hassan al-Bakr&#x27;s involvement in the RCC led to legislation that greatly reinforced the power of the Ba’ath party as he created a strong Ba’ath base within the government.

Charles Tripp makes the point that &quot;in 1969, Saddam was appointed Vice-Chairman of the RCC, arguably the second most powerful office in the state.&quot; Al-Bakr and Saddam&#x27;s political positions helped them consolidate their power and control. The RCC was mostly composed of Ba’ath leaders and their control limited the input from other groups. However, Shi‘i Iraqis were later accepted into the RCC to help appease the unrest among the Shi‘a in the 1970s. Many scholars argue that the powerful positions held by al-Bakr and Saddam in the RCC reinforced their supreme control of the Iraqi government. Saddam promoted an agenda of modernization as vice chairman of the RCC that included literacy and education.

In 1979, Saddam became President of Iraq and Chairman of RCC, with deputy chairman Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri, and deputy Prime Ministers Tariq Aziz and Taha Yassin Ramadan. Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri played an important role in leading the RCC during Saddam&#x27;s administration. The council was led by the deputy chairman, ad-Douri. Through their leadership positions in the council, the deputy chairman and deputy prime minister worked on behalf of Saddam in the RCC to advance the Ba’ath Party&#x27;s interests. The RCC was the supreme policy making force in Iraq until the American-led invasion in 2003 dissolved the council and replaced it with Coalition Provisional Authority. The power of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was transferred to newly appointed Iraqi Interim Government in 2004 and the CPA was dissolved in 2008.

===Power and controversies===
There is a debate among scholars regarding the true power of Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam in their relation to the Revolutionary Command Council. Some scholars argue that early on the RCC &quot;functioned as a genuine collective decision-making body, and was often the arena for heated debates.&quot; Many argue it was Saddam who greatly changed and controlled the RCC by eliminating any manifestations of pluralism. The government under Saddam was often seen as a brutal dictatorship. In 1979, Saddam &quot;accused dozens of party officers and party officials, including five of the RCC’s twenty-two members, of taking part in a Syrian plot against the regime. The accused were put on trial and sent to death. Saddam’s actions at the beginning of his presidency greatly limited the plurality in the RCC with his accusations against the Syrian plot &quot;conspirators.&quot; This action consolidated his power in the RCC.

The Revolutionary Command Council passed a multitude of controversial legislation that advanced only the interests of the Ba’ath Party in Iraq. For example, &quot;Article 200, and the Penal Code of 1969 and its various amendments, provide the death penalty for anyone joining the Ba’ath Party while concealing any previous political affiliation, or who resigns from it to join another party.&quot;

During the Iraq-Iran War, Saddam used the Revolutionary Command Council as his personal headquarters; Saddam maintained tight control of war operations. Saddam&#x27;s tight control limited the power of field commanders and this resulted in an intense conflict between the highest command and the commanders fighting the war. The military showed signs of discontent in 1982, and Saddam responded by executing some three hundred high-ranking officers.

Subsequently, in the 1990s, &quot;reports in the BMJ drew attention to a series of decrees of the RCC introducing amputation of the right hand as judicial punishment for theft, with amputation of the left foot for a second offence, amputation of one ear for evasion of the draft, military desertion, or harbouring deserters.&quot; Amnesty International received reports that confirmed the governmental judicial acts of amputation. After the Gulf War, the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was created to ensure Iraq&#x27;s compliance with policies regarding the production of WMDs. The commission conducted weapons inspections in Iraq. The U.S. used Iraq&#x27;s failure to comply with weapons inspections to prompt the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the end, Saddam&#x27;s regime as the U.S. invaded and captured him.

Many scholars such as Charles Tripp argue that Saddam&#x27;s complete control of both the executive and legislative components of the government led to the rise of a brutal dictatorship that crushed any forms of opposition. Saddam used his vast powers to strengthen the Ba’ath Party and his control. Groups in opposition to the Ba’ath Party increasingly became disconnected from the political process and victimized for their differences.

<doc id="590523" wikidata="Q1042959" url="?curid=590523" title="Ebilun">
<text>Ebilun (Manchu:, Möllendorff: ebilun; ; died 1673) was a Manchu noble and warrior of the Niohuru clan, most famous for being one of the Four Regents assisting the young Kangxi Emperor from 1661 to 1667, during the early Qing dynasty (1644–1912). A largely passive figure during the regency, Ebilun was disgraced following the ouster of the far more powerful regent Oboi and considered a political supporter of the latter. He was stripped of his positions by the emperor but later regained his noble rank. Many of his descendants became influential figures in the Qing imperial government.

==Biography==
Ebilun was from the Niohuru clan, which lived north of the Korean border and belonged to the Bordered Yellow Banner. He was the youngest of the sixteen sons of Eidu (1562–1621), who had been a close associate of Manchu patriarch Nurhaci. Ebilun&#x27;s mother was herself a sister (or according to some sources, a cousin) of Nurhaci.

In 1634, the second Qing emperor Hong Taiji (r. 1626–1643) gave Eidu a posthumous rank of viscount, which Ebilun immediately inherited but lost in 1637 after he tried to interfere in a trial involving his niece. In 1643 Ebilun followed Nurhaci&#x27;s seventh son Abatai in forays inside North China and was credited with the capture of several towns. In 1645 and 1646, after the Qing had defeated the Ming dynasty and made Beijing their capital, Ebilun served under Lekedehun in campaigns to dislodge Ming loyalist He Tengjiao from Hubei and was rewarded with a minor hereditary rank. Yet his position was not assured. Because he belonged to the Yellow Banners, Ebilun was treated with suspicion by Dorgon (the Prince Regent of the young Shunzhi Emperor), whose power base was in the White Banners.

In 1648, during the persecution of Hooge, Dorgon&#x27;s main rival, Ebilun&#x27;s nephew accused Ebilun of having opposed Dorgon during the 1643 succession. Ebilun was sentenced to death, but his penalty was commuted. Half of his property was nonetheless confiscated and his minor nobility title was revoked.

The Shunzhi emperor restored Ebilun&#x27;s titles after Dorgon&#x27;s death, and eventually entrusted Ebilun with three others to assist the rule of his son (the Kangxi Emperor), who ascended the throne in 1661 at the age of seven. Of the four regents, Ebilun was ranked third, after Sonin and Suksaha, and before Oboi. In practice Ebilun acquiesced to Oboi on nearly all decisions, as the latter gained increasing power. Ebilun also played a role in the ouster of Suksaha, which, after the infirm Sonin died, left Oboi the unchallenged top political figure at court. In 1667, after the Kangxi Emperor assumed personal rule, Ebilun was given the title of a first-class duke. In 1669, Manchu noble Giyesu memorialized the Kangxi Emperor listing 21 crimes supposedly committed by Ebilun shortly after the emperor had moved against Oboi. Ebilun was then sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted, and Ebilun retained his title, which could be inherited by his descendants.

==Family and descendants==
Ebilun belonged to the Eidu line of Niohuru clan nobles, many of whom would go on to serve with distinction in the imperial service. He had five sons. The eldest, Faka, inherited Ebilun&#x27;s title of duke in 1667, only to lose it several years later. 

Ebilun&#x27;s sixth son, Yende, served as an official under the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735), and in turn Yende&#x27;s own son, Tsereng, served as Viceroy of Huguang; Yende&#x27;s second son, Necin, served on the Grand Council of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796). Two of Ebilun&#x27;s daughters became imperial consorts of the Kangxi Emperor.

Ebilun&#x27;s seventh son, Alingga, was a main figure in the succession battle among the sons of the Kangxi Emperor.

<text>Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in North America. The structure built by the Ancestral Puebloans is located in Mesa Verde National Park in their former homeland region. The cliff dwelling and park are in Montezuma County, in the southwestern corner of Colorado, Southwestern United States.

==History==

Tree-ring dating indicates that construction and refurbishing of Cliff Palace was continuous approximately from 1190 CE through 1260 CE, although the major portion of the building was done within a 20-year time span. The Ancestral Puebloans who constructed this cliff dwelling and the others like it at Mesa Verde were driven to these defensible positions by &quot;increasing competition amidst changing climatic conditions&quot;. Cliff Palace was abandoned by 1300, though debate is ongoing as to the cause. Some contend that a series of megadroughts interrupting food production systems was the main cause. 

Cliff Palace was rediscovered in 1888 by Richard Wetherill and Charlie Mason while they were looking for stray cattle.

==Description==
Cliff Palace was constructed primarily out of sandstone, mortar and wooden beams. The sandstone was shaped using harder stones, and a mortar of soil, water and ash was used to hold everything together. &quot;Chinking&quot; stones were placed within the mortar to fill gaps and provide stability. Many of the walls were decorated with colored earthen plasters, which were the first to erode over time.
Many visitors wonder about the relatively small size of the doorways at Cliff Palace; the explanation being that at the time the average man was under , while the average woman was closer to . Cliff Palace contains 23 kivas (round sunken rooms of ceremonial importance) and 150 rooms and had a population of approximately 100 people. One kiva, in the center of the ruin, is at a point where the entire structure is partitioned by a series of walls with no doorways or other access portals. The walls of this kiva were plastered with one color on one side and a different color on the opposing side. &quot;It is thought that Cliff Palace was a social, administrative site with high ceremonial usage.&quot; Archaeologists believe that Cliff Palace contained more clans than the surrounding Mesa Verde communities. This belief stems from the higher ratio of rooms to kivas. Cliff Palace has a room-to-kiva ratio of 9 to 1. The average room-to-kiva ratio for a Mesa Verde community is 12 to 1. This ratio of kivas to rooms may suggest that Cliff Palace might have been the center of a large polity that included surrounding small communities.

A large square tower is to the right and almost reaches the cave &quot;roof&quot;. It was in ruins by the 1800s. The National Park Service carefully restored it to its approximate height and stature, making it one of the most memorable buildings in Cliff Palace. It is the tallest structure at Mesa Verde standing at tall, with four levels. Slightly differently colored materials were used to show that it was a restoration.

<doc id="590527" wikidata="Q831169" url="?curid=590527" title="Yinxiang, Prince Yi">
<text>Yinxiang (16 November 1686 – 18 June 1730), formally known as [[Prince Yi (怡)|Prince Yi]], was a Manchu prince of the Qing dynasty. The thirteenth son of the Kangxi Emperor, Yinxiang was a major ally of his brother Yinzhen (that is, the Yongzheng Emperor) during the latter&#x27;s struggle for the succession of the throne. He was made a &quot;qinwang&quot; (first-grade prince) during Yongzheng&#x27;s reign and became one of his closest advisors. He died eight years into the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor and was memorialized with top honours by the emperor. When he died, his title was granted &quot;iron-cap&quot; status and became perpetually inheritable, one of the only twelve such princes in Qing dynasty history.

==Early life==
Yinxiang was born in the Aisin-Gioro clan as the 13th son of the Kangxi Emperor. The emperor had some 55 recorded consorts. Yinxiang&#x27;s mother, Imperial Noble Consort Jingmin, was the daughter of the military commander Haikuan (海寬) from the Bordered White Banner. By the same birth mother, Yinxiang had two sisters, both of whom were younger than him. Yinxiang&#x27;s mother died when he was 14, so he was raised by Consort De, the biological mother of Yinzhen (the future Yongzheng Emperor). This meant that he had an especially close relationship to Yinzhen from a young age.

Yinxiang was schooled in the arts and classics by Fahai, the second son of Tong Guogang, the maternal uncle of the Kangxi Emperor. Fahai was also the imperial tutor to Yinti, the 14th prince who was born to the same mother as Yinzhen. Both of Yinxiang&#x27;s sisters died young shortly after being named &quot;hesuo princess&quot; and wedded respectively to Mongol princes. Yinxiang was a favorite of Kangxi from a young age. He accompanied his father on four inspection tours to the south. However, in 1709 when Kangxi bestowed noble titles to his various sons, Yinxiang was not among the recipients; his younger brother Yinti, however, was named a &quot;beizi&quot;. There is no explanation given in primary sources as to why Yinxiang was not granted a title in spite of seemingly being a favourite of his father.

During the succession battle among Kangxi&#x27;s sons, Yinxiang was imprisoned by the Kangxi Emperor for 10 years. The historical record makes nearly no mention of Yinxiang between 1712 and 1722. It seems like during these years he did not achieve anything remarkable, but did nonetheless conceive several children.

==Yongzheng era==
When the Kangxi Emperor died in 1722, Yinzhen succeeded to the throne as the Yongzheng Emperor. In the same year, Yinxiang was granted the title &quot;Prince Yi of the First Rank&quot; (怡親王); this Prince Yi peerage was one of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s 12 &quot;iron-cap&quot; princely peerages. His personal name was also changed to &quot;Yunxiang&quot; (允祥) to avoid naming taboo because the Chinese character for &quot;Yin&quot; (胤) in &quot;Yinxiang&quot; is the same as the one in the Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s personal name &quot;Yinzhen&quot; (胤禛).

Yunxiang was a staunch supporter of the Yongzheng Emperor, and he worked tirelessly to assist the emperor in administering state affairs despite suffering from poor health. Soon after Yongzheng ascended the throne, Yinxiang was named overseer of the three vaults of the Ministry of Revenue. In 1725, Yunxiang was sent to oversee the water issues in Zhili Province, including flood control and transport. He was still constantly affected by ill health when he returned to Beijing later.

Yunxiang died in June 1730 and was granted the posthumous name of &quot;Zhongjing Chengzhi Qinshen Lianming Xian&quot; (忠敬誠直勤慎廉明賢), so his full posthumous title became Prince Yi Zhongjing Chengzhi Qinshen Lianming Xian of the First Rank (和碩怡忠敬誠直勤慎廉明賢親王). The Yongzheng Emperor praised Yunxiang in his eulogy edict and declared a mourning period of three days, during which imperial court sessions were not held. In the edict, the Yongzheng Emperor also granted an exception by allowing Yunxiang&#x27;s name to be reverted to &quot;Yinxiang&quot;.

==Succession of Prince Yi==
Prince Yi was elevated to an &quot;iron-cap prince&quot; level peerage, that is, the title was to be perpetually inheritable by his successors. Yinxiang&#x27;s sixth generation descendant Zaiyuan was a regent during the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor and was ousted in a coup.

<doc id="590528" wikidata="Q1348178" url="?curid=590528" title="George R. Price">
<text>George Robert Price (October 16, 1922 – January 6, 1975) was an American population geneticist. Price is often noted for his formulation of the Price equation in 1967.

Originally a physical chemist and later a science journalist, he moved to London in 1967, where he worked in theoretical biology at the Galton Laboratory, making three important contributions: first, rederiving W.D. Hamilton&#x27;s work on kin selection with the new Price equation that vindicated group selection; second, introducing (with John Maynard Smith) the concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), a central concept in game theory; and third, formalizing Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection.

Price converted to Christianity and gave all his possessions to the poor. Struggling with a thyroid condition in conditions of great poverty, he grew increasingly depressed and committed suicide.

==Early life==
Price was born in 1922 in the U.S. state of New York. His father, an electrician, died when Price was four. His mother was a former theater actress, and the family struggled through the Great Depression.

Price attended Birch Wathen School followed by Stuyvesant High School in New York. He graduated with a degree in chemistry from University of Chicago in 1943 and received his doctorate in the subject from the same institution in 1946.

In 1947 he married Julia Madigan, but their relationship was contentious as George was a strong atheist while his wife was a practicing Roman Catholic. They divorced in 1955, having had two daughters, Annamarie and Kathleen.

==Career==

===Early career===
Price was a member of the Manhattan Project as a chemist looking into the characteristics of plutonium-235.
Between 1946 and 1948, he was an instructor in chemistry at Harvard University and consultant to Argonne National Laboratory. Later, he took a position at Bell Laboratories to work on the chemistry of transistors. He then worked as a research associate in medicine at the University of Minnesota, working on, among other things, fluorescence microscopy and liver perfusion. In 1955 and 1956, he published two papers in the journal &quot;Science&quot; criticizing the pseudoscientific claims of extrasensory perception.

Continuing with science journalism, Price tried to write a book titled &quot;No Easy Way&quot; about the United States&#x27; Cold War with the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but complained that &quot;the world kept changing faster than I could write about it&quot;, and so the book was never finished.

From 1961 to 1967, Price was employed by IBM as a consultant on graphic data processing. In 1966, he was treated for thyroid cancer, but the operation to remove the tumour left his shoulder partially paralysed and left him reliant on thyroxine medication. With the money from his medical insurance, he moved to the United Kingdom to start a new life in November 1967.

===In Britain===
W.D. Hamilton failed to recall when Price first contacted him, but says Price had read Hamilton&#x27;s 1964 papers on kin selection, and with no training in population genetics or statistics devised the Price equation, a covariance equation that generated the change in allele frequency of a population. Although the first part of the equation had previously been derived by Alan Robertson and C. C. Li, its second component allowed it to be applied to all levels of selection, meiotic drive, traditional natural selection with an extension into inclusive fitness and group selection.

===Conversion to Christianity===
On 6 June 1970, Price had a religious experience and became an ardent scholar of the New Testament. He believed that there had been too many coincidences in his life. In particular, he wrote a lengthy essay titled &quot;The Twelve Days of Easter&quot;, arguing that the calendar of events surrounding Jesus of Nazareth&#x27;s death in Easter Week was actually slightly longer. Later he turned away from Biblical scholarship and instead dedicated his life to community work, helping the needy of North London.

===Other work in evolutionary theory===
Price developed a new interpretation of Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection, the Price equation, which has now been accepted as the best interpretation of a formerly enigmatic result. He wrote what is still widely held to be the best mathematical, biological and evolutionary representation of altruism. He also pioneered the application of game theory to evolutionary biology, in a co-authored 1973 paper with John Maynard Smith. Furthermore, Price reasoned that in the same way as an organism may sacrifice itself and further its genes (altruism) an organism may sacrifice itself to eliminate others of the same species if it enabled closely related organisms to better propagate their related genes. This negative altruism was described in a paper published by W. D. Hamilton and is termed Hamiltonian spite.

Price&#x27;s &#x27;mathematical&#x27; theory of altruism reasons that organisms are more likely to show altruism toward each other as they become more genetically similar to each other. Thus, in a species that requires two parents to reproduce, an organism is most likely to show altruistic behavior to a biological parent, full sibling, or direct offspring. The reason for this is that each of these relatives&#x27; genetic makeup contains (on average in the case of siblings) 50% of the genes that are found in the original organism. So if the original organism dies as a result of an altruistic act it can still manage to propagate its full genetic heritage as long as two or more of these close relatives are saved. Consequently, an organism is less likely to show altruistic behavior to a biological grandparent, grandchild, aunt/uncle, niece/nephew or half-sibling (each carry one-fourth of the genes found in the original organism); and even less likely to show altruism to a first cousin (carrying one-eighth of the genes found in the original organism). The theory then asserts that the further genetically removed two organisms are from each other, the less likely they are to show altruism to each other.

===Helping the homeless===
Price grew increasingly depressed by the implications of his equation. As part of an attempt to prove his theory right or wrong, he began showing an ever-increasing amount (in both quality and quantity) of random kindness to complete strangers. In this way, he dedicated the latter part of his life to helping the homeless, often inviting homeless people to live in his house. Sometimes, when the people in his house became a distraction, he slept in his office at the Galton Laboratory. He also gave up everything to help alcoholics; yet as he helped them steal his belongings, he increasingly fell into depression.

He was eventually evicted from his rented house owing to a construction project in the area, making him unhappy because he could no longer provide housing for the homeless. He moved to various squats in the North London area, and became depressed over Christmas, 1974.

==Death==
Possibly due to the long-term complications of his thyroid treatment, Price committed suicide on January 6, 1975, by cutting his carotid artery with a pair of nail scissors. His body was identified by his close colleague, W.D. Hamilton.

A memorial service was held for Price in Euston. The only persons present from academia were Hamilton and Maynard Smith, the other few mourners being those who had come to know him through his community work. He is buried in St Pancras Cemetery.

==Recognition==
Price&#x27;s contributions were largely overlooked for 20 years; he had worked in theoretical biology for only a short time and was not very thorough in publishing papers. This has changed in recent years. An article by James Schwartz published in 2000 was the beginning of the historical redress. In 2010, Oren Harman&#x27;s LA Times Book Prize winning biography, &quot;The Price of Altruism: George Price and the Search for the Origins of Kindness&quot; was published, and has received major attention, finally bringing Price and his story to the general public. A stage play about Price, &quot;The Altruists&quot; by Craig Baxter, won the fourth STAGE International Script Competition. On 29 March 2016, Farnworth&#x27;s play &quot;Calculating Kindness&quot; opened for a sold-out three-week run at the Camden People&#x27;s Theatre.

==In media==
*The story of Price&#x27;s equation, its application to altruism, and the profound effects this supposedly had on its discoverer&#x27;s life were featured in an episode of &quot;Dark Matters: Twisted But True&quot;, in a segment entitled &quot;Killed by Kindness&quot;.
*Similar coverage, both of Price&#x27;s contributions to studies of altruism and his efforts to disprove the supposed selfishness of altruism, was discussed in &quot;The Good Show&quot; episode of the NPR series &quot;Radiolab&quot; in December 2010.
*The life and work of Price and his work with Bill Hamilton is the central theme of the third and final documentary of the series &quot;All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace&quot; by Adam Curtis and includes an interview with his daughter Kathleen.
*The life story of George R. Price was dramatized in 2010 by Craig Baxter, whose play &quot;The Altruists&quot; won the S.T.A.G.E. (Scientists, Technologists and Artists Generating Exploration) International Playwriting Competition in that year; and again in 2016 by Lydia Adetunji as a play titled &quot;Calculating Kindness&quot;.
*Northern Irish singer songwriter Joshua Burnside wrote about Price and his fate in his song &quot;George Price&quot; 

== Legacy ==
The Papers of George R Price are housed at the British Library. The papers can be accessed through the British Library catalogue.

<text>The Kanuri people (Kanouri, Kanowri, also Yerwa, Barebari and several subgroup names) are an African ethnic group living largely in the lands of the former Kanem and Bornu Empires in Niger, Nigeria, Chad, and Cameroon, as well as a diaspora community residing in Sudan. Those generally termed Kanuri include several subgroups and dialect groups, some of whom identify as distinct from the Kanuri. Most trace their origins to ruling lineages of the medieval Kanem–Bornu Empire, and its client states or provinces. In contrast to the neighboring Toubou or Zaghawa pastoralists, Kanuri groups have traditionally been sedentary, engaging in farming, fishing the Chad Basin, trade, and salt processing.

==Background==
Kanuri peoples include several subgroups, and identify by different names in some regions. The Kanuri language was the major language of the Bornu Empire and remains a major language in southeastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon, but in Chad it is limited to a handful of speakers in urban centers.

The largest population of Kanuri reside in the northeast corner of Nigeria, where the ceremonial Emirate of Bornu traces direct descent from the Kanem-Bornu empire, founded sometime before 1000 CE. Some 3 million Kanuri speakers live in Nigeria, not including some 200,000 speakers of the Manga dialect. The Nga people in Bauchi State trace their origins to a Kanuri diaspora.

In southeastern Niger, where they form the majority of the sedentary population, the Kanuri are commonly called Barebari (a Hausa name). The 400,000 Kanuri population in Niger includes the Manga subgroup, numbering some 100,000 (as at 1997) in the area east of Zinder, who regard themselves as distinct from the Barebari.

Around 40,000 (1998) members of the Tumari subgroup, sometimes called Kanembu, are a distinct Kanuri subgroup living in the N&#x27;guigmi area, and are distinct from the Chadian Kanembu people. In the Kaour escarpment oasis of eastern Niger, the Kanuri are further divided into the Bilma subgroup, numbering some 20,000 (2003), and are the dominant ethnic group in the salt evaporation and trade industry of Bilma.

Kanuri speak varieties of Kanuri, one of the Nilo-Saharan languages. Divisions include the Manga, Tumari, and Bilma dialects of Kanuri and the more distinct Kanembu language.

Inheriting the religious and cultural traditions of the Kanem-Bornu state, The Kanuri people are predominantly Sunni Muslim.

In Chad, Kanembu speakers differentiate themselves from the large Kanuri ethnicity. The Kanembu are centered in Lac Prefecture and southern Kanem Prefecture. Although Kanuri was the major language of the Bornu Empire, in Chad, Kanuri speakers are limited to handfuls of speakers in urban centers. Kanuri remains a major language in southeastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon.

In the early 1980s, the Kanembu constituted the greatest part of the population of Lac Prefecture, but some Kanembu also lived in the Chari-Baguirmi Prefecture. Once the core ethnic group of the Kanem-Borno Empire, whose territories at one time included northeastern Nigeria and southern Libya, the Kanembu retain ties beyond the borders of Chad. For example, close family and commercial ties bind them with the Kanuri of northeastern Nigeria. Within Chad, many Kanembu of Lac and Kanem prefectures identify with the Alifa of Mao, the governor of the region in precolonial times.

Originally a pastoral people, the Kanuri were one of many Nilo-Saharan groups indigenous to the Central South Sahara, beginning their expansion in the area of Lake Chad in the late 7th century, and absorbing indigenous Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Congo and Chadic (Afro-Asiatic) speakers. According to Kanuri tradition, Sef, son of Dhu Ifazan of Yemen, arrived in Kanem in the ninth century and united the population into the Sayfawa dynasty. This tradition however, is likely a product of later Islamic influence, reflecting the association with their Arabian origins in the Islamic era. Evidence of indigenous state formation in the Lake Chad area dates back to circa 800 BCE at Zilum.

==Religion==
The use of proverbs is very apparent in the Kanuri religion of Islam where they are used to help with comprehension of social happenings and to teach the meanings of things. These proverbs are created by the wise old men with a point of view based on the situation and what lesson is trying to be taught. Proverbs will usually reference objects found in everyday life. However, the objects used in the proverbs are used in such a way that they teach social attitudes, beliefs or experiences. Often proverbs are built around necessary acts that are carried out in daily life, but made to be easily visualized and applied to other, more intense situations. Kanuri proverbs can be used as a way to scare or warn the people of foolish or dangerous acts, but can also be more light hearted and encouraging.

The Kanuri became Muslims in the 11th century. Kanem became a centre of Muslim learning and the Kanuri soon controlled all the area surrounding Lake Chad and a powerful empire called Kanem Empire, which reached its height in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when they ruled much of Central Africa.

==Traditional state==
Following the downfall of the Bornu Empire and the Scramble for Africa in the 19th century, the Kanuri were divided under the rule of the British, French and German Empires.

Despite the loss of the Kanuri-led state, the Shehu of Bornu continues as the head of the Bornu Emirate. This traditional Kanuri/Kanembu state maintains a ceremonial rule of the Kanuri people based in Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria but acknowledged by the 4 million Kanuri in neighboring countries. The Shehu (&quot;Sheikh&quot;) of Bornu draws his authority from a state founded before 1000 CE, the Kanem-Bornu Empire.

The current ruling line, the al-Kanemi dynasty, dates to the accession of Muhammad al-Amin al-Kanemi in the early 19th century, displacing the Sayfawa dynasty which had ruled from around 1300 CE. The 19th Shehu, Mustafa Ibn Umar El-Kanemi, died in February 2009, and was succeeded by Abubakar Ibn Umar Garba.

==Political leaders==
In Nigeria, famous post-independence Kanuri leaders include Kashim Ibrahim, Ibrahim Imam, Zannah Bukar Dipcharima, Shettima Ali Monguno, Abba Habib, Muhammad Ngileruma, Baba Gana Kingibe, former GNPP leader Waziri Ibrahim, the former military ruler, Sani Abacha, and the former presidential candidate Bashir Tofa. In Niger, Kanuri-origin political leaders include the former Prime Minister of Niger Mamane Oumarou, and the former President of Niger, Mamadou Tandja.

==Kanuri regionalism in Nigeria==
A Nigeria specific small Kanuri nationalist movement emerged in 1950s, centred on Bornu. Some &quot;Pan-Kanuri&quot; nationalists claimed an area of for the territory of what they called &quot;Greater Kanowra&quot;, including the modern-day Lac and Kanem Prefectures in Chad, Far North Region in Cameroon, the Yobe and Borno states in Nigeria and Diffa and Zinder Regions in Niger and Darfur in Sudan.

In 1954, the Borno Youth Movement (BYM) was founded and played a role as a mass regionalist political party up through the end of colonialism, though it petered out at independence.

<text>Arabic epic literature encompasses epic poetry and epic fantasy in Arabic literature. Virtually all societies have developed folk tales encompassing tales of heroes. Although many of these are legends, many are based on real events and historical figures.

==Popular epic==

Taghribat Bani Hilal is an Arabic epic recounting the Banu Hilal&#x27;s journey from Egypt to Tunisia and conquest of the latter in the 11th century. It was declared one of mankind&#x27;s Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by the UNESCO in 2003.

In the 13th century, an Arabic epic poem entitled &quot;Antar&quot; was created based on Antarah ibn Shaddad, a pre-Islamic Arabian-Abyssinian warrior-poet. In 1898 the French painter Étienne Dinet published his translation of &quot;Antar&quot;, which brought Antar bin Shaddad to European notice. It has been followed by a number of derivative works such as Diana Richmond&#x27;s &quot;Antar and Abla&quot;, which furthered Western exposure to the Antar bin Shaddad legends.

==Fantasy epic literature==

The &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;) is easily the best known of all Arabic literature and which still shapes many of the ideas non-Arabs have about Arabic culture.

The stories of Aladdin and Ali Baba, usually regarded as part of the &quot;Tales from One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, were not actually part of the &quot;Tales&quot;. They were first included in French translation of the &quot;Tales&quot; by Antoine Galland who heard them being told by a traditional Arab storyteller and only existed in incomplete Arabic manuscripts before that. The other great character from Arabic literature, Sinbad, is from the &quot;Tales&quot;.

The &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot; is usually placed in the genre of Arabic epic literature along with several other works. They are usually, like the &quot;Tales&quot;, collections of short stories or episodes strung together into a long tale. The extant versions were mostly written down relatively late on, after the 14th century, although many were undoubtedly collected earlier and many of the original stories are probably pre-Islamic. Types of stories in these collections include animal fables, proverbs, stories of &quot;jihad&quot; or propagation of the faith, humorous tales, moral tales, tales about the wily con-man Ali Zaybaq and tales about the prankster Juha.

The epic took form in the 10th century and reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another. All Arabian fantasy tales were often called &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; when translated into English, regardless of whether they appeared in &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, in any version, and a number of tales are known in Europe as &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; despite existing in no Arabic manuscript.

This epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland. Many imitations were written, especially in France. Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba. Part of its popularity may have sprung from the increasing historical and geographical knowledge, so that places of which little was known and so marvels were plausible had to be set further &quot;long ago&quot; or farther &quot;far away&quot;; this is a process that continues, and finally culminate in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. A number of elements from Arabian mythology and Persian mythology are now common in modern fantasy, such as genies, bahamuts, magic carpets, magic lamps, etc. When L. Frank Baum proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.

Arabian Nights was not the only Fantasy story that exist in Arabic epic literature. Arabic short stories scripts was discovered in 1933 when Hellmut Ritter, a German orientalist, stumbled across it in the mosque of Ayasofya and translated it into his mother tongue. An Arabic edition was belatedly printed in 1956. It contains stories from the Arab world the stories originating in the 10th century, the title page of this medieval Arab story collection has been lost, but the opening sentence of its introduction declares that these are &quot;al-hikayat al-‘ajiba wa’l-akhbar al-ghariba&quot;, which translate in english to &quot;Tales of the Marvellous and News of the Strange&quot;. The Ottoman sultan Selim the Grim, having defeated the Mamluks in two major battles in Syria and Egypt. The sultan celebrated his victory by taking Arabic manuscripts and then shipped to Istanbul and distributed among the city’s mosques. This is probably how the manuscript of Tales of the Marvellous and News of the Strange ended up in the library of the great mosque of Ayasofya. The stories are very old, more than 1,000 years old, Six of these stories were later included in the Arabian Nights, but most of the stories are quite new and are not found in the Arabian nights stories. Tales of the Marvellous includes tales of the supernatural, romances, comedy, Bedouin derring-do and one story dealing in apocalyptic prophecy. The contents page indicates that the complete manuscript contained 42 chapters, of which only 18 chapters containing 26 tales have survived.

Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, considered the greatest epic of Italian literature, derived many features of and episodes about the hereafter directly or indirectly from Arabic works on Islamic eschatology: the &quot;Hadith&quot; and the &quot;Kitab al-Miraj&quot; (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before as &quot;Liber scalae Machometi&quot;, &quot;The Book of Muhammad&#x27;s Ladder&quot;) concerning Muhammad&#x27;s ascension to Heaven, and the spiritual writings of Ibn Arabi.

==Science fiction==
&quot;Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fil Siera al-Nabawiyyah&quot; (&quot;The Treatise of Kamil on the Prophet&#x27;s Biography&quot;), known in English as &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot;, written by the Arabian polymath Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288), is one of the earliest known science fiction novels. While also being an early desert island story and coming of age story, the novel deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation, futurology, apocalyptic themes, the end of the world and doomsday, resurrection and the afterlife. Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using his own extensive scientific knowledge in anatomy, biology, physiology, astronomy, cosmology and geology. His main purpose behind this science fiction work was to explain Islamic religious teachings in terms of science and philosophy. For example, it was through this novel that Ibn al-Nafis introduces his scientific theory of metabolism, and he makes references to his own scientific discovery of the pulmonary circulation in order to explain bodily resurrection. The novel was later translated into English as &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot; in the early 20th century.

A number of stories within the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;) also feature science fiction elements. One example is &quot;The Adventures of Bulukiya&quot;, where the protagonist Bulukiya&#x27;s quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to the Garden of Eden and to Jahannam, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinns, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In another &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tale, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. &quot;The City of Brass&quot; features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city. &quot;The Ebony Horse&quot; features a robot in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the &quot;Third Qalandar&#x27;s Tale&quot; also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman. &quot;The City of Brass&quot; and &quot;The Ebony Horse&quot; can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.

Other examples of early Arabic proto-science fiction include Al-Farabi&#x27;s &quot;Opinions of the residents of a splendid city&quot; about a utopian society, and elements such as the flying carpet.

<doc id="590543" wikidata="Q1446212" url="?curid=590543" title="Opechancanough">
<text>Opechancanough ( ; – ) was a sachem (or paramount chief) of the Powhatan Confederacy in present-day Virginia from 1618 until his death. He had been a leader in the confederacy formed by his older brother Powhatan, from whom he inherited the paramountcy.

Opechancanough led the Powhatan in the second and third Anglo-Powhatan Wars, including the Indian massacre of 1622.

In 1646, the aged Opechancanough was captured by English colonists and taken to Jamestown, where he was killed by a settler assigned to guard him.

== Name ==
The name Opechancanough meant &quot;He whose Soul is White&quot; in the Algonquian Powhatan language.

It was likely derived from a Powhatan original phonemically spelled as /a·pečehčakeno·w/ &lt; &quot;a·pe&quot; &quot;white&quot; + &quot;čehčak&quot; &quot;soul&quot; + -&quot;en&quot; &quot;inanimate verb ending&quot; + &quot;-o·w&quot; &quot;3rd person transitive inanimate subject&quot;. This would have the reconstructed pronunciation or perhaps with nasal spreading and haplology.

Before the 1622 massacre, Opechancanough ceremoniously changed his name &quot;Mangopeesomon&quot;.

==Powhatan warrior==
The Powhatan Confederacy was established in the late 16th and early 17th centuries under the leadership of Chief Wahunsonacock (more commonly known as Chief Powhatan, named for the tribe he originally led, which was based near present-day Richmond, Virginia). Over a period of years, through negotiation and/or coercion, Chief Powhatan united more than 31 of the Virginia Indian tribal groups in the Tidewater region of what is now the Commonwealth of Virginia, essentially the southeastern portion of the modern state.

At the time of the English settlement at Jamestown, which was established in May 1607, Opechancanough was a much-feared warrior and a charismatic leader of the Powhatans. As Chief Powhatan&#x27;s younger brother (or possibly half-brother), he was sachem of a tribe situated along the Pamunkey River near the present-day town of West Point.

Known to be strongly opposed to European settlers, he captured Captain John Smith along the Chickahominy River and brought him before Chief Powhatan at Werowocomoco, one of the Powhatans&#x27; two capital villages. Located along the northern shore of the present-day York River, Werowocomoco is thought to be where Powhatan&#x27;s young daughter Matoaka (known as Pocahontas to historians) intervened on Smith&#x27;s behalf during a ceremony, based upon Smith&#x27;s account.

Written accounts by other colonists confirm that Pocahontas later served as an intermediary between the natives and the colonists, and helped deliver crucial food during the winter of 1607–08, when the colonists&#x27; fort at Jamestown Island burned in an accidental fire in January.

The marriage of Pocahontas and colonist John Rolfe in April 1614 brought a period of peace; this ended not long after her death while on a trip to England and the death of her father, Wahunsonacock, in 1618. A short time later, after a brief succession of the chiefdom by his older brother Opitchapam (during which Opechancanough was war chief), Opechancanough became paramount chief of the Powhatan Confederacy.

==Powhatan chief==
The natives and the colonists came into increasingly irreconcilable conflict as tobacco (which had been first developed by Rolfe) became the colony&#x27;s cash crop. The relationship became even more strained as ever-increasing numbers of Europeans arrived and began establishing &quot;hundreds&quot; and plantations along the navigable rivers.

Beginning with the Indian massacre of 1622, in which his forces killed many settlers, Chief Opechancanough abandoned diplomacy with the English colonists as a means of settling conflicts and tried to force them to abandon the region altogether. On March 22, 1622, approximately a third of the settlers in Virginia were killed by Powhatan forces during a series of coordinated attacks along both shores of the James River, extending from Newport News Point, near the mouth of the river, to Falling Creek, near the Fall Line at the head of navigation. But the colony eventually rebounded, and colonists later killed hundreds of natives in retaliation, including many warriors poisoned by Dr. John Pott at Jamestown.
Chief Opechancanough launched a last major effort to expel the colonists on April 18, 1644, the third Anglo-Powhatan War. In 1646, forces under Royal Governor William Berkeley captured Opechancanough, at the time believed to be between 90 and 100 years old. They paraded him as a prisoner through Jamestown before a jeering crowd, and he was subsequently killed by a settler who shot him in the back while assigned to guard him in prison. Before dying, Opechancanough reportedly said, &quot;If it had been my fortune to take Sir William Berkeley prisoner, I would not have meanly exposed him as a &quot;show&quot; to my people.&quot;

He was succeeded as Weroance first by Nectowance, then by Totopotomoi, then by Cockacoeske, Totopotomoi&#x27;s wife, who is believed to be Opechancanough&#x27;s daughter or granddaughter.

==Connection with Don Luis==
Historians, including Carl Bridenbaugh, have speculated that Opechancanough was the same Native American youth who was a chief&#x27;s son and is known to have been transported voluntarily from the village of Kiskiack, Virginia, to Spain in the 16th century at the age of 17 and educated. He became known as Don Luis. Murrin, however, suggests that Opechancanough was more likely Don Luis&#x27;s nephew or cousin.

Rechristened as Don &quot;Luis&quot;, the young man returned to his homeland in what is now the Virginia Peninsula subregion of the Hampton Roads region of Virginia, where Jesuit priests established Ajacán Mission in September 1570. Shortly thereafter, Don Luis is believed to have returned to live with the Powhatan and turned against the Europeans. He and his allies killed the Jesuits at the mission in the winter of 1571, ending Spanish efforts to colonize the area.

Other historians speculate that Don Luis may have become the father of Powhatan chiefs Wahunsunacock and Opechancanough. Their remains are buried on the Pamunkey Indian Reservation in King William, Virginia.

==Illness==
From various contemporary reports, it is speculated that Opechancanough suffered from myasthenia gravis. These reports include symptoms of weakness which improved with resting, and visible drooping of the eyelids.

==Representations==
*Opechancanough was portrayed by Stuart Randall in the 1953 low-budget film &quot;Captain John Smith and Pocahontas&quot;. The film shortened his name to &quot;Opechanco&quot;.
*He appeared as a figure in the &quot;Animated Hero Classics&quot; 1994 episode &quot;Pocahontas,&quot; and was voiced by Lorenzo Gonzalez, but is entirely absent in Disney&#x27;s 1995 animated film &quot;Pocahontas&quot; as well as its 1998 direct-to-video sequel &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot;. 
*Opechancanough is portrayed by Wes Studi in Terrence Malick&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;The New World&quot;. In this live-action film, he is conflated with Tomocomo, a priest who accompanied Pocahontas/Rebecca to London.
*In the Sky TV show Jamestown, he is played by Raoul Max Trujillo.

<text>Alexander Lucius Twilight (September 23, 1795 – June 19, 1857) was an American educator, minister and politician. He was recognized as the first African American to have earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from an American college or university, graduating from Middlebury College in 1823. He was ordained as a Congregational minister and worked in education and ministry all his career. In 1829, Twilight became principal of the Orleans County Grammar School. There he designed and built Athenian Hall, the first granite public building in the state of Vermont. In 1836, he was the first African American elected as a state legislator, serving in the Vermont House of Representatives; he was also the only African American ever elected to a state legislature before the Civil War.

His house and Athenian Hall are included in the Brownington Village Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

==African-American roots==
Alexander&#x27;s father, Ichabod, was born in Boston, July 1765. Ichabod&#x27;s father was black, his mother, white, possibly an indentured servant. Eventually, Ichabod married Mary, described as &#x27;white&#x27; or &#x27;light-skinned,&#x27; implying she was of partial African descent.

Ichabod and Mary were free and mixed race, of African and English descent. It is unknown if they were born free; they were likely descendants of enslaved Africans and English settlers. Ichabod was a Revolutionary War veteran from New Hampshire. His parents were both listed in the Corinth, Vermont town history as &quot;the first negroes to settle in Corinth where they bought property, moving from Bradford on November 28, 1798.

==Early life and education==
Alexander Lucius Twilight was born September 23, 1795, in Bradford, Vermont. Starting around 1802 when he was eight years old, Twilight worked for a neighboring farmer in Corinth. Working from an early age was typical of working-class children of his era. For the next 12 years he read, studied, and learned mathematics while working in various farm labor positions.

Twilight enrolled in Randolph&#x27;s Orange County Grammar School in 1815 at the age of 20. From 1815 to 1821, he completed all the institution&#x27;s secondary school courses as well as the first two years of a college-level curriculum. He enrolled in Middlebury College in 1821, where he graduated in 1823 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was the first known African American to receive a degree from an American institution of higher learning. This did not become widely known until 1826, when Amherst College awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree to Edward Jones and claimed that he was the first African-American college graduate, which prompted Middlebury College to publicize Twilight&#x27;s earlier graduation.

==Career==
Twilight&#x27;s first job was teaching in Peru, New York. He also studied for the ministry with the Congregational Church and served several Congregational churches. He occasionally led worship services and delivered sermons. The Champlain Presbytery of Plattsburgh licensed him to preach. Twilight taught for four years in Peru, then moved to Vergennes, Vermont, in 1828 to teach during the week and hold weekend church services in Waltham and Ferrisburg.

In 1829, Twilight was hired as principal of the Orleans County, Vermont, Grammar School in Brownington, the only secondary school in a two-county area, where he was also ordained as minister of the Congregational Church. He built a house for his family shortly after arrival, which still stands and is the headquarters of the Orleans County Historical Society.

Wanting to create a residence dormitory to accommodate out of town students, from 1834 to 1836, Twilight designed, raised funds for, and had built a massive four-story granite building which he called Athenian Hall. The first granite public building in Vermont, it served as a dormitory for the co-educational school, also known as the Brownington Academy. Both his home and Athenian Hall are today part of a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1836, Twilight was elected to the newly established Vermont House of Representatives (Vermont&#x27;s legislature was unicameral, consisting only of the House until 1836), becoming the first African American to be elected to a state legislature. As a member of the House, he worked unsuccessfully to persuade the Vermont General Assembly not to divide school funding between Brownington and nearby Craftsbury, which had decided to open its own school.

He left his job as headmaster in 1847, apparently after a falling out with the Brownington school&#x27;s trustees. He taught school in Shipton and Hatley, Quebec. Without Twilight&#x27;s leadership, the school in Brownington experienced declining enrollment, and it was closed in 1852. Persuaded to return to Brownington, Twilight resumed his duties as principal and pastor. He resigned as pastor in 1853, and continued as principal until 1855.

==Death and burial==
In October 1855, Twilight suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed and caused him to retire as principal of the Brownington school. He died on June 19, 1857, and was buried at the Congregational church in Brownington.

==Marriage and family==
In 1826, Twilight married Mercy Ladd Merrill of Unity, New Hampshire. They remained married until his death, and had no children. Mercy Twilight died in 1878.

==Legacy and honors==

*Alexander Twilight House (1830), still stands across the street from Athenian Hall. Today it serves as headquarters for the Orleans County Historical Society. It is within the Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
*Athenian Hall (1834–36) is now operated by the Orleans County Historical Society as the Old Stone House Museum, and anchors the Historic District of Brownington. It was the first granite public building in Vermont.
*Alexander Twilight Hall at his alma mater Middlebury College was named in his honor.
*The Alexander Twilight Auditorium at Lyndon State College is named for Twilight. 
*The Aspire Alexander Twilight College Preparatory Academy in Sacramento, California, was named for Twilight. It opened in the fall of 2009.
*The Twilight Awards, a special awards show to celebrate teachers, schools and education nonprofits were named for Twilight.
*Howard Frank Mosher wrote about the Stone House in &quot;Vermont Life Magazine&quot;, Autumn 1996:
I like the way the Stone House still looms up on that hilltop, where the wind blows all the time. There it sits, unshaken and monolithic, as I write this sentence and as you read it, every bit as astonishing today as the day it was completed. What a tribute to the faith of its creator, the Reverend Alexander Twilight: scholar, husband, teacher, preacher, legislator, father-away-from-home to nearly 3,000 boys and girls, an African American and a Vermonter of great vision, whose remains today lie buried in the church-yard just up the maple-lined dirt road from his granite school, in what surely was, and still is, one of the last best places anywhere.
*An official portrait of Alexander Twilight hangs in the Vermont State House.

<doc id="590565" wikidata="Q6495541" url="?curid=590565" title="Later life of Isaac Newton">
<text>During his residence in London, Isaac Newton had made the acquaintance of John Locke. Locke had taken a very great interest in the new theories of the &quot;Principia&quot;. He was one of a number of Newton&#x27;s friends who began to be uneasy and dissatisfied at seeing the most eminent scientific man of his age left to depend upon the meagre remuneration of a college fellowship and a professorship.

==1693==
During the period 1692–1693 Newton is known to have suffered a breakdown of nervous functioning, or a supposed depression lasting for 18 months, as reported by Huygens. He suffered insomnia and poor digestion, in his letters to friends showing signs of irrationality.

During exhumation the hair from Newton&#x27;s dead body was found to contain high levels of mercury, remains of desiccated hair were later found to contain four times the lead, arsenic and antimony and fifteen times mercury than in normal range samples. Two hairs contained mercury and separately lead at levels indicating chronic poisoning. Symptoms of mercury poisoning exhibited by Newton were apparently tremor, severe insomnia, delusions of persecution or paranoid ideas, problems with memory, mental confusion, and withdrawal or decline from personal friendships, significant in the period of time, the deterioration of his relations with his &quot;protégé&quot; Nicolas Fatio de Duillier.

Newton documented the first performed alchemy experiment during 1678, having first obtained furnaces and chemicals in 1669. Experiments with metal included analysis of taste of which there are 108 documented, including mercury: documented also by the scientist were similar experiments with arsenic, gold and lead.

Newton recorded in his notebook of experimenting with chemicals during June 1693. The limited evidence for symptomatic mental illness of Newton during this period stem from &quot;correspondences&quot; (c.f. The Royal Society) revealing &quot;melancholia&quot;, desire for withdrawal from relations including his good friends, insomnia, apathy, loss of appetite, &quot;delusion of persecution&quot;, possibly failures in memory (&quot;amnesia&quot;), and bipolar. In a letter written to Samuel Pepys, Newton stated he was

On the 30th of that month Newton reported he had been &quot;seized by a distemper&quot;
== Running the Royal Mint ==
For the last half of Newton&#x27;s adult life, 30 years, he was warden of the Royal Mint as well as Master of the Mint.

=== Appointment to the Mint ===
Newton got his appointment because of his renown as a scientist and because he supported the winning side in the Glorious Revolution.

At some time Locke nearly succeeded in procuring Newton an appointment as provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, but the college had offered a successful resistance on the grounds that the appointment would be illegal; its statutes required that the provost should be in priest&#x27;s orders. Charles Montagu, afterwards Earl of Halifax, was a fellow of Trinity and an intimate friend of Newton, and it was on his influence that Newton relied for promotion to some honourable and lucrative post. However, his hopes were spoiled by long delay. In one of his letters to Locke at the beginning of 1692, when Montagu, Lord Monmouth and Locke were exerting themselves to obtain some appointment for Newton, Newton wrote that he was &quot;fully convinced that Montagu, upon an old grudge which he thought had been worn out, was false to him.&quot;

Newton was now 55 years old, and whilst those of his own standing at the university had been appointed to high posts in church or state, he still remained without any mark of national gratitude. Montagu, after being appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1694 finally put this right; he had previously consulted Newton upon the subject of the recoinage, and took the opportunity to appoint Newton to the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696. In a letter to Newton announcing the news, Montagu writes: &quot;I am very glad that at last I can give you a good proof of my friendship, and the esteem the king has of your merits. Mr Overton, the warden of the mint, is made one of the Commissioners of Customs, and the king has promised me to make Mr Newton warden of the mint. The office is the most proper for you. &#x27;Tis the chief office in the mint: &#x27;tis worth five or six hundred pounds per annum, and has not too much business to require more attendance than you can spare.&quot;

The letter must have convinced Newton of the sincerity of Montagu&#x27;s good intentions towards him; we find them living as friends on the most intimate terms until Halifax&#x27;s death in 1715.

===Achievements and influence===
Although the post was intended to be a sinecure, Newton took it seriously. By the time of his appointment the currency had been seriously weakened by an increase in clipping and counterfeiting during the Nine Years&#x27; War to the extent that it had been decided to recall and replace all hammered silver coinage in circulation. The exercise came close to disaster due to fraud and mismanagement, but was salvaged by Newton&#x27;s personal intervention. Newton&#x27;s chemical and mathematical knowledge proved of great use in carrying out this Great Recoinage of 1696, a process that was completed in about two years. Newton was subsequently given the post of Master of the Mint in 1699, a post worth between £1,200 and £1,500 per annum.

Despite counterfeiting being considered high treason, punishable by hanging, drawing and quartering, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. Undaunted, Newton conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. He himself gathered much of the evidence he needed to successfully prosecute 28 coiners.

One of Newton&#x27;s cases as the King&#x27;s attorney was against William Chaloner. Chaloner&#x27;s schemes included setting up phony conspiracies of Catholics and then turning in the hapless conspirators whom he had entrapped. Chaloner made himself rich enough to posture as a gentleman. Petitioning Parliament, Chaloner accused the Mint of providing tools to counterfeiters (a charge also made by others). He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the Mint&#x27;s processes in order to improve them. He petitioned Parliament to adopt his plans for a coinage that could not be counterfeited, while at the same time striking false coins. Newton put Chaloner on trial for counterfeiting and had him sent to Newgate Prison in September 1697. But Chaloner had friends in high places, who helped him secure an acquittal and his release. Newton put him on trial a second time with conclusive evidence. Chaloner was convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered on 23 March 1699 at Tyburn gallows. Then, he was publicly disemboweled.

Following the 1707 union between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland, Newton used his experience from the English recoinage to direct the 1707-1710 Scottish recoinage, resulting in a common currency for the new Kingdom of Great Britain.

Newton also drew up a very extensive table of assays of foreign coins.

As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by
Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. Due to differing valuations in other European countries this inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard, rather than the bimetallic standard implied by the proclamation.

Due to his income from the Mint Newton became very wealthy, although he lost a substantial sum in the collapse of the South Sea Bubble. Newton&#x27;s niece Catherine Conduitt reported that he &quot;lost twenty thousand pounds. Of this, however, he never much liked to hear…&quot; This was a fortune at the time (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms), but it is not clear whether it was a monetary loss or an opportunity cost loss.

Newton continued in his position at the Royal Mint until his death in 1727.

==Fluxions==

Up to the time of the publication of the &quot;Principia&quot; in 1687 the method of fluxions which had been invented by Newton, and had been of great assistance to him in his mathematical investigations, was still, except to Newton and his friends, a secret. One of the most important rules of the method forms the second lemma of the second book of the &quot;Principia&quot;. Though this new and powerful method was of great help to Newton in his work, he did not exhibit it in the results. He was aware that the well known geometrical methods of the ancients would make his new creations seem less strange and uncouth to those not familiar with the new method. The Principia gives no information on the subject of the notation adopted in the new calculus, and it was not until 1693 that it was communicated to the scientific world in the second volume of John Wallis&#x27;s works.

Newton&#x27;s admirers in the Netherlands informed Wallis that Newton&#x27;s method of fluxions passed there under the name of Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;Calculus Differentials&quot;. It was therefore thought necessary that an early opportunity should be taken of asserting Newton&#x27;s claim to be the inventor of the method of fluxions, and this was why this method first appeared in Wallis&#x27;s works. A further account was given in the first edition of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot; (1704).

To this work were added two treatises, entitled &quot;Accedunt tractatus duo ejusdem authoris de speciebus &amp; magnitudine figurarum curvilinearum&quot;, the one bearing the title &quot;Introductio ad Quadratura Curvarum&quot;, and the other &quot;Enumeratio linearum tertii ordinis&quot;. The first contains an explanation of the doctrine of fluxions, and of its application to the quadrature of curves; the second, a classification of 72 curves of the third order, with an account of their properties.

The reason for publishing these two tracts in his &quot;Optics&quot;, from the subsequent editions of which they were omitted, is thus stated in the advertisement: &quot;In a letter written to Leibniz in the year 1679, and published by Dr Wallis, I mentioned a method by which I had found some general theorems about squaring curvilinear figures on comparing them with the conic sections, or other the simplest figures with which they might be compared. And some years ago I lent out a manuscript containing such theorems; and having since met with some things copied out of it, I have on this occasion made it public, prefixing to it an introduction, and joining a Scholium concerning that method. And I have joined with it another small tract concerning the curvilinear figures of the second kind, which was also written many years ago, and made known to some friends, who have solicited the, making it public.&quot;

In 1707 William Whiston published the algebra lectures which Newton had delivered at Cambridge, under the title of &quot;Arithmetica Universalis, sive de Compositione et Resolutione Arithmetica Liber&quot;. We are not accurately informed how Whiston obtained possession of this work, but it is stated by one of the editors of the English edition &quot;that Mr Whiston, thinking it a pity that so noble and useful a work should be doomed to a college confinement, obtained leave to make it public.&quot; It was soon afterwards translated into English by Raphson; and a second edition of it, with improvements by the author, was published at London in 1712, by Dr Machin, secretary to the Royal Society. With the view of stimulating mathematicians to write annotations on this admirable work, &#x27;s Gravesande published a tract, entitled &quot;Specimen Commentarii in Arithmetican Universalem&quot;; and Maclaurin&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot; seems to have been drawn up in consequence of this appeal.

==Bernoulli&#x27;s mathematical challenge==
Newton&#x27;s solution of the celebrated problems proposed by Johann Bernoulli and Leibniz deserves mention among his mathematical works. In June 1696 Bernoulli addressed a letter to the mathematicians of Europe challenging them to solve two problems:
# to determine the brachistochrone curve between two given points not in the same vertical line
# to determine a curve such that, if a straight line drawn through a fixed point A meet it in two points P1, P2, then mAP1 + mAP2 will be constant.
This challenge was first made in the &quot;Ada Lipsiensia&quot; for June 1696.

Six months were allowed by Bernoulli for the solution of the problem, and in the event of none being sent to him he promised to publish his own. The six months elapsed without any solution being produced; but he received a letter from Leibniz, stating that he had &quot;cut the knot of the most beautiful of these problems&quot;, and requesting that the period for their solution should be extended to Christmas next; that the French and Italian mathematicians might have no reason to complain of the shortness of the period. Bernoulli adopted the suggestion, and publicly announced the postponement for the information of those who might not see the &quot;Ada Lipsiensia&quot;.

On 29 January 1697 Newton returned at 4pm from working at the Royal Mint and found in his post the problems that Bernoulli had sent to him directly; two copies of the printed paper containing the problems. Newton stayed up to 4am before arriving at the solutions; on the following day he sent a solution of them to Montague, then president of the Royal Society for anonymous publication. He announced that the curve required in the first problem must be a cycloid, and he gave a method of determining it. He also solved the second problem, and in so doing showed that by the same method other curves might be found which cut off three or more segments having similar properties. Solutions were also obtained from Leibniz and the Marquis de l&#x27;Hôpital; and, although Newton&#x27;s solution was anonymous, he was recognized by Bernoulli as its author, &quot;comme &quot;ex ungue leonem&quot;&quot; (&quot;as by the claw [we recognize] the lion&quot;).

In 1699 Newton&#x27;s position as a mathematician and natural philosopher was recognized by the French Academy of Sciences. In that year the Academy was remodelled, and eight foreign associates were created. Leibniz, Domenico Guglielmini (1655—1710), Hartsoeker, and E. W. Tschirnhaus were appointed on 4 February, James Bernoulli and John Bernoulli on 14 February, and Newton and Ole Rømer on 21 February.

==End of professorship and presidency of the Royal Society==

While Newton held the office of warden of the mint, he retained his chair of mathematics at Cambridge and discharged the duties of the post, but shortly after he was promoted to be master of the mint he appointed Whiston his deputy with &quot;the full profits of the place.&quot; Whiston began his astronomical lectures as Newton&#x27;s deputy in January 1701. On 10 December 1701 Newton resigned his professorship, thereby at the same time resigning his fellowship at Trinity, which he had held with the Lucasian professorship since 1675 by virtue of the royal mandate. Whiston&#x27;s claims to succeed Newton in the Lucasian chair were successfully supported by Newton himself.

On 11 November 1701 Newton was again elected one of the representatives of the University of parliament, but he retained his seat only until the dissolution in the following July. Newton does not seem to have been a candidate at this election, but at the next dissolution in 1705 he stood for the university. He was warmly supported by the residents, but being a Whig, he was opposed by the non-residents, and beaten by a large majority.

In the autumn of 1703 Lord Somers retired from the presidency of the Royal Society, and on 30 November 1703 Newton was elected to succeed him. Newton was annually re-elected to this honourable post for the remainder of his life. He held the office for 25 years, the longest term of office for any Royal Society president since except Sir Joseph Banks. As president Newton was brought into close association with Prince George of Denmark, the queen&#x27;s husband, who had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society. The prince had offered, on Newton&#x27;s recommendation, to cover the expense of printing Flamsteed&#x27;s &quot;Observations&quot;—especially his catalogue of the stars. It was natural that the queen should form a high opinion of one whose merits had made such a deep impression on her husband. In April 1705, when the queen, the prince and the court were staying at the royal residence at Newmarket, they paid a visit to Cambridge, where they were guests of Richard Bentley, Master of Trinity College. Her Majesty went in state to the Regent House, where a congregation of the Senate was held, and a number of honorary degrees conferred. Afterwards, the queen held a court at Trinity Lodge, where (16 April 1705) she conferred the order of knighthood upon Sir Isaac Newton.

==Second edition of the &quot;Principia&quot;==

As soon as the first edition of the &quot;Principia&quot; was published Newton began to prepare for a second. He was anxious to improve the work by additions to the theory of the motion of the moon and the planets. Dr Edleston, in his preface to Newton&#x27;s correspondence with Cotes, justly remarks: &quot;If Flamsteed the Astronomer-Royal had cordially co-operated with him in the humble capacity of an observer in the way that Newton pointed out and requested Of him... the lunar theory would, if its creator did not overrate his own powers, have been completely investigated, so far as he could do it, in the first few months of 1695, and a second edition of the &quot;Principia&quot; would probably have followed the execution of the task at no long interval.&quot;

Newton, however, could not get the information he wanted from Flamsteed, and after the spring of 1696 his time was occupied by his duties at the mint. Rumours, however, of his work, and of a new edition, were heard from time to time. In February 1700 Leibniz writes of Newton, &quot;J&#x27;ai appris aussi (je ne sais où) qu&#x27;il donnera encore quelque chose sur le mouvement de la Lune: et on m&#x27;a dit aussi qu&#x27;il y aura une nouvelle édition de ses principes de la nature.&quot; (I have learnt - I forget from where - that he will give further details on the movements of the Moon: and I&#x27;ve also been told that there will be a new edition of his &quot;Principia&quot;).

Dr Bentley, the master of Trinity College, had for a long time urged Newton to give his consent to the republication of the &quot;Principia&quot;. In 1708 Newton&#x27;s consent was obtained, but it was not till the spring of 1709 that he was prevailed upon to entrust the superintendence of it to a young mathematician of great promise, Roger Cotes, fellow of Trinity College, who had been recently appointed the first Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy. On 21 May 1709, after speaking to Newton, Bentley announced this arrangement to Cotes: &quot;Sir Isaac Newton,&quot; he said, &quot;will be glad to see you in June, and then put into your hands one part of his book corrected for the press.&quot; About the middle of July Cotes went to London, no doubt expecting to bring down with him to Cambridge the corrected portion of the &quot;Principia&quot;. Although Cotes was impatient to begin his work, it was nearly the end of September before the corrected copy was given to him.

During the printing of this edition a correspondence went on continuously between Newton and Cotes. On 31 March 1713, when the edition was nearly ready for publication, Newton wrote to Cotes: &quot;I hear that Mr Bernoulli has sent a paper of 40 pages to be published in the &quot;Ada Leipsica&quot; relating to what I have written upon the curve lines described by projectiles in resisting media. And therein he partly makes observations upon what I have written &amp; partly improves it. To prevent being blamed by him or others for any disingenuity in not acknowledging my oversights or slips in the first edition, I believe it will not be amiss to print next after the old &quot;Praefatio ad Lectorem&quot;, the following account of this new Edition.
&quot;In hac secunda Principiorum Editione, multa sparsim emendantur &amp; nonnulla adjiciuntur. In Libri primi Sect. ii Inventio viriuni quibus corpora in Orbibus datis revolvi possint, facilior redditur et amplior. In Libri secundi Sect. vii. Theoria resistentiac fluidorum accuratius investigatur &amp; novis experimentis confirmatur. In Libro tertio Theoria Lunae &amp; Praecessio Aequinoctiorum ex Principiis suis plenius deducuntur, et Theoria Cometarum pluribus et accuratius computatis Orbium exemplis confirmatur.
&quot;28 Mar 1713. I. N.
&quot;If you write any further preface, I must not see it, for I find that I shall be examined about it. The cuts for ye Comet of 1680 &amp; 1681 are printed off and will be sent to Dr Bently this week by the Carrier.&quot;

Newton&#x27;s desire to avoid writing the preface seems to have come from a knowledge that Cotes was considering alluding to the dispute about the invention of fluxions. At last, about midsummer 1713, was published the long and impatiently expected second edition of the &quot;Principia&quot;, and; on 27 July, Newton waited on Queen Anne, to present her with a copy of the new edition.

==The longitude problem==

In 1714 the question of finding the longitude at sea, which had been looked upon as an important one for several years, was brought into prominence by a petition presented to the House of Commons by a number of captains of Her Majesty&#x27;s ships and merchant ships and of London merchants. The petition was referred to a committee of the House, who called witnesses. Newton appeared before them and gave evidence. He stated that for determining the longitude at sea there had been several projects, true in theory but difficult to execute. He mentioned four:

# by a watch to keep time exactly
# by the eclipses of Jupiter&#x27;s moons
# by the place of the moon
# by a new method proposed by Mr Ditton.

Newton criticized all the methods, pointing out their weak points, and it is due mainly to his evidence that the Committee brought in the report which was accepted by the House, and shortly afterwards was converted into a Bill, passed both Houses, and received the royal assent. The report ran &quot;that it is the opinion of this committee that a reward be settled by Parliament upon such person or persons as shall discover a more certain and practicable method of ascertaining the longitude than any yet in practice; and the said reward be proportioned to the degree of exactness to which the said method shall reach.&quot; Newton was in charge of the Board of Longitude, and it never gave a prize, but it did give some advance funds to the mathematician Leonhard Euler and some others for work on accurate lunar tables, and these did more or less solve the longitude problem. Some argue that John Harrison, a developer of clocks, should have received the main prize, but in defense of Newton&#x27;s decision not to award it, Harrison&#x27;s work had no effect on maritime navigation. He made a total of four clocks, and at most one of these ever went to sea.

Newton was a very popular visitor at the Court of George I. The Princess of Wales, Caroline of Ansbach, wife of George II, took every opportunity of conversing with him. Having one day been told by Sir Isaac that he had composed a new system of chronology while he was still resident at Cambridge, she requested him to give her a copy. He accordingly drew up an abstract of the system from his papers, and sent it to the Princess for her own private use; but he afterwards allowed a copy to be made for the Abbé Conti on the express understanding that it should not be communicated to any other person. The abbé, however, lent his copy to M Fréret, an antiquary at Paris, who translated it, and endeavoured to refute it. The translation was printed under the title &quot;Abrege de chronologie de M le Chevallier Newton, fait par lui-même et traduit sur le manuscrit anglais&quot;.

Upon receiving a copy of this work, Newton printed, in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; for 1725, a paper entitled &quot;Remarks on the observations made on a Chronological Index of Sir Isaac Newton, translated into French by the observator, and published at Paris.&quot; Newton charged the Abbé with a breach of promise, and answered the objections which Fréret had urged against his system. Father Étienne Souciet entered the field in defence of Fréret; and in consequence of this controversy Newton was induced to prepare his larger work, which was published in 1728, after his death, and entitled &quot;The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended&quot;.

==Theological studies==

From an early period in life Newton paid great attention to theological studies, beginning his studies before 1690. That Newton was even then a powerful thinker was proved by his ability to attack the most difficult mathematical problems with success. For example, in 1716 Leibniz, in a letter to the Abbe Conti, proposed a problem for solution &quot;for the purpose of feeling the pulse of the English analysts&quot;. The problem was to find the orthogonal trajectories of a series of curves represented by a single equation. Newton received the problem at about 17:00 as he was returning from the mint, and though he was fatigued from work, he solved it later the same evening.

One of the most remarkable of Newton&#x27;s theological works is his &quot;Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of the Scriptures&quot;, included in a letter to John Locke in November 1690. Sir Isaac was anxious for its publication but because his argument deprived the Trinitarians of two passages in favour of the Trinity, he became alarmed at the possible consequences. He therefore asked Locke, who was on the way to the continent, to have it translated into French and have it published there. Locke copied the manuscript and sent it to Jean Leclerc on 11 April 1691. On 20 January 1692 Leclerc announced his intention of publishing it in Latin. Upon hearing this Newton responded &quot;to stop the translation and publication as soon as he could.. to suppress it&quot;. This was done, but Leclerc sent the manuscript to the library of the Remonstrants, and it was later published in London in 1754 under the title &quot;Two Letters from Isaac Newton to M le Clerc&quot;. This edition had many errors. Dr Horsley therefore published a genuine one, which is in the form of a single letter to a friend, and was taken from a manuscript in Sir Isaac&#x27;s own hand.

Sir Isaac Newton also wrote &quot;Observation on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John&quot; which was published in London in 1733. Another work &quot;Lexicon Propheticum&quot; published in 1737 was a dissertation on the sacred cubit of the Jews. He wrote four letters to Bentley containing arguments for existence of a deity which were published by Cumberland, a nephew of Bentley, in 1756. Newton also wrote a &quot;Church History&quot; and a &quot;History of Creation, Paradoxical Questions regarding Athanasius&quot;.

==Final years==

In the last few years of Newton&#x27;s life he was troubled by urinary incontinence and urinary tract calculi. In January 1725 he was seized with violent cough and inflammation of the lungs which induced him to move to Kensington. In the next month he had a case of gout and then had an improvement of health. His duties from the mint were terminated and thus he seldom left home. On 28 February 1727 he went to London to preside at a meeting of the Royal Society but his health condition forced him to return to Kensington on 4 March when it was determined he had a gallstone. He endured great suffering. On 18 March he became delirious around 6 pm and stayed in that state until Monday 20 March 1727 when he died between one and two in the morning. His body was taken to London and on Tuesday, 28 March it lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber in Westminster Abbey, and then was moved to his burial location in the Abbey. &quot;(Note: the date of Newton&#x27;s death is 20 March 1726/27 in the &quot;Old Style&quot; Julian calendar and 31 March 1727 in the &quot;New Style&quot; Gregorian calendar).&quot; Voltaire was present at his funeral and praised the British for honoring a scientist of heretical religious beliefs with burial there.

His considerable liquid estate was divided equally between his eight half-nieces and half-nephews — three Pilkingtons, three Smiths and two Bartons (including Catherine Barton Conduitt). Woolsthorpe Manor passed to his heir-in-law, a John Newton (&quot;God knows a poor representative of so great a man&quot;), who, after six years of &quot;cock[fight]ing, horse racing, drinking and folly&quot; was forced to mortgage and then sell the manor before dying in a drunken accident.

Towards the end of his life, Newton took up residence at Cranbury Park, near Winchester with his niece and her husband until his death in 1727. He died in his sleep.

<doc id="590567" wikidata="Q1935311" url="?curid=590567" title="Macbeth (album)">
<text>Macbeth is a 1990 album by Slovenian avant-garde music group Laibach. It consists of music composed and performed by Laibach for a 1987 production of the William Shakespeare play &quot; Macbeth&quot; by at Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, Germany in 1987. It is the second Laibach album consisting of music written for a play, after their 1986 album &quot;Baptism&quot;.

Largely instrumental, the music is a combination of dramatic pseudo-classical themes, typically on strings and brass, and militaristic ones dominated by percussion, with musique concrete interludes. Critics have noted the album&#x27;s resemblance to Laibach&#x27;s earlier, more radical and experimental style, in contrast with their their, at the time, increasing incorporation of popular music elements.

==Track listing==
The LP editions don&#x27;t list the individual track durations. The CD editions contain all music merged into a single half-hour track.

<text>Sky Sports News (SSN) is a British paid television sports news channel run by Sky, a division of Comcast.

== History ==

Sky Sports first started broadcasting sports news bulletins when it began broadcasting the Premier League in the autumn of 1992. Initially, they took the form of a brief &quot;Football Update&quot; before being expanded into a 30-minute programme called &quot;Sky Sports Centre&quot;. These programmes were generally broadcast on weekdays at 6pm and 10pm.

Sky Sports News began broadcasting internal test runs on 10 August 1998 with Mike Wedderburn and Kelly Cates launching the channel with the first edition of &quot;Good Morning Sports Fans&quot;. The service became officially available to the public on 1 October, the launch date of BSkyB&#x27;s Digital Satellite service, and was BSkyB&#x27;s first digital only channel. On 10 April 2000, Sky Sports News relaunched as Sky Sports.com TV, to tie with the launch of the SkySports.com website.

The channel scrapped its &quot;.com TV&quot; look, and on 1 July 2001, Sky Sports News launched another graphics change. A major part of this was the standardisation, i.e., a more corporate look across the Sky channels. The channel also scrapped its slogan and just paid attention to the fact of the news.

From 2002, Sky Sports News was available free to view on digital terrestrial TV. From April 2002, Sky Sports News had another face-lift, the channel stayed in the same studio, but with a silver look replacing the old wooden bench, and there was a promise of being first for breaking news, along with much more useful information.

In 2004, Sky Sports News changed its image, with a more open blue look to the channel. The titles featured players such as Frank Lampard, Tim Cahill, Thierry Henry and Ryan Giggs passing the football to each other and unveiling the Sky Sports News logo. Programmes such as Sky Sports Centre were dropped, and replaced with shows such as &quot;Sky Sports Now&quot;, &quot;Sky Sports Today&quot;, &quot;Sports Saturday&quot;, Sports Sunday, &#x27;Through the Night&quot;, &quot;News HQ at 5&quot;, &quot;News HQ at 6&quot;, &quot;Goals Express&quot;, &quot;Today&#x27;s Goals Now&quot; and &quot;Sky Sports News at Ten, with the exception of &quot;Good Morning Sports Fans&quot;, &quot;Gillette Soccer Special&quot; and &quot;Sky Sports News at Ten&quot;, some of these programme titles have been retired or renamed.

On 20 May 2007, SSN broadcast the Conference National play-off final between Exeter City and Morecambe. This was the first live match to be shown on the channel since certain European games involving British teams were shown to provide exclusivity when competing with the then operational &quot;OnSports&quot; (owned by ITV) as Sky Sports News was not available at that time via digital terrestrial platforms. This was due to all other Sky Sports channels being occupied by live sport. This enabled Freeview viewers to watch a live match on Sky Sports. The station also had live coverage of Wales v New Zealand on 26 May 2007 and the La Liga tie between Espanyol and Barcelona in December 2007.

===Virgin Media dispute===
On 1 March 2007, Virgin Media removed Sky&#x27;s basic channels including Sky One, Sky Two, Sky News, Sky Sports News, Sky Travel and Sky Travel Extra, from their Television Services after a dispute between Virgin Media and BSkyB caused by the expiry of their carriage agreement and their inability to reach a new deal, after attempts were made to reach an agreement. At Midnight, Sky Sports News was removed, with its EPG slot being renamed derisively as &quot;OLD SKY SPORTS SNOOZE&quot; (it was removed with a public apology by Richard Branson hours later). As a direct rival to Sky Sports News, Virgin Media and Setanta Sports launched Setanta Sports News on 30 November 2007. A deal was eventually reached between Virgin and Sky resulting in Sky Sports News returning to the Cable platform on 13 November 2008 on channel number 517.

From 1 September 2009, the channel was made available to subscribers of the Sports Pack, in addition to being available in the News &amp; Events Pack.

===2010–present===
Sky Sports News was removed from Freeview on 23 August 2010 and replaced with Sky3+1, a one-hour timeshift Sky3. Approval for the DTT change was needed from the regulator Ofcom, which told Sky and multiplex licence holder Arqiva that the move &quot;would not unacceptably diminish the capacity of the services broadcast to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests.&quot; Sky claimed that the move back to pay TV allowed them to improve the channel through increased editorial investment.

The channel also previously used a different piece of music for each news programme, the most well-known of these being Republica&#x27;s &quot;Ready to Go&quot;, &quot;The Time Is Now&quot; by Moloko, &quot;Surface to Air&quot; by The Chemical Brothers, &quot;Shooting Star&quot; by Deepest Blue, and &quot;Club Foot&quot; by Kasabian.

Sky Sports News was rebranded as Sky Sports News HQ on 12 August 2014. As part of the change the channel moved to Sky channel 401. At the same time the channel introduced an updated studio including new features, overhauled graphics and a new theme. Following the rebrand of the Sky Sports channels in July 2017, the channel returned to its original name: Sky Sports News.

== Sky Sports News HD ==
Sky Sports News HD launched on 23 August 2010 on Sky channel 455, transferring to channel 405 several months later. The HD channel offered enhancements such as widescreen viewing and sharper graphics. A range of new programmes, such as &quot;First Fast Now&quot; and &quot;Sky Sports News at Seven&quot; were launched plus new presenters, as well as the extension of existing offerings, such as Ed Chamberlin presenting a regular live Sunday afternoon sports update.

Sky backed the launch of the channel with an extensive advertising campaign.

== Simulcasts ==

A number of programmes are simulcast on other Sky Sports channels, including &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; and many of the midweek &quot;Soccer Specials&quot;. Also, Sky Sports News airs on Sky Sports Main Event when that channel is not showing live sport.

&quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; has been simulcast on other Sky Sports channels for many years. Until the 2007/08 season most or all of the programme was broadcast on Sky Sports 1. This was cut back in August 2007 to just the live scores section of the programme i.e., between 15:00 and 17:15. Simulcasting of &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; on Sky Sports 1 stopped altogether in August 2010 but returned to Sky Sports 1 for the 2013–14 season as part of Sky Sports 1 devoting all of Saturdays to football. The simulcast ran between 15:00 and 16:55. For the 2014–15 season the simulcasts switched to the newly launched Sky Sports 5. Since the rebranding of the Sky Sports channels in 2017, &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; has been shown on Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Football, and more recently, the 3pm to 5pm portion of the programme has also been broadcast on Sky One and this portion of the programme is also aired on Sky Showcase.

Until 1 July 2013, two hours of live feed (daily at 07:00 BST, weekdays at 17:00 BST) and one hour of delayed feed (daily at 23:00 BST) were picked up by Fox Soccer in the United States; both Fox Soccer Channel and Sky Sports were News Corporation channels at the time. More hours of the channel were picked up in critical periods such as the end of transfer windows and coverage of qualifying draws for Euro tournaments. The American simulcasts were discontinued on that date as Fox Cable Networks wound down Fox Soccer&#x27;s operations for the 2 September 2013 launch of FX sister channel FXX on its channel space for the launch of Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2. Until March 2017, the only Sky output carried on American TV were darts coverage on BBC America and Sky Sports 2&#x27;s coverage and related programming, such as &quot;The Verdict&quot;, involving the England cricket team on ONE World Sports. ONE World Sports closed in March 2017. Sky&#x27;s English team coverage has since moved to Willow in the United States, including the pre-show and &quot;The Verdict&quot;.

Upon Comcast&#x27;s acquisition of Sky, Sky Sports began to collaborate with the networks of its U.S. counterpart NBC Sports (which holds the U.S. media rights to the Premier League), beginning with Sky Sports News transfer window coverage being simulcast on its pay television channel NBCSN, and Sky reporters contributing to an NBCSN-produced transfer window programme hosted by its own Premier League pundits. In February 2019, it was announced that beginning 4 March 2019, an hour of programming from Sky Sports News would air daily on NBCSN at 11:00 a.m. ET (as part of a new daytime lineup resulting from its loss of rights to &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot;). The simulcast is dropped temporarily at times to facilitate other programming, such as the run-up to the American National Football League&#x27;s draft in April. NBCSN began re-airing Sky Sports News from August 2020 until the network&#x27;s demise on 31 December 2021. On 2 October 2023 Sky Sports News was free to air for one day only to celebrate its 25th anniversary, with a livestream of the channel available to watch on YouTube.

<text>Sir Frank Merry Stenton  (17 May 1880 – 15 September 1967) was an English historian of Anglo-Saxon England, a professor of history at the University of Reading (1926–1946), president of the Royal Historical Society (1937–1945), Reading University&#x27;s vice-chancellor (1946–1950).

==Life==

The son of Henry Stenton of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, he was educated at Keble College, Oxford, and was elected an Honorary Fellow in 1947.

With Allen Mawer, Stenton wrote the second English Place-Name Society volume, &quot;The Place-Names of Buckinghamshire&quot;, published in 1925. He delivered the Ford Lectures at Oxford University in 1929. He went on to write &quot;Anglo-Saxon England&quot;, a volume of the Oxford History of England, first published in 1943 and described by Simon Keynes as &quot;magisterial and massively authoritative&quot;. In the view of Nicholas Higham writing in 1992 it &quot;remains the most complete study of Anglo-Saxon history that has ever appeared. He was himself a historian of the first rank, an eminent place-name scholar and in addition well versed in archaeological literature.&quot;

Stenton was a professor of history at the University of Reading (1926 – 1946), and subsequently the university&#x27;s vice-chancellor (1946–1950). During his period as vice-chancellor at Reading, he presided over the university&#x27;s purchase of Whiteknights Park, creating the new campus that allowed for the expansion of the university in later decades. In November 2008, it was announced that a new hall of residence to be constructed on that campus would be named Stenton Hall, in his honour. The annual Stenton Lecture, given by an eminent historian, was inaugurated at Reading University in 1967.

He was knighted in the 1948 New Year Honours, and received the accolade from King George VI at Buckingham Palace on 10 February 1948.

His wife, Doris Mary Stenton, wrote a preface to the third edition of &quot;Anglo-Saxon England&quot;, published after his death, and edited &quot;Preparatory to Anglo-Saxon England: Being the Collected Papers of Frank Merry Stenton&quot;, published in 1970. She was a historian in her own right, producing &quot;English Society in the Early Middle Ages&quot; for the Pelican History of England, and &quot;The English Woman in History&quot; (1957).

Stenton&#x27;s papers, together with those of his wife Doris, Lady Stenton, their library and his coin collection are part of the Special Collections in the University of Reading.

==Publications==
Stenton&#x27;s major publications were &quot;The First Century of English Feudalism, 1066–1166&quot; (1932) and &quot;Anglo-Saxon England&quot; (1943). Other publications include:

* &quot;The Danes in England&quot;. &quot;History&quot;, 5 (1920): 173–177. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1920.tb01326.x
* Types of Manorial Structure in the Northern Danelaw
* Documents illustrative of the social and economic history of the Danelaw, from various collections (1920)

<text>Straight to Hell is a 1987 independent action comedy film directed by Alex Cox and starring Sy Richardson, Joe Strummer (frontman of the Clash), Dick Rude, and Courtney Love. The film also features cameos by Dennis Hopper, Grace Jones, Elvis Costello, Edward Tudor-Pole, Kathy Burke, and Jim Jarmusch. Band members of the Pogues, Amazulu, and the Circle Jerks are also featured in the film. The film borrows its title from the Clash&#x27;s 1982 song of the same name.

The film has been called a parody of Spaghetti Westerns, and concerns a gang of criminals who become stranded in the desert, where they stumble upon a surreal Western town full of coffee-addicted killers. The film is loosely based on Giulio Questi&#x27;s Spaghetti Western film &quot;Django Kill... If You Live, Shoot!&quot; (1967), which Cox was given permission to adapt.

&quot;Straight to Hell&quot; received few positive reviews upon release, and was not a commercial success, although it later gained a cult film status. A soundtrack, including music by some of the musician/actors who starred in the film, was also released. On 14 December 2010, an extended cut of the film, titled &quot;Straight to Hell Returns&quot;, was released on DVD, featuring additional footage and digitally enhanced picture quality. This version of the film, under the collaboration of Alex Cox, was also screened at several cinemas as part of a midnight movie theatrical run.

==Plot==
Three hitmen, Willy, Norwood, and Simms, are staying in a Los Angeles hotel. After failing a job, they take off in a car with Velma, Norwood&#x27;s pregnant wife. They flee to Mexico to escape the wrath of their boss, Amos Dade, robbing a bank along the way. While driving through the desert, their car breaks down, having accidentally filled the tank with diesel. They bury their suitcase of money and begin to walk.

Night falls, and they come upon a nearly deserted town, where they enter an empty bar and the three men get drunk while Velma pesters them to leave. The group camps out for the night on the edge of town, and the following morning Velma witnesses several trucks of cowboys enter the town, carrying espresso machines with them. Much to the dismay of Velma, who insists they keep a low profile and leave, the three men enter the town, which is now full of townspeople, and go back to the bar.

There they are confronted by Bruno and Angel-Eyes, two members of the gang that runs the town, the McMahon clan. A stand-off ensues, but before guns are drawn, another group, led by a man named Rusty Zimmerman, arrives to arrest Bruno and Angel-Eyes for previous (minor) crimes. However the three hitmen kill Zimmerman and his cadre, saving the McMahon brothers. They are ultimately welcomed by the townspeople for this action. The bizarre townspeople include George and Fabienne, a couple who own a general store, Karl, a man running a hot dog stand, and countless cowboys and other unusual characters. The head honcho of the town, Frank McMahon, invites the gang to a party that evening. The following day, Frank&#x27;s elderly father is pushed off of a building by his relative Sabrina. The entire town has a funeral procession for him, and at the funeral another employee of Mr. Dade, named Whitey, shows up looking for the hitmen and Velma.

The town seizes Whitey for being a &quot;stranger&quot;, and accuses him of the murder of the McMahon grandfather. On the gallows, Whitey begins to tell the town about a bounty on the hitmen, but is hanged before he can tell his story. Meanwhile, Simms and Fabienne have an affair, while Willy falls for Louise, one of the few women in the McMahon clan, who spurns his advances and is clearly only interested in learning where they have hidden their money. A man named I.G. Farben, who claims to be a house developer, enters town with his wife Sonia and introduces himself, but quickly disappears, living a suitcase of machine guns for Norwood, Simms, and Willy. The next morning, Simms sees Mr. Dade&#x27;s car enter the town, and tries to get a drunken Willy and Norwood to leave with Velma.

George, already angry over Fabienne being unfaithful, kills Angel-Eyes for making sexual advances her, and the three hitmen are blamed. A series of shootouts begin between the townspeople, Mr. Dade&#x27;s crew, and the hitmen. Frank joins Mr. Dade&#x27;s team, and everyone begins to turn against each other. Willy seeks Louise, hoping she&#x27;ll join his side, but instead she shoots him, though he manages to crawl away, badly wounded. As Simms and Willy run into the desert, a shootout ensues with the town priest. They reach the spot where they buried the money, and, after recovering it, Simms shoots the wounded Willy. Simms in turn is shot by Velma. Frank and Velma then take off arm-in-arm with the suitcase of money, while Simms and Willy die.

Meanwhile, in town, chaos has ensued, and the store is set on fire, with Norwood and Fabienne inside. They miraculously survive and shoot Mr. Dade and his cronies. Eventually virtually everyone is killed, aside from Norwood and several female characters. Frank and Velma leave the town in a truck with the suitcase full of money, but accidentally drive off of a cliff when their brakes go out. Norwood leaves town with the women, and Farben Oil Company trucks enter the town to drill for oil.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was not originally intended to be made at all, and the reason for a preponderance of musicians in the cast was the result of a concert tour of Nicaragua that was planned in the first place. Political problems arose concerning the support of the left-wing government of Nicaragua, and the tour was cancelled. In its place Cox decided to have the bands, and several actors he could assemble, make a movie in Almería, Spain. Cox and co-star Dick Rude wrote a script in three days, and the entire film was shot in just four weeks. Cox wrote the part of Velma specifically for Courtney Love, who had starred in a supporting role in his previous film, &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; (1986). Love modeled the character after Carroll Baker&#x27;s performance in the 1956 film &quot;Baby Doll&quot;.

Alex Cox turned down the chance to direct &quot;Three Amigos&quot; in order to film &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Straight to Hell&quot;&#x27;s premiere was held at the Pickwick Drive-In in Burbank, California. Invitees were asked to come dressed in &quot;post-apocalyptic fiesta garb.&quot; Everyone who arrived was handed a water pistol. The film&#x27;s premiere was a fiasco, and several people at the drive-in left midway into the movie. Courtney Love was reportedly visibly upset at the premiere.

The film was not well received by critics, drawing mostly negative reviews. In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;The result is a mildly engrossing, instantly forgettable midnight movie.&quot; Hal Hinson, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote, &quot;The action is so gratuitous, and so indifferently presented, that it&#x27;s impossible to think that Cox ever truly intended it to be seen by anyone outside of the cast and crew and their immediate families.&quot; Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun Times&quot; gave the film 1.5 stars out of a possible 4. He wrote: &#x27;After &quot;Repo Man&quot; and &quot;Sid and Nancy,&quot; I believed that [Cox] could scarcely do wrong, and that there was a streak of obsession in his genius that might well carry him into the pantheon. Since then I have seen Cox&#x27;s &quot;Straight to Hell,&quot; and I must report that he is human after all. I still anticipate his next film. I still think he has a special gift. But &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; is an indulgent mess...&#x27;

In the US &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; was rated &quot;R&quot; for violence and language. The latter reason caught the producers by surprise, as the writers deliberately refrained from including any sort of profanity in the dialogue. Even the word &quot;hell&quot; appears only in the title (at one point a character quite noticeably says &quot;what the &quot;heck&quot; is going on here?&quot;), and the insults that fly before a showdown are no worse than &quot;go boil yer head!&quot;

The film was released on VHS in the 1990s and was also released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment on 24 April 2001, but went out of print in the following years.

===2010 director&#x27;s cut===
In 2010, Microcinema DVD announced a new director&#x27;s cut, dubbed &quot;Straight to Hell Returns&quot;. The new version features a new HD transfer, color correction that changes the look of the film, new effects, and new footage. Blood and additional violence during the shootout scenes was digitally implemented into the film which had not been there prior. Cox stated that he was inspired to revisit the film by Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot;. The DVD was released on 14 December 2010. It was also the first version of the film available on Blu-ray.

Leading up to the DVD release, &quot;Straight to Hell Returns&quot; was screened at several arthouse theaters across the United States and Canada in October and November 2010.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for the movie was composed of all new, original music composed and performed mostly by the musicians who acted in the film, however the original 1987 soundtrack release contained only some of the music from the film. The complete soundtrack was not released until 2004, under the new title &quot;Straight to Hell Returns&quot;.

<doc id="590599" wikidata="Q771877" url="?curid=590599" title="Antarah ibn Shaddad">
<text>Antarah ibn Shaddad al-Absi (Arabic: عنترة بن شداد العبسي), &quot;ʿAntarah ibn Shaddād al-ʿAbsī&quot;; AD 525–608), also known as ʿAntar, was a pre-Islamic Arabian poet and knight, famous for both his poetry and his adventurous life. His chief poem forms part of the &quot;Mu&#x27;allaqāt&quot;, the collection of seven &quot;hanging odes&quot; legendarily said to have been suspended in the Kaaba at Mecca. The account of his life forms the basis of a long and extravagant romance.

==Life==

ʿAntarah was born in Najd in the Arabian Peninsula. His father was Arab, Shaddād al-ʿAbsī, a respected warrior of the Banu Abs under their chief Zuhayr. His mother was an Ethiopian woman named Zabībah. Described as one of three &quot;Arab crows&quot; (&quot;Aghribah al-&#x27;Arab&quot;) - famous Arab with a black complexion,ʿAntarah grew up a slave as well. He fell in love with his cousin ʿAblah, but could not hope to marry her owing to his position. He also gained the enmity of his father&#x27;s wife Sumayya.

He gained attention and respect for himself by his personal qualities and courage in battle, excelling as an accomplished poet and a mighty warrior. He earned his freedom after another tribe invaded the lands of the Banu ʿAbs. When his father said to him, &quot;ʿAntarah, fight with the warriors&quot;, he replied that &quot;the slave doesn&#x27;t know how to invade or how to defend, but is only good for milking goats and serving his masters&quot;. His father answered him: &quot;Defend your tribe, O ʿAntar, and you are free&quot;. After defeating the invaders, he sought to gain permission to marry his cousin. To secure allowance to marry, Antarah had to face challenges including getting a special kind of camel from the Northern Arab Lakhmid Kingdom, then under al-Nu&#x27;man III ibn al-Mundhir. ʿAntarah took part in the great war between the related tribes of ʿAbs and Dhubyān, which began over a contest of horses, and was named after them the war of Dāhis and Ghabrā.

The time and manner of his death are a matter of dispute. Ibn Duraid has him slain by Wasr ibn Jabir or in battle against the Tayy, while according to Abu Obeida he died a natural death in old age.

ʿAntarah&#x27;s poetry is well preserved and often talks of chivalrous values, courage, and heroism in battle as well as his love for ʿAbla. It was immortalized when one of his poems was included in the &quot;Mu&#x27;allaqat&quot;, the collection of poems legendarily said to have been suspended in the Kaaba. His poetry&#x27;s historical and cultural importance stems from its detailed descriptions of battles, armour, weapons, horses, desert, and other themes from his time.

==Legacy==
The story of ʿAntar and ʿAbla was embroidered into a poetic saga traditionally credited to al-Asmaʿi, a poet in the court of Hārūn al-Rashīd. It is still recited by traditional story-tellers in Arab coffee houses. Its importance has been compared with English literature&#x27;s Arthurian romances. His house and his stable were particularly legendary. One of the seven clans of Bethlehem is called the &quot;Anatreh&quot;, named after ʿAntarah. It formerly acted as the guardians of the Church of the Nativity.

The Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov wrote his Symphony No. 2 based on the legend of ʿAntar. In 1898 the French painter Étienne Dinet published his translation of a 13th-century epic Arab poem &quot;Antar&quot;, which brought Antar bin Shaddad to European notice. It has been followed by a number of derivative works such as Diana Richmond&#x27;s &quot;Antar and Abla&quot; which furthered western exposure to the Antar bin Shaddad legends. &quot;Antar&quot; is the title of the first Palestinian opera, composed by the Palestinian musician Mustapha al-Kurd in 1988.

The Lebanese painter Rafic Charaf developed from the 1960s a series of paintings depicting the epics of Antar and Abla. These works that show his interest in the popular folklore of the region are considered a cornerstone in the artist&#x27;s work.

In the late 1940s the British Lorry Manufacturer Thornycroft began the design of an oilfield tractor to carry pipes for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which later became the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The chosen name for the new Thornycroft tractor, which at the time was one of the largest tractors in the world, was the Thornycroft Mighty Antar. The Antar moniker was chosen with reference to the mighty Warrior Antar.

==Works==
Antara&#x27;s poems are published in Wilhelm Ahlwardt&#x27;s &quot;The Divans of the six ancient Arabic poets&quot; (London, 1870); they have also been published separately at Beirût (1888). As regards their genuineness, cf. W. Ahlwardt&#x27;s &quot;Bemerkungen über die Aechtheit der alten arabischen Gedichte&quot; (Greifswald, 1872), pp. 50ff. &quot;The Romance of &#x27;Antar&quot; (Sīrat &#x27;Antar ibn Shaddād) is a work which was long handed down by oral tradition only; it has grown to immense proportions and has been published in 32 vols. at Cairo (1889), and in 10 vols. at Beirût, 1871. It was partly translated by Terrick Hamilton under the title &quot; &#x27;Antar, a Bedoueen Romance&quot; (4 vols, London, 1820). In addition, Sīrat &#x27;Antar was translated into Turkish by the order of Fatih Sultan Mehmed in 1477 AD. The translator of the Turkish translation in three volumes is unknown. The manuscript copies of the Turkish translation known as &quot;Qıssa-i &#x27;Antar&quot; are available in the Topkapı Palace Museum Library.

<text>The Blohm &amp; Voss BV 141 (originally the Ha 141) was an unorthodox tactical reconnaissance aircraft developed by the German aircraft manufacturer Blohm &amp; Voss. It was notable for its uncommon structural asymmetry.

Development commenced during 1937 in response to a Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM/German Aviation Ministry) specification seeking a new single-engine reconnaissance aircraft. While not invited to participate, the firm&#x27;s design team opted to use a radical configuration for the BV 141 that placed the crew inside of a Plexiglas-glazed gondola that was positioned starboard of the engine and tail boom. Although the RLM declined to finance its development in favour of other options, Blohm &amp; Voss chose to spend its own money to produce a prototype, which performed its maiden flight on 25 February 1938.

During flight testing, the aircraft proved itself to possess relatively good performance. Despite this, the RLM cancelled production plans for the BV 141A in April 1940 due to its perceived lack of power. A more powerful version of the aircraft, the BV 141B, commenced testing in 1941. However, development was protracted and a planned operational deployment on the Eastern Front was cancelled in 1942. The aircraft was never ordered into full-scale production for multiple reasons; these included the unavailability of the preferred engine and strong competition from another tactical reconnaissance aircraft, the twin-engined Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Uhu. Several examples were captured and studied by the Allied powers.

==Development==
===Background===
During the mid-to-late 1930s, efforts were underway to develop and construct suitable aircraft to equip the rapidly growing &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. To this end, during 1937, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM/German Aviation Ministry) issued a specification that called for a single-engine reconnaissance aircraft that would succeed the Henschel Hs 126. Stipulations included the use of a single engine (this was intended to reduce maintenance requirements in the field), accommodation of a three-man crew, and the possession of favourable all-round visual characteristics superior to that typically offered by parasol wing aircraft such as the Hs 126. Several different German aircraft companies opted to respond to this specification, including Arado, Focke-Wulf, and Blohm &amp; Voss.

At one stage, the preferred contractor to fulfil the requirement was Arado, which had submitted the Ar 198. A single-engined shoulder-wing monoplane, the Ar 198 featured an enlarged glazed central fuselage position to facilitate good external visibility. However, the Ar 198 prototype proved to be unsatisfactory during flight testing. The competing Fw 189 &quot;Uhu&quot; featured a twin-boom configuration and was powered by a pair of smaller engines in spite of the requirement having stipulated the use of a single-engine.

Blohm &amp; Voss (Hamburger Flugzeugbau), although not invited to participate, opted to pursue the requirement as a private venture. The company&#x27;s design team, headed by chief designer Dr. Richard Vogt, produced a somewhat radical proposal in the form of the uniquely asymmetric BV 141. In terms of its general configuration, the aircraft&#x27;s single engine was directly attached to the forward end of the tail boom while the crew were seated with a Plexiglas-glazed gondola; the tailboom and gondola were connected via the wing. Several key figures within the RLM did not look favourably upon Blohm &amp; Voss&#x27;s submission, which declined to fund its development; however, Ernst Udet of the Technical Department did show interest in the BV 141. Not dissuaded by this unenthusiastic reception, the company elected to self-finance the construction of a single prototype, initially designated as the &quot;Ha 141-0&quot;.

===Into flight===
On 25 February 1938, the Ha 141-0 performed its maiden flight; it was quickly determined to possess relatively few problems. Soon thereafter, it was accepted as the first of three development prototypes, at which point it was redesignated &quot;BV 141 V2&quot;. The second prototype to fly, &quot;BV 141 V1&quot;, joined the test programme in September 1938; it was somewhat larger than the earlier aircraft and was the first to be equipped with the highly-panelled crew gondola. &quot;BV 141 V3&quot; was intended to be more representative of the prospective production aircraft, featuring increased dimensions, a widened undercarriage, and various armaments, including a pair of forward-firing 7.92mm MG 17 machine guns and a pair of aft-facing 7.92mm MG 15 machine guns along with up to four SC50 bombs on bomb racks and automatic camera apparatus.

Encouraged by the favourable performance of BW 141 V3, the RLM placed an order for a further five preproduction aircraft, the first of which started flying during early 1939. During January 1940, this version of the aircraft, designated &quot;BV 141A&quot;, underwent an official evaluation at E-Stelle Rechlin that concluded favourably. However, on 4 April 1940, the RLM decided that the aircraft was underpowered, although it was also noted that it had otherwise exceeded the requirements, leading to production plans being cancelled.

Even prior to the RLM&#x27;s cancellation, Blohm &amp; Voss was working on an extensive redesign of the aircraft, designated &quot;BV 141B&quot;. It was powered by the BMW 801 radial engine, but also featured numerous structural changes, a further enlargement, a revised outer wing panel arrangement, and a new asymmetric tailplane. An initial order for five BV 141Bs was received, the first of which flew on 9 January 1941. This aircraft demonstrated aerodynamic issues, necessitating several modifications, including structural strengthening. Progress was relatively slow while teething issues were addressed, which delayed the delivery of &quot;BV 141 V13&quot; for the type&#x27;s official evaluation until 15 May 1943.

By the time a batch of 12 BV 141Bs were built with the BMW 801 engine, they were too late to make an impression, as the RLM had already decided to put the Fw 189 into production. Furthermore, an urgent need for BMW 801 engines to power the Fw 190 fighter aircraft reduced the chance of the BV 141B being produced in quantity. At no point was the BV141 ever considered to be an operational type, though the B-02 (V-10) was evaluated in Autumn 1941 by Aufklärungsschule 1 (Reconnaissance school). Furthermore, At one point, it was planned to send a handful of aircraft to the Eastern Front, however these plans were cancelled in 1942.

Vogt came up with several other asymmetric designs, including the piston-jet P.194.01, but none of those were actually built. Several wrecked BV 141s were found by advancing Allied forces. One aircraft was captured by British forces and sent to England for examination. No examples survive today.

==Design==

All three crew (pilot, observer and rear gunner) of the BV 141 was seated within a gondola, which was extensively glazed with Plexiglas. This gondola was positioned on the starboard side of the engine and strongly resembled that found on the Fw 189. The fuselage was located on the port side and led smoothly from the BMW 132N radial engine to a tail unit. At first glance, the placement of weight would have induced tendency to roll, but the weight was evenly supported by lift from the wings.

In terms of thrust vs drag asymmetry, the countering of induced yaw was a more complicated matter. At low airspeed, it was calculated to be mostly alleviated because of a phenomenon known as P-factor, while at normal airspeed it proved to be easily controlled with trimming. The tailplane was symmetrical at first, but in the 141B it became asymmetrical – starboard tailplane virtually removed – to improve the rear gunner&#x27;s fields of view and fire. The displaced center of gravity was accounted for through a combination of propeller torque and the specific arrangement of the outer wing areas,

==Variants==

All 20 of the BV 141Bs that were ordered were produced and delivered. There exists a complete record of BV 141 production with either a German civil registration number or pre-military, four letter &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; factory radio code number.

<text>The Mohmand () or Momand is a prominent tribe of the Iranic Pashtun people.

==Distribution==
They are based primarily in the Mohmand territory, which is located in Nangarhar, Afghanistan and Mohmand Agency, Pakistan. In Afghanistan, their areas of presence include Nangarhar, Ghazni, Kandahar, Kunar, Logar and Kunduz. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa they predominantly reside in the Mohmand Agency (formerly part of the Tribal Areas), with others later settling in Charsadda, Mardan and Peshawar District.

== History ==
The Mohmand Ghoryakhel originally lived in the present-day Mohmand region, as well as in areas of Kandahar, Ghazni, Ghor, and between the basins of the Tarnak, Oxus and Indus rivers, along the present Afghanistan-Pakistan border. 

Ghoryakhel consists of tribes led by the son of Kand, son of Kharshbun, son of Sarban, and son of Qais Abdur Rashid, who lived in Ghwara Marghay Arghistan Qandahar, mostly in Ghazni, Nangarhar, Logar, Ghor, Kabul, Kunar, Paktia, Kunduz, Zabul and Herat. Ghoryakhel had four sons, Chamkani, Daulatyar, Khalil and Zirani. Daulatyar had two sons Mohmands and Daudzai 

The Mohmand are historically known for resisting outside forces. From 1672 to 1676, under the leadership of Aimal Khan Mohmand, they rebelled and fought deadly wars against the Mughal Army. They also battled the British Empire in multiple wars, including taking part in the 1897 Frontier Revolt, alongside other rebellions across Pashtunistan, for Afghan Independence in the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War and they also fought independently in the 1935 Mohmand Campaign. Additionally, the Mohmand people resisted other invaders of Afghanistan, such as during the Soviet–Afghan War as well as the American War in Afghanistan including against Pakistan Security Forces.

In May 2018, Mohmand tribal elders condemned the merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and expressed support for the creation of a separate province, Qabailistan.

<text>Nexus is an American comic book series created by writer Mike Baron and penciler Steve Rude in 1981. The series is a combination of the superhero and science fiction genres, set 500 years in the future.

==Publication history==
The series debuted as a three-issue black-and-white limited series (the third of which featured a 33 RPM flexi disc with music and dialogue from the issue), followed by an ongoing full-color series which lasted 80 issues. The black-and-white issues and the first six color issues were published by Capital Comics; after Capital’s demise, First Comics took over publication.

On the creation of the series, Baron noted that they had originally pitched a series called &quot;Encyclopaedias&quot; to Capital Comics, but the company rejected this, saying they were looking for a superhero title. Over a drink at a restaurant, Baron outlined his ideas for &quot;Nexus&quot; to Rude:

In addition to the ongoing series, First reprinted the original miniseries as a graphic novel and later reprinted the first two years of the ongoing title in the &quot;Nexus Legends&quot; series. The ongoing series was also supplemented by &quot;The Next Nexus&quot;, a four-issue miniseries that followed &quot;Nexus&quot; #52. Following the conclusion of the ongoing series with #80 (May 1991), seven miniseries and two one-shot comics were published by Dark Horse Comics. The last of these miniseries was printed in black and white as a cost-cutting measure; low sales led to the series being discontinued. Although each miniseries had its own issue numbering, Baron and Rude added a sequential number to each, as explained in the back of the first issue of &quot;Nexus: Executioner’s Song&quot;:

The sequential numbering system excluded &quot;Nexus the Liberator&quot; (which neither Rude nor Baron worked on), and crossover specials with &quot;&quot; and &quot;Madman&quot;.

Baron and Rude discussed plans to either revive the series or release a movie, possibly in animated form (a brief animated test clip was shown at comics conventions). From July 2007 through July 2009 they published the miniseries &quot;Space Opera&quot;, which culminated in a double-size issue #101/102.

The creators’ canonical publication list includes 105 issues:
* Volume 1 (Black and White): #1–#3
* Volume 2: #1–#80
*&quot;Nexus: The Origin&quot; (#81)
*&quot;Nexus: Alien Justice&quot; (#82–#84)
*&quot;Nexus: Wages of Sin&quot; (#85–#88)
*&quot;Nexus: Executioner’s Song&quot; (#89–#92)
*&quot;Nexus: God Con&quot; (#93–#94)
* &quot;Nexus: Nightmare in Blue&quot; (#95–#98)
*&quot;Nexus: Space Opera&quot; (#99–#102)

The series returned to publication in 2012 within the pages of &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot;.
* &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #12–#14 (“Bad Moon Rising” and “Infestation”)
* &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #23–#26, #29–#34 (“Into the Past”)

In 2019, Dark Horse announced &quot;The Coming of Gourmando&quot;, a collection of Nexus “newspaper strips”. The volume would finally see publication in 2021.

As of April 2022, Baron and Rude had parted ways and were working on separate &quot;Nexus&quot; projects. The first for Rude is 100 page Nexus story “Battle for Thuneworld”, originally intended to be completed in the fall of 2022.

Mike Baron has produced &quot;Nexus: Nefarious&quot;, one issue of proposed miniseries &quot;Nexus: Triplets&quot;, &quot;Nexus: A Novel&quot;, and the upcoming &quot;Nexus: Scourge&quot;

==Horatio Hellpop==
The lead character, Horatio Valdemar Hellpop, received his Nexus powers from an alien entity called the Merk. As payment, the Merk required Nexus to seek out and kill a certain quantity of human mass murderers per &quot;cycle&quot;. When the Merk selected a target, Nexus would receive strong headaches and maddeningly anguishing dreams (whose extremely intense episodes caused physical injuries to Hellpop&#x27;s body that emulated the dream violence) of his target&#x27;s victims until he did his duty. Horatio was reluctant to act as the Merk&#x27;s tool, but continued seeking out mass murderers to maintain his power and his sanity so that he could defend his homeworld, a lunar refuge named Ylum (a shortening of the word &quot;asylum&quot;, thus pronounced &quot;eye-lum&quot;).

==Stylistic influence==
Both Baron and Rude paid homage to &quot;Space Ghost&quot; in their work on &quot;Nexus&quot;, including use of the battle cry &quot;This calls for hyperspeed!&quot; and including &quot;Space Ghost&quot; characters Jan, Jayce, and Blip in several uncredited background cameos. Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters from &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;The Herculoids&quot; and &quot;Magnus Robot Fighter&quot; along with his girlfriend Leeja Clane are frequently spotted in Nexus comics along with the occasional appearance of Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Rude was later hired to create a Space Ghost comic for with writer Mark Evanier.

Steve Rude cited a number of influences on his clean, distinctive style, including &quot;Space Ghost&quot; character designs and other work by Alex Toth, Doug Wildey, Jack Kirby and commercial illustrators of the 1940s and 1950s, particularly Andrew Loomis. Rude occasionally does covers in the style of American illustrator Norman Rockwell.

Baron&#x27;s &quot;Nexus&quot; stories responded to the world he was writing in, with competing merchants overwhelming media channels (and telepathy) with advertising. A great computerized library controlled the universe&#x27;s memory of history. Some of his early 1980s references have become outdated, such as the menacing Sov Empire.

==Reception==
Martin A. Stever reviewed &quot;Nexus&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 83. Stever commented that &quot;the success of the book is due, in part, to its greatly detailed setting. Together Baron and Rude have fleshed out an entire future universe that is as rich and original as anything that I&#x27;ve seen in any medium&quot;.

===Awards===
The series won a total of six Eisner Awards. In 1988, the series won an award for Best Artist/Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team. 1992&#x27;s &quot;Nexus: Origin&quot; won awards for Best Single Issue/Single Story, Best Writer/Artist, and Best Artist/Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team. In 1997, &quot;Nexus: Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; won Best Artist/Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team. In 2008, Todd Klein won Best Letterer/Lettering for his work on &quot;Nexus&quot;.

==Crossovers==
The &quot;Nexus&quot; series produced several crossover issues, featuring characters from several other First series, including &quot;American Flagg!&quot;, &quot;Grimjack&quot;, &quot;Jon Sable: Freelance&quot;, &quot;Badger&quot;, &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Dreadstar&quot;. An example of &quot;Nexus&quot; crossover issues is the series &quot;Crossroads&quot;, published in 1988. Following the switch in publishers from First to Dark Horse, &quot;Nexus&quot; crossed over with &quot;Madman&quot; (&quot;Nexus Meets Madman&quot;) and &quot;Magnus Robot Fighter&quot; (&quot;Magnus Robot Fighter/Nexus&quot;).

==Adaptations==
On January 1, 2000, it was revealed that producer Jeff Kline was awaiting a pick-up order from the Fox Kids Network for a cel-animated &quot;Nexus&quot; series. While the production had gotten as far as scripting (with significant input from the comic&#x27;s creators), the show was ultimately never produced. It has never been publicly confirmed why the network passed on the series, but the underperformance of Kline&#x27;s previous production, &quot;Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot&quot;, may have been a contributing factor.

A 2-minute promo for a &quot;Nexus&quot; animated series was produced in 2004.

<text>Robert Bennet Forbes (September 18, 1804 – November 23, 1889), was an American sea captain, China merchant and ship owner. He was active in ship construction, maritime safety, the opium trade, and charitable activities, including food aid to Ireland, which became known as America&#x27;s first major disaster relief effort. 
==Early life==

He was born in 1804 in Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts, to Ralph Bennet Forbes and Margaret Perkins, sister of the trader in slaves and China opium, Thomas Perkins. His brothers were Thomas Tunno Forbes and John Murray Forbes.

On October 19, 1817, at age 13, he joined the crew on his uncle Thomas&#x27; &quot;Canton Packet&quot; and made his first voyage to China, the first of the three brothers to do so. He arrived in Canton, China in March 1818 via the eastern route. He returned to Boston three months later.

In 1819, he made a second voyage aboard &quot;Canton Packet&quot;. On this voyage, he was promoted to third mate. He became second mate in 1821.

==Ships&#x27; command and Far East trade==
Aboard &quot;Nile&quot; he sailed for Manila. He had been ship&#x27;s master of &quot;Levant&quot;. He became a full captain in 1825. From Manila &quot;Nile&quot; went to China, then to California, and from there to Buenos Aires.

In 1828, he sailed &quot;Danube&quot; for Sturgis &amp; Perkins on a trading voyage to Smyrna, Ottoman Empire and other European ports. He later was captain of .

When Russell &amp; Company were merged with his uncle&#x27;s Turkish opium trading firm in 1830, Forbes was placed in command of their opium storehouse vessel &quot;Lintin&quot; which was moored permanently at the Pearl River estuary island after which it was named. His work in supervising the repacking of the opium and negotiating trades with drug smugglers made him his first fortune. From his ample means, he made generous provision for his mother and younger brother. He visited China several times and became the American vice-consul at Canton.

In 1834, he married Rose Greene Smith and they had three children: Robert Bennet Forbes (1837-1891), Edith Forbes who married Charles Eliot Perkins, and James Murray Forbes (1845-1885).

In 1841, he witnessed the Battle of Kowloon between the Qing Dynasty and the British Empire from aboard his rowboat.

He died on November 23, 1889, aged 85, in Milton, Massachusetts.

==Ships==
Forbes owned or was involved in the construction of approximately seventy vessels.

His first ship was &quot;Lintin&quot;, a 390-ton bark built by Sprague and James in Medford, Massachusetts, in 1830. Forbes owned &quot;Lintin&quot; from 1830–1832, after which time she sailed in Chinese waters. Forbes also owned , which took the first cargo of ice to China. &quot;During the Civil War he was employed as a volunteer by the government to inspect the building of nine gunboats and at the same time built for himself and others the &quot;Meteor&quot;, of 1500 tons.&quot;

The &quot;Sylph&quot;, yacht and pilot-boat, built in Boston in 1834 by Whitmore &amp; Holbrook. was owned by Forbes. Her construction was overseen by Forbes.

==Forbes rig==
The Forbes rig was also well received on &quot;Mermaid&quot;, as this 1852 excerpt from the &quot;Boston Atlas&quot; transcribed by Bruzelius shows:
 The Forbes rig was publicly rejected, however, by the captain of in 1855, in favor of the Howe rig.

==Legacy==
He built a Greek Revival mansion for his mother in Milton, Massachusetts, designed by Isaiah Rogers (1833), that is now the Captain Robert Bennet Forbes House Museum.

Forbes was awarded the medal of the Liverpool Shipwreck and Humane Society in 1849 for gallant conduct. The Cunard steamship Europa&quot;, on which Forbes was a passenger, ran down and sank an emigrant ship, &quot;Charles Bartlett&quot;. Forbes jumped from the bulwarks of the &quot;Europa&quot; into the water and rescued first a woman and child, and then a man.

In 1852, he was one of the founders and first president of the Sailors&#x27; Snug Harbor of Boston, a retirement home for &quot;decrepit, infirm or aged sailors&quot;.

In private writings, while noting that the flooding of China with opium was &quot;demoralizing&quot; millions of workers and &quot;draining the country of money,&quot; he noted that he made his &quot;fortune&quot; by selling the drug. He wrote that he had &quot;no moral feeling of indignation connected with the business&quot; despite his awareness of the human costs and the Chinese government&#x27;s aims to make opium illegal, turning Forbes and his fellows into smugglers. The opium trade led by western powers sparked several wars, led to the downfall of one Chinese dynasty and directly killed untold thousands of addicts.

==Writings==
Forbes&#x27; writings, most of them pamphlets, include: 
*
*On the Establishment of a Line of Mail Steamers ... to China (1855)
*Remarks on Ocean Steam Navigation (1855)
*The Forbes Rig (1862)
*Means for Making the Highways of the Ocean more Safe (1867)
*Remarks on Magnetism and Local Attraction (1875)
*The Lifeboat and other Life-saving Inventions (1880)
*New Rig for Steamers (1883)
*Notes on Navigation (1884)
*Loss of Life and Property in the Fisheries (1884)

<doc id="590640" wikidata="Q637747" url="?curid=590640" title="Climax, Colorado">
<text>Climax is an extinct mining company town, railroad station, and post office located in Lake County, Colorado, United States. The town site is located at an elevation of at Fremont Pass on the Continental Divide of the Americas. The Climax station on the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad was the highest railroad station in North America from its construction in 1884 until 1904 and again from 1928 until it was removed in 1937. Although the town was razed in 1962 to make room for the expansion of the Climax Molybdenum Mine, the Climax post office continued operation from December 5, 1917 until January 4, 1974. Climax had the highest elevation post office in the United States from April 1, 1919 to January 1, 1974.

==History==

Climax&#x27;s reason for being is its huge deposit of molybdenum ore. The Climax mine was the largest molybdenum mine in the world, and for many years it supplied three-fourths of the world&#x27;s supply of the metal. Over the years it evolved from &quot;at times the largest underground mine in the world&quot; into a pit mine.

The village of Climax is now considered a ghost town. The former Colorado &amp; Southern Railway line from Leadville is now operated as a tourist line by Leadville, Colorado &amp; Southern Railroad. The line stops at an overview of the Climax Molybdenum Mine and Fremont Pass. Climax is also a destination for automobile tourists, bicyclists, and photographers, but lacking commercial enterprise, the location is not well advertised.

Climax is known for its large molybdenum ore deposit. After mining ceased, the residential houses were all transported to the West Park subdivision of Leadville, Colorado, before 1965, leaving only the mining buildings standing.

After a 17-year shutdown, the Climax mine has reopened and resumed shipment of molybdenum on May 10, 2012.

==Notable people==

*Erbey Satterfield, Utah state legislator, was born in Climax.
*Dave Gorsuch, Olympian, was born in Climax.

==Climate==

With a mean annual temperature of , Climax is not only the highest but also the coldest settlement ever established in the contiguous US, being probably the only one with a mean annual temperature below freezing point. The town has a borderline subalpine climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), closely bordering on an alpine climate (&quot;ETH&quot;) with short, mild summers and long, snowy winters. The annual snowfall is, as would be expected, extremely heavy at , with the record for a full season being between July 1961 and June 1962, and the most in one month during December 1983. Snow does not melt until June and after wet winters may accumulate into May – the maximum daily snow cover was on March, 8th, 2019. Precipitation falls off in June, but the tail end of the monsoon may cause thunderstorm activity in July and August. The wettest calendar year has been 2014 with and the driest 1989 when only a water equivalent of was gauged.

The high elevation means that Climax has consistently cold temperatures throughout the year, with frosts possible in any month and 53.5 mornings falling to or below . The average window for zero temperatures is from November 1 to April 10, though temperatures that low have been reported as late as May 11, 1953 and as early as October 10 of 1982. Climax&#x27;s 99.6 days that do not top freezing is also the most in the contiguous US – the average window for days not topping freezing being from October 11 to May 4, and cases as late as June 25, 1969 and as early as September 3 of 1961 are known. The high altitude, however, limits extreme minima as in the coldest weather Climax may be warmer than lower valleys; the record low being on January 12, 1963, and December 23, 1990. The hottest temperature has been on July 7, 1981; 1981 was also the hottest full year at , whilst 1973 with an annual mean of is the coldest calendar year. The hottest month has been July 2003 with a mean of ; the coldest has been January 1979 which averaged .

<text>Maria Mitchell ( ; August 1, 1818 – June 28, 1889) was an American astronomer, librarian, naturalist, and educator. In 1847, she discovered a comet named 1847 VI (modern designation C/1847 T1) that was later known as &quot;Miss Mitchell&#x27;s Comet&quot; in her honor. She won a gold medal prize for her discovery, which was presented to her by King Christian VIII of Denmark in 1848. Mitchell was the first internationally known woman to work as both a professional astronomer and a professor of astronomy after accepting a position at Vassar College in 1865. She was also the first woman elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Mitchell is the namesake of the Maria Mitchell Association, the Maria Mitchell Observatory, and the Maria Mitchell Aquarium.

==Early years (1818–1846)==
Maria Mitchell was born on August 1, 1818, on the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts, to Lydia Coleman Mitchell, a library worker, and William Mitchell, a schoolteacher and amateur astronomer. The third of ten children, Mitchell and her siblings were raised in the Quaker religion. William Mitchell educated all his children about nature and astronomy and her mother&#x27;s employment at two libraries gave them access to a variety of knowledge. Mitchell reportedly showed an early interest and talent in astronomy and mathematics. Her father taught her to operate a number of astronomical instruments including chronometers, sextants, refracting telescopes, and Dolland telescopes. Mitchell often assisted her father in his work with local seamen and in his observations of the night sky.

Additionally, Nantucket&#x27;s importance as a whaling port meant that wives of sailors were left for months, sometimes years, to manage affairs at home while their husbands were at sea, thus fostering an atmosphere of relative independence and equality for the women of the island.

After attending Elizabeth Gardner small school as a young child, Mitchell enrolled in the North Grammar school, where her father was the first principal. When Maria Mitchell was 11 years old, her father founded his own school on Howard Street. There, she was a student and also a teaching assistant to her father. In 1831, at the age of 12, Mitchell aided her father in calculating the exact moment of a solar eclipse.

William Mitchell&#x27;s school closed, and afterwards she attended Unitarian minister Cyrus Peirce&#x27;s school for young ladies until she was about the age of 16. Later, she worked for Peirce as his teaching assistant before opening her own school in 1835. Mitchell developed experimental teaching methods, which she later employed during her professorship at Vassar College. She allowed nonwhite children to attend her school, though the local public school was still racially segregated.

In 1836, Mitchell began working as the first librarian of the Nantucket Atheneum, a position she held for 20 years. The institution&#x27;s limited operating hours enabled Mitchell to assist her father with a series of astronomical observations and geographical calculations for the United States Coast Survey and to continue her own education. Mitchell and her father worked in a small observatory constructed on the roof of the Pacific Bank building with a four-inch equatorial telescope provided by the survey. In addition to looking for nebulae and double stars, the pair produced latitudes and longitudes by calculating the altitudes of stars and the culminations and occultations of the moon, respectively.

In 1843, Mitchell converted to Unitarianism, although she did not physically attend a Unitarian Church until more than twenty years later. Her departure from the Quaker faith did not cause a break with her family, with whom she appears to have remained close. Historians have limited knowledge about this period in Mitchell&#x27;s life because few of her personal documents remain from before 1846. Members of the Mitchell family believed she destroyed many of her personal documents in order to keep them private, having witnessed personal papers blown through the street by the Great Fire of 1846, and because fear of another fire persisted.

==Discovery of &quot;Miss Mitchell&#x27;s Comet&quot; (1847–1849)==
At 10:50 pm on the night of October 1, 1847, Mitchell discovered Comet 1847 VI (modern designation C/1847 T1) using a Dollond refracting telescope with three inches of aperture and forty-six inch focal length. She had noticed an unknown object flying through the sky in an area where she previously had not noticed any other activity and believed it to be a comet. The comet later became known as &quot;Miss Mitchell&#x27;s Comet.&quot; She published a notice of her discovery in Silliman&#x27;s Journal in January 1848 under her father&#x27;s name. The following month, she submitted her calculation of the comet&#x27;s orbit, ensuring her claim as the original discoverer. Mitchell was celebrated at the Seneca Falls Convention for the discovery and calculation later that year.

On October 6, 1848, Mitchell was awarded a gold medal prize for her discovery by King Christian VIII of Denmark. This award had been previously established by King Frederick VI of Denmark to honor the &quot;first discoverer&quot; of each new telescopic comet, a comet too faint to be seen with the naked eye. A question of credit temporarily arose because Francesco de Vico had independently discovered the same comet two days after Mitchell but reported it to European authorities first. Mitchell was declared the first to discover the comet and she was awarded the prize. The only previous women to discover a comet were the astronomers Caroline Herschel and Maria Margarethe Kirch.

Mitchell&#x27;s medal was inscribed with line 257 of Book I of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;: &quot;&quot;Non Frustra Signorum Obitus Speculamur et Ortus&quot; (Not in vain do we watch the setting and the rising [of the stars]).&quot; Though the award was sent via letter in 1848, Mitchell did not physically receive the award in Nantucket until March 1849. She became the first American to receive this medal and the first woman to receive an award in astronomy.

==Intermediate years (1849–1864)==

Mitchell became a celebrity following her discovery of the comet, with hundreds of newspaper articles written about her in the subsequent decade. At her home on Nantucket, she entertained a number of prominent academics such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, and Sojourner Truth. In 1849, Mitchell accepted a computing and field research position for the U.S. Coast Survey undertaken at the U.S. Nautical Almanac Office. Her work consisted of tracking the movements of the planets - particularly Venus - and compiling tables of their positions to assist sailors in navigation. She joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1850 and befriended many of its members, including the director of the Smithsonian Institution, Joseph Henry.

Mitchell traveled to Europe in 1857. While abroad, Mitchell toured the observatories of contemporary European astronomers Sir John and Caroline Herschel and Mary Somerville. She also spoke with a number of natural philosophers including Alexander von Humboldt, William Whewell, and Adam Sedgewick before continuing her travels with Nathaniel Hawthorne and his family. Mitchell never married, but remained close to her immediate family throughout her life, even living in Lynn, Massachusetts with her sister Kate and her family in 1888.

==Professorship at Vassar College (1865–1888)==

Though Mitchell did not have a college education, she was appointed professor of astronomy at Vassar College by its founder, Matthew Vassar, in 1865, and became the first female professor of astronomy. Mitchell was the first person appointed to the faculty and was also named director of the Vassar College Observatory, a position she held for more than two decades. Mitchell also edited the astronomical column of &quot;Scientific American&quot; during her professorship. Thanks in part to Mitchell&#x27;s guidance, Vassar College enrolled more students in mathematics and astronomy than Harvard University from 1865 to 1888. In 1869, Mitchell became one of the first women elected to the American Philosophical Society, alongside Mary Somerville and Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz. She received honorary doctorates from Hanover College, Columbia University, and Rutgers Female College.

Mitchell employed many unconventional teaching methods in her classes. She reported neither grades nor absences, advocated for small classes and individualized attention, and incorporated technology and mathematics into her lessons. Though her students&#x27; career options were limited by their gender, she emphasized the importance of their study of astronomy. &quot;I cannot expect to make astronomers,&quot; she said to her students, &quot;but I do expect that you will invigorate your minds by the effort at healthy modes of thinking. When we are chafed and fretted by small cares, a look at the stars will show us the littleness of our own interests.&quot;

Mitchell&#x27;s research interests were varied. She photographed planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, as well as their moons, and studied nebulae, double stars, and solar eclipses. Mitchell also developed theories around her observations, such as the revolution of one star around another in double star formations and the influence of distance and chemical composition in star color variation.

Mitchell often involved her students with her astronomical observations in both the field and the Vassar College Observatory. Though she began recording sunspots by eye in 1868, she and her students began photographing them daily in 1873. These were the first regular photographs of the Sun, and they allowed her to explore the hypothesis that sunspots were cavities rather than clouds on the surface of the Sun. For the total solar eclipse of July 29, 1878 Mitchell and five assistants traveled with a 4-inch telescope to Denver for observations. Her efforts contributed to the success of Vassar&#x27;s science and astronomy graduates, as twenty-five of her students would go on to be featured in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America.&quot;

After teaching at Vassar for some time, Mitchell discovered that she was being paid less than many younger male professors. Mitchell and Alida Avery, the only other woman on the faculty at that time, demanded a salary increase, which they received. She taught at the college until her retirement in 1888, one year before her death.

==Social activism==
In 1841, Mitchell attended the anti-slavery convention in Nantucket where Frederick Douglass made his first speech, and she also became involved in the anti-slavery movement by boycotting clothes made of Southern cotton. She later became involved in a number of social issues as a professor, particularly those pertaining to women&#x27;s suffrage and education. She also befriended various suffragists including Elizabeth Cady Stanton. After returning from a trip to Europe in 1873, Mitchell joined the national women&#x27;s movement and helped found the Association for the Advancement of Women (AAW), a group dedicated to educational reform and the promotion of women in higher education. Mitchell addressed the Association&#x27;s First Women&#x27;s Congress in a speech titled &quot;The Higher Education of Women&quot; in which she described the work of English women working for access to higher education at Girton College, Cambridge.

Mitchell advocated for women working part-time while studying to make them more independent, as well as to increase their skills. She also called attention to the place for women in science and mathematics and encouraged others to support women&#x27;s colleges and women&#x27;s campaigns to serve on local school boards. Mitchell served as the second president of the AAW in 1875 and 1876 before stepping down to head a special Committee on Science to analyze and promote women&#x27;s progress in the field. She held this position until her death in 1889.

== Death and legacy ==
Mitchell died of brain disease on June 28, 1889, in Lynn, Massachusetts at the age of 70. She was buried in Lot 411, in Prospect Hill Cemetery, Nantucket. The Maria Mitchell Association was established to promote the sciences on Nantucket and preserve the legacy of Mitchell&#x27;s work. The Association operates a Natural History museum, an Aquarium, a Science Library and Research Center, Maria Mitchell&#x27;s Home Museum, and an Observatory named in her honor, the Maria Mitchell Observatory.

In 1989, Mitchell was named a National Women&#x27;s History Month Honoree by the National Women&#x27;s History Project and was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1994. She was the namesake of a World War II Liberty ship, the &quot;SS Maria Mitchell&quot;, and New York&#x27;s Metro North commuter railroad (with its Hudson Line endpoint in Poughkeepsie near Vassar College) has a train named the &quot;Maria Mitchell Comet&quot;. A crater on the moon was also named in her honor. On August 1, 2013, the search engine Google honored Maria Mitchell with a Google Doodle showing her in cartoon form on top of a roof gazing through a telescope in search of comets.

Her unique place at the intersection of American science and culture has been captured in a number of recent publications.

==Publications==
During her life, Mitchell published seven items in the Royal Society Catalog and three articles detailing her observations in Silliman&#x27;s Journal. Mitchell also authored three articles for &quot;Hours at Home&quot;, &quot;Century&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

<text>Charles Rohlfs (February 15, 1853 – June 30, 1936), was an American actor, patternmaker, stove designer and furniture maker. Rohlfs is a representative of the Arts and Crafts Movement, and is most famous for his skill as a furniture designer and maker.

==Life and career==
Rohlfs was born in Brooklyn and studied at the Cooper Union in Manhattan. As a young man, he worked as a stove pattern-maker while pursuing his career as an actor. He received several patents for stove designs, but had limited success as an actor. (Reading a review in 1895 in which a Chicago critic wrote, &quot;His face is comedy, his spindling legs are comedy, and those ponderous double-jointed, floppy hands of his would be two separate and distinct boons to any eccentric comedian&quot; - and Rohlfs was performing a serious role - may have been a turning point in his choice of careers.) He married the successful crime novelist Anna Katharine Green in 1884. After their marriage, he continued his career in the stove industry, and later made another attempt to establish his reputation as an actor. Rohlfs&#x27;s father-in-law had been prominent in the Republican Party in New York City, and in 1896, Rohlfs participated in public debates in support of William McKinley&#x27;s presidential campaign.

Rohlfs designed and made furniture for his family&#x27;s use as early as 1888, but he did not commence his decade-long career as a professional furniture maker until 1897. Rohlfs had no professional training as a furniture maker. By century&#x27;s end, Rohlfs had set up a shop on Washington Street in downtown Buffalo and began producing examples of what he called &quot;artistic furniture&quot; or the &quot;Rohlfs style.&quot; Starting in 1899, Chicago retailer Marshall Field advertised and offered furniture and other decorative objects by Rohlfs, but sales fell short of expectations.

Rohlfs participated at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition at the National Arts Club in New York in December 1900. The next year, he participated both as an exhibitor and as an organizer of the Pan-American Exposition in his hometown of Buffalo. The Exposition brought him fame. &quot;So far as furniture is concerned, Buffalo can claim to hold the most original man in America,&quot; one enthusiastic Berlin commentator wrote about Rohlfs&#x27; work. Rohlfs is the only American furniture maker known to have participated in the International Exposition of Decorative Art in Turin in 1902. Perhaps as a result of the exposure he received there, Rohlfs became a member of the Royal Society of Arts in London.

After he retired from furniture making around 1907, Rohlfs became a leader of the Chamber of Commerce in Buffalo. He actively campaigned for child labor reform and was an advocate of the metric system.

An art critic writes, &quot;The photographs in the exhibition of the house that the Rohlfs designed and build [i.e., built] at 156 Park St. (still extant) in 1912 reveal a sense of structural harmony between woodwork and furniture that sidesteps typical Victorian clutter.&quot;

He died on June 30, 1936, in Buffalo, New York. He was widowed a year earlier.

==Family==
Rohlfs and Anna Katharine Green had one daughter and two sons. Sterling Rohlfs, a ranch manager, died piloting a private plane over Mexico in 1928. After World War I, Roland Rohlfs was a record-holding test pilot.

==Works==
An exhibition, entitled The Artistic Furniture of Charles Rohlfs, was organized by the Milwaukee Art Museum, Chipstone Foundation and American Decorative Art 1900 Foundation. From 2009 to 2011, the exhibition was presented at the Milwaukee Art Museum, Dallas Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Art, Huntington Art Collections and Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Works by Charles Rohlfs are included in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, Brooklyn Museum, Carnegie Museum of Art, Dallas Museum of Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, High Museum of Art, Huntington Art Collections, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Milwaukee Art Museum, Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute, Museum of Fine Arts-Boston, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Princeton University Art Museum, Saint Louis Art Museum, Toledo Museum of Art, Two Red Roses Foundation, Virginia Museum of Fine Art and Wolfsonian-FIU.

During the Philadelphia edition of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in November 2007, a mahogany chair designed by Rohlfs was appraised for between $80,0000 - $120,000 (updated in 2020- valued at $220,000).

==Books==
Charles Rohlfs&#x27;s life and work are covered in the monographic book &quot;The Artistic Furniture of Charles Rohlfs&quot; (Yale University Press, ), which received three book awards.

The same topics fill the book &quot;Drama in Design: The Life and Craft of Charles Rohlfs&quot;, by Michael L. James, published on the occasion of the Burchfield Art Center&#x27;s exhibition &quot;The Craftsmanship of Charles Rohlfs.&quot;

<text>Blackwater is a rural town and locality in the Central Highlands Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Blackwater had a population of 4,702 people.

It is a town in a significant coal mining area in Central Queensland. The name of the township was inspired by the dark colour of local waterholes.

== Geography ==
Six major open cut coal mines and one underground dot the landscape surrounding the town and provide its main employment opportunities. The town is also situated close to the Blackdown Tableland National Park which lies to the southeast and Blackwater coal mine located south of the town. Emerald is to the west.

Bonnie Doon is a neighbourhood in the centre of the locality () and is associated with the Bonnie Doon pastoral station established in 1893.

Rangal, a neighbourhood in the locality (), is associated with former Rangal railway station (originally called Frasers Siding), assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 7 June 1927. It is an Aboriginal word referring to a species of &quot;Callistemon&quot; (ti tree).

== History ==
Blackwater was established on Gangulu territory, and is named after the Blackwater Creek which apparently was first observed to flow with black water, believed to be caused by the local coal deposits.

Coal deposits were discovered there by Ludwig Leichhardt on his expedition from Moreton Bay to Port Essington (now Darwin, Northern Territory) in 1845. Leichhardt saw &quot;beds of coal indistinguishable from those on the Hunter at Newcastle&quot;.

Blackwater Post Office opened on 19 July 1877.Blackwater Provisional School opened on 21 November 1877 but closed sometime after September 1878. It reopened in 1883 and on 1 January 1909 became Blackwater State School.

It wasn&#x27;t until over a century after Leichhardt first discovered the beds of coal at Blackwater that the town saw major coal mining development. With the opening up of several coal mines near the town in the 1960s, Blackwater&#x27;s population rapidly increased as people searching for work found employment in the town&#x27;s booming mining industry. 

Blackwater State High School opened on 30 January 1973.

By the mid-late 1970s, the town had 3 Rugby League clubs: South Blackwater, Blackwater Devils and Blackwater Centrals.

Blackwater North State School opened on 30 January 1979.

Approximately 100,000 workers have been employed in coal mining at Blackwater over its 50-year history. The town has provided considerable economic development for Queensland and Australia more generally.

=== 1867 Gold Escort murders ===
Blackwater is located close to the site of the infamous double murder of two police constables at the hands of gold commissioner Thomas Griffin.

Griffin killed the two troopers, John Power and Patrick Cahill, on 6 November 1867 on the banks of the Mackenzie River near the present day site of Blackwater&#x27;s Bedford Weir, which is located approximately 25 kilometres north of the town. The three men had been a part of a gold escort, escorting £4000 in cash from Rockhampton to the Clermont goldfields, which Griffin stole after he killed Power and Cahill. Griffin was later convicted of the crime and hanged in Rockhampton.

A memorial to Power and Cahill was erected at the Bedford Weir in 2013. The 150th anniversary of their murders, in 2017, was commemorated in both Blackwater and Rockhampton.

=== 1980 John Howard visit ===
Blackwater attracted national media attention in 1980 after violent scenes occurred outside the Capricorn Hotel on 1 August 1980, when angry striking coal miners confronted Federal Treasurer, John Howard.

Howard had arrived in Blackwater with Deputy Prime Minister, Doug Anthony, and Queensland Treasurer, Llewellyn Edwards, to negotiate with union officials in an attempt to end the protracted industrial action. The strike by the miners was in protest against a government plan to make coal miners pay tax on housing subsidised by the mining companies.

The miners, who had been supplied with free alcohol, confronted the politicians as they left the hotel after negotiations reached a stalemate. As police officers attempted to hastily escort the politicians to the safety of waiting police vehicles, Howard was shoved, jostled, sworn at and grabbed in a headlock. A police officer sustained a suspected broken nose, a camera operator was punched in the face and eggs were thrown. A police vehicle was also damaged when its tail light was kicked in.

The 10-week strike ended in September 1980 when the Federal Government eventually reached an agreement with the Combined Mining Unions.

=== 1999 &quot;Australian Story&quot; controversy ===
In 1999, a production crew from ABC Television&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Australian Story&quot; arrived in Blackwater to film jazz musician Don Burrows&#x27; visit to the town. Burrows had already visited Blackwater on two previous occasions. On this occasion Burrows performed a concert in the town with pianist Kevin Hunt and briefly spent time with members of Blackwater State High School&#x27;s concert band. The &quot;Australian Story&quot; program, entitled &quot;Mr Burrows goes to Blackwater&quot; and introduced by Julie Anthony, aired on 29 July 1999.

The Blackwater community&#x27;s reception to the program was mostly negative. Complaints ranged from the way Blackwater was portrayed in the program, to the way the program implied that Burrows was single-handedly responsible for the success of the high school band when in actuality he had only played a very minor role. Principal of Blackwater State High School, Jim Reay, said he was disappointed with the program, particularly by the failure of the program to acknowledge the contribution of bandmaster and music teacher John Evenhuis. It was also a sentiment shared by many local residents who felt that Evenhuis had achieved much more than Burrows regarding the success of the concert band and was more deserving of the praise which had been afforded to Burrows.

The substantial negative reaction prompted &quot;Australian Story&quot; producer John Millard to write a lengthy open letter to the Blackwater community which was published in local newspaper, the &quot;Blackwater Herald&quot;, in an attempt to explain why the program was produced the way it was.

=== 2008 Bedford Weir fabridam failure ===
On 23 November 2008, a fabridam barrier at the Bedford Weir on the Mackenzie River near Blackwater suddenly failed, causing 6,000 megalitres of water to surge downstream into a popular recreational area where people were swimming. A four year old girl, Nelani Koefer, who had been paddling in shallow water, was washed away and drowned. Her body was recovered the following day.

The Bedford Weir&#x27;s operator SunWater Limited and the manufacturer of the fabridam wall, Trelleborg Engineered Systems, were held responsible for the failure. In 2013, SunWater pleaded guilty to a breach of the Workplace Health &amp; Safety Act in the Rockhampton Industrial Magistrates Court and was fined $80,000, but no conviction was recorded. Trelleborg Engineered Systems was also fined $80,000.

A coronial inquest was held in 2015, the findings of which were delivered on 17 March 2016. The coroner found that the collapse had been caused by a manufacturing fault in the wall, which had been designed by Trelleborg. The coroner advised that the walls should be removed, never to be used again.

In 2016, it was reported that Nelani Koefer&#x27;s mother had filed a claim in the Rockhampton Supreme Court suing SunWater and Trelleborg for $1.48 million.

=== 2020 COVID-19 scares ===
In 2020, it was feared that the Blackwater community was potentially exposed to COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia after it was confirmed on two separate occasions that there had been positive COVID-19 test results. On both occasions it was confirmed the initial test results had been false positives.

In the first incident, it was reported on 11 April 2020 that a Rockhampton-based worker employed at BHP&#x27;s BMA coal mine at Blackwater had tested positive to COVID-19. The positive result prompted BHP to contact people who may have been in contact with the employee who had not been on site since 1 April 2020. However, several days later the Central Queensland Hospital and Health Service confirmed that the man had tested negative to COVID-19 following a secondary test and that the first test had been a false positive.

In the second incident, it was confirmed on 27 May 2020 by the Queensland Government that 30-year-old mine worker Nathan Turner had died at his Blackwater home and had subsequently tested positive to COVID-19. At the time, Turner was believed to have been the youngest person in Australia to have died from COVID-19, a fact that generated significant national media interest. 

Following the announcement, a special COVID-19 response team was dispatched to Blackwater and many of the town&#x27;s residents came forward to be tested. Blackwater&#x27;s sewerage was also tested in an attempt to determine whether the virus had spread through the community. There were also fears that they may have been a link between Turner and a Rockhampton aged care nurse who had earlier travelled to Blackwater while infectious with COVID-19.

Several days after they had said that Turner had died from COVID-19, the Queensland Government revealed that the coroner had advised them that Turner did not have COVID-19 and that the initial test may have been a false positive.

The revelation that Turner did not have COVID-19 sparked anger in the Blackwater community. It also prompted almost 10,000 people to sign a petition on Change.org demanding Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young apologise to Turner&#x27;s family. Palaszczuk and Deputy Premier Steven Miles both publicly apologised to Turner&#x27;s family while Young said she believed nothing could have been done differently and was confident the correct actions were taken to protect the Blackwater community following the initial positive test result.

There was also criticism that news of Turner&#x27;s false positive was first revealed on social media by his partner&#x27;s workplace rather than Queensland Health, who only confirmed the news several hour afterwards. The government&#x27;s actions, however, received support from Turner&#x27;s father who said although he didn&#x27;t understand how a false positive had occurred, he understood that the potential risk required immediate action and that the public needed to be informed.

<text>Alceo Dossena (1878–1937) was an Italian sculptor who became well-known for his creation of a variety of convincing forgeries of ancient sculptures. His dealers marketed his creations as originals by other sculptors.

==Biography==
Dossena was born in 1878 in Cremona, Italy. He was a talented stonemason and sculptor, and was so skilled at duplicating classical and medieval art, that his agent, Alfredo Fasoli sold his works as authentic antiques. Fasoli commissioned copies of Greek, Roman, medieval, and Renaissance sculptures, and of works by such artists as Giovanni Pisano, Simone Martini, and Donatello. Dossena was meagerly paid by Fasoli who made immense profit off of the copies he sold to museums and collectors. One of the fakes was a sculpted tomb attributed to Mino da Fiesole that was sold to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

In 1928 Dossena discovered that some of his works were displayed in museum collections as original antiques, and that his dealers were keeping most of the profit for themselves. The artist was only paid the equivalent of $200 per sale. He exposed the ruse and sued his dealers. Dossena defended himself against forgery charges by claiming that he had been unaware that others were selling his work under false claims. A trial cleared him and he received the equivalent of $66,000 in compensation.

His subsequent exhibit in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art was unsuccessful. In 1933, the Italian government auctioned 39 of his works for the modest sum of $9000, when a forgery of his sold at a peak price of $150,000.

Alceo Dossena died a poor man in Rome in 1937.

==Collections==

Two of Dossena&#x27;s sculptures are on permanent display in the Frick Fine Arts Building at the University of Pittsburgh. They were intended to appear as if they had been mounted on a Renaissance church, carved by Simone Martini. The subject matter is the Virgin Mary and angel Gabriel.

<text>Gerhard Rohlfs (July 14, 1892 – September 12, 1986) was a German linguist. He taught Romance languages and literature at the universities in Tübingen and Munich. He was described as an &quot;archeologist of words&quot;.

== Biography ==
Rohlfs was born in Berlin-Lichterfelde. His main interest was the languages and dialects spoken in Southern Italy and he travelled extensively in this region. He studied Italiot Greek (a language still spoken in a few places in Salento, southern Apulia, and in Bovesia, southern Calabria) and found several indications suggesting that Italiot-Greek is a direct descendant of the language originally spoken by the Greek colonists of Magna Grecia. He first advanced this theory in his book (&quot;Greeks and Romans in Southern Italy&quot;, 1924). He also published two complete vocabularies of the dialects of Bovesia (1938–1939) and Salento (1956–1961).

His main work is considered to be his &quot;Historical Grammar of the Italian Language and its Dialects&quot; (, 1949–1954). He received honorary degrees from the University of Calabria in Cosenza and the University of Salento in Lecce. He died in Tübingen.

<text>In computing, busdma, bus_dma and bus_space is a set of application programming interfaces designed to help make device drivers less dependent on platform-specific code, thereby allowing the host operating system to be more easily ported to new computer hardware. This is accomplished by having abstractions for direct memory access (DMA) mapping across popular machine-independent computer buses like PCI, which are used on distinct architectures from IA-32 (NetBSD/i386) to DEC Alpha (NetBSD/alpha). Additionally, some devices may come in multiple flavours supporting more than one bus, e.g., ISA, EISA, VESA Local Bus and PCI, still sharing the same core logic irrespective of the bus, and such device drivers would also benefit from this same abstraction. Thus the rationale of busdma is to facilitate maximum code reuse across a wide range of platforms.

Circa 2006, bus and DMA abstractions made it possible for NetBSD to support 50 hardware platforms and 14 CPU architectures out of a single source tree, compared to the forking model used by Linux ports.

Originally implemented as the &quot;bus_dma&quot; APIs by the developers of the NetBSD operating system, busdma has been adopted by OpenBSD, FreeBSD and their derivatives; with FreeBSD incorporating it under a busdma umbrella (without an underscore). Both NetBSD and OpenBSD have additional &quot;bus_space&quot; APIs that have been amalgamated into the version of busdma incorporated into FreeBSD. DragonFly BSD developers are also slowly converting their drivers to use busdma.

<text>Roland Rohlfs (February 10, 1892 – February 28, 1974) was an American aviator.

==Biography==
Roland Rohlfs was born in Buffalo, New York on February 10, 1892, the son of Anna Katharine Green, the crime novelist; and Charles Rohlfs, the actor and furniture craftsman.

Rohlfs flew a hydro-aeroplane called the &quot;Dunkirk Fighter&quot; for Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company in 1918. Later that year he broke the flight airspeed record while flying a Curtiss Wasp, his speed was clocked at 163.1 mph (262.4 km/h).

In 1919 he broke another world record when he flew to an altitude of 34,610 feet in a Curtiss L-3 triplane (at - 47 degrees Fahrenheit).

He died on February 28, 1974.

<text>Beautification is the process of making visual improvements to a town, city, or urban area. This most often involves planting trees, shrubbery, and other greenery, but frequently also includes adding decorative or historic-style street lights and other lighting and replacing broken pavement, often with brick or other natural materials. Old-fashioned cobblestones are sometimes used for crosswalks; they provide the additional benefit of slowing motorists.

Beautification projects are often undertaken by city councils to refurbish their downtown areas, in order to boost tourism or other commerce. Often, this is also spurred by broken sidewalks, which pose a safety hazard for pedestrians and potentially insurmountable obstacles for wheelchair users. These projects are frequently part of other larger projects such as construction, especially in conjunction with ones for transit, such as streets and roads and mass transit.

The Laurel Hill Association of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, founded in 1853, is the oldest incorporated village beautification society in the United States. The Memphis City Beautiful Commission, the oldest city beautification project in the United States, was established in 1930.

<text>Barcaldine ( ) is a rural town and locality in the Barcaldine Region in Queensland, Australia. This is the administrative centre of the Barcaldine Region. Barcaldine played a major role in the Australian labour movement. In the , Barcaldine had a population of 1,540 people.

==Geography==
Barcaldine is in Central West Queensland, approximately by road west of the city of Rockhampton, north of Charleville. The town is situated on Lagoon Creek, which flows into the Alice River approximately five kilometres south of the Barcaldine. Major industries are sheep and beef cattle rearing. The streets in Barcaldine are named after different types of trees.

==History==
Barcaldine lay on the traditional tribal lands of the Iningai. Iningai (also known as Yiningay, Muttaburra, Tateburra, Yinangay, Yinangi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Iningai people. The Iningai language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Longreach Region and Barcaldine Region, particularly the towns of Longreach, Barcaldine, Muttaburra and Aramac as well as the properties of Bowen Downs and catchments of Cornish Creek and Alice River.

The first European to enter the area was Frederick Walker, the former commandant of the Native Police, who in 1861 led an expedition through what is now Barcaldine searching for the explorers Burke and Wills.

The town takes its name from a sheep station called &quot;Barcaldine Downs&quot;, which was established in 1863 by Donald Charles Cameron, whose family property in Ayrshire, Scotland, was named after Barcaldine, Argyll, Scotland. Cameron had been a sugar plantation owner and slaveholder in Berbice, British Guiana. The local Aboriginal people were not allowed onto &quot;Barcaldine Downs&quot; and blackbirded South Sea Islander labour was utilised in the 1860s and 1870s.

The first town lots were sold in 1885 and within a year several buildings were under construction. By the end of 1886 the town had been surveyed. The Central Western railway line to Barcaldine opened on 8 November 1886.

Barcaldine Post Office opened on 13 November 1886.

The artesian water at Barcaldine is full of minerals. A bore had been constructed in 1887, but was unsuitable for the water needs of the steam locomotives and so the water was let run to waste. By 1891, a local doctor observed that water contained soda and potash which he believed would have health benefits. In 1907, a swimming pool using the artesian water was built by the Barcaldine Shire Council, along with baths and showers for therapeutic use. Although Barcaldine was being promoted as a spa town into the mid-1930s, interest in &quot;taking the waters&quot; declined after that period as medical opinion became increasingly doubtful of the benefits of mineral waters, favouring drugs and physiotherapy as better treatments.

In 1887 a Methodist church was erected in Ash Street, Barcaldine, the first church in the town. The church building had previously been used at a number of railway camps involved in the construction the Central Western railway line. As each new segment of the line was completed, the camp and the church building were relocated to the new railhead. Barcaldine was its final location. In 1893 a new wooden church was erected in Maple Street. The foundation stone for the current brick church was laid on 1 July 1961 by Reverend Joseph Tainton, President of the Queensland Methodist Conference, with the former wooden church beside it becoming the church hall. In 1977 following the amalgamation that created the Uniting Church in Australia, the Barcaldine Methodist Church became the Barcaldine Uniting Church.

Barcaldine State School opened on 4 July 1887.In 1892, the local government area of Barcaldine Division was established, by separating it from the Kargoolnah Division which had its headquarters in Blackall. Since then, Barcaldine has been the headquarters of local government in the area, commencing with the Barcaldine Divisional Board, which became the Barcaldine Shire Council in 1903, and then the Barcaldine Regional Council in 2008. The initial local government meetings were held in a building in Oak Street, which burned down in 1896. A shire hall was then constructed in 1898 on the south-east corner of Ash and Beech Streets, which eventually became too small. In February 1912 a new larger shire hall was opened and that building (somewhat modified and extended) is still in use today and is heritage-listed.

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School was opened in 1896 by Sisters of Mercy, specifically Sister Mary Muredach McMullen (superior), Sister Mary Catherine Cleary, and Sister Mary Fayne, with the assistance of lay teacher Catherine Lobie. The original building had two storeys with the sisters living upstairs and the classrooms downstairs. In 1906 a new school building was erected to accommodate the school&#x27;s 195 students. The current school building opened on 21 October 1962.In August 1909, a devastating fire destroyed buildings in Oak Street, including a general store (J. Dias), a saddlery (H. A. Hawthorne) and the Welcome Home Hotel (W. Kemp).

The Barcaldine War Memorial was unveiled by Queensland Governor, Matthew Nathan, on 21 May 1924.

The current Barcaldine Public Library opened in 2016.

On 26 May 2019, Barcaldine set a world record for a line of 868 motorhomes, caravans, campervans and fifth wheelers outside the town, beating the previous record of 672 vehicles in Italy in 2003.

On 22 November 2019, the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. Barcaldine was expanded to incorporate Barcaldine Downs, Evora, Grant (all except for the eastern corner), Home Creek, Ingberry (southern part), Moombria, Narbethong (all except for the north-eastern corner), Patrick, Saltern Creek, and Tara Station.

== Labour movement ==
Barcaldine played a significant role in the Australian labour movement and the birth of the Australian Labor Party. In 1891, it was one of the focal points of the 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike, with the Eureka Flag flying over the strike camp. The landmark Tree of Knowledge, under which the strikers met, stood outside the railway station. In 2006, persons unknown poisoned the tree with the herbicide Roundup, which led to its demise.

One of the first May Day marches in the world took place during the strike on 1 May 1891 in Barcaldine. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that of the 1,340 men that took part, 618 were mounted on horses. Banners carried included those of the Australian Labor Federation, the Shearers&#x27; and Carriers&#x27; Unions, and one inscribed &#x27;Young Australia&#x27;. The leaders wore blue sashes and the Eureka Flag was carried. The &quot;Labor Bulletin&quot; reported that cheers were given for &quot;the Union&quot;, &quot;the Eight-hour day&quot;, &quot;the Strike Committee&quot; and &quot;the boys in gaol&quot;. It reported the march:On the 9 September 1892 the &quot;Manifesto of the Queensland Labour Party&quot; was read out under the well known Tree of Knowledge at Barcaldine following the Great Shearers&#x27; Strike. The State Library of Queensland now holds the manifesto, in 2008 the historic document was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Australian Register and in 2009, the document was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World International Register.

The Australian Workers Heritage Centre opened in Barcaldine in 1991 as a museum to pay tribute to Australian workers.

== Cultural references ==
&quot;The Working Man&#x27;s Paradise: an Australian Labour novel&quot;, was written by William Lane under the pseudonym John Miller in 1892, inspired by the events of the 1891 Shearers&#x27; Strike in Barcaldine. This story shows a contrast between the &#x27;haves&#x27; and the &#x27;have nots&#x27; (slum dwellers and the wealthy citizens) and depicts the conflict between the squatters and pastoral workers. The preface of the book states, &#x27;The scene is laid in Sydney because it is not thought desirable, for various reasons, to aggravate by a local plot the soreness existing in Queensland&#x27;.

Barcaldine features in &quot;Hail Tomorrow&quot;: &quot;a play in four acts&quot;, written by Vance Palmer in 1947. The full-length play&#x27;s conflict centres about the Queensland shearers&#x27; strike of 1891.

<doc id="590684" wikidata="Q2083502" url="?curid=590684" title="Abu Zayd al-Hilali">
<text>Abu Zayd Ibn Rizq Al-Hilali () was an 11th-century Arab leader and hero of the &#x27;Amirid tribe of Banu Hilal.

On the orders of the Ismaili Fatimid caliph, Abu Zayd moved his tribe to Ifriqiya to punish the Zirids for adopting Sunniism. The Banu Hilali weakened largely the Zirid state and sacked Kairouan. The event was fictionalized in the epic &quot;Taghribat Bani Hilal&quot;. In the epic it is said that he was murdered by his rival Dhieb bin Ghanim.

In a modern context, the events experienced by Bani Hilal and their cousins Bani Sulayma at the time of Abu Zayd have been portrayed in two Arabic TV shows. The first modern drama discussing these events is the 1997 Egyptian show &quot;Al-Seera Al-Hilalia&quot;, composed of three 38-episode seasons following Abu Zeyd throughout the migration from Najd to Ifriqiya. A second TV drama was published in Syria, &quot;Abu Zayd al-Hilali&quot;. Published in 2004, it has garnered millions of views on YouTube and licensed television. Of course, as all shows attempt to entertain as well educate society, these two shows underwent an exemplary attempt at illustrating the honour and dignity systems of ancient Arabs and how their traditions affected their day-to-day life, even in the midst of battle.

<doc id="590687" wikidata="Q2996907" url="?curid=590687" title="Cobblestone">
<text>Cobblestone is a natural building material based on cobble-sized stones, and is used for pavement roads, streets, and buildings. Setts, also called &quot;Belgian blocks&quot;, are often referred to as &quot;cobbles&quot;, although a sett is distinct from a cobblestone by being quarried and shaped into a regular form, while cobblestones are naturally occurring rounded forms less uniform in size.

It has been used across various cultures for millennia, particularly in Europe, and became especially prominent during the medieval and early modern periods. Today, cobblestone streets are often associated with historic preservation and are used in many cities to maintain the historical character of certain neighborhoods.

==History as road surface==
During the medieval period, cobblestone streets became common in many European towns and cities. Cobblestones were readily available, as they were often naturally occurring stones found in riverbeds and fields. Their rounded shape made them easy to lay, and their durability was well-suited to the needs of growing urban centers. Cobblestones are typically either set in sand or similar material, or are bound together with mortar. Paving with cobblestones allows a road to be heavily used all year long. It prevents the build-up of ruts often found in dirt roads. It has the additional advantage of immediately draining water, and not getting muddy in wet weather or dusty in dry weather. Shod horses are also able to get better traction on stone cobbles, pitches or setts than tarmac or asphalt. Cobblestones set in sand have the environmental advantage of being permeable paving, and of moving rather than cracking with movements in the ground. The fact that carriage wheels, horse hooves and even modern automobiles make a lot of noise when rolling over cobblestone paving might be thought a disadvantage, but it has the advantage of warning pedestrians of their approach. In England, the custom was to strew straw over the cobbles outside the house of a sick or dying person to damp the sound. In rural areas, cobblestones were sometimes used to pave important roads, particularly those leading to and from major cities.In England, it was commonplace since ancient times for flat stones with a flat narrow edge to be set on edge to provide an even paved surface. This was known as a &#x27;pitched&#x27; surface and was common all over Britain, as it did not require rounded pebbles. Pitched surfaces predate the use of regularly-sized granite setts by more than a thousand years. Such pitched paving is quite distinct from that formed from rounded stones, although both forms are commonly referred to as &#x27;cobbled&#x27; surfaces. Most surviving genuinely old &#x27;cobbled&#x27; areas are in reality pitched surfaces. A cobbled area is known as a &quot;causey&quot;, &quot;cassay&quot; or &quot;cassie&quot; in Scots (probably from &quot;causeway&quot;). In the early modern period, cities like Paris, London, and Amsterdam began to pave their streets with cobblestones to manage the increased traffic from carts, carriages, and pedestrians.


Cobblestones were largely replaced by quarried granite setts (also known as Belgian block) in the nineteenth century. Cobblestoned and &quot;setted&quot; streets gradually gave way to macadam roads and later to tarmac, and finally to asphalt concrete at the beginning of the 20th century. However, cobble­stones are often retained in historic areas, even for streets with modern vehicular traffic. Many older villages and cities in Europe are still paved with cobblestones or pitched.

===Use today===
With the advent of asphalt and concrete in the 20th century, the use of cobblestones declined. These newer materials were cheaper and easier to install, leading to the replacement of many cobblestone streets. However, cobblestone streets have been preserved in many historic districts around the world, valued for their historical significance and aesthetic charm. In recent decades, cobblestones have become a popular material for paving newly pedestrianised streets in Europe. In this case, the noisy nature of the surface is an advantage as pedestrians can hear approaching vehicles. The visual cues of the cobblestones also clarify that the area is more than just a normal street. The use of cobblestones and setts is also considered to be a more &quot;upmarket&quot; roadway solution, having been described as &quot;unique and artistic&quot; compared to the normal asphalt road environment.

In older U.S. cities such as Philadelphia, Boston, Pittsburgh, New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, New Castle, Portland (Maine), Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans, many of the older streets are paved in cobblestones and setts (mostly setts); however, many such streets have been paved over with asphalt, which can crack and erode away due to heavy traffic, thus revealing the original stone pavement.

In some places such as Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, as late as the 1990s some busy intersections still showed cobblestones through worn down sections of pavement. In Toronto streets, setts were used by streetcar routes and disappeared by the 1980s, but are still found in the Distillery District.

Many cities in Latin America, such as Buenos Aires, Argentina; Zacatecas and Guanajuato, in Mexico; Old San Juan, Puerto Rico; Vigan, Philippines; and Montevideo, Uruguay, are well known for their many cobblestone streets, which are still operational and in good condition. They are still maintained and repaired in the traditional manner, by placing and arranging granite stones by hand.

In the Czech Republic, there are old cobblestone paths with colored marbles and limestones. The design with three colors (red/limestone, black/limestone, white/marble) has a long tradition in Bohemia. The cubes of the old ways are handmade.

==Use in architecture==

In the Finger Lakes Region of New York State, the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age left numerous small, rounded cobblestones available for building. Pre-Civil War architecture in the region made heavy use of cobblestones for walls. Today, the fewer than 600 remaining cobblestone buildings are prized as historic locations, most of them private homes. Ninety percent of the cobblestone buildings in America can be found within a 75-mile radius of Rochester, New York. There is also a cluster of cobblestone buildings in the Town of Paris, Ontario. In addition to homes, cobblestones were used to build barns, stagecoach taverns, smokehouses, stores, churches, schools, factories, and cemetery markers.

The only public cobblestone building in the US is the Alexander Classical School, located in Alexander, New York.

==Implications for disabled people==
Cobblestone may not be accessible for disabled people, particularly wheelchair users. Wheelchair users and other disabled people may opt to avoid streets and sidewalks made with cobblestone. Some European cities, such as Breda in the Netherlands, have tried to preserve their historic aesthetic while also making cobblestone pavement more accessible for disabled people by slicing the cobblestone to be flat on the surface.

The United States Access Board does not specify which materials a sidewalk must be made of in order to be ADA compliant, but does state that &quot;cobblestones can significantly impede wheelchair movement&quot; and that sidewalks must not have surface variances of greater than one inch. Due to the accessibility challenges of cobblestone, the Federal Highway Administration recommends against the use of cobblestone and bricks in its accessibility guide for sidewalks and crosswalks.

<text>Overseas Shipholding Group (OSG) is the operator of a fleet of twenty-four oil tankers and oil tug-barges. In 2024, the company was acquired by Seattle-based transportation company Saltchuk.

==History==

Founded in 1948, Overseas Shipholding Group (OSG) is based in Tampa, Florida, United States. It has offices in Tampa, Florida and Newark, Delaware, with nearly 900 sea and shore-based employees.

In 1969, under the leadership of Raphael Recanati, OSG began acquiring tanker ships to transport oil from Alaska to the lower 48 U.S. states. In the 1990s, OSG began to acquire luxury cruise liners.

In 1995, the cruise ships resulted in losses of over $12 million to OSG. As a result of the losses, Michael Recanati, the son of Raphael Recanati, was reported to have been forced to leave OSG.

The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2012 after the SEC accused CEO Morten Arntzen and CFO Miles Itkin of falsifying financial statements. In 2017, the company paid a $75,000 fine to the SEC to settle the securities fraud allegations. Former CFO Miles Itkin also paid a separate $75,000 fine. The executives were sued by OSG and agreed to pay a $16.25 million settlement in 2015.

In July 2024 its stock was delisted from the NYSE as the company was acquired by the private company Saltchuk.

==Spin-off of international business and fleet==

In 2016, as part of its restructuring, OSG spun-off its large international fleet and business, concentrating solely on its U.S. flag business.

The international activities and fleet were re-incorporated into a new company, International Seaways, Inc., based in New York City, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under ticker .

<text>Eva Ahnert-Rohlfs (11 August 1912 – 9 March 1954) was a German astronomer. She made key observations of variable stars.

Eva Ahnert-Rohlfs was born in Coburg (Duchy Saxe-Coburg-Gotha). She studied in Würzburg, Munich and Kiel from 1931 to 1933. After nine years of withdrawal into family life, she studied from 1942 until the end of the Second World War at the University of Göttingen. From 1945, she worked closely with professor Cuno Hoffmeister as an assistant astronomer at the Sonneberg Observatory. In 1951, she received a doctorate in astrophysics from the University of Jena. At Sonneberg Observatory Eva Rohlfs met the astronomer Paul Oswald Ahnert and they were married in 1952.

From the Sonneberg observatory he made important observations of the variable stars that he detailed in the article &quot;On the structure and origin of the Perseid current&quot; () included in the Observatory Publications Sonneberg Astronomical.

Eva Ahnert-Rohlfs died at the age of 41 in Sonneberg.

<doc id="590696" wikidata="Q265469" url="?curid=590696" title="Definite description">
<text>In formal semantics and philosophy of language, a definite description is a denoting phrase in the form of &quot;the X&quot; where X is a noun-phrase or a singular common noun. The definite description is &quot;proper&quot; if X applies to a unique individual or object. For example: &quot;the first person in space&quot; and &quot;the 42nd President of the United States of America&quot; are proper. The definite descriptions &quot;the person in space&quot; and &quot;the Senator from Ohio&quot; are &quot;improper&quot; because the noun phrase X applies to more than one thing, and the definite descriptions &quot;the first man on Mars&quot; and &quot;the Senator from Washington D.C.&quot; are &quot;improper&quot; because X applies to nothing. Improper descriptions raise some difficult questions about the law of excluded middle, denotation, modality, and mental content.

==Russell&#x27;s analysis==

As France is currently a republic, it has no king. Bertrand Russell pointed out that this raises a puzzle about the truth value of the sentence &quot;The present King of France is bald.&quot;

The sentence does not seem to be true: if we consider all the bald things, the present King of France is not among them, since there is no present King of France. But if it is false, then one would expect that the negation of this statement, that is, &quot;It is not the case that the present King of France is bald&quot;, or its logical equivalent, &quot;The present King of France is not bald&quot;, is true. But this sentence does not seem to be true either: the present King of France is no more among the things that fail to be bald than among the things that are bald. We therefore seem to have a violation of the law of excluded middle.

Is it meaningless, then? One might suppose so (and some philosophers have) since &quot;the present King of France&quot; certainly does fail to refer. But on the other hand, the sentence &quot;The present King of France is bald&quot; (as well as its negation) seem perfectly intelligible, suggesting that &quot;the present King of France&quot; cannot be meaningless.

Russell proposed to resolve this puzzle via his theory of descriptions. A definite description like &quot;the present King of France&quot;, he suggested, is not a referring expression, as we might naively suppose, but rather an &quot;incomplete symbol&quot; that introduces quantificational structure into sentences in which it occurs. The sentence &quot;the present King of France is bald&quot;, for example, is analyzed as a conjunction of the following three quantified statements:

# there is an x such that x is currently King of France: formula_1 (using &#x27;Kx&#x27; for &#x27;x is currently King of France&#x27;)
# for any x and y, if x is currently King of France and y is currently King of France, then x=y (i.e. there is at most one thing which is currently King of France): formula_2
# for every x that is currently King of France, x is bald: formula_3 (using &#x27;B&#x27; for &#x27;bald&#x27;)

More briefly put, the claim is that &quot;The present King of France is bald&quot; says that some x is such that x is currently King of France, and that any y is currently King of France only if y = x, and that x is bald: 

This is &quot;false&quot;, since it is &quot;not&quot; the case that some is currently King of France.

The negation of this sentence, i.e. &quot;The present King of France is not bald&quot;, is ambiguous. It could mean one of two things, depending on where we place the negation &#x27;not&#x27;. On one reading, it could mean that there is no one who is currently King of France and bald:

On this disambiguation, the sentence is &quot;true&quot; (since there is indeed no x that is currently King of France).

On a second reading, the negation could be construed as attaching directly to &#x27;bald&#x27;, so that the sentence means that there is currently a King of France, but that this King fails to be bald:

On this disambiguation, the sentence is &quot;false&quot; (since there is no x that is currently King of France).

Thus, whether &quot;the present King of France is not bald&quot; is true or false depends on how it is interpreted at the level of logical form: if the negation is construed as taking wide scope (as in the first of the above), it is true, whereas if the negation is construed as taking narrow scope (as in the second of the above), it is false. In neither case does it lack a truth value.

So we do &quot;not&quot; have a failure of the Law of Excluded Middle: &quot;the present King of France is bald&quot; (i.e. formula_4) is false, because there is no present King of France. 

The negation of this statement is the one in which &#x27;not&#x27; takes wide scope: formula_5. This statement is &quot;true&quot; because there does not exist anything which is currently King of France.

== Generalized quantifier analysis ==

Stephen Neale, among others, has defended Russell&#x27;s theory, and incorporated it into the theory of generalized quantifiers. On this view, &#x27;the&#x27; is a quantificational determiner like &#x27;some&#x27;, &#x27;every&#x27;, &#x27;most&#x27; etc. The determiner &#x27;the&#x27; has the following denotation (using lambda notation):

(That is, the definite article &#x27;the&#x27; denotes a function which takes a pair of properties and to truth if, and only if, there exists something that has the property , only one thing has the property , and that thing also has the property .) Given the denotation of the predicates &#x27;present King of France&#x27; (again for short) and &#x27;bald&#x27; ( for short)


we then get the Russellian truth conditions via two steps of function application: &#x27;The present King of France is bald&#x27; is true if, and only if, formula_4. On this view, definite descriptions like &#x27;the present King of France&#x27; do have a denotation (specifically, definite descriptions denote a function from properties to truth values—they are in that sense not syncategorematic, or &quot;incomplete symbols&quot;); but the view retains the essentials of the Russellian analysis, yielding exactly the truth conditions Russell argued for.

==Fregean analysis==

The Fregean analysis of definite descriptions, implicit in the work of Frege and later defended by Strawson among others, represents the primary alternative to the Russellian theory. On the Fregean analysis, definite descriptions are construed as referring expressions rather than quantificational expressions. Existence and uniqueness are understood as a presupposition of a sentence containing a definite description, rather than part of the content asserted by such a sentence. The sentence &#x27;The present King of France is bald&#x27;, for example, is not used to claim that there exists a unique present King of France who is bald; instead, that there is a unique present King of France is part of what this sentence &quot;presupposes&quot;, and what it &quot;says&quot; is that this individual is bald. If the presupposition fails, the definite description &quot;fails to refer&quot;, and the sentence as a whole fails to express a proposition.

The Fregean view is thus committed to the kind of truth value gaps (and failures of the law of excluded middle) that the Russellian analysis is designed to avoid. Since there is currently no King of France, the sentence &#x27;The present King of France is bald&#x27; fails to express a proposition, and therefore fails to have a truth value, as does its negation, &#x27;The present King of France is not bald&#x27;. The Fregean will account for the fact that these sentences are nevertheless &quot;meaningful&quot; by relying on speakers&#x27; knowledge of the conditions under which either of these sentences &quot;could&quot; be used to express a true proposition. The Fregean can also hold on to a restricted version of the law of excluded middle: for any sentence whose presuppositions are met (and thus expresses a proposition), either that sentence or its negation is true.

On the Fregean view, the definite article &#x27;the&#x27; has the following denotation (using lambda notation):

(That is, &#x27;the&#x27; denotes a function which takes a property and yields the unique object that has property , if there is such a , and is undefined otherwise.) The presuppositional character of the existence and uniqueness conditions is here reflected in the fact that the definite article denotes a partial function on the set of properties: it is only defined for those properties which are true of exactly one object. It is thus undefined on the denotation of the predicate &#x27;currently King of France&#x27;, since the property of currently being King of France is true of no object; it is similarly undefined on the denotation of the predicate &#x27;Senator of the US&#x27;, since the property of being a US Senator is true of more than one object.

== Mathematical logic ==

Following the example of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, it is customary to use a definite description operator symbolized using the &quot;turned&quot; (rotated) Greek lower case iota character &quot;℩&quot;. The notation ℩formula_7 means &quot;the unique formula_8 such that formula_9&quot;, and

is equivalent to &quot;There is exactly one formula_10 and it has the property
formula_11&quot;:

<text>WAT is the sixth studio album by Slovenian music group Laibach, released September 8, 2003.

The CD included a bonus video of &quot;Tanz mit Laibach&quot; and the vinyl LP and promo CD &quot;Reject or Breed&quot;.

The album title is an acronym for &quot;We Are Time&quot; as the title track reveals.

&quot;The point of WAT is not what Laibach is, or what it wants, but what you are and where you stand&quot;.
