<text>The Battle of Gqokli Hill has been claimed by some to have occurred on or around April 1818, a part of the Ndwandwe-Zulu War between Shaka of the Zulu nation and Zwide of the Ndwandwe just south of present-day Ulundi ( 28° 22&#x27; 23&quot; S 31° 21&#x27; 15.77&quot; E). However, some claim that the battle never actually happened.

==Background==

The Zulus were originally a close-knit ethnic group community that had migrated to the eastern plateau of present-day South Africa; they became a strong tribal nation largely due to the efforts of an ambitious chieftain named Shaka (c. 1787–1828, reigned 1816–1828). A rebellious young man, Shaka was estranged from his father, who was a Zulu chief named Senzangakhona, and became a warrior with the Mthethwa people. The Mthethwa paramount chieftain Dingiswayo helped Shaka become recognized as head of the Zulus after Senzangakhona died in 1816. The two chieftains were close friends, and their warriors fought together against common enemies, such as the Ndwandwe headed by King Zwide. After Dingiswayo was captured and executed by Zwide, the Mthethwa people placed themselves under Shaka and took the Zulu name. Shaka revolutionized traditional ways of fighting by introducing the iklwa, a short stabbing spear, as a weapon and by organizing warriors into disciplined units that fought in close formation behind large cowhide shields. 

==Alleged battle==

The popular account of the battle goes roughly as follows. In spite of being significantly outnumbered, masterful strategy and tactics won the battle for Shaka. To delay the Ndwandwe invasion army, under command of Zwide&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Nomahlanjana, Shaka posted forces along the drifts (fords) of the White Umfolozi River to delay the enemy while the river was still relatively high. Meanwhile, he laid waste to the area on the south (Zulu) side the river, and moved most of his clan&#x27;s noncombatants and cattle into hiding in the Nkandla Forest, on the southern extremities of Zulu land. He then placed the bulk of his troops around the top of Gqokli hill, with a reserve and all his supplies out of sight in a depression at the top of the hill. To Nomahlanja, it seemed like a much smaller force of Zulus at the top of the hill and he anticipated it would be an easy massacre, &quot;Like butchering cattle in a kraal,&quot; he is reputed to have said.

Before the Ndwandwe army was across the river and surrounding his hilltop position, Shaka dispatched about 700 from his small army, with a fraction of the clan&#x27;s cattle herd, to make a display about ten kilometers south of Gqokli and tempt Nomahlanjana to split his force to capture them. The Ndwandwe general, thinking he was seeing the entire Zulu herd and half their army, obliged by sending four regiments (about 4,000 men) off to chase the cattle down.

By about nine o&#x27;clock in the morning, once all eight of the remaining Ndwandwe regiments (about 8,000) were arrayed at the bottom of Gqokli Hill, Nomahlanjana gave the signal for the attack. In the first charge up the slopes, it quickly became apparent that the Ndwandwe superiority in numbers would actually be a hindrance, for the converging formations began to crowd into each other, making it difficult to throw their spears effectively. And when Shaka ordered a counter-attack, his men, who had no throwing spears (assegai) but were armed with the new, shorter, stabbing assegai (amaKlwa), charged downhill and routed the packed mob of Ndwandwes.

Nomahlanjana perceived that his confidence was premature. He correctly reasoned that the problem presented by the Zulu&#x27;s central hilltop position, and the congestion that caused in his own forces, needed more thoughtful, flexible tactics. As many as five attacks were made during the day, each one trying a slightly different technique. But all failed to overwhelm the perceptibly small band of Zulus.

The Ndwandwe commander was also aware that his men, who had drunk all of their carried water, were becoming thirsty and exhausted in the hot, dry weather. They were starting to slip away in increasing numbers to make their way back to the nearest water, the Umfolozi river, about two kilometers from the battlefield. Shaka&#x27;s men, by contrast and thanks to his foresight, had plenty of water, food and first aid supplies in the depression on top of the summit, so were not nearly so taxed by the weather.

Shaka had earlier arranged for the decoy force to the south to signal him with smoke when the 4,000 Ndwandwes on the cattle raiding expedition were heading back. Just after the fourth Ndwandwe attack had been repulsed, Shaka saw the smoke signal to the south. That meant he had very little time left to destroy Nomahlanjana&#x27;s main army before it was reinforced.

Both sides had suffered casualties during the day, the Ndwandwes in greater proportion than the Zulus (due, it has been claimed by Zulu oral tradition, to the superior weapons, discipline, and fighting techniques implemented by Shaka). But Nomahlanjana calculated, based on the thinning ranks of the four Zulu regiments he could see on the hill, that he still had a vastly superior force. He also concluded that the Zulus must be getting as hot, tired and thirsty as his own men (not aware of their ability to refresh themselves on the hilltop). He decided to make one, last, decisive attack. He moved 1,500 of his warriors, including his crack amaNkayia brigade, to the north of the hill in a gigantic attack column, about twenty men wide and seventy-five ranks deep. There were only, from what he could see, about 500 Zulus left on this side of the hill. He would lead this charge in person and simply roll over the remnant of the Zulu force. He left the remainder of his regiments in an arc to the south of the hill as a pinning force to keep Shaka from reinforcing his threatened flank.

But Shaka could see very well what was coming and felt that the time was ripe for him to spring his trap. All day long he had been fighting off the Ndwandwe assaults with just four of his six regiments (the amaWombe, uDlambedlu, uKhangela, and Jubingwaqa), keeping his own elite brigade, consisting of the uFasimba and iziChwe regiments, out of sight and fresh in the hilltop depression. As the Ndwandwe shock column charged up the hill and into the waiting amaWombe regiment, Shaka launched his reserves in two encircling wings, completely enveloping the Ndwandwe column. These men had not expected such a large force to come out of nowhere. And they were thrown into a panic. This enveloping ploy on the part of Shaka was the first trial of a maneuver that would thereafter become the signature tactic of the Zulu army, the &quot;Impondo Zenkomo&quot;, or &quot;beast&#x27;s horns&quot;. In several minutes, virtually all of the surprised and demoralized Ndwandwes in the column, 

including Nomahlanjana and four of his brothers, were killed. They managed to take some Zulus with them, but the outcome was foregone.

As the fighting on the northern slope wound down, Shaka ordered his remaining regiment on the south side, the Jubingwaqa, to attack the southern wing of the Ndwandwes. These, hearing first rumour and then confirmation of the massacre of their comrades on the north, made a fighting retreat in the direction of the approaching 4,000 cattle raiders. When these latter came in sight, the Jubingqwanga broke off and, with the remnants of the regiment with the decoy (the Nkomendala), hung on the flanks of the retreating Ndwandwes to harass them and take back as many cattle as they could.

Meanwhile, Shaka dispatched two of his regiments (probably the fresher uFasimba and iziCwe) to the north to mop up the Ndwandwe stragglers who had gone off in search of water at the river.

The battle was a bloody one, in which the Ndwandwes supposed lost as many as 7,500 men (including five of Zwide&#x27;s oldest sons), or almost two-thirds of their original force. The Zulus, though, suffered about 2,000 casualties (most of them killed), or about 40%. In the Nguni tradition of war-of-annihilation, neither side took prisoners.

While Shaka&#x27;s new tactics, his newly trained army, and his shrewd battle plan saved his people from extermination, he had by no means eliminated the Ndwandwe threat. He had only eked out a respite. The Zulus had given up several hundred cattle (the economic capital of the Zulu economy) and sacrificed precious fighters they could not afford to lose. Zwide, for his part, was infuriated by the loss of his sons, by the blow to his arms, and, most of all by the temerity of the upstart usuper of the Zulu clan, and came back the following year with an even larger army and smarter generals. Shaka had just that year to build up his own power to meet the second invasion he knew was coming. This he was able to do by vigorous diplomacy with other tribes, and by attracting thousands of angry warriors with scores to settle with the Zwide.

==Fabrication by Ritter==

Though the story of the battle has been widely circulated, evidence for it is very thin. The first account of the battle in any detail is Ernst Augustus Ritter&#x27;s &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot; 1955, about 140 years after the battle allegedly took place. Dan Wylie, in his 1992 article “Textual Incest: Nathaniel Isaacs and the Development of the Shaka Myth” in the journal &quot;History in Africa&quot;, lays out how the story probably came to be:Gqokli hill, however, first appears in Bryant’s Olden Times, and then only as a landmark to the battle which occurred on the nearby Mhlatuze river. Bryant cites no source for this, and it appears in no oral traditional account. However, Ritter assimilates Bryant’s passing reference, apparently misreads his precursor’s reference to Shaka drawing up his men in a “great circle” (a pre-battle harangue, not a defensive formation), and embellishes it into a sixteen-page account, complete with ranges, maneuvers, and casualty figures.Wylie lays out a more thorough case against the story in a 1993 article “Dangerous Admiration: E.A. Ritter’s Shaka Zulu”. Wylie examines Ritter’s oral sources used in &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot; in detail. Ritter claimed that he had received his information on Gqokli Hill from two informants –Njengebantu and Mzuzeli Qwabe. Little is known of the latter, while the former is described as a son of Mahola who was in the same IziCwe regiment as Shaka under Dingiswayo. Wylie could find no other mention of Mahola in any other source, though this isn&#x27;t definitive evidence, and could mean that Mahola was not a prominent figure. Ritter claimed that he was a daily listener to Njengebantu’s recital of Shaka’s deeds, and that this occurred when Ritter was 13 and Njengebantu was around 68 years of age. However, Ritter began writing the first draft of &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot; in 1949, 46 years after attending these daily sessions and therefore Wylie questions both the accuracy of Ritter’s memories as well as Njengebantu’s alleged retellings, especially in light of the story being completely absent from Zulu oral traditions. There are two possible references to Gqokli hill, both stories about battles at &quot;Kwa Qori&quot;, a hill near the White Mfolozi River, just like Gqokli, but both battles were decisive defeats for Shaka. Further evidence against the battle is provided by the very precise casualty figures given by Ritter, with such precise figures not given in any other oral Zulu account. Due to this evidence, Wylie concludes the story of Gqokli hill was certainly fabricated by Ritter.

<text>The bird genus Balearica (also called the crowned cranes or Balearic cranes) contains two extant species in the crane family Gruidae: the black crowned crane (&quot;B. pavonina&quot;) and the grey crowned crane (&quot;B. regulorum&quot;).

The species today occur only in Africa, south of the Sahara Desert, and are the only cranes that can nest in trees. This habitat is one reason the relatively small &quot;Balearica&quot; cranes are believed to closely resemble the ancestral members of the Gruidae.

Like all cranes, they eat insects, reptiles, and small mammals.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Balearica&quot; was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the black crowned crane (&quot;Balearica pavonina&quot;) as the type species. The name is from the Latin &quot;Baliaricus&quot; for &quot;of the Balearic Islands&quot;.

The crane family (Gruidae) is divided into the subfamily Gruinae of typical cranes and the subfamily Balearicinae of crowned cranes.

===Extant species===


===Fossil record===
Crowned cranes seem to have been more widespread prehistorically. Compared to the true cranes, genus &quot;Grus&quot;, which were always common in the Holarctic and adjacent regions, the present genus appears to have had a more Atlantic distribution, ranging into Europe and North America; it is not known from the fossil record of Asia and South America, as none have yet been discovered.
*&quot;Balearica rummeli&quot; (Early Miocene of Germany) – formerly &quot;Basityto&quot;
*&quot;Balearica excelsa&quot; (Early–Middle Miocene of France) – formerly &quot;Grus&quot; and &quot;Ornithocnemus&quot;

<text>The ES EVM (, &quot;Unified System of Electronic Computing Machines&quot;), or YeS EVM, also known in English literature as the Unified System or Ryad (, &quot;Series&quot;), is a series of mainframe computers generally compatible with IBM&#x27;s System/360 and System/370 mainframes, built in the Comecon countries under the initiative of the Soviet Union between 1968 and 1998. More than 15,000 of the ES EVM mainframes were produced.

== Development ==
In 1966, the Soviet economists suggested creating a unified series of mutually compatible computers. Due to the success of the IBM System/360 in the United States, the economic planners decided to use the IBM design, although some prominent Soviet computer scientists had criticized the idea and suggested instead choosing one of the Soviet indigenous designs, such as BESM or Minsk. The first works on the cloning began in 1968; production started in 1972. In addition, after 1968, other Comecon countries joined the project.

With the exception of only a few hardware pieces, the ES EVM machines were recognized in the Western countries as independently designed, based on legitimate Soviet patents. Unlike the hardware, which was quite original, mostly created by reverse engineering, much of the software was based on slightly modified and localized IBM code. In 1974–1976, IBM had contacted the Soviet authorities and expressed interest in ES EVM development; however, after the Soviet Army entered Afghanistan, in 1979, all contacts between IBM and ES developers were interrupted, due to the U.S. embargo on technological cooperation with the USSR.

Due to the CoCom restrictions, much of the software localization was done through disassembling the IBM software, with some minimal modification. The most common operating system was OS ES (), a modified version of OS/360; the later versions of OS ES were very original and different from the IBM OSes, but they also included a lot of original IBM code. There were even anecdotal rumors among the Soviet programmers, that this supposedly Soviet operating system contained some secret command which outputs the American national anthem. Today some of the Russian institutions that worked on ES EVM are cooperating with IBM to continue legacy support for both actual IBM mainframes and the ES EVM systems.

ES EVM machines were developed in Moscow, at the Scientific Research Center for Electronic Computer Machinery (NITsEVT); in Yerevan, Armenia, at Yerevan Computer Research and Development Institute; and later in Minsk, at the Scientific Research Institute of Electronic Computer Machines (NIIEVM); and in Penza, at the Penza Scientific Research Institute of Computer Machinery. They were manufactured in Minsk, at the Minsk Production Group for Computing Machinery (MPOVT); and in Penza, at the Penza Electronic Computer Factory. Some models had been also produced in other countries of the Eastern Bloc, such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and East Germany; some peripheral devices were also produced in Cuba. The former German chancellor Angela Merkel, used one of East Germany&#x27;s ES EVM computers in 1986 for her PhD dissertation.

ES EVM computers were assigned to four subseries or generations (), known as Ryad 1, Ryad 2, Ryad 3 and Ryad 4, this nomenclature gave rise to the common name for the whole project.

== Hardware models and technical details ==

The first subseries of the ES EVM, released in 1969–1978, included the models 1010, 1020, 1030, 1040, and 1050, which were analogous to the System/360 and operated at 10–450 kIPS, and the more rare and advanced versions, incompatible with the IBM versions: 1022, 1032, 1033 and 1052. The electronics of the first models were based on TTL circuits; the later machines used ECL design. ES 1050 had up to 1M RAM and 64-bit floating point registers. The fastest machine of the series, ES 1052, developed in 1978, operated at 700 kIPS.

The second subseries, released in 1977–1978, included the models 1015, 1025, 1035, 1045, 1055, and 1060, analogous to System/370 and operated at 33 kIPS—1.050 MIPS. ES 1060 had up to 8M RAM.

The third subseries, released in 1984, were analogous to System/370 with some original enhancements, and included 1016, 1026, 1036, 1046, and 1066. ES 1066 had up to 16M RAM and operated at 5.5 MIPS. The fourth subseries had no direct IBM analogs and included 1130, 1181, and 1220. The last machine in the series, ES 1220, released in 1995, supported a number of 64-bit CPU commands, 256M RAM, and operated at 7 MIPS, but was not successful; only 20 such machines were ever produced, and in 1998 the whole production of ES mainframes was stopped.

<text>Hocking College is a public community college in Nelsonville, Ohio. The college offers more than 60 associate and vocational programs and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The college was chartered in 1969 by the Ohio Board of Regents.

Hocking has 3,474 students enrolled (78% of students are full-time). Its 2,300-acre campus is set in a rural setting and uses a semester-based academic calendar. Hocking&#x27;s athletic teams are the Hawks. The college is a member of the National Junior College Athletics Association.

== History ==
Hocking College came into existence as the Tri-County Institute. In the 1960s, the need for a vocational school became apparent in Southeast Ohio through demographic studies and population surveys. The Tri-County Institute was built on the campus of the Tri-County Joint Vocational School with the schools sharing laboratory and service areas. Fall 1968 marked the opening of the institute with approximately 250 students and 28 instructors. In 1969, the Ohio Board of Regents granted a charter to the institute, and they were authorized to grant degrees in 13 technical programs. The first commencement took place in June 1970 with 117 graduates.

In 1972, the official name of the school was changed to Hocking Technical College and 250 acres were purchased for new building and future development. In 1975, the college relocated its main campus to its current site on Hocking Parkway. The same year, residence halls opened on Hocking&#x27;s campus, making it the only two-year school in Ohio to have college-owned residence halls available to its students. Hocking College was first accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, Higher Learning Commission (HLC) in 1976. During the 1980s, Hocking College continued to grow and expand, establishing many sister-colleges worldwide, in places such as Taiwan, Japan and Jamaica. In 1990, the Perry Campus in New Lexington opened to serve the needs of Perry County residents. In 1991, the college&#x27;s name officially changed for a second time to Hocking College. In 1997, the college purchased Lake Snowden in Albany, Ohio and in 1998 renamed it as the Lake Snowden Education and Recreation Park.

In addition to their main campus, Hocking College owns and operates Lake Snowden, a recreation area in Lee Township. They also own of open-space land in the rugged landscape of York Township, west of the campus.

==Academics==
The college offers programs within the areas of Allied Health; Arts, Business and Science; Engineering and Information Technology; Hospitality; Natural Resources; Nursing; and Public Safety Services.

==Research==
Hocking College became one of two licensed cannabis testing laboratories for Ohio in 2018. In early 2018, the Ohio Department of Commerce licensed Hocking College to test Ohio&#x27;s medical marijuana before it is passed through the state-regulated supply chain. Jonathan Cachat, Director of Laboratory Sciences, led the development of these cannabis focused initiatives. The college&#x27;s medical and chemical laboratory, confirmed by the Ohio Department of Higher Education, tests available supplies for common cannabinoids (delta-9-THC, cannabidiol, and cannabinol), purity, potency, and chemical content. In July 2018, The Ohio Department of Higher Education confirmed the college&#x27;s associates programs in Applied Science and Laboratory Science. The laboratory is located in the historic downtown area of Nelsonville. The lab will also be used in courses related to a new major in the associate degree in Laboratory Sciences program, Cannabis Laboratory, beginning in early 2019.

==Controversies==
===2008 financial scandal===
In August 2008, the Ohio Auditor&#x27;s office announced an audit of Hocking College to investigate possible financial irregularities. President John Light and his wife, senior vice president Roxanne DuVivier, were found to have taken money illegally from the college. They pled no contest to the charges, were fined, and ordered to pay restitution.

Light was replaced by Ron Erickson, who was fired within a month for sending a campus-wide e-mail complaining about micromanagement by the board of trustees. Erickson was reinstated three months later.

===Racist threat===
In January 2010, a note threatening that black students would be killed on a specific date the following month was found in a dormitory bathroom. The school increased security measures and offered a financial reward for information leading to arrest. Two black students who feared for their safety withdrew from the college. This prompted the college to review and revise campus security policies. The college installed security cameras throughout each dormitory and hired additional residence hall staff.

===Killing of Michael Whitmer===
On July 27, 2021, Hocking College Police Officer Cecil Morrison shot and killed 37-year-old Michael Whitmer while responding to a domestic dispute call as Whitmer attempted to drive away. A Nelsonville officer was hit by ricocheted bullets. Morrison, who was hired by Nelsonville Police after the shooting, later pleaded no contest to a negligent homicide charge. He surrendered his law enforcement powers.

<doc id="586204" wikidata="Q1743701" url="?curid=586204" title="Kishon River">
<text>The Kishon River (, ; , – &quot;the river of slaughter&quot; or &quot;dismemberment&quot;; alternative Arabic, ) is a river in Israel that flows into the Mediterranean Sea near the city of Haifa.

== Course ==
The Kishon River is a perennial stream in Israel. Its furthest source is the Gilboa mountains, and it flows in a west-northwesterly direction through the Jezreel Valley, emptying into the Haifa Bay in the Mediterranean Sea. Its drainage basin, of , includes much of Jezreel Valley and the Western Galilee, and parts of Mount Carmel.

==Biblical references==
The Kishon is mentioned six times in the Hebrew Bible, among them the following verses:
*In Judges , Sisera&#x27;s Canaanite army is encamped at the Kishon River and the prophet Deborah predicts their defeat; in , in her song of celebration, the Kishon River is praised for washing away the Canaanite army.
*1 Kings names the Kishon River as the site where the prophets of Baal were executed on Elijah&#x27;s orders, following Elijah&#x27;s contest with the prophets of Baal nearby on Mount Carmel ().

==Modern history==

Following the end of the First World War there was an increase in the number of Jewish settlers arriving in Palestine, the Third Aliyah. Those who arrived at Haifa were kept in a tented Quarantine Camps set up on the Kishon estuary. Many of the immigrants, &quot;Halutzim&quot;, were infected with malaria for which the area was notorious. Under the British Mandate the area became Haifa&#x27;s industrial zone with a power station, railway workshops and the Iraq Petroleum Company refinery.

==Pollution==

Considered the most polluted river in Israel by several government authorities on the matter, it has been the subject of controversy regarding the struggle to improve the water quality. The pollution stems in part from daily contamination for over 40 years with mercury, other heavy metals, and organic chemicals by nearby chemical plants.

It was claimed in 2000, that there are more chemicals than water in the river, and that washing one&#x27;s hands in this river can cause severe chemical burns. On several occasions this river (or rather, patches of petrochemical waste on it) has caught fire from the chemical contaminants. Below Histadrut Bridge (Highway 4), after passing the petrochemical industries zone, the pH was 3 or below for most of the time in 2001.

A 2002 study found the ability of 3 hours&#x27; exposure to Kishon River water to induce DNA damage in rainbow-trout liver-cells to be on average threefold that of unpolluted water. Notably the lower Kishon, below the petrochemical industry zone, had a markedly elevated genotoxic potential.

A 2000 analysis of the river water revealed chlorinated compounds in discharges from the refineries, the municipal sewage treatment plant and from the Haifa Chemicals fertilizer production plant. Heavy metals were present in the discharges from the Carmel Olefins and Haifa Chemicals plants. The upper river system may also be mixed with genotoxic materials from domestic waste and agricultural runoff that contain pesticides and fertilizers. Potent genotoxins usually found in domestic wastes also include N-nitroso compounds and aromatic amines, which are known to be present in human sanitary outflows as well as genotoxic PAHs found in municipal discharges.

As of January 4, 2016; 1,000,000 cubic meters per year of potable water is added to the Kishon River and had decreased concentrations of salts, nitrates and phosphates, by over 50%. This flow will be replaced by the Jezreel Valley springs, as their flow is removed from irrigation.

===Cleanup===
In 2012, the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection launched a tender to clean up the Kishon river in a project costing NIS 220 million. Much of the funding for the project came from the companies responsible for the pollution. The Canadian company EnGlobe Corp. began work in 2012 to clean up the river. The cleanup project is to be concluded in 2015.

===Shayetet 13===

Since 2001, it was discovered that Shayetet 13 veterans had high occurrence of cancer, probably due to training in the polluted Kishon River and Haifa Bay. A commission for investigating the matter did not find statistical evidence that diving in the Kishon caused the cancers. However, despite the commission findings, the Defense Ministry decided to compensate select litigants. A new probe initiated in December 2021 concluded in February 2022 that the veterans had been exposed to a high amount of toxic chemicals, and it was subsequently decided to provide compensation to anyone who had trained in the Kishon River and fallen ill.

<doc id="586217" wikidata="Q6635052" url="?curid=586217" title="List of program music">
<text>[[Program music]] is a term applied to any musical composition on the classical music tradition in which the piece is designed according to some preconceived narrative, or is designed to evoke a specific idea and atmosphere. This is distinct from the more traditional absolute music popular in the Baroque and Classical eras, in which the piece has no narrative program or ideas and is simply created for music&#x27;s sake. Musical forms such as the symphonic poem, ballade, suite, overture and some compositions in freer forms are named as program music since they intended to bring out extra-musical elements like sights and incidents.

Opera, ballet, and Lieder could also trivially be considered program music since they are unintended to accompany vocal or stage performances. They will be excluded from this list except where they have been extensively popularised and played without the original vocals and/or stage performance.

The orchestral program music tradition is also continued in some pieces for jazz orchestras. For narrative or evocative popular music, please see Concept Album.

Any discussion of program music brings to mind Walt Disney&#x27;s animated features &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940) and &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; (1999), in which the Disney animators provided graphic visualisation of several famous pieces of program music. However, not all the pieces used in the films were particularly programmatic, and in most cases, the narratives illustrated by the animators were different from whatever programmatic narrative might have existed originally.

* Egmont Overture, Op. 84
* &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot;, Op. 91 is also known as the &quot;Battle Symphony&quot; and describes the battle between the French and British armies outside the Spanish town of Vitoria and the subsequent British victory.

=== Anton Bruckner ===

* Symphony No. 4 in E-flat major, &quot;Romantic&quot; — The program, involving medieval castles and dawn and royal hunts, appears to have been an afterthought like it was with the other Symphonies, but the validity of it, in this case, is supported by the subtitle given to the work, the only one of Bruckner&#x27;s Symphonies to have been given a subtitle by the composer himself.

<doc id="586219" wikidata="Q4909024" url="?curid=586219" title="Bill Foster (baseball)">
<text>William Hendrick Foster (June 12, 1904 – September 16, 1978) was an American left-handed pitcher in baseball&#x27;s Negro leagues in the 1920s and 1930s. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. Foster was the much-younger half-brother of Rube Foster, a Negro league player, pioneer, and fellow Hall of Famer.

== Early life ==
Foster was born in 1904 in Calvert, Texas. He had the same father as Rube Foster, who was a Negro league player, manager and owner. Rube Foster was a key figure in the founding of the Negro National League. Bill Foster&#x27;s mother died when he was four years old, so he was raised by his grandparents in Rodney, Mississippi. He did not meet his older half-brother until he was a teenager.

== Professional career ==
Foster played for the Memphis Red Sox in 1923 and 1924, the Chicago American Giants from 1925 to 1930—and again from 1932 to 1935 and in 1937—the Homestead Grays and Kansas City Monarchs in 1931, and the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1936.

Foster played for Chicago American Giants teams that won the Negro National League pennant and the Negro League World Series championship in 1926 and 1927, the Negro Southern League pennant in 1932, and the Negro National League pennant in 1933. He was the player-manager of the team in 1930.

In 1926, Foster won 23 games in a row and 26 overall, but his most amazing performance came the last day of the playoffs to determine the Negro National League title. Needing to win both games of a doubleheader against the Kansas City Monarchs, Foster hurled complete game shutouts in both games of a doubleheader against Bullet Joe Rogan and the Monarchs, 1–0 and 5–0, to put the Giants in the World Series. Foster was the starting pitcher in Game 7 and Game 11 for the Giants, and he won both of his starts while facing Hubert Lockhart. In the former, he allowed four runs on eight hits in nine innings of work, while in the latter he threw a complete-game shutout despite allowing ten hits.

In 1931 Foster, as a pitcher for the Homestead Grays, recorded a 10–2 record against rival African-American teams. His record against rival African-American teams increases to 11–3, if you count the games that were won and lost in Alcorn, Mississippi, when Syd Pollock&#x27;s Cubans House of Davids visited Alcorn College prior to Foster joining the Grays. Foster finished the 1931 campaign with J. L. Wilkinson&#x27;s Kansas City Monarchs where on October 4, 1931 he blew his fastball past a major league all-star team composed of such legendary men as Babe Herman, Joe Kuhel and both Waner brothers, Lloyd and Paul. In the game played at Kansas City&#x27;s Muehlebach Field, Foster captured a 4–3 win. During the 1931 season, Foster struck out ten men in a game on nine occasions and posted a seasonal high of 16 strikeouts in Vandergrift, Pennsylvania, on August 6. He also recorded four shutouts. Foster finished 1931 with a 23–5 record.

He was the top vote getter and the winning pitcher in the first East-West All-Star Game in 1933, and was on the All-Star team again in 1934.

Foster&#x27;s pitch selection included a fastball, overhand curve, slider, sidearm curve, and a changeup.

Baseball people often characterized Foster as one of the game&#x27;s great players. Umpire Jocko Conlan said Foster had &quot;the same perfect delivery of Herb Pennock, but was faster by far, with a sharp curve, and had what all great pitchers have – control.&quot; Charlie Gehringer once told Foster, &quot;If I could paint you white I could get $150,000 for you right now.&quot; Negro league player and manager Dave Malarcher favorably compared him to Negro league legend Satchel Paige, saying, &quot;Bill Foster was my star pitcher, the greatest pitcher of our time, not even barring Satchel.&quot;

== Later life ==
After retiring from professional baseball in 1936, Foster moved to Tarboro, North Carolina, where his childhood sweetheart Thelma Quigless lived. He also played semiprofessional baseball in 1940 in nearby Princeville. Foster and Quigless were married in 1941. Foster took a job in insurance policy sales with the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company. He later divorced Quigless.

Foster married again and returned to Mississippi. From 1960 to 1977, Foster was a dean and the baseball coach at his alma mater, Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College. In 1978, Foster died in Lorman, Mississippi.

==Legacy==
The Foster Baseball Field at McGowan Stadium in Lorman, the home field for Alcorn State baseball, is named for him.

Foster was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. He was elected to the Southwestern Athletic Conference Hall of Fame the next year. In 2003, he was voted in to the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="586221" wikidata="Q7190436" url="?curid=586221" title="Pibb Xtra">
<text>Pibb Xtra, formerly called Mr. Pibb (sometimes styled as Mr. PiBB), is a soft drink created and marketed by The Coca-Cola Company. It is a type of pepper soda with several variants. 

As of 2020, Pibb Xtra is sold in bottles, cans, and two-liter bottles, and is available in most Coca-Cola Freestyle machines.

==History==
First introduced as &quot;Peppo&quot; to compete against Dr Pepper, the name was changed to &quot;Mr. Pibb&quot; after Dr Pepper sued The Coca-Cola Company for trademark infringement. The original test markets for Mr. Pibb in 1972 were located in Waco, Texas the birthplace of Dr Pepper, before the company moved to Dallas, Texas. In 1980, Mr. Pibb was reformulated and marketed with the words &quot;New Taste&quot; printed prominently on the products.

In 2001, a cinnamon-forward &quot;spicy cherry&quot; flavor replaced the original formula in many parts of the United States, marketed as a bolder version of original Mr. Pibb. As recently as 2020, Pibb Xtra has been marketed as a &quot;refreshing, spicy cherry alternative to regular cola&quot;.

==Variations==
===Standard flavors===

Pibb Xtra, introduced in 2001, replaced Mr. PiBB. It is not merely a re-branding, but a reformulation.

Pibb Zero replaced Diet Mr. PiBB.

===Coca-Cola Freestyle flavors===
Pibb is now available in some Freestyle machines at restaurant chains that do not serve Dr Pepper or regions where Dr Pepper is not bottled by a local Coca-Cola distributor, which introduced the brand to new countries exclusively through the machines. In 2011, Pibb Xtra expanded to two new flavors: Pibb Xtra Cherry and Pibb Xtra Cherry-Vanilla. Released for Coca-Cola Freestyle machines, both new flavors were also released for Pibb Zero. Pibb Xtra Strawberry was released in 2018, along with Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola Strawberry.

==Ingredients==
Carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, phosphoric acid, potassium sorbate and potassium benzoate, artificial and natural flavors, caffeine, monosodium phosphate, lactic acid, polyethylene glycol.

<doc id="586227" wikidata="Q253436" url="?curid=586227" title="Shawnee">
<text>The Shawnee ( ) are a Native American people of the Northeastern Woodlands. Their language, Shawnee, is an Algonquian language.

Their precontact homeland was likely centered in southern Ohio. In the 17th century, they dispersed through Ohio, Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. In the early 18th century, they mostly concentrated in eastern Pennsylvania but dispersed again later that century across Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, with a small group joining Muscogee people in Alabama. In the 19th century, the U.S. federal government forcibly removed them under the 1830 Indian Removal Act to areas west of the Mississippi River; these lands would eventually become the states of Missouri, Kansas, and Texas. Finally, they were removed to Indian Territory, which became the state of Oklahoma in the early 20th century.

Today, Shawnee people are enrolled in three federally recognized tribes, all headquartered in Oklahoma: 
* Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma
* Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma
* Shawnee Tribe

==Etymology==
Shawnee has also been written as &quot;Shaawana&quot; and &quot;Shawanese&quot;. Individuals and singular Shawnee tribes may be referred to as &quot;šaawanwa,&quot; and the collective Shawnee people as &quot;šaawanwaki&quot; or &quot;šaawanooki&quot;.

Algonquian languages have words similar to the archaic &quot;shawano&quot; (now: &quot;shaawanwa&quot;) meaning &quot;south&quot;. However, the stem &quot;šawa-&quot; does not mean &quot;south&quot; in Shawnee, but &quot;moderate, warm (of weather)&quot;: See Charles F. Voegelin, &quot;šawa (plus -ni, -te) Moderate, Warm. Cp. šawani &#x27;it is moderating...&quot;. In one Shawnee tale, &quot;Sawage&quot; (šaawaki) is the deity of the south wind. Jeremiah Curtin translates Sawage as &#x27;it thaws&#x27;, referring to the warm weather of the south. In an account and a song collected by C. F. Voegelin, šaawaki is attested as the spirit of the South, or the South Wind.

==Language==
The Shawnee language is known as &quot;saawanwaatoweewe.&quot; In 2002, the Shawnee language, part of the Algonquian family, was in decline but still spoken by 200 people. These included more than 100 Absentee Shawnee and 12 Shawnee Tribe speakers. By 2017, Shawnee language advocates, including tribal member George Blanchard, estimated that there were fewer than 100 speakers. Most fluent Shawnee speakers are over the age of 50.

The language is written in the Latin script, but attempts at creating a unified spelling system have been unsuccessful. The Shawnee language has a dictionary, and portions of the Bible have been translated into Shawnee.

==History==

===Precontact history===

Some scholars believe that the Shawnee descend from the precontact Fort Ancient culture of the Ohio region, although this is not universally accepted. The Shawnee may have entered the area at a later time and occupied the Fort Ancient sites.

Fort Ancient culture flourished from c. 1000 to c. 1650 CE among a people who predominantly inhabited lands on both sides of the Ohio River in areas of present-day southern Ohio, northern Kentucky and western West Virginia. Like the Mississippian culture peoples of this period, they built earthwork mounds as part of their expression of their religious and political structure. Fort Ancient culture was once thought to have been a regional extension of the Mississippian culture. Scholars now believe that Fort Ancient culture (1000–1650 CE) was descended from Hopewell culture (100 BCE–500 CE). The people in those earlier centuries also built mounds as part of their social, political and religious system. Among their monuments were earthwork effigy mounds, such as Serpent Mound in present-day Ohio.
Uncertainty surrounds the fate of the Fort Ancient people. Most likely their society, like the Mississippian culture to the south, was severely disrupted by waves of epidemics from new infectious diseases carried by the first Spanish explorers in the 16th century. After 1525 at Madisonville, the type site, the village&#x27;s house sizes became smaller and fewer. Evidence shows that the people changed from their previously &quot;horticulture-centered, sedentary way of life&quot;.

There is a gap in the archaeological record between the most recent Fort Ancient sites and the oldest sites of the historic Shawnee. The latter were recorded by European (French and English) archaeologists as occupying this area at the time of encounter. Scholars generally accept that similarities in material culture, art, mythology, and Shawnee oral history linking them to the Fort Ancient peoples, can be used to support the connection from Fort Ancient society and development as the historical Shawnee society. But there is also evidence and oral history linking Siouan-speaking nations to the Ohio Valley.

The Shawnee considered the Lenape (or Delaware) of the East Coast mid-Atlantic region, who were also Algonquian speaking, to be their &quot;grandfathers&quot;. The Algonquian nations of present-day Canada, who extended to the interior along the St. Lawrence River and around the Great Lakes from the Atlantic coast, regarded the Shawnee as their southernmost branch. Along the East Coast, the Algonquian-speaking tribes were historically located mostly in coastal areas, from Quebec to the Carolinas.

===17th century===
Europeans reported encountering the Shawnee over a wide geographic area. One of the earliest mentions of the Shawnee may be a 1614 Dutch map showing some &quot;Sawwanew&quot; located just east of the Delaware River. Later 17th-century Dutch sources also place them in this general location. Accounts by French explorers in the same century usually located the Shawnee along the Ohio River, where the French encountered them on forays from eastern Canada and the Illinois Country.

Based on historical accounts and later archaeology, John E. Kleber describes Shawnee towns by the following:A Shawnee town might have from forty to one hundred bark-covered houses similar in construction to Iroquois longhouses. Each village usually had a meeting house or council house, perhaps sixty to ninety feet long, where public deliberations took place.

According to one English colonial legend, some Shawnee were descended from a party sent by Chief Opechancanough, ruler of the Powhatan Confederacy of 1618–1644, to settle in the Shenandoah Valley. The party was led by his son, Sheewa-a-nee. Edward Bland, an explorer who accompanied Abraham Wood&#x27;s expedition in 1650, wrote that in Opechancanough&#x27;s day, there had been a falling-out between the &quot;Chawan&quot; chief and the &quot;weroance&quot; of the Powhatan (also a relative of Opechancanough&#x27;s family). He said the latter had murdered the former. The Shawnee were &quot;driven from Kentucky in the 1670s by the Iroquois of Pennsylvania and New York, who claimed the Ohio valley as hunting ground to supply its fur trade. In 1671, the colonists Batts and Fallam reported that the Shawnee were contesting control of the Shenandoah Valley with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (Iroquois) in that year and were losing.

Sometime before 1670, a group of Shawnee migrated to the Savannah River area. The English based in Charles Town, South Carolina, were contacted by these Shawnee in 1674. They forged a long-lasting alliance. The Savannah River Shawnee were known to the Carolina English as &quot;Savannah Indians&quot;. Around the same time, other Shawnee groups migrated to Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and other regions south and east of the Ohio country. Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville, founder of New Orleans and the French colony of La Louisiane, writing in his journal in 1699, describes the Shawnee (or as he spells them, &quot;Chaouenons&quot;) as &quot;the single nation to fear, being spread out over Carolina and Virginia in the direction of the Mississippi.&quot;

Historian Alan Gallay speculates that the Shawnee migrations of the middle to late 17th century were probably driven by the Beaver Wars, which began in the 1640s. Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy invaded from the east to secure the Ohio Valley for hunting grounds. The Shawnee became known for their widespread settlements, extending from Pennsylvania to Illinois and to Georgia. Among their known villages were &quot;Eskippakithiki&quot; in Kentucky, &quot;Sonnionto&quot; (also known as Lower Shawneetown) in Ohio, &quot;Chalakagay&quot; near what is now Sylacauga, Alabama, &quot;Chalahgawtha&quot; at the site of present-day Chillicothe, Ohio, Old Shawneetown, Illinois, and Suwanee, Georgia. Their language became a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for trade among numerous tribes. They became leaders among the tribes, initiating and sustaining intertribal resistance to European and Euro-American expansion.

===18th century===
Some Shawnee occupied areas in central Pennsylvania. Long without a chief, in 1714 they asked Carondawana, an Oneida war chief, to represent them to the Pennsylvania provincial council. About 1727, Carondawana and his wife, a prominent interpreter known as Madame Montour, settled at Otstonwakin, on the west bank at the confluence of Loyalsock Creek and the West Branch Susquehanna River.

By 1730, European American settlers began to arrive in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, where the Shawnee predominated in the northern part of the valley. They were claimed as tributaries by the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; or Six Nations of the Iroquois to the north. The Iroquois had helped some of the Tuscarora people from North Carolina, who were also Iroquoian speaking and distant relations, to resettle in the vicinity of what is now Martinsburg, West Virginia. Most of the Tuscarora migrated to New York and settled near the Oneida people, becoming the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy; they declared their migration finished in 1722. Also at this time, Seneca (an Iroquois nation) and Lenape war parties from the north often fought pitched battles with pursuing bands of Catawba from Virginia, who would overtake them in the Shawnee-inhabited regions of the Valley.

By the late 1730s, pressure from colonial expansion produced repeated conflicts. Shawnee communities were also impacted by the fur trade. While they gained arms and European goods, they also traded for rum or brandy, leading to serious social problems related to alcohol abuse by their members. Several Shawnee communities in the Province of Pennsylvania, led by Peter Chartier, a Métis trader, opposed the sale of alcohol in their communities. This resulted in a conflict with colonial Governor Patrick Gordon, who was under pressure from traders to allow rum and brandy in trade. Unable to protect themselves, in 1745, some 400 Shawnee migrated from Pennsylvania to Ohio, Kentucky, Alabama and Illinois, hoping to escape the traders&#x27; influence.

Prior to 1754, the Shawnee had a headquarters at Shawnee Springs at modern-day Cross Junction, Virginia. The father of the later chief Cornstalk held his council there. Several other Shawnee villages were located in the northern Shenandoah Valley: at Moorefield, West Virginia, on the North River; and on the Potomac at Cumberland, Maryland. In 1753, the Shawnee on the Scioto River in the Ohio Country sent messengers to those still in the Shenandoah Valley, suggesting that they cross the Alleghenies to join the people further west, which they did the following year. The community known as &quot;Shannoah&quot; (Lower Shawneetown) on the Ohio River increased to around 1,200 people by 1750. 

Ever since the Beaver Wars, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy had claimed the Ohio Country as their hunting ground by right of conquest, and treated the Shawnee and Lenape who resettled there as dependent tribes. Some independent Iroquois bands from various tribes also migrated westward, where they became known in Ohio as the Mingo. These three tribes—the Shawnee, the Delaware (Lenape), and the Mingo—became closely associated with one another, despite the differences in their languages. The first two spoke Algonquian languages and the third an Iroquoian language.

After taking part in the first phase of the French and Indian War (also known as &quot;Braddock&#x27;s War&quot;) as allies of the French, the Shawnee switched sides in 1758. They made formal peace with the British colonies at the Treaty of Easton, which recognized the Allegheny Ridge (the Eastern Divide) as their mutual border. This peace lasted only until Pontiac&#x27;s War erupted in 1763, following Britain&#x27;s defeat of France and takeover of its territory east of the Mississippi River in North America. Later that year, the Crown issued the Proclamation of 1763, legally confirming the 1758 border as the limits of British colonization. They reserved the land beyond for Native Americans. But the Crown had difficulty enforcing the boundary, as Anglo-European colonists continued to move westward.

The Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 extended the colonial boundary to the west, giving British colonists a claim to lands in what are now the states of West Virginia and Kentucky. The Shawnee did not agree to this treaty: it was negotiated between British officials and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, who claimed sovereignty over the land. While they predominated, the Shawnee and other Native American tribes also hunted there. After the Stanwix treaty, Anglo-Americans began pouring into the Ohio River Valley for settlement, frequently traveling by boats and barges along the Ohio River. Violent incidents between settlers and Indians escalated into Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War in 1774. British diplomats managed to isolate the Shawnee during the conflict: the Iroquois and the Lenape stayed neutral. The Shawnee faced the British colony of Virginia with only a few Mingo allies. Lord Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia, launched a two-pronged invasion into the Ohio Country. The Shawnee chief Cornstalk attacked one wing but fought to a draw in the only major battle of the war, the Battle of Point Pleasant. In the Treaty of Camp Charlotte ending the war (1774), Cornstalk and the Shawnee were compelled by the British to recognize the Ohio River as their southern border, which had been established by the Fort Stanwix treaty. By this treaty, the Shawnee ceded all claims to the &quot;hunting grounds&quot; of West Virginia and Kentucky south of the Ohio River. But many other Shawnee leaders refused to recognize this boundary. The Shawnee and most other tribes were highly decentralized, and bands and towns typically made their own decisions about alliances.

===American Revolution===
When the United States declared independence from the British crown in 1776, the Shawnee were divided. They did not support the American rebel cause. Cornstalk led the minority who wished to remain neutral. The Shawnee north of the Ohio River were unhappy about the American settlement of Kentucky. Colin Calloway reports that most Shawnees allied with the British against the Americans, hoping to be able to expel the settlers from west of the mountains.

War leaders such as Blackfish and Blue Jacket joined Dragging Canoe and a band of Cherokee along the lower Tennessee River and Chickamauga Creek against the colonists in that area. Some colonists called this group of Cherokee the Chickamauga, because they lived along that river at the time of what became known as the Cherokee–American wars, during and after the American Revolution. But they were never a separate tribe, as some accounts suggested.

After the Revolution and during the Northwest Indian War, the Shawnee collaborated with the Miami to form a great fighting force in the Ohio Valley. They led a confederation of warriors of Native American tribes in an effort to expel U.S. settlers from that territory. After being defeated by U.S. forces at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, most of the Shawnee bands signed the Treaty of Greenville the next year. They were forced to cede large parts of their homeland to the new United States. Other Shawnee groups rejected this treaty, migrating independently to Missouri west of the Mississippi River, where they settled along Apple Creek. The French called their settlement &quot;Le Grand Village Sauvage.&quot;

===Tecumseh&#x27;s War and the War of 1812===
In the early 19th century, the Shawnee leader Tecumseh gained renown for organizing his namesake confederacy to oppose American expansion in Native American lands. The resulting conflict was called Tecumseh&#x27;s War. The two principal adversaries in the conflict, Chief Tecumseh and General William Henry Harrison, had both been junior participants in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. Tecumseh did not sign the 1795 Treaty of Greenville. However, many American Indian leaders in the region accepted the Greenville terms, and for the next ten years local intertribal resistance to American hegemony faded.

In September 1809, Harrison, then governor of the Indiana Territory, invited Potawatomi, Lenape, Eel River people, and Miami representatives to a meeting at Fort Wayne. In the negotiations, Harrison promised large subsidies to the tribes if they would cede lands to the United States. After two weeks of negotiating, the Potawatomi leaders convinced the Miami to accept the treaty as reciprocity, because the Potawatomi had earlier accepted treaties less advantageous to them at the request of the Miami. Finally, the tribes signed the Treaty of Fort Wayne on September 30, 1809, thereby selling the United States more than , chiefly along the Wabash River north of Vincennes, Indiana.
Tecumseh was outraged by the Treaty of Fort Wayne, believing that American Indian land was owned in common by all tribes, an idea advocated in previous years by the Shawnee leader Blue Jacket and the Mohawk leader Joseph Brant. In response, Tecumseh began to expand on the teachings of his brother Tenskwatawa, a spiritual leader known as The Prophet who called for the tribes to return to their ancestral ways. He began to associate these teachings with the idea of an intertribal alliance. Tecumseh traveled widely, urging warriors to abandon accommodationist chiefs and to join the resistance at Prophetstown. In August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 armed warriors to confront Harrison in Vincennes. Tecumseh demanded that Harrison nullify the Fort Wayne treaty, threatening to kill the chiefs who had signed it. Harrison refused, saying that the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so chose. Tecumseh left peacefully but warned Harrison that he would seek an alliance with the British unless the treaty was nullified.

====Great Comet of 1811 and Tekoomsē====

In March, the Great Comet of 1811 appeared. During the next year, tensions between American colonists and Native Americans rose quickly. Four settlers were murdered along the Missouri River and, in another incident, Natives seized a boatload of supplies from a group of traders. Harrison summoned Tecumseh to Vincennes to explain the actions of his allies. In August 1811, the two leaders met, with Tecumseh assuring Harrison that the Shawnee intended to remain at peace with the United States.

Afterward, Tecumseh traveled to the Southeast on a mission to recruit allies against the United States from among the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot;. His name Tekoomsē meant &quot;Shooting Star&quot; or &quot;Panther Across The Sky&quot;.

Tecumseh told the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee, and many others that the comet of March 1811 had signaled his coming. He also said that the people would see a sign proving that the Great Spirit had sent him.

As Tecumseh traveled, both sides readied for the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison assembled a small force of army regulars and militia to combat the Native forces. On November 6, 1811, Harrison led this army of about 1,000 men to Prophetstown, Indiana, hoping to disperse Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy. Early the next morning, forces under The Prophet prematurely attacked Harrison&#x27;s army at the Tippecanoe River near the Wabash. Though outnumbered, Harrison repulsed the attack, forcing the Natives to retreat and abandon Prophetstown. Harrison&#x27;s men burned the village and returned home.

====New Madrid earthquake====
On December 11, 1811, the New Madrid earthquake shook the Muscogee lands and the Midwestern United States. While the interpretation of this event varied from tribe to tribe, they agreed that the powerful earthquake had to have spiritual significance. The earthquake and its aftershocks helped the Tecumseh resistance movement as the Muscogee and other Native American tribes believed it was a sign that the Shawnee must be supported and that Tecumseh had prophesied such an event and sign.

====Tribal involvement in the War of 1812====

The Muscogee who joined Tecumseh&#x27;s confederation were known as the Red Sticks. They were the more conservative and traditional part of the people, as their communities in the Upper Towns were more isolated from European-American settlements. They did not want to assimilate. The Red Sticks rose in resisting the Lower Creek, and the bands became involved in civil war, known as the Creek War. This became part of the War of 1812 when open conflict broke out between American soldiers and the Red Sticks of the Creek.

After William Hull&#x27;s surrender of Detroit to the British during the War of 1812, General William Henry Harrison was given command of the U.S. Army of the Northwest. He set out to retake the city, which was defended by British Colonel Henry Procter, together with Tecumseh and his forces. A detachment of Harrison&#x27;s army was defeated at Frenchtown along the River Raisin on January 22, 1813. Some prisoners were taken to Detroit, but Procter left those too injured to travel with an inadequate guard. His Native American allies attacked and killed perhaps as many as 60 wounded Americans, many of whom were Kentucky militiamen. The Americans called the incident the &quot;River Raisin Massacre&quot;. The defeat ended Harrison&#x27;s campaign against Detroit, and the phrase &quot;Remember the River Raisin!&quot; became a rallying cry for the Americans.

In May 1813, Procter and Tecumseh besieged Fort Meigs in northern Ohio. Native forces defeated the American reinforcements arriving during the siege, but the garrison in the fort held out. The Indians eventually began to disperse, forcing Procter and Tecumseh to return to Canada. Their second offensive in July against Fort Meigs also failed. To improve Indian morale, Procter and Tecumseh attempted to storm Fort Stephenson, a small American post on the Sandusky River. After they were repulsed with serious losses, the British and Tecumseh ended their Ohio campaign.

On Lake Erie, the American commander Captain Oliver Hazard Perry fought the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813. His decisive victory against the British ensured American control of the lake, improved American morale after a series of defeats, and compelled the British to fall back from Detroit. General Harrison launched another invasion of Upper Canada (Ontario), which culminated in the U.S. victory at the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813. 

Tecumseh was killed there, and his death effectively ended the Indigenous alliance with the British in the Detroit region. American control of Lake Erie meant the British could no longer provide essential military supplies to their Native allies, who dropped out of the war. The Americans controlled the area during the remainder of the conflict.

===Aftermath===
The Shawnee in Missouri migrated from the United States south into Mexico, in the eastern part of Spanish Texas. They became known as the &quot;Absentee Shawnee&quot;. They were joined in the migration by some Delaware (Lenape). Although they were closely allied with the Cherokee led by The Bowl, their chief John Linney remained neutral during the 1839 Cherokee War.

Texas achieved independence from Mexico under American leaders. It decided to force removal of the Shawnee from the new republic. But in appreciation of their earlier neutrality, Texan President Mirabeau Lamar fully compensated the Shawnee for their improvements and crops. They were forced out to Arkansas Territory. The Shawnee settled close to present-day Shawnee, Oklahoma. They were joined by Shawnee pushed out of Kansas (see below), who shared their traditionalist views and beliefs.

In 1817, the Ohio Shawnee had signed the Treaty of Fort Meigs, ceding their remaining lands in exchange for three reservations in Wapaughkonetta, Hog Creek (near Lima), and Lewistown, Ohio. They shared these lands with some Seneca people who had migrated west from New York.

In a series of treaties, including the Treaty of Lewistown of 1825, Shawnee and Seneca people agreed to exchange land in western Ohio with the United States for land west of the Mississippi River in what became Indian Territory. In July 1831, the Lewistown group of Seneca–Shawnee departed for the Indian Territory (in present-day Kansas and Oklahoma).

The main body of Shawnee in Ohio followed Black Hoof, who fought every effort to force his people to give up their homeland. After the death of Black Hoof, the remaining 400 Ohio Shawnee in Wapaughkonetta and Hog Creek surrendered their land and moved to the Shawnee Reserve in Kansas. This movement was largely under terms negotiated by Joseph Parks (1793–1859). He had been raised in the household of Lewis Cass and had been a leading interpreter for the Shawnee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Society https://archive.org/details/collectionskans00socigoog/page/n421 399&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Missouri joined the Union in 1821. After the Treaty of St. Louis in 1825, the 1,400 Missouri Shawnee were forcibly relocated from Cape Girardeau, along the west bank of the Mississippi River, to southeastern Kansas, close to the Neosho River.

During 1833, only Black Bob&#x27;s band of Shawnee resisted removal. They settled in northeastern Kansas near Olathe and along the Kansas (Kaw) River in Monticello near Gum Springs. The Shawnee Methodist Mission was built nearby to minister to the tribe. About 200 of the Ohio Shawnee followed the prophet Tenskwatawa and had joined their Kansas brothers and sisters here in 1826.

In the mid-1830s, two companies of Shawnee soldiers were recruited into United States service to fight in the Seminole War in Florida. One of these was led by Joseph Parks, who had earlier helped negotiate the cession treaty. He was commissioned as captain. Parks was a major landholder in both Westport, Missouri, and in Shawnee, Kansas. He was also a Freemason and a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In Shawnee, Kansas, a Shawnee cemetery was started in the 1830s and remained in use until the 1870s. Parks was among the most prominent men buried there.

In the 1853 Indian Appropriations Bill, Congress appropriated $64,366 for treaty obligations to the Shawnee, such as annuities, education, and other services. An additional $2,000 was appropriated for the Seneca and the Shawnee together.

During the American Civil War, Black Bob&#x27;s band fled from Kansas and joined the &quot;Absentee Shawnee&quot; in Indian Territory to escape the war. After the Civil War, the Shawnee in Kansas were expelled and forced to move to northeastern Oklahoma. The Shawnee members of the former Lewistown group became known as the &quot;Eastern Shawnee&quot;.

The former Kansas Shawnee became known as the &quot;Loyal Shawnee&quot; (some say this is because of their allegiance with the Union during the war; others say this is because they were the last group to leave their Ohio homelands). The latter group appeared to be regarded as part of the Cherokee Nation by the United States. They were also known as the &quot;Cherokee Shawnee&quot; and were settled on some of the Cherokee land in Indian Territory.

On June 7, 2024, on the site of the Shawnee town &quot;Old Chillicothe&quot; along U.S. 68 in Xenia Township, Greene County, Ohio, was opened the Great Council State Park with the help of the three federally recognized Shawnee tribes: the Shawnee Tribe, Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, and the Absentee Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma.

==Federal recognition==

In the late 20th century, the &quot;Loyal&quot; or &quot;Cherokee&quot; Shawnee began a movement to be federally recognized as a tribe independent of the Cherokee Nation. They received this action by a Congressional bill and are now known as the &quot;Shawnee Tribe&quot;. Today, most members of the three federally recognized Shawnee tribes reside in Oklahoma.

The three federally recognized Shawnee tribes are:
* Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma
* Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma
* Shawnee Tribe

==Social and kinship groups==
Before contact with Europeans, the Shawnee tribe had a patrilineal system, by which descent and inheritance went through paternal lines. This was different from many of the Native American tribes, who had matrilineal kinship systems. In that alternative, children were considered born to the mother&#x27;s family and clan, and inheritance and property was passed through the female line.

According to mid-19th century historian Henry Harvey, the Shawnee were ruled by kings, whom they called &quot;sachema&quot; [or sachems], who reigned by succession in the matrilineal line. For instance, the children of a king would not inherit the position. The sons of his brother, by the mother, or the sons of his sister (and after them, the sons of her daughter) would reign. Women did not inherit such a position directly. Harvey suggested that the Shawnee relied on this system of descent because a woman&#x27;s sons would always be considered legitimate.

The five divisions, or septs, of the tribe were commonly known as:
* Chillicothe (Principal Place), Chalahgawtha, Chalaka, Chalakatha; The Principal division of &quot;Tschillicothi&quot;, appointed by the 1st Lead Illini or man Kwikullay. 
* Hathawekela, Thawikila;
* Kispoko, Kispokotha, Kishpoko, Kishpokotha; [from &quot;ishpoko&quot; as akin to the Ispogi, meaning swamps or marshy lands of the Muscogee, most specific to the Tukabatchi] 
* Mekoche, Mequachake, Machachee, Maguck, Mackachack, etc.; Mackochee
* Pekowi, Pekuwe, Piqua, Pekowitha. [Pickywanni or pickquay]

The war chiefs were also hereditary. They descended from their maternal line in the Kispoko division.

A 1935 study noted that the Shawnee had five septs, and that they were also divided among six clans or subdivisions, according to kinship. Each clan represented spiritual values and had a recognized role in the overall confederacy. Each name group or clan is found among each of the five divisions, and each Shawnee belongs to a clan or name group.

The six group names are:
* &quot;Pellewomhsoomi&quot; (Turkey name group)—represents bird life
* &quot;Kkahkileewomhsoomi&quot; (Turtle name group)—represents aquatic life
* &quot;Petekoθiteewomhsoomi&quot; (Rounded-feet name group)—represents carnivorous animals such as the dog, wolf, or those with paws that are ball-shaped or &quot;rounded&quot;
* &quot;Mseewiwomhsoomi&quot; (Horse name group)—represents herbivorous animals such as the horse and deer
* &quot;θepatiiwomhsoomi&quot; (Raccoon name group)—represents animals having paws which can rip and tear, such as those of a raccoon and bear
* &quot;Petakineeθiiwomhsoomi&quot; (Rabbit name group)—represents a gentle and peaceful nature

Each sept or division had a primary village where the chief of the division lived. This village was usually named after the division. By tradition, each Shawnee division and clan had certain roles it performed on behalf of the entire tribe. By the time these kinship elements were recorded in writing by European Americans, these strong social traditions were fading. They are poorly understood. Because of the disruption and scattering of the Shawnee people from the 17th century through the 19th century, the roles of the divisions changed.

Today the United States government recognizes three Shawnee tribes, all of which are located in Oklahoma:
* The Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, consisting mainly of &quot;Hathawekela&quot;, &quot;Kispokotha&quot;, and &quot;Pekuwe&quot; divisions
* The Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, mostly of the &quot;Mekoche&quot; division
* The Shawnee Tribe, formerly considered part of the Cherokee Nation, mostly of the &quot;Chaalakatha&quot; and &quot;Mekoche&quot; divisions. Petakineeθiiwomhsoomi (Rabbit name group) represents a gentle and peaceful nature, that stands alone as the Tail or last

As of 2008, there were 7,584 enrolled Shawnee, with most living in Oklahoma.

==State-recognized tribe==
The state of Alabama recognizes an organization, the Piqua Shawnee Tribe, as a state-recognized tribe under the Davis-Strong Act. Ohio does not recognize any Shawnee tribes or any other state-recognized tribes. Kentucky also has no mechanism for state-recognizing tribes.

==Unrecognized groups who claim Shawnee descent==

Dozens of unrecognized organizations self-identify as having Shawnee ancestry. These organizations are not federally recognized tribes nor state-recognized tribes.

The Absentee Shawnee Tribal Historic Preservation Office&#x27;s Cultural Preservation Department wrote that &quot;in our ancestral settlement areas including but not limited to Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, [and] Alabama. In these areas, there are a number of people who claim Shawnee ancestry, this is not so much the concern as the fact that some of these individuals or groups use this claim to exploit Shawnee culture as a means of gaining opportunities for themselves from a public that is largely unaware of the vast divide that separates our tribal community politically and culturally from those of alleged Shawnee ancestry.&quot;

Ben Barnes, chief of the Shawnee Tribe, has written: &quot;Groups claiming to be tribal sovereigns has reached a new level of concern for the Shawnee Tribe and other tribal nations.&quot; He continues:
There are currently 36 unestablished Shawnee “tribes” operating as 501(c)(3) non-profits across the country. Their 501(c)(3) designations allow them to solicit donations and participate in grants meant for Tribal nations. They pose as spokespeople for our ancestors at historic sites, state historical societies, and university campuses causing significant harm to our identity, culture, and reputation. These groups are violating the sacred, ancient places of our ancestors. They perform their ideas of our ceremonies on top of our burial mounds and have stolen our language, customs, and ceremonies.

United Remnant Band of the Shawnee Nation of Bellefontaine Ohio:In 1979 and 1980, the Ohio state legislature held hearings about state recognition of the United Remnant Band. The band filed historical and genealogical documents with the state to support their claim of descent from the historical Shawnee. The Ohio General Assembly held hearings and heard testimony from numerous groups. In 1980, the 113th Ohio General Assembly passed a &quot;Joint Resolution to recognize the Shawnee Nation United Remnant Band&quot;, as adopted by the Ohio Senate, 113th General Assembly, Regular Session, Am. Sub. H.J.R. No. 8, 1979–1980. This is a congratulatory resolution, and Ohio attorney general&#x27;s office spokesperson Leo Jennings said: &quot;The resolution has no force of law in the state Ohio.… It was basically a ceremonial resolution.&quot;

<text>Nieuport, later Nieuport-Delage, was a French aeroplane company that primarily built racing aircraft before World War I and fighter aircraft during World War I and between the wars.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Originally formed as Nieuport-Duplex in 1902 for the manufacture of engine components the company was reformed in 1909 as the Société Générale d&#x27;Aéro-locomotion, and its products were marketed to the aviation industry, including ignition components. During this time they built their first aircraft, a small single-seat pod and boom monoplane. This was destroyed shortly after having been flown successfully, during the Great Flood of Paris in 1909 . A second design flew before the end of 1909 and had the essential form of modern aircraft, including an enclosed fuselage with the pilot protected from the slipstream and a horizontal tail whose aerodynamic force acted downwards, balancing the weight of the engine ahead of the centre of gravity, as opposed to upwards as on contemporaries such as the Blériot XI.

Nieuport had trouble obtaining suitable engines for their early designs and resorted to making their own. In 1910 a twin-cylinder horizontally-opposed type producing was fitted to the Nieuport II and proved successful.

In 1911, the company was reformed specifically to build aircraft while continuing to build components including propellers under the name Nieuport et Deplante. In 1911, Edouard Nieuport (1875–1911), who was one of several aviation minded brothers, died after being thrown from his aircraft, and the company was taken over by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe, a famous supporter of aviation development. With his financing, the name was changed to Société Anonyme des Établissements Nieuport, and development of existing designs was continued. A second of the brothers, Charles Nieuport, died in another accident January 24, 1913 after he stalled and spun in, and the position of chief designer was taken over by the Swiss engineer Franz Schneider, better known for his work for his next employer, L.V.G., and his long-running fight with Anthony Fokker over machine gun interrupter / synchronizer patents. Schneider left Nieuport in late 1913.

===Gustave Delage and World War I===

With Schneider&#x27;s departure, Gustave Delage (no connection to the Delage automobile company) took over as chief designer in January 1914. He began work on a sesquiplane racer – a type of biplane whose lower wing was much narrower in chord than its top wing. This aircraft was not ready to fly until after World War I had begun but, as the Nieuport 10, the type saw extensive service with the Royal Naval Air Service (R.N.A.S.) of the United Kingdom and with the French and Russian Flying Services. The performance of the Nieuport 10, and the more powerful Nieuport 12, which also served with the Royal Flying Corps (R.F.C.) was such that they were used as fighters. Nieuport developed an improved design specifically intended as a fighter – the Nieuport 11, which was regarded as the &quot;baby&quot; (&quot;bébé&quot;) of the 10, which it closely resembled, except in size.

Until the end of 1917, most of the company&#x27;s output would consist of successive developments of this one design, with more powerful engines, modest increases in overall dimensions, and refined aerodynamics, until the line ended with the Nieuport 27. As horsepower increased, the &quot;V-strut&quot; Nieuports began to reach their maximum safe flying speed (VNE) more readily and discovered the limitations of the three spars sesquiplane wing form, which then required they avoid sustained power-on dives to avoid the risk of wing failures. By the spring of 1917 the design was being surpassed by the new twin-gun Albatros D.III, and although the process of replacement had begun, Nieuport 27&#x27;s would still be in front line service in the spring of 1918. Even while still in frontline service, Nieuports of all types were being used at French and American flight training facilities, with the bulk of production from 1917 onwards going to flying schools.

Some pilots, notably Albert Ball and Charles Nungesser, preferred the Nieuport due to its sensitive controls and maneuverability. Pilots Eddie Rickenbacker and Billy Bishop flew Nieuport aircraft to some of their first victories.

The first major break from the sesquiplane design, the Nieuport 28 was the first production Nieuport fighter with two spars to both upper and lower wings, but by the time it was ready for service the French had already chosen the SPAD S.XIII as their primary fighter. Due to a shortage of SPAD S.XIIIs and problems with their engines, the first fighter squadrons of the United States Army Air Service (USAAS) used the Nieuport 28 on operations. While only in operational service with the USAAS for a short time, the Nieuport 28 was the first fighter to be used on operations by an American squadron.

Nieuports were widely used by the Allied air arms, and various models were built under licence in Italy, Russia and the United Kingdom. In Italy, Aermacchi was originally formed as Nieuport-Macchi for the purpose of building various Nieuports under licence. They started with the Nieuport IV, but built the Nieuport 10, 11, 17 and finally the post-war NiD.29 under licence. In Russia several companies, notably Dux, built Nieuports of several types including the IV, 10, 11, 16, 17, 21, 23 and 24bis, with the 24bis continuing in production after the Russian Revolution had ended. In Scotland, William Beardmore and Company built the Nieuport 12 under licence, while gradually incorporating many of their own changes. Nieuport &amp; General Aircraft was formed to build Nieuport fighters under licence in England, and built 50 Nieuport 17bis scouts for the Royal Naval Air Service before switching to other aircraft.
Three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919 marking the end of hostilities in World War I, and in protest over being forced to march like infantry in the parade, Charles Godefroy flew a &quot;v-strut&quot; Nieuport fighter through the arch of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on the morning of Friday, 8 August 1919. The event was filmed.

===Post–World War I===
By the end of 1918, Nieuport had two new fighter types flying, the Nieuport 29 biplane and the Nieuport 31 monoplane both of which had evolved in parallel from the Nieuport 28. They differed from earlier Nieuports in having streamlined wooden monocoque fuselages, and Hispano-Suiza engines. Specially modified Nieuport 29 and 31 aircraft set speed and height records, and the 31 was the first aircraft to exceed in level flight, while in the hands of Joseph Sadi-Lecointe.

At this time, Nieuport became Nieuport-Astra, with the absorption of Société Astra, a company known for aerial balloons, though this name would not be used for long, before becoming Nieuport-Delage, in honour of the work of the chief designer, Gustave Delage, who had been running the company through the war years. Also at this time, the seaplane builder Tellier was absorbed, and for a brief time the name Nieuport-Tellier was also used.

Despite the many successes achieved with 29 and 31 in setting speed and altitude records, Delage quickly embarked on a new design that was to provide the basis for a family of aircraft that would remain in service until the fall of France during World War II – the Nieuport-Delage NiD.42. This design first saw light as a shoulder-wing racer (42S), then as single-seat (42 C.1) and two-seat fighters (42 C.2) for the French Air Force, although none of these variants would see service. 
The Nieuport-Delage 52, a slightly improved NiD.42 with a metal monocoque fuselage, entered service with Spain where it was also built under licence by Hispano-Suiza, and remained in service well into the Spanish Civil War. By then it was obsolete and would be retired before the end of the conflict. The French bought large numbers of the 62 series (620, 621, 622, 629) which were also derived from the NiD.42 to equip the bulk of the French fighter units until replaced by newer designs in the late 30s. Despite being hopelessly obsolete, several French second-line escadrilles were still equipped with them during the invasion of France.

The Nieuport-Delage NiD 38 and similar 39 were small airliners of which more than 37 were built. Other types were developed, the majority of which were one-offs or did not result in significant production.

===The end of Nieuport===
The final aircraft developed by Nieuport saw much of its development done by successor companies. In 1932, as a result of the amalgamations taking place in the French aviation industry, Delage retired and Nieuport-Delage was briefly renamed Nieuport again, before merging with Loire Aviation to form Loire-Nieuport, which was then merged into SNCAO during the amalgamations in the French aircraft industry. SNCAO would in turn be merged into the massive conglomerate known as Aérospatiale.
During the German invasion of France in 1940, the company&#x27;s records were burnt to prevent their falling into German hands. This step didn&#x27;t prevent the Germans from charging several employees with espionage, as the last operational Nieuport, the Loire-Nieuport LN.401 was a single-seat, single-engine retractable-gear monoplane dive bomber with an inverted gull wing with a vague similarity to the Junkers Ju 87.

<text>Ingen Ryūki () (December 7, 1592 – May 19, 1673) was a Chinese poet, calligrapher, and monk of Linji Chan Buddhism from China. He is most known for founding the Ōbaku school of Zen in Japan.

==Biography==
Ingen was born on December 7, 1592, in Fuqing, Fujian, during China&#x27;s Ming dynasty. Ingen&#x27;s father disappeared when he was five. At age 20, while searching for him, Ingen arrived at Mount Putuo off Zhejiang province, where he served tea to monks. At 28, after the death of his mother, he was ordained as a monk at his family temple - Wanfu Temple, Mount Huangbo, Fujian. Ingen&#x27;s teachers there were Miyun Yuanwu and Feiyin Tongrong. In 1633 he received dharma transmission from the latter, and in 1637 served his first term as abbot. His second term as 33rd abbot of the temple began in 1646 and at this time he is credited with helping Mount Huangbo to develop into a thriving Buddhist centre.

In 1654, after repeated requests of Itsunen Shoyu, he went to Nagasaki, Japan with around 30 monks and artisans, including his disciple Muyan. He founded the Ōbaku school of Zen. He established the Ōbaku head temple Manpuku-ji at Uji, Kyoto in 1661.

On May 21, 1673 (&quot;Enpō 1, 5th day of the 4th month&quot;), he died at Mampuku-ji.

==Calligraphy==
Ingen was a skilled calligrapher, introducing the Ming style of calligraphy to Japan. Along with his disciples Muyan and Sokuhi Nyoitsu, he was one of the &quot;Ōbaku no Sanpitsu&quot; (&quot;Three Brushes of Ōbaku&quot;). He is known to have carried paintings by Chen Xian with him to Japan.

==Selected work==
Ingen&#x27;s published writings encompass 35 works in 46 publications in 4 languages and 226 library holdings.

<text>A combination square is a multi-purpose measuring and marking tool used in metalworking, woodworking, and stonemasonry. It is composed of a rule and one or more interchangeable heads that can be attached to the rule. Other names for the tool include adjustable square, combo square, and sliding square.

The most common head is the standard head, which is used as a square for marking and testing 90° and 45° angles. The other common types of head are the protractor head, and the centre finder head.

== Description ==

=== Rule ===
Combination square rules are made of steel and can be purchased with gradations in metric, imperial, or both metric and imperial. Both faces of the rule have markings, providing four different sets of markings. This allows different sides to have different graduations (eg. 1mm or 0.5mm markings) or units (ie. metric and imperial). The rule typically comes in lengths between 150mm and 600mm or between 4 inches and 24 inches.

=== Heads ===
The heads, occasionally called anvils, are attached to the rule by sliding the rule into a slot in the side of the head. The head is then tightened in place via a lock bolt or lock nut which engages with a channel running the full length of the rule, allowing the head to be tightened on at any point along the rule.

The standard or square head has three adjacent flat faces, two of them meet square to one another, and the third face is angled away at 45°. When attached one face is parallel to the rule, one face is perpendicular, and one face is at 45°. The standard head usually incorporates a small spirit level and a small removable scriber.

The protractor head has a flat reference edge which is attached to an adjustable 180° protractor or (sometimes called a turret) with a graduated scale in both directions for reading both the angle or the complement angle. The protractor head sometimes includes a small spirit level.

The centre finder head has two faces meeting at 90°, when attached one edge of the rule bisects the two faces at 45°.

The heads are manufactured from either forged steel, cast iron, die-cast aluminium, die-cast zinc, or plastic. Aluminium and zinc heads are cheaper than steel and iron, but less durable and more prone to inaccuracy. Cast iron and steel heads are also notably heavier. The heads are usually painted except for the flat machined reference faces.

== Uses ==
As well as being used as a regular standalone rule or straightedge, the rule is used in combination with the different heads.

=== Standard head ===

The standard head can be used as a:

* Square, for marking and referencing 90° angles and checking if surfaces are flat and square to one another.
* Mitre square, for marking and referencing 45° angles, such as in woodworking for mitre joints.
* Spirit level, to check if a surface is level or similarly if a surface or edge is plumb (vertical).
* Depth gauge or height gauge.
* Form of marking gauge for marking lines parallel to an edge, by setting the head to a certain distance from the end of the rule.
* Reference for directly transferring dimensions without needing to take a measurement, minimising measurement errors and inaccuracies.

=== Protractor head ===

The protractor head can be used for:

* Measuring and checking angles between surfaces, edges, and markings.
* Marking angles from an edge
* Directly transferring angles, like a bevel gauge (sliding T gauge), to minimise measurement errors and inaccuracies.
* Measuring and marking angles relative to the horizontal by using the spirit level.

=== Centre finder head ===

The centre finder head can be used for:

* Marking lines through the centre of circular or square objects, such as dowels. Making multiple marks at different angles can be used to identify the point at the centre of the circle.
* Marking lines perpendicular to a curved edge (normal lines).
* Bisecting square corners to mark a 45° angle.

== History ==
Though some earlier 19th century tools were called combination squares, the modern combination square was invented in the late 1870s by American inventor Laroy S. Starrett, and patented in 1879. In 1880 he founded the L. S. Starrett Company in Athol, Massachusetts, United States. The tool was originally designed for machinists, but over time became commonly used in other trades, such as woodworking.

<text>Anthony Davis (born February 20, 1951) is an American pianist and composer. He incorporates several styles including jazz, rhythm &#x27;n&#x27; blues, gospel, non-Western, African, European classical, Indonesian gamelan, and experimental music. He has played with several groups and is also a professor of music at the University of California, San Diego.

Davis is perhaps best known for his operas; he has been called &quot;the dean of African-American opera composers.&quot; His better known compositions include &quot;X, The Life and Times of Malcolm X&quot;, which was premiered by the New York City Opera in 1986; &quot;Amistad&quot;, which premiered with the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1997; and &quot;Wakonda&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which premiered at Opera Omaha in 2007. His opera &quot;The Central Park Five&quot; premiered on June 15, 2019, at the Long Beach Opera Company in California. It won him a Pulitzer Prize for Music on May 4, 2020.

==Biography==
Davis was born in Paterson, New Jersey in 1951. The son of Professor Charles Davis, an expert on author Richard Wright, Davis was brought up in a series of college towns. He has a 1975 degree from Yale University, and has taught at Yale and Harvard University.

Davis is a Distinguished Professor of Music at the University of California, San Diego, having joined the department in 1996. He has received acclaim as a free-jazz pianist, a co-leader or sideman with various ensembles. Such ensembles include those that featured Smith as bandleader from 1974 to 1977. He has played with Anthony Braxton and Leo Smith. In 1981, Davis formed an octet called Episteme. He also wrote the incidental music for the 1993 Broadway version of Tony Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Angels in America&quot;.

Many of his operas have explored people and events from African-American history. In a 1986 interview with writer Samuel R. Delany and historian Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Anthony Davis provides a detailed account of his influences and motivations for writing &quot;X, The Life and Times of Malcolm X.&quot; In 1997 his opera &quot;Amistad&quot;, with a libretto by his cousin Thulani Davis, premiered at the Chicago Lyric Opera. Its ambition was recognized but the production received mixed reviews. It was accepted for production in 2008 at Spoleto Festival USA. It underwent a major revision and the production was highly praised. &quot;Opera Today&quot; said that the revised &quot;Amistad&quot; was &quot;much leaner, more focused and dramatically far more effective than the original. And in so doing they [the Davises] created not only a masterpiece of American opera, but further a work that — against a contemporary horizon darkened by undercurrents of racism — resonates today far beyond Memminger and Spoleto USA.&quot;

Davis has also explored Native American history in his work. His opera &quot;Wakonda&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2007), with a libretto by Yusef Komunyakaa, is a tale of a contemporary Native American Ponca family in Nebraska and the history that affects them.

His opera, &quot;Lilith&quot;, (libretto by Allan Havis) had its world premiere at the Conrad Prebys Music Center at UCSD on December 4, 2009. The story is about the demon figure of Jewish mythology who was sometimes said to be biblical Adam&#x27;s first wife. It is set in a modern era.

He began working on the music for the opera &quot;The Central Park Five&quot; in 2014. An early version, titled &quot;Five&quot;, was performed in Newark, New Jersey in 2016 by the . The librettist for both the early and final versions was playwright Richard Wesley. &quot;The Central Park Five&quot; premiered on June 15, 2019, in a production by the Long Beach Opera Company in San Pedro, California. In 2020 the work won him the Pulitzer Prize for Music. He is the third UCSD professor in the university&#x27;s 60-year history to win a Pulitzer. He commented, &quot;it&#x27;s also very exciting for me that you can create political work that has an impact and speaks to issues in our society. I&#x27;ve done my career creating political works, and I never thought I would ever get a Pulitzer.&quot; He learned that he had won the prize while in a Zoom meeting with music faculty colleagues, so they all heard the phone call; one of them later commented &quot;Best Zoombomb ever!&quot;

In 2022, the Detroit Opera staged a production of &quot;X, The Life and Times of Malcolm X&quot;, directed by Robert O&#x27;Hara. This was followed by the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s production of the same opera in Fall 2023, which received significant critical acclaim in sources such as The New York Times, San Francisco Classical Voice and Smithsonian Magazine.

In 2023, he composed the opening fanfare &quot;If a Fish Kept His Mouth Shut, He Wouldn&#x27;t Get Caught!&quot; for the Bandshell&#x27;s 100th anniversary, commissioned by the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, and performed in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series.

<doc id="586257" wikidata="Q1051519" url="?curid=586257" title="Sailor Neptune">
<text>is a fictional lead character in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; media franchise. Her alternate identity is , a teenage Japanese schoolgirl and violinist. Michiru is a member of the Sailor Soldiers, female supernatural fighters who protect the Solar System from evil. 

Introduced in the third story arc, Sailor Neptune fights alongside her partner and lover Sailor Uranus. In both versions of the story she is portrayed as elegant, sophisticated, capable of sharp anger, occasionally cold, and fully dedicated to her duty as a Sailor Soldier. She possesses powers associated with the sea, precognition, as well as powers granted by her magic mirror.

==Profile==
Michiru is formally introduced in the third story arc, although she appears in silhouette alongside Sailor Uranus in episode 89, a &quot;teaser&quot; to &quot;Sailor Moon S&quot;. She is portrayed as a very polite, calm character in the series. She dislikes being patronized even if not doing so would hurt her feelings, and subsequently will not indulge people. This is alluded to in her backstory, explaining that she was congenial but generally not social. Michiru is also graceful and delicate, with an aura of sophistication. She is clearly intelligent, and this usually manifests itself through art and music. Usagi (to whom this observation is especially relevant) once commented that Michiru was the ideal example of a princess. Michiru has short teal hair in a wavy style that reaches just past her shoulders. In her transformation sequence, she finishes with a hair toss/flip.

Michiru attends Mugen Academy with Haruka (and the younger Hotaru Tomoe) when she is first introduced. In the manga, after Mugen is destroyed, she and Haruka later attend the same high school as Usagi and the other girls. It is never mentioned where they go after this in the anime, but the two of them are shown driving away in their last appearance in &quot;Sailor Moon S&quot;, and during a made-for-TV special set during the following season, they are shown staying at a hotel elsewhere in Japan. According to the musicals, Michiru had experience studying abroad. Michiru&#x27;s closest bond is with Haruka, and Takeuchi has explicitly stated that the two are in a lesbian relationship in both the manga and the anime as well as the musicals.

In the anime adaptation, Michiru briefly flirts with Seiya, at that time a man, asking him to help her unzip her dress. Her stated intention, earlier in the episode, is to learn Seiya&#x27;s motives out of fear that he is a threat to the planet. This flirtation does not occur in the manga, where Seiya is always a female and plays a much more minor role. However, in the &quot;Infinity&quot; arc, Michiru appears as temptation for Mamoru, paralleling Haruka being used as temptation for Usagi. Though she never makes any of the advances on Mamoru that Haruka makes on Usagi, Usagi is jealous of her because she sees them together.

Michiru is deeply artistic and is the Sailor Soldier most associated with the arts. Her known skills include the violin, swimming, and painting; of all her skills, her strongest is as a violinist, which is also her greatest dream. She likes all her classes, especially music, and belongs to the music club at school as well as the swimming club. In the manga, she collects cosmetics; in the anime, she loves to swim, often using the water as a way to relax. Her favorite food is sashimi, while her least favorite is kikurage mushrooms. She also dislikes sea cucumbers for unclear reasons, and her favorite color is Marine blue.

== Aspects and forms ==
As a character with different incarnations, special powers, transformations and a long lifetime virtually spanned between the Silver Millennium era and the 30th century, Michiru gains multiple aspects and aliases as the series progresses.

===Sailor Neptune===

Michiru&#x27;s Soldier identity. She wears a uniform colored in teal and cerulean, and unlike most of the other Soldiers, her gloves extend only to her mid-forearms and has an 8 stars shaped jewel on her teal-colored choker. She wears planet shaped teal colored earrings (which is the shape of Planet Neptune) but the earrings were absent in the 1992 version of Sailor Moon, and present in the Sailor Moon Crystal. She is given specific titles throughout the various series, including Soldier of the Deep Waters (or &quot;Depths&quot; in the English manga), Soldier of Embrace, Soldier of the Sea, and Soldier of Comprehension. Her personality is no different from when she is a civilian, although certain special abilities and powers are unavailable to her in her regular civilian form. Just like her partner, Haruka, Michiru has some precognitive abilities while in her normal form. She is able to prophetically predict who is likely to be the next target of the Death Busters.

Sailor Neptune uses ocean-based attacks (not just water), and carries one of three Talismans carried by the &quot;outer&quot; Sailor Soldiers; Neptune has the Deep Aqua Mirror, which always reveals the truth. She takes a black-and-white approach to her role as a Soldier, one shared by Sailor Uranus, who is virtually always at her side. As she grows stronger, Sailor Neptune gains additional unique special abilities, and at key points her uniform changes to reflect this. The first change takes place in Act 44 of the manga, when she obtains the Neptune Crystal and her outfit becomes similar to that of Super Sailor Moon. She is not given a new title. A similar event takes place in Episode 167 of the anime, and she is given the name Super Sailor Neptune. A third form appears in Act 49 of the manga, unnamed but similar to Eternal Sailor Moon (without wings). In the official visual book for Sailor Moon Eternal, this form was named &quot;Eternal Sailor Neptune&quot;.

===Princess Neptune===
On Silver Millennium, Sailor Neptune was also the princess of her home planet. She was among those given the duty of protecting the Solar System from outside invasion. As Princess Neptune, she dwelt in Triton Castle and wore a sea-green gown. She appears in this form in the original manga Act 48, as well as in supplementary art. It is unknown whether she had a romantic relationship with Princess Uranus at that time.

==Special powers and items==

Even in civilian form, Michiru has some precognitive gifts, as she occasionally states that &quot;the sea is stormy&quot; when there is an evil presence at work. She is not shown using any other special powers in her civilian form, and must first transform into a Sailor Soldier by either raising her hand or using a special device called the Lip Rod in the anime and shouting a special phrase, originally &quot;Neptune Planet Power, Make-up!&quot; In the manga she eventually gains her Neptune Crystal and this phrase changes to evoke &quot;Neptune Crystal Power&quot;. In the anime, although she &quot;does&quot; upgrade to Super Sailor Neptune, the Crystal is never mentioned and her transformation is never shown on screen after the upgrade.

Sailor Neptune&#x27;s powers are inspired by Roman mythology, where Neptune is the god of the sea. She draws energy from the &quot;deep waters&quot; and blasts it at her foes. She is given three major attacks in the series, and although they all have English names (like those of the other Sailor Soldiers), each is also given kanji in the manga to denote the meaning to Japanese readers. For example, her first attack, &quot;Deep Submerge&quot;, is given kanji which translate precisely to and . The intended English pronunciation is given in furigana. This is Sailor Neptune&#x27;s primary attack for most of the anime series.

In the manga, Michiru owns a special hand mirror which supplements her precognition. This turns out to be the Deep Aqua Mirror, one of three powerful Talismans, the other two of which are carried by Sailor Uranus and Sailor Pluto. In the anime, she does not gain the mirror until she is revealed as one of the Talisman bearers; in either case, it is used in her second attack, &quot;Submarine Reflection&quot; . In both the anime and manga, she can use it to launch an extremely powerful and devastating attack. In the anime, Michiru can also use it by dispelling illusions, as seen in the SuperS movie. In the manga, she can also use it for astral projection, and lends it to Chibiusa while she and the other Outer Soldiers are away. Chibiusa invokes the Deep Aqua Mirror&#x27;s strength and power by stating its name and is able to teleport to Sailor Neptune&#x27;s location.

Michiru&#x27;s violin, a Stradivarius worth some five million dollars, is called the Marine Cathédrale and is named after &quot;the temple of the sea&quot;. Aside from playing it in concert, she uses it in her third and final attack, which (like the instrument itself) has a French-inspired name: . This third attack is only used in the manga, and was never shown in the anime. This attack is also used by the evil Sailor Neptune in Act 50, where it is renamed &quot;Galactica Violon Tide&quot;. The Neptune Crystal is perhaps her most important possession, as it is her Sailor Crystal and the source of all her power, which becomes especially important in the fifth story arc. It is given to her by Sailor Saturn.

==Development==
The character of Sailor Neptune was not developed until partway through the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series, after the Sailor Soldiers were well-established. She was created in tandem with Sailor Uranus, as a pair of &quot;complementary but opposite characters&quot;, and meant from the beginning to work alongside Sailor Pluto. Creator Naoko Takeuchi has said that she was shocked by the changes made to Michiru&#x27;s personality in the anime series, but that she was glad fans still liked the character.

Sailor Neptune&#x27;s visual design is intended to evoke images of her element, from the choice of colors to the wavy quality of her hair, which Takeuchi even joked might be thought of as seaweed hair. In street clothes, Michiru is supposed to be an &quot;artist type&quot; and to dress accordingly; in fact, initial drawings are extremely elegant and &quot;adult&quot;, because she was originally intended to be involved in the all-female Takarazuka Revue with Haruka. Although this was not included in the series itself, Takeuchi stated in an interview that she feels Takarazuka is &quot;the maximum level of feminine emancipation,&quot; that as such it was her inspiration for the character of Haruka, and that it seemed natural for Haruka to fall in love with another woman—namely Michiru.

The kanji of Michiru&#x27;s surname translate as and . Together, they constitute most of the name of the planet Neptune in Japanese, . Her given name is in hiragana and so its meaning is not inherent, but the word itself means &quot;to rise&quot; . The packaging of Irwin dolls released in Canada in 1998 called Michiru by the name Nerissa.

===Actresses===

In the Japanese anime series and movies, Michiru Kaioh is voiced by veteran voice actress Masako Katsuki. In the third season of &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, she is voiced by Sayaka Ohara. In the original English dub her name is changed to &quot;Michelle Kaioh&quot; and her voice is provided by Barbara Radecki. Michiru is voiced by Lauren Landa in the Viz Media English dub.

In the stage musicals, Michiru has been played by ten actresses: Kaoru Sakamoto, Chikage Tomita, Miyuki Fuji, Hiroko Tahara, Sara Shimada, Yuhka Asami, Tomoko Inami, Takayo Oyama, Sayaka Fujioka and Ayana Kinoshita. Asami, the longest-running of these actresses, knew nothing about &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; when she was given a role in the musical, but came to greatly admire the character of Michiru after reading the manga and watching the anime. Nao Takagi, who played Sailor Uranus, has stated that certain scenes were specially created just for the two of them.

Michiru does not appear in the live-action series.

==Reception and influence==

The official &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; popularity polls listed Michiru Kaioh and Sailor Neptune as separate characters. In 1994, with fifty one choices, Sailor Neptune was the seventh most popular character, receiving almost eight thousand votes more than Michiru, who was the ninth. In early 1996, with fifty one choices, Michiru was the sixteenth most popular character, and Neptune was the twenty second.

Fan fiction featuring Haruka and Michiru is among the most searched-for fan fiction on the Internet, and Erica Friedman of Yuricon has described Haruka and Michiru as being &quot;one of the most romantic, funny, and fun yuri couples, ever.&quot; In her response to an academic essay on &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; by Mary Grigsby, author Emily Ravenwood compared Michiru and Haruka&#x27;s relationship with Zoisite and Kunzite&#x27;s relationship explaining that &quot;in both cases, the feminine and masculine attributes are highlighted with a heavy hand (deliberate display of stereotypes).&quot; According to her, the contrast between Michiru and Haruka, is not played so burlesque-ly as that of Zoisite and Kunzite, but still is extreme, with Haruka being the &quot;perfect butch&quot; while Michiru &quot;is the classic high femme. She&#x27;s beautiful, she&#x27;s artistically talented, she&#x27;s gracious and has exquisite manners, she even does things with her hair (the only character to do so in the whole show). She&#x27;s never the one driving the car.&quot;

===Censorship===
In an effort to avoid the controversy that a lesbian character in a cartoon aimed towards a younger audience would cause, given the social mores, Haruka and Michiru&#x27;s relationship has been censored in certain countries. In North America, the former English dub stated that Haruka and Michiru are cousins, even going so far as to occasionally state this through characters who should not know such information. However, whether in an attempt to be more faithful to the original Japanese or through failure to edit consistently, several episodes of the former English dub retained a noticeable amount of their casual flirting. Due to the censorship and problematic dubbing, some viewers inferred not only a homosexual relationship between the two girls, but also an incestuous one. It has even been implied that the difficulties in dubbing Haruka and Michiru&#x27;s relationship are part of the reason why there was a gap of several years between the dubbing of the earlier series and the dubbing of &quot;Sailor Moon S&quot;. In Japan, there were also some controversies around the character.

Viz Media and Studiopolis&#x27; English-language redub of the series in 2016 would address the censorship issue by restoring any deleted scenes and preserving the integrity of the original Japanese scripts. In 2019, Viz Media released a new dub of &quot;Sailor Moon Sailor Stars&quot;, but in what they call a &quot;translation error&quot;, they refer to Haruka and Michiru in a booklet as &quot;friends&quot; rather than a lesbian couple. The company later issued an apology on Twitter, in which they acknowledge that the two characters &quot;are not friends, but in fact, partners.&quot;

<doc id="586261" wikidata="Q849923" url="?curid=586261" title="Nieuport 17">
<text>The Nieuport 17 C.1 (or Nieuport XVII C.1 in contemporary sources) is a French sesquiplane fighter designed and manufactured by the Nieuport company during World War I. An improvement over the Nieuport 11, it was a little larger than earlier Nieuports and better adapted to the more powerful engine than the interim Nieuport 16. Aside from early examples, it had the new Alkan-Hamy synchronization gear, permitting the use of a fuselage-mounted synchronised Vickers gun firing through the propeller disc.

At the time of its introduction in March 1916, the type&#x27;s outstanding manoeuvrability and excellent rate of climb gave it a significant advantage over fighters on both sides and was described as &quot;the best pursuit plane of the day&quot;. It was used by many operators and entered service with every Allied power and copies were also operated by the (German Air Service). Mass-produced by several French firms, the Nieuport 17 and its derivatives were built under licence in Italy by Nieuport-Macchi and in Russia by Dux. Unlicensed copies, notably the Siemens-Schuckert D.I and the Euler D.I, were produced in Germany.

The Nieuport 21 and 23 represented relatively minor alterations. Aerodynamic refinement led to the Clerget-powered 17bis. More powerful versions of the Le Rhône rotary engines with detail improvements resulted in the Nieuport 24, 24bis and 27.

==Development==
===Origins===
When Gustave Delage was appointed as the chief designer of Nieuport, in January 1914, a series of sesquiplane designs followed. Nieuport had been famous for wire-braced monoplanes and these had reached the limit of their development. The sesquiplane configuration was adopted by Delage as a compromise between the low drag of a monoplane and the greater strength of a biplane. The first of Delage&#x27;s sesquiplanes was the two-seat Nieuport 10 of 1914, which was followed the next year by the smaller Nieuport 11 single-seater, which in turn was supplemented by the Nieuport 16. The larger engine of the latter aircraft made it nose heavy and increased the wing loading, especially when armed with a synchronised Vickers gun.

Developed in parallel with the conservative Nieuport 16, the Nieuport 17 was slightly larger with longer wings and fuselage, improved aerodynamic form and better balance. It was fitted with the Le Rhône 9J engine and later examples used motors.

===Design===
 
The upper wings of the Nieuport sesquiplanes used a typical structure for the period, with widely spaced spars connected with full chord ribs and compression ribs, cross-braced internally with wire and by riblets on the leading edge. The lower wing&#x27;s single spar was directly below the rear spar of the upper wing and was braced with a characteristic Vee strut. The ribs, composed of ash flanges and limewood webs, featured cut-outs to lighten them. Ailerons were fitted on the top wing only and had increased chord towards the wingtips for improved stall response. They were actuated by a pair of push-pull rods that connected torque tubes running to the ailerons to the control column in the cockpit. The horizontal stabilizer, elevator and rudder were built up from welded diameter steel tube and controls for these were provided via conventional cables and pulleys. The angle of incidence on the wings could be adjusted by ground crew via a single pivot joint arrangement, which was originally intended to allow the lower wing to be rotated for low speed flight on the Nieuport 10, but was never used. No adjustment was provided for the tailplane.

Quite apart from the improvement in the pilot&#x27;s downward view, there were aerodynamic gains from the reduction in area of the lower wing, which on a biplane produces far less lift than the upper wing, yet causes considerable drag. This helped give sesquiplanes a superior climb rate. Unfortunately at very high speeds (at what would now be termed its VNE, or &quot;velocity, never exceed&quot;) the lower wing was prone to flutter, an aerodynamic phenomenon not fully understood at the time. The single spar was behind the centre of lift, which at high speeds could cause the lower wing to twist, increasing the angle of attack until the wing stalled, at which point it would return to its normal position, repeating until the wing snapped or the pilot slowed the aircraft.

British Nieuports were modified at No 2 Aeroplane Supply Depot to alleviate this problem. Late in French service, some N.17s had their lower wings replaced with spares intended for the newer Nieuport 24.

The fuselage of the 17 was built around four ash longerons which tapered from the rectangular sheet steel engine mounting to the rudder post, with the upper longerons bowed around the cockpit, giving most of the fuselage a trapezoid cross section. This was braced with spruce struts held with diagonal bracing wires and steel plate joints. The sides and top of the forward fuselage were covered in light molded plywood panels while the rear fuselage sides were covered in fabric. Behind the pilot was a headrest, molded into the plywood top decking, which was supported by longitudinal stringers. The cowling was made of aluminium, had strengthening ribs and a pair of inset holes to provide ventilation and egress of the engine exhaust underneath. It was faired with the forward fuselage via molded side pieces. A (), resembling a spinner that didn&#x27;t spin, was bolted to the front of the stationary engine crankshaft on some early examples but was generally dispensed with on later machines

Production of the new Alkan-Hamy synchronization gear permitted the wing-mounted Lewis gun on the earliest examples to be replaced with a synchronised Vickers gun mounted on the fuselage to fire through the propeller arc. The standard Royal Flying Corps synchroniser, the Vickers-Challenger gear, was unreliable and unpopular with pilots, so that in British service the over-wing Lewis gun was retained. The Lewis gun was fitted to the new Foster mounting, a curved metal rail which allowed the pilot to slide the gun back to change ammunition drums and to clear jams. Pilots could also aim the gun upwards to shoot into the underside of aircraft above which was used to good effect by several ace pilots.

===Derivatives===

Entering service in May 1916 but not named until September, the Nieuport 21 differed from the 17 primarily in the adoption of the lower powered Le Rhône 9C or Le Rhône 9Ga engine. This increased endurance and reduced wing loading and was useful for a high-altitude bomber escort but it was rarely employed as such. In French and especially Russian service, the 21 was commonly used with the Nieuport 17 in the same general fighter role, although it was also useful as an advanced trainer. The 21 has commonly been mistaken for the earlier Nieuport 11, as both lacked headrests and used the same cowling and engines, particularly when some Nieuport 11s were also fitted with molded fuselage sides. Like the 17, the 21 is larger and can be identified by the flying wires, which restrain the upper wings. On the 11 the flying wires merged to a single point, while on the 21 they ran parallel to different points on the lower fuselage.

The Nieuport 23 was largely the same as the definitive 17, differing mainly in the use of a different machine gun synchronizer. The gun was offset to starboard, the fuel and oil tank arrangement and the center section rigging were changed to suit. Nieuport 23s were operated by both French and British squadrons alongside Nieuport 17s until their replacement by the later Nieuport 24, 24bis and 27.
The more powerful Clerget 9B nine-cylinder rotary engine was used by the Nieuport 17bis, which first appeared late in 1916. The N.17bis had stringers fairing out the fuselage sides compared to the flat sides on the 17. The major user was the British Royal Naval Air Service, which ordered 32 from Nieuport, 50 more being licence-built by the Nieuport &amp; General Aircraft Company. Heavier than the preferred Le Rhône, output from the Clerget rotaries quickly fell below their rated power and the performance of the 17bis suffered accordingly. Armament often included a synchronised Vickers gun with the standard over-wing Lewis.

Related to the 17bis, the Nieuport 23bis combined the aerodynamic improvements of the 17bis but reverted to the Le Rhône. Few were built and the Royal Naval Air Service may have been the sole operator.

A pair of triplanes based on the Nieuport 17 were constructed for testing purposes, one for the French and the other for the British. The narrow chord wings were staggered in an unusual manner, placing the middle wing furthest forward and the top wing furthest aft. No subsequent orders came as a result of these tests. Nieuport later trialled the same layout on the Nieuport 17bis, which was tested by the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service as well, however this also remained a prototype. During flight testing, both types demonstrated favourable climbing characteristics, but were also found to be relatively tail-heavy.

Several of the experimental Berliner Helicopters, named after their German-American inventor Emile Berliner, were manufactured around Nieuport 23 fuselages, including the 1922 and 1923 versions.

==Operational history==
During March 1916, the new Nieuport 17 reached the front to begin replacing the earlier Nieuport 11 and 16 fighters that had been instrumental in ending the Fokker Scourge of 1915. On 2 May 1916, Escadrille N.57 became the first unit entirely equipped with the new model. During the late 1916 and into 1917, the Nieuport 17 equipped every fighter squadron of the . Almost all of the top French aces flew the nimble Nieuport during their flying careers, including Georges Guynemer, Charles Nungesser, Maurice Boyau, Armand Pinsard and René Dorme.

American volunteers of the , converted to the Nieuport 17 from Nieuport 11s and 16s, although only one achieved ace status, Raoul Lufberry.

The Nieuport 17 was ordered by the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service as it was markedly superior to British fighters. RFC squadrons that used Nieuport 17s and 23s as their main equipment included 1, 11, 29, 40 and 60 squadrons while 1, 3 and 4 Wings of the Royal Naval Air Service operated the 17 and the 17bis. Additional units in both services also had small numbers on strength.

Many British Empire air aces flew Nieuport fighters, including the top Canadian ace Billy Bishop, V.C. and Albert Ball, V.C. who often hunted alone in his Nieuport. Mick Mannock V.C. flew Nieuports early in his career with 40 Squadron. His VC award reflected his combat career – including his time on Nieuports. The top-scoring Nieuport ace was Captain Phillip Fletcher Fullard of No. 1 Squadron RFC, who scored 40 kills between May and October 1917, before breaking his leg in a football match.

Italian aces, such as Francesco Baracca, Silvio Scaroni and Pier Piccio, achieved victories while flying Nieuport fighters. In Belgium, the 1st and 5th Belgian were equipped with the Nieuport 17 and 23. Belgian aces flying the type included Andre de Meulemeester, Edmond Thieffry and Jan Olieslagers.

The Imperial Russian Air Service operated large numbers of Nieuports of all types, including the 17, 21 and 23. Being largely reliant on aircraft procured directly from France, there was pressure within Russia to establish the domestic manufacture of fighters and the type was produced under licence however inexperience and the limited availability of trained personnel to assist, and poor quality raw materials limited quality. Many of these were operated on the Eastern Front and during the Russian Civil Wars. Russian Nieuport aces include Alexander Kazakov, who flew the type against the Germans and later against the Bolsheviks.

By mid-1917, the Nieuport fighters were outclassed by new German types such as the Albatros D.III so that the SPAD S.VII had begun to replace the Nieuport fighters in French front line squadrons. The British continued to operate Nieuports until early 1918, when enough Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s had become available to replace them.
Later in its service life, the 17 was operated in large numbers as an advanced trainer. The American Expeditionary Forces purchased 75 Nieuport 17s for training and the French operated a fleet of trainers. The French operated one Nieuport 21 for carrier training during 1920 and 1921 aboard &quot;Bapaume&quot;, a converted French Arras-class aviso, pending the delivery of carrier aircraft such as the Nieuport-Delage NiD.32RH.

Following its retirement from the European theatre, many examples were exported in small numbers for new Air Forces being formed around the world, to be used through the 1920s.

==Copies==
So impressive were the Nieuport fighters in early 1916 that (the German Inspectorate of flying troops) requested their aircraft manufacturers to produce a copy. Retrieved aircraft, detailed drawings and sketches were provided and the Siemens-Schuckert D.I was produced. The copy differed primarily in minor details, was deemed to be satisfactory and went into production, although the SSW D.I was obsolete by the time it went into service and was used mainly as an advanced trainer. Another clone of the Nieuport 17 was the Euler D.I, although development work did not proceed beyond a few prototypes.

Other manufacturers, notably Albatros and Pfalz, explored a sesquiplane configuration in their own fighter designs. The Albatros D.II led to the Albatros D.III and D.V - commonly called &#x27;V-strutters&#x27; by the RFC to distinguish them from the earlier Albatros fighters. As well as the advantages of this layout these types also exacerbated the flutter problem, which was never satisfactorily contained, in spite of strengthening. The Pfalz D.III was also a sesquiplane version of a previous biplane fighter, although it featured a more substantial lower wing with two spars that avoided the flutter problems encountered by single-spar sesquiplanes.

==Survivors and replicas==

A single original example has survived, this being Nieuport 23 &quot;5024&quot;, which has been preserved and following a recent restoration, was placed on static display in the Belgian Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels. The Nieuport 17 has also become a popular aircraft for replica builders. Dedicated kits for the type have been produced, including both 7/8ths scale and full size, and groups of builders have reproduced entire squadrons of aircraft in this manner. Contemporary drawings, sourced from both the original factory and a German technical report on the fighter, have facilitated the construction of various replicas, such as the example on display in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, which was built to the original specifications, while many others have used more modern construction, often using metal tubes to replace much of the wooden structure used on authentic aircraft.

<text>The Fluminense Federal University (Portuguese: &quot;Universidade Federal Fluminense&quot;, UFF, named after the state&#x27;s demonym) is a Brazilian public higher education institution located mainly in Niterói and in other cities of Rio de Janeiro state. It was first established on December 18, 1960, with the name of Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UFERJ), through an integration of different academic colleges in the city of Niterói. On November 5, 1965, the current name became official.

It is considered one of the main centers of excellence in Brazil, ranked in the 17th (out of 68) national position in the &quot;Center for World University Rankings of the best universities&quot; and 889th (out of 1000) world position. UFF is among the top 25 universities in Latin America, according to research published by the &quot;Webometrics Ranking of World Universities&quot;. Besides, UFF has become the sixteenth largest university in the country, the sixth largest public university and the third largest federal university in the country. The university&#x27;s Cinema and Audiovisual major is also a reference in Brazil. Created in 1968, by filmmaker Nelson Pereira dos Santos, the course is an official cultural heritage of the city of Niterói.

== History ==

UFF was established in 1960, with the name Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UFERJ). The university began with the merger of five existing federal institutions in Niterói, three state institutions and two private colleges, becoming a part of the federal government and being renamed Universidade Federal Fluminense (Federal Fluminense University).

After a rough start, with a power struggle due to the institutions’ different administrations, the military government ruling at that time imposed a model structure for the university to its units and departments. Following the country&#x27;s tradition in other institutions at the time, the main aim of the university was academic training, focusing on resources to qualify citizens for professional development. Research had a more formal role, and extension programs had different functions, with the main aim to offer services to the community. Today, these remain the three pillars of the university.

In the 1990s, UFF expanded and began to offer new programs in campuses in different towns in regional areas if Rio de Janeiro state. From these programs, new departments and colleges were established. In the 2000s, these regional units were known as University Centers (Pólos Universitários da UFF).

Its headquarters and the major number of UFF unities are located in the city of Niterói. Besides Niterói, the university has academic unities in other cities inside the Rio de Janeiro state, being the Federal University present in the highest number of municipalities in the country.

<text>The Saunders Roe A.27 London was a British military biplane flying boat built by the Saunders Roe company. Only 31 were built, entering service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1936. Although due for replacement by the outbreak of World War II, they saw some active service pending the introduction of the ultimately unsuccessful Lerwick.

==Development==
The A.27 London was designed in response to the Air Ministry Specification R.24/31 issued for a &quot;General Purpose Open Sea Patrol Flying Boat&quot; and was based on the Saro A.7 Severn. The London and its contemporary, the Supermarine Stranraer, were the last multi-engine, biplane flying-boats to see service with the RAF. The design utilized an all-metal corrugated hull and fabric-covered wing and tail surfaces, with two Bristol Pegasus II radial engines, mounted on the upper wing to keep them clear of spray while taking off and landing.

The first prototype first flew in March 1934 and then went on to serve until 1936 with 209 and 210 Squadrons of the RAF at RAF Felixstowe and Gibraltar respectively.

The first deliveries of production aircraft began in March 1936 with Pegasus III engines, and from the eleventh aircraft onwards the Pegasus X engine was fitted instead and the aircraft&#x27;s designation changed to London Mk.II. Earlier Londons were retrofitted with the Pegasus X and were also given the &quot;Mk.II&quot; designation.

==Operational history==

The London Mk.II model equipped 201 Squadron RAF at RAF Calshot beginning in 1936, replacing Supermarine Southamptons. Others later were delivered in October 1936 to 204 Squadron RAF at RAF Mount Batten, Plymouth, also replacing Southamptons. More were delivered to the same squadron in 1937 to replace Blackburn Perths, and to 202 Squadron RAF at Kalafrana, Malta, replacing Supermarine Scapas, and 228 Squadron RAF at Pembroke Dock.

In 1937–1938 204 Squadron RAF used five Londons equipped with auxiliary external fuel tanks for a long-distance training flight to Australia to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Colony at Sydney, New South Wales. In this configuration, they had a range of 2,600 miles (4,180 km).

At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Londons equipped 201 Squadron RAF, which was by now stationed at Sullom Voe in Shetland, and 202 Squadron RAF at Gibraltar, as well as 240 Squadron RAF at Invergordon, which had re-equipped with Londons in July 1939. These aircraft carried out active patrols over the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Some were fitted with a dorsal fuel tank to increase operational radius. Armament in the form of bombs, depth charges, and naval mines up to a total weight of 2,000 lb (907 kg) could be carried beneath the lower wings.

Gradually, the Londons&#x27; duties were assumed by newer aircraft such as the Lockheed Hudson, while squadrons flying Atlantic and Mediterranean patrols were re-equipped with Short Sunderlands. All were withdrawn from front-line duties by the middle of 1941.

<text>Social philosophy is the study and interpretation of society and social institutions in terms of ethical values rather than empirical relations. Social philosophers emphasize understanding the social contexts for political, legal, moral and cultural questions, and the development of novel theoretical frameworks, from social ontology to care ethics to cosmopolitan theories of democracy, natural law, human rights, gender equity and global justice.

==Subdisciplines==
There is often a considerable overlap between the questions addressed by social philosophy and ethics or value theory. Other forms of social philosophy include political philosophy and jurisprudence, which are largely concerned with the societies of state and government and their functioning.

Social philosophy, ethics, and political philosophy all share intimate connections with other disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities. In turn, the social sciences themselves are of focal interest to the philosophy of social science.

Social philosophy is broadly interdisciplinary, looking at all of phenomenology, epistemology, and philosophy of language from a sociological perspective; phenomenological sociology, social epistemology and sociology of language respectively.

==Relevant issues==

Some social philosophy is concerned with identity, and defining strata that categorize society, for example race and gender. Other social philosophy examines agency and free will, and whether people socialized in a particular way are accountable for their actions.

It also looks at the concepts of property, rights, and authority, examining actions in terms of both ethical values and their wider social effect; it applies situational ethics to broader political concepts.

Sociology of language considers communication in the context of social relations, for example speech acts or performative utterances are social actions in themselves. 

Other relevant issues considered by social philosophy are:
* The will to power
* Modernism and postmodernism
* Cultural criticism

== Social philosophies ==
* Communitarianism
* Conflict theory
* Conservatism
* Critical theory
* Individualism
* Positivism
* Progressivism
* Structural functionalism
* Social constructionism
* Symbolic interactionism

<text>The 1972 UEFA European Football Championship final tournament was held in Belgium. This was the fourth UEFA European Championship, held every four years and endorsed by UEFA. The final tournament took place between 14 and 18 June 1972.

Only four countries played in the final tournament, with the tournament consisting of the semi-finals, a third place play-off, and the final.

The hosts were only announced after the qualifying round, which meant all teams had to participate in the qualification process for the final stage. Belgium was chosen among three candidates; the other bids came from England and Italy, whose teams did not reach the semi-finals.

West Germany won the tournament, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.

==Qualification==
The qualifying round was played throughout 1970 and 1971 (group phase), and 1972 (quarter-finals). There were eight qualifying groups of four teams each, with matches played on a home-and-away basis. The group winners qualified for the quarter-finals, played in two legs, home and away. The winners of the quarter-finals went through to the final tournament.

<doc id="586307" wikidata="Q13424305" url="?curid=586307" title="Remote surgery">
<text>Remote surgery (also known as cybersurgery or telesurgery) is the ability for a doctor to perform surgery on a patient even though they are not physically in the same location. It is a form of telepresence. A robot surgical system generally consists of one or more arms (controlled by the surgeon), a master controller (console), and a sensory system giving feedback to the user. Remote surgery combines elements of robotics, telecommunications such as high-speed data connections and elements of management information systems. While the field of robotic surgery is fairly well established, most of these robots are controlled by surgeons at the location of the surgery. Remote surgery is remote work for surgeons, where the physical distance between the surgeon and the patient is less relevant. It promises to allow the expertise of specialized surgeons to be available to patients worldwide, without the need for patients to travel beyond their local hospital.

==Surgical systems==
Surgical robot systems have been developed from the first functional telesurgery system-ZEUS-to the da Vinci Surgical System, which is currently the only commercially available surgical robotic system. In Israel a company was established by Professor Moshe Schoham, from the faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Technion. Used mainly for &quot;on-site&quot; surgery, these robots assist the surgeon visually, with better precision and less invasiveness to patients. The Da Vinci Surgical System has also been combined to form a Dual Da Vinci system which allows two surgeons to work together on a patient at the same time. The system gives the surgeons the ability to control different arms, switch command of arms at any point, and communicate through headsets during the operation.

==Costs==
Marketed for $975,000, the ZEUS Robot Surgical System was less expensive than the da Vinci Surgical System, which cost $1 million. The cost of an operation through telesurgery is not precise but must pay for the surgical system, the surgeon, and contribute to paying for a year&#x27;s worth of ATM technology which runs between $100,000-$200,000.

==The Lindbergh Operation==

The first true and complete remote surgery was conducted on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean, with a French surgeon (Dr. Jacques Marescaux) in New York City performing a cholecystectomy on a 68-year-old female patient 6,230 km away in Strasbourg, France. It was named Operation Lindbergh, after Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s pioneering transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. France Telecom provided the redundant fiber optic ATM lines to minimize latency and optimize connectivity, and Computer Motion provided a modified Zeus robotic system. After clinical evaluation of the complete solution in July 2001, the human operation was successfully completed on 9/7/2001.

The success and exposure of the procedure led the robotic team to use the same technology within Canada, this time using Bell Canada&#x27;s public internet between Hamilton, Ontario and North Bay, Ontario (a distance of about 400 kilometers). While operation Lindbergh used the most expensive ATM fiber optics communication to ensure reliability and success of the first telesurgery, the follow on procedures in Canada used standard public internet which was provisioned with QOS using MPLS QOS-MPLS. A series of complex laparoscopic procedures were performed where in this case, the expert clinician would support the surgeon who was less experienced, operating on his patient. This resulted in patient receiving the best care possible while remaining in their hometown, the less experienced surgeon gaining valuable experience, and the expert surgeon providing their expertise without travel. The robotic team&#x27;s goal was to go from Lindbergh&#x27;s proof of concept to a real-life solution. This was achieved with over 20 complex laparoscopic operations between Hamilton and North Bay.

==Applications==
Since Operation Lindbergh, remote surgery has been conducted many times in numerous locations. To date Dr. Anvari, a laparoscopic surgeon in Hamilton, Canada, has conducted numerous remote surgeries on patients in North Bay, a city 400 kilometres from Hamilton. Even though he uses a VPN over a non-dedicated fiberoptic connection that shares bandwidth with regular telecommunications data, Dr. Anvari has not had any connection problems during his procedures.

Rapid development of technology has allowed remote surgery rooms to become highly specialized. At the Advanced Surgical Technology Center at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada, the surgical room responds to the surgeon&#x27;s voice commands in order to control a variety of equipment at the surgical site, including the lighting in the operating room, the position of the operating table and the surgical tools themselves. With continuing advances in communication technologies, the availability of greater bandwidth and more powerful computers, the ease and cost-effectiveness of deploying remote surgery units is likely to increase rapidly.

The possibility of being able to project the knowledge and the physical skill of a surgeon over long distances has many attractions. There is considerable research underway in the subject. The armed forces have an obvious interest since the combination of telepresence, teleoperation, and telerobotics can potentially save the lives of battle casualties by providing them with prompt attention in mobile operating theatres.

Another potential advantage of having robots perform surgeries is accuracy. A study conducted at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London, England compared the success of kidney surgeries in 304 dummy patients conducted traditionally as well as remotely and found that those conducted using robots were more successful in accurately targeting kidney stones.

In 2015, another test was conducted on the lag time involved in the robotic surgery. A Florida hospital successfully tested lag time created by the Internet for a simulated robotic surgery in Ft. Worth, Texas, more than 1,200 miles away from the surgeon who was at the virtual controls. The team found out that the lag time in robotic surgeries, were insignificant. Roger Smith, CTO at the Florida Hospital Nicholson Center said that the team had concluded that, telesurgery is something that is possible and generally safe for large areas within the United States.

==Unassisted robotic surgery==
As the techniques of expert surgeons are studied and stored in special computer systems, robots might one day be able to perform surgeries with little or no human input. Carlo Pappone, an Italian surgeon, has developed a software program that uses data collected from several surgeons and thousands of operations to perform the surgery without human intervention. This could one day make expensive, complicated surgeries much more widely available, even to patients in regions which have traditionally lacked proper medical facilities.

==Force-feedback and time delay==
The ability to carry out delicate manipulations relies greatly upon feedback. For example, it is easy to learn how much pressure is required to handle an egg. In robotic surgery, surgeons need to be able to perceive the amount of force being applied without directly touching the surgical tools. Systems known as force-feedback, or haptic technology, have been developed to simulate this. Haptics is the science of touch. Any type of Haptic feedback provides a responsive force in opposition to the touch of the hand. Haptic technology in telesurgery, making a virtual image of a patient or incision, would allow a surgeon to see what they are working on as well as feel it. This technology is designed to give a surgeon the ability to feel tendons and muscles as if it were actually the patient&#x27;s body. However these systems are very sensitive to time-delays such as those present in the networks used in remote surgery.

==Depth perception==
Being able to gauge the depth of an incision is crucial. Humans&#x27; binocular vision makes this easy in a three-dimensional environment. However, this can be much more difficult when the view is presented on a flat computer screen.

==Possible uses==
One possible use of remote surgery is the Trauma-Pod project conceived by the US military under the Defense Advanced Research Agency. This system is intended to aid wounded soldiers in the battlefield by making use of the skills of remotely located medical personnel.

Another future possibility could be the use of remote surgery during long space exploration missions.

==Limitations==
For now, remote surgery is not a widespread technology in part because it does not have sponsorship by the governments. Before its acceptance on a broader scale, many issues will need to be resolved. For example, establishing secure very fast connections between the two sites, establishing clinical protocols, training, and global compatibility of equipment. Another technological limitation is the risk of interference with the communications (hacking). Also, there is still the need for an anesthesiologist and a backup surgeon to be present in case there is a disruption of communications or a malfunction in the robot. Nevertheless, Operation Lindbergh proved that the technology exists today to enable delivery of expert care to remote areas of the globe.

<doc id="586308" wikidata="Q1369015" url="?curid=586308" title="John M. Deutch">
<text>John Mark Deutch (born July 27, 1938) is an American civil servant and physical chemist. He was the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1994 to 1995 and Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) from May 10, 1995, until December 15, 1996. He is an emeritus Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and serves on the boards of directors of Citigroup, Cummins, Raytheon, and Schlumberger. Deutch is also a member of the Trilateral Commission.

==Background==
Deutch was born in Brussels, Belgium, the son of Rachel Felicia (Fischer) and Michael Joseph Deutch. He is of Russian Jewish heritage, and became a United States citizen in 1945. He graduated from the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and economics from Amherst College. In 1961, Deutch earned a Master of Science degree in chemical engineering and, in 1966, he earned a PhD in chemistry, both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He holds honorary degrees from Amherst College, University of Massachusetts Lowell, and Northeastern University.

From 1977 to 1980, he served in several positions at the United States Department of Energy (DOE), including as director of energy research, acting assistant secretary for energy technology, and undersecretary of the department. In 1978, Deutch published two physical chemistry papers (in &quot;Combustion and Flame&quot;, 1978, vol 231 pp. 215–221 and 223-229) on modeling the mechanism of the fuel/air mixture. He served as the provost of MIT from 1985 to 1990. As MIT&#x27;s dean of science and provost, Deutch oversaw the disbanding of the department of applied biological sciences, including its toxicology faculty. Furthermore, in December 2012, he was elected to the Board of Trustees for the MIT-Russia Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology.

==Director of Central Intelligence tenure==
In 1995, President Bill Clinton appointed him Director of Central Intelligence. As Deutch was initially reluctant to accept the appointment, the position was conferred with Cabinet rank, a prerequisite ultimately retained by successor George Tenet through the end of the Clinton administration. At the time of his appointment, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted activist Noam Chomsky, a prominent critic of U.S. foreign policy and of the CIA, as saying, &quot;He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I&#x27;ve ever met in academic life, or any other life... If somebody&#x27;s got to be running the C.I.A., I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s him.&quot;

As head of the CIA, Deutch continued the policy of his predecessor R. James Woolsey to declassify records pertaining to U.S. covert operations during the Cold War.

In 1996, Deutch took the unusual step of traveling to Locke High School in Los Angeles to address reports that the CIA had facilitated the introduction of crack cocaine into Los Angeles. Speaking to a hostile crowd, Deutch denied any connection between the CIA and cocaine traffic in Los Angeles and vowed to open an investigation. The meeting was prompted by allegations published by journalist Gary Webb that connected the CIA to the California cocaine trade and trafficker Danilo Blandón.

Deutch fell out of favor with the Clinton administration because of public testimony he gave to Congress on Iraq. Specifically, Deutch testified that Saddam Hussein was stronger than he had been four years earlier and that the CIA might never be able to remedy the issue. After he won reelection, Clinton replaced Deutch.

Deutch left the CIA on December 15, 1996. Soon after, it was revealed that several of his laptop computers contained classified information wrongfully labeled as unclassified. In January 1997, the CIA began a formal security investigation of the matter. Senior management at CIA declined to fully pursue the security breach. Over two years after his departure, the matter was referred to the Department of Justice, where Attorney General Janet Reno declined prosecution. She did, however, recommend an investigation to determine whether Deutch should retain his security clearance. Deutch had agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor for mishandling government secrets on January 19, 2001, but President Clinton pardoned him on his last day in office, two days before the Justice Department could file the case against him.

==Board memberships and fellowships==

Deutch was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2007. He has been a member of the National Petroleum Council since 2008 and the Secretary of DOE Energy Advisory Board since 2010. In 1988, Deutch was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

==Personal life==
In June 2003, his son Philip Joseph Deutch (from his first marriage), then a managing director and venture capitalist at Perseus LLC, married Marne Levine, who later served as the COO of Instagram.

<doc id="586314" wikidata="Q154334" url="?curid=586314" title="45 Eugenia">
<text>45 Eugenia is a large asteroid of the asteroid belt. It is famed as one of the first asteroids to be found to have a moon orbiting it. It was also the second triple asteroid to be discovered, after 87 Sylvia.

== Discovery ==
Eugenia was discovered on 27 June 1857 by the Franco–German amateur astronomer Hermann Goldschmidt. His instrument of discovery was a 4-inch aperture telescope located in his sixth floor apartment in the 6th Arrondissement of Paris. It was the forty-fifth minor planet to be discovered. The preliminary orbital elements were computed by Wilhelm Forster in Berlin, based on three observations in July, 1857.

The asteroid was named by its discoverer after Empress Eugenia di Montijo, the wife of Napoleon III. It was the first asteroid to be definitely named after a real person, rather than a figure from classical legend.

== Physical characteristics ==
Eugenia is a large asteroid, with a diameter of 214 km. It is an F-type asteroid, which means that it is very dark in colouring (darker than soot) with a carbonaceous composition. Like Mathilde, its density appears to be unusually low, indicating that it may be a loosely packed rubble pile, not a monolithic object. Eugenia appears to be almost anhydrous. Lightcurve analysis indicates that Eugenia&#x27;s pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (−30°, 124°) with a 10° uncertainty, which gives it an axial tilt of 117°. Eugenia&#x27;s rotation is then retrograde, rotating backward to its orbital plane.

== Satellite system ==
=== Petit-Prince ===
In November 1998, astronomers at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, discovered a small moon orbiting Eugenia. This was the first time an asteroid moon had been discovered by a ground-based telescope. The moon is much smaller than Eugenia, about 13 km in diameter, and takes five days to complete an orbit around it.

The discoverers chose the name &quot;Petit-Prince&quot; (formally &quot;(45) Eugenia I Petit-Prince&quot;). This name refers to Empress Eugenia&#x27;s son, the Prince Imperial. However, the discoverers also intended an allusion to the children&#x27;s novella &quot;The Little Prince&quot; by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which is about a young prince who lives on an asteroid.

=== S/2004 (45) 1 ===
A second, smaller (estimated diameter of 6 km) satellite that orbits closer to Eugenia than Petit-Prince has since been discovered and provisionally named S/2004 (45) 1. It was discovered by analyses of three images acquired in February 2004 from the 8.2 m VLT &quot;Yepun&quot; at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Cerro Paranal, in Chile. The discovery was announced in IAUC 8817, on 7 March 2007 by Franck Marchis and his IMCCE collaborators. It orbits the asteroid at about ~700 km, with an orbital period of 4.7 days.

<text>Mu&#x27;an (; Japanese Mokuan Shōtō) (1611–1684) was a Chinese Chan monk who followed his master Ingen to Japan in 1654. Mokuan was from Chuanchow in what was then Fukien Province. He and Sokuhi Nyoitsu were the two disciples most involved in spreading Ingen&#x27;s teachings.

== History ==
Together they founded the Ōbaku Zen school and Mampuku-ji, the school&#x27;s head temple at Uji in 1661. In 1664, Muyan succeeded his master as chief of the temple and in 1671 established another temple called Zuishō-ji at Shirokane, Edo. He is honored as one of the Ōbaku no Sanpitsu.

His work is kept in a variety of museums, including the Smart Museum of Art, University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the British Museum.

<text>Dulles ( ) is an unincorporated area in Loudoun County, Virginia, United States, and is part of the Washington metropolitan area. The headquarters of Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems and ODIN Technologies, as well as the former headquarters of MCI Inc. and AOL are located in Dulles. The National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington forecast office and the National Weather Service&#x27;s Sterling Field Support Center are also both in Dulles.

==Geography==
Dulles covers roughly the southwestern third of Sterling, Virginia (another unincorporated community). The usage of Dulles as a community name began in the mid-1980s when Loudoun County economic development officer Pam Treadwell successfully lobbied the United States Postal Service to allow Sterling businesses and residents to use Dulles as an alternative address. The USPS defines Dulles as an &quot;acceptable&quot; city name for the 20166 ZIP code, whose &quot;recommended&quot; city name is Sterling. Dulles is also the city name for ZIP code 20189.

The addresses for shipping parcels to United States embassies and consulates, as well as their employees worldwide, are located in Dulles.

==Transport==
Washington Dulles International Airport is located partially in Dulles (although its postal address uses the Sterling name instead) and partially in Fairfax County. The community derives its name from the airport; the airport in turn takes its name from former U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (1888–1959).

==Economy==
Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems has its headquarters on Warp Drive in Dulles. AOL had its headquarters at 22000 AOL Way in Dulles. In 2007, AOL announced that it would move its headquarters from Loudoun County to New York City, though it would continue to operate its Virginia offices.

Before its dissolution, FLYi, Inc./Independence Air (originally Atlantic Coast Airlines) was headquartered in Dulles. Prior to its dissolution, MAXjet Airways was headquartered on the grounds of Washington Dulles International Airport and in Dulles. Cryptek was headquartered in Dulles before its acquisition in 2009.

Other companies have offices in Dulles, e.g., Harris IT Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of Harris Corporation.

Dulles Town Center, a large enclosed shopping mall, is also located in the northern part of Dulles.

<text>The Germanenorden (Germanic or Teutonic Order) was an occultist and &quot;völkisch&quot; secret society in early 20th-century Germany.

==History==

The Germanenorden was founded in Berlin in 1912 by Theodor Fritsch and several prominent German occultists including Philipp Stauff, who held office in the Guido von List Society and High Armanen Order as well as Hermann Pohl, who became the Germanenorden&#x27;s first leader. The order was a clandestine movement that wished to create a small but devoted group and was a sister movement to the more open and mainstream Reichshammerbund.

In 1916, during World War I, the Germanenorden split into two parts. Eberhard von Brockhusen became the Grand Master of the &quot;loyalist&quot; Germanenorden. Pohl, previously the order&#x27;s Chancellor, founded a schismatic offshoot: the Germanenorden Walvater of the Holy Grail. He was joined in the same year by Rudolf von Sebottendorff (formerly Rudolf Glauer), a wealthy adventurer with wide-ranging occult and mystical interests. A Freemason and a practitioner of Sufism and astrology, Sebottendorff was also an admirer of Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels. Convinced that the Islamic and Germanic mystical systems shared a common Aryan root, he was attracted by Pohl’s runic lore and became the Master of the Walvater&#x27;s Bavarian province late in 1917. Charged with reviving the province&#x27;s fortunes, Sebottendorff increased membership from about a hundred in 1917 to 1,500 by the autumn of the following year.

The Munich lodge of the Germanenorden Walvater when it was formally dedicated on August 18, 1918, was given the cover name the Thule Society, which is notable chiefly as the organization that sponsored the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP), which was later transformed by Adolf Hitler into the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP).

==Activity==
The Germanenorden had a hierarchical fraternal structure based on Freemasonry. The structure was adopted due to the assumption that Jews engaged in secret organizing, and that it would be best to counter their influence over the German public life by using the same method. The primary concern was to monitor Jewish activity and to be a centre for the distribution of antisemitic material. Secondary concerns involved the assistance between members in business and the circulation of &quot;völkisch&quot; journals, especially Fritsch&#x27;s journal &quot;Hammer&quot;.

Applicants were required to prove their Germanic descent, and if they were married also their wife&#x27;s Germanic descent. Through Bernhard Koerner, Stauff and Brockhusen, the order became imbued with the occult-nationalist ideas of List. Influenced by List&#x27;s Ariosophy, it adopted a swastika superimposed on a cross as its symbol in 1916. The rituals of the order were influenced by theories about the Aryan race, Freemasonry and the operas of Richard Wagner.

<text>Wanfu Temple () is a Buddhist temple on Mount Huangbo in Fuqing, Fujian, China. It is famous as the original temple of Yinyuan Longqi, the temple&#x27;s 33rd abbot and a Chan master. He later travelled to Japan with his disciple Muyan to found the Japanese Ōbaku school of Zen.

Found in 789 by Chan master Zhenggan () in the Tang dynasty (618–907), it was destroyed and rebuilt several times. A modern restoration of the entire temple complex was carried out in 1989 and again in 2016.

Mampuku-ji, head temple of the Ōbaku school, is named after this temple.

==History==
===Tang dynasty===
The temple was first built by Chan master Zhenggan () in 789 in the Tang dynasty (618–907) with the name of Boruo Hall or Bore Hall (). It was enlarged as a temple eight years later. Zhenggan was a disciple of the Six Patriarch of Chan Buddhism Huineng.

In 848, Huangbo Xiyun received ordination as a monk in the temple. After gaining skills and qualifications under Baizhang Huaihai, he returned to Wanfu Temple to taught Chan Buddhism.

===Song dynasty===
During the Shaoxing period (1131–1162) in the Song dynasty (960–1279), Chan master Shanguo () moved to Wanfu Temple from Miyin Temple, Hunan, where he promulgated Buddhist doctrines and delivered Buddhist precepts for over ten years.

===Ming dynasty===
In the 23rd year of Hongwu period in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), namely 1390, under the support of Zhou Xinjian (), monk Daxiu () restored the temple on the original site.

Wanfu Temple was completely destroyed in the battles between Japanese pirates and Ming army. It was subsequently rebuilt by Sun Jianyuan () and Sun Jingyuan () in the late 17th century. The emperor inscribed and honored the name &quot;Wanfu Chan Temple&quot; (), which is still in use now.

In 1637, Yinyuan Longqi was unanimously chosen as the new abbot. He raised funds to establish more than 30 halls and rooms, including the Shanmen, Mahavira Hall, Dharma Hall, Bell tower, Drum tower, etc.

===Qing dynasty===
In 1654, in the 11th year of Shunzhi period of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), under the invitation of Japanese monks, Yinyuan Longqi led monks to go to the east Japan to preach Buddhism. His disciple Xingpei () replaced him as the new abbot.

During the reign of Qianlong Emperor, monk Qingfu () renovated and refurbished the temple.

===Republic of China===
In 1928, a disastrous flood struck the temple and destroyed most of the temple buildings.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
In 1949, the year of the defeat of the Communists over the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War, the whole Wanfu Temple went up into flames in a catastrophic fire. All of the cultural relics, scriptures, historical documents, and other works of art were damaged or destroyed in the disaster. Dharma Hall and Abbot&#x27;s Room were rebuilt in 1957.

In 1979, a Japanese visiting mission led by Yoshii Shimamine () came to the site to worship the cradle of Japanese Ōbaku school of Zen.

Wanfu Temple was designated as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area by the State Council of China in 1983.

In April 1989, the reconstruction project of the temple was launched. The reconstruction took 8 years, and lasted from 1989 to 1997. On December 8, 1997, the newly established temple was consecrated by eminent monks.

In 2016, Cao Dewang (), a well-known entrepreneur in China, donated 250 million yuan (38.4 million U.S. dollar) to redecorate Wanfu Temple.

==Architecture==
The extant buildings were built between 1989 and 1997, which were modeled the traditional architectural style of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The complex include the following halls: Shanmen, Mahavira Hall, Hall of Four Heavenly Kings, Bell tower, Drum tower, Hall of Guru, Dharma Hall, Memorial Hall of Yinyuan Longqi, etc.

<text>Frances Morrell (&quot;née&quot; Frances Maine Galleway; 28 December 1937 – 10 January 2010) was a British Labour politician who led the Inner London Education Authority from 1983 until 1987.

== Life and career ==
Frances Morrell was brought up in York, and educated at that city&#x27;s Queen Anne Grammar School and at Hull University. Much later she undertook an MA at Goldsmiths College, London University. She worked as a schoolteacher from 1960, and married Brian Morrell in 1964. In 1970 she became a Press Officer, working for the Fabian Society and the National Union of Students. This latter role brought her into contact with Tony Benn, then coming to be seen as the leader of the Labour left, and with whom she then agreed on many important issues.

In 1973, Benn invited Morrell to be his political adviser should Labour win the next election. She was Labour candidate for Chelmsford at the February 1974 general election, and served as a Special Adviser to Benn at the Departments of Industry and Energy from 1974 to 1979. Benn was increasingly marginalised as the Parliament went on, but Morrell worked to link him with a network of activists outside Parliament. She was unlucky in failing to be selected as candidate for any of several Labour constituencies at the 1979 general election (among them Birkenhead and Manchester Blackley).

After Labour left office she helped to create the Rank and File Mobilising Committee, through which the left organised to bring changes in the party. In this capacity she was referred to cynically by some in the media: &quot;Private Eye&quot; commented &quot;How typical of Tony Benn to have a hatchet-woman&quot;. The Eye also published a Clerihew: &quot;Frances Morrell / Has done very well / To be leader of the ILEA / Without being black, working class or gay.&quot; In the run-up to the 1981 Greater London Council (GLC) elections she was chosen to fight Islington South and Finsbury, and on election formed part of the GLC&#x27;s left faction in support of Ken Livingstone.

However, Morrell&#x27;s background as a teacher led her to spend most time on the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA), membership of which came with membership of the GLC representing an inner borough. She was chosen as Deputy Leader of the new left leadership of the ILEA under Bryn Davies. She became unsatisfied with his leadership, which she considered weak, and built support for a change through the GLC Women&#x27;s Group; in April 1983 she challenged him and was elected as the new leader.

Under Morrell, the ILEA became concerned with promoting gender equality. The authority was severely criticised for what the right wing regarded as propaganda in the schools it administered. Many of the policies of the Davies leadership were continued, which included the high spending: the ILEA deliberately set an illegally high budget for 1985. The government under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, which was proposing to abolish the GLC, would have wanted to abolish the ILEA as well, but found it was impractical to do so. However, new legislation allowed the Government to limit the ILEA&#x27;s budget, and it did so. The ILEA was helped by a bail-out from the GLC for one year.

The abolition of the GLC in 1986 also meant something had to be done to provide for future elections to the ILEA. It was first suggested that the ILEA could be made up of delegates from the 12 inner London Boroughs, but the Conservative group on the ILEA was strongly against this policy; eventually it was decided that there would be direct elections. Morrell led Labour into the campaign, and with London hostile to the abolition of the GLC, Labour won an easy victory. Morrell was re-elected quite narrowly herself, as the SDP had a strong challenge.

Morrell lost her leadership in 1987 by 23 votes to 22, continuing a tradition of internal deselection established by both her predecessors. She had insisted that teachers who were surplus to requirements at one ILEA school should transfer to another where there was a shortfall, and threatened to dismiss those who refused. She became secretary of the Speaker of the House of Commons&#x27; Commission on Citizenship the next year and a senior research fellow at Queen Mary and Westfield College briefly in 1991–92, before becoming executive director of the Institute for Citizenship Studies.

She was joint chief executive of ArtsInform, which she set up with Linda Payne in 1995 to build relationships between schools and colleges with professional artists and arts organisations.

=== Personal life and death ===
Morrell&#x27;s husband Brian committed suicide in April 2009, and she herself suffered from increasingly poor health. She died from cancer on 10 January 2010, at the age of 72. She was survived by her daughter, Daisy, and brother, Peter.

<doc id="586330" wikidata="Q1941299" url="?curid=586330" title="Mr. Tambourine Man">
<text>&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; is a song written by Bob Dylan, released as the first track of the acoustic side of his March 1965 album &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;. The song&#x27;s popularity led to Dylan recording it live many times, and it has been included in multiple compilation albums. It has been translated into other languages and has been used or referenced in television shows, films, and books.

The song has been performed and recorded by many artists, including the Byrds, Judy Collins, Melanie, Odetta, Alvin and the Chipmunks, and Stevie Wonder among others. The Byrds&#x27; version was released in April 1965 as their first single on Columbia Records, reaching number 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart, as well as being the title track of their debut album, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. The Byrds&#x27; recording of the song was influential in popularizing the musical subgenres of folk rock and jangle pop, leading many contemporary bands to mimic its fusion of jangly guitars and intellectual lyrics in the wake of the single&#x27;s success. Dylan himself was partly influenced to record with electric instrumentation after hearing the Byrds&#x27; reworking of his song during one of their rehearsals at World Pacific Studios in late 1964.

Dylan&#x27;s song has four verses, of which the Byrds only used the second for their recording. Dylan&#x27;s and the Byrds&#x27; versions have appeared on various lists ranking the greatest songs of all time, including an appearance by both on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 best songs ever. Both versions received Grammy Hall of Fame Awards.

The song has a bright, expansive melody and has become famous for its surrealistic imagery, influenced by artists as diverse as French poet Arthur Rimbaud and Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini. The lyrics call on the title character to play a song and the narrator will follow. Interpretations of the lyrics have included a paean to drugs such as LSD, a call to the singer&#x27;s muse, a reflection of the audience&#x27;s demands on the singer, and religious interpretations.

==Composition==
&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was written and composed in early 1964, at the same approximate time as &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;, which Dylan recorded later that spring for his album &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;. Dylan began writing and composing &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; in February 1964, after attending Mardi Gras in New Orleans during a cross-country road trip with several friends, and completed it sometime between the middle of March and late April of that year after he had returned to New York. Nigel Williamson has suggested in &quot;The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan&quot; that the influence of Mardi Gras can be heard in the swirling and fanciful imagery of the song&#x27;s lyrics. Journalist Al Aronowitz has stated that Dylan completed the song at his home, but folk singer Judy Collins, who later recorded the song, has stated that Dylan completed the song at her home. Dylan premiered the song the following month at a May 17 concert at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall.

==Recording==
During the sessions for &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;, in June 1964, with Tom Wilson producing, Dylan recorded &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; with Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott singing harmony. As Elliott was slightly off key, that recording was not used. Later that month he recorded a publisher demo of the song at Witmark Music. More than six months passed before Dylan re-recorded the song, again with Wilson in the producer&#x27;s chair, during the final &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; session on January 15, 1965, the same day that &quot;Gates of Eden&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Alright, Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; were recorded. It was long thought that the four songs were each recorded in one long take. However, in the biography &quot;Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades&quot;, Clinton Heylin relates that the song required six attempts, possibly because of difficulties in working out the playoffs between Dylan&#x27;s acoustic guitar and Bruce Langhorne&#x27;s electric lead. Alternate takes released on Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; collection also reveal that early takes include drummer Bobby Gregg playing a tambourine-heavy  rhythm, but Dylan found this too distracting and opted to continue recording with Langhorne alone. The final take was selected for the album, which was released on March 22, 1965.

In his book &quot;Keys to the Rain: The Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia&quot;, Oliver Trager describes &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; as having a bright, expansive melody, with Langhorne&#x27;s electric guitar accompaniment, which provides a countermelody to the vocals, being the only instrumentation besides Dylan&#x27;s acoustic guitar and harmonica. Author Wilfrid Mellers has written that although the song is in the key of D major, it is harmonized as if it were in a Lydian G major, giving the song a tonal ambiguity that enhances the dreamy quality of the melody. Unusually, rather than beginning with the first verse, the song begins with an iteration of the chorus:

:&quot;Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,&quot;
:&quot;I&#x27;m not sleepy and there is no place I&#x27;m going to.&quot;
:&quot;Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,&quot;
:&quot;In the jingle-jangle morning I&#x27;ll come following you.&quot;

==Interpretations==
William Ruhlmann, writing for the AllMusic web site, has suggested the following outline of the song&#x27;s lyrics: &quot;The time seems to be early morning following a night when the narrator has not slept. Still unable to sleep, though amazed by his weariness, he is available and open to Mr. Tambourine Man&#x27;s song, and says he will follow him. In the course of four verses studded with internal rhymes, he expounds on this situation, his meaning often heavily embroidered with imagery, though the desire to be freed by the tambourine man&#x27;s song remains clear.&quot;

While there has been speculation that the song is about drugs, particularly with lines such as &quot;take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship&quot; and &quot;the smoke rings of my mind&quot;, Dylan has denied the song is about drugs. Though he was smoking marijuana at the time the song was written, Dylan was not introduced to LSD until a few months later. Outside of drug speculation, the song has been interpreted as a call to the singer&#x27;s spirit or muse, or as a search for transcendence. In particular, biographer John Hinchey has suggested in his book &quot;Like a Complete Unknown&quot; that the singer is praying to his muse for inspiration; Hinchey notes that ironically the song itself is evidence the muse has already provided the sought-after inspiration. The figure of Mr. Tambourine Man has sometimes been interpreted as a symbol for Jesus or the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The song may also reference gospel music themes, with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation.

Dylan has cited the influence of Federico Fellini&#x27;s movie &quot;La Strada&quot; on the song, while other commentators have found echoes of the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. Author Howard Sounes has identified the lyrics &quot;in the jingle jangle morning I&#x27;ll come following you&quot; as having been taken from a Lord Buckley recording. Bruce Langhorne, who performs guitar on the track, has been cited by Dylan as the inspiration for the tambourine man image in the song. Langhorne used to play a giant, four-inch-deep &quot;tambourine&quot; (actually a Turkish frame drum), and had brought the instrument to a previous Dylan recording session.

==Other Dylan releases==
The &quot;Bringing it All Back Home&quot; version of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was included on &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; in 1967 and several later Dylan compilation albums, including &quot;Biograph&quot;, &quot;Masterpieces&quot;, and &quot;The Essential Bob Dylan&quot;. The two June 1964 recordings, one with Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott and the other at Witmark Music, have been released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home&quot; and &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos 1962–1964&quot;, respectively. Outtakes from the January 15, 1965, recording session were released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966&quot; in 2015.

The song has been in Dylan&#x27;s live concert repertoire since it was written, usually as a solo acoustic song, and live performances have appeared on various concert albums and DVDs. An early performance, perhaps the song&#x27;s live debut, recorded at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall
on May 17, 1964, appeared on &quot;Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections&quot;, while another early performance, recorded during a songs workshop at the Newport Folk Festival on July 24, 1964, was included in both Murray Lerner&#x27;s film &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot; and the DVD release of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s documentary &quot;No Direction Home&quot;. A live performance at New York&#x27;s Philharmonic Hall dating from October 31, 1964, appeared on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall&quot;. During his appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on July 25, 1965, after he was heckled by acoustic folk music fans during his electric set, Dylan returned to play acoustic versions of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;; this performance of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was included in &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot;.

A live version from Dylan&#x27;s famous May 17, 1966, concert in Manchester, England (popularly but mistakenly known as the Royal Albert Hall Concert) was included on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; Concert&quot;. Dylan&#x27;s August 31, 1969, performance of the song at the Isle of Wight Festival appeared on &quot;Isle of Wight Live&quot;, part of the 4-CD deluxe edition of &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 10: Another Self Portrait (1969–1971)&quot;. Dylan played the song as part of his evening set at the 1971, Concert for Bangladesh, organized by George Harrison and Ravi Shankar, featuring Harrison on electric guitar, Leon Russell on bass, and Ringo Starr on tambourine. That performance was included on &quot;The Concert For Bangladesh&quot; album, although it was excluded from the film of the concert. Another live version, from the Rolling Thunder Revue tour of 1975, was included on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue&quot; and &quot;The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings&quot;, while electric band versions from 1978 and 1981 appeared, respectively, on &quot;Bob Dylan at Budokan&quot; and the Deluxe Edition of &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979–1981&quot;.

In November 2016, all Dylan&#x27;s recorded live performances of the song from 1966 were released in the boxed set &quot;The 1966 Live Recordings&quot;, with the May 26, 1966, performance released separately on the album &quot;The Real Royal Albert Hall 1966 Concert&quot;.

== The Byrds&#x27; version==
===Release===
&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was the debut single by the American rock band the Byrds and was released on April 12, 1965 by Columbia Records, less than a month after Dylan&#x27;s original. The song was also the title track of the band&#x27;s debut album, which was released on June 21, 1965. The Byrds&#x27; version is abridged and in a different key from Dylan&#x27;s original.

The single&#x27;s success initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966, with a number of American and British acts imitating the band&#x27;s hybrid of a rock beat, jangly guitar playing, and poetic or socially conscious lyrics. The single was the &quot;first folk rock smash hit&quot;, and gave rise to the term &quot;folk rock&quot; in the U.S music press to describe the band&#x27;s sound.

This hybrid had its antecedents in the American folk revival of the early 1960s, the Animals&#x27; rock-oriented recording of the folk song &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;, the folk influences present in the songwriting of the Beatles, and the twelve-string guitar jangle of the Searchers and the Beatles&#x27; George Harrison. However, the success of the Byrds&#x27; debut created a template for folk rock that proved successful for many acts during the mid-1960s.

===Conception===
Most of the members of the Byrds had a background in folk music, since Jim McGuinn, Gene Clark, and David Crosby had all worked as folk singers during the early 1960s. They had all spent time, independently of each other, in various folk groups, including the New Christy Minstrels, the Limeliters, the Chad Mitchell Trio, and Les Baxter&#x27;s Balladeers.

In early 1964, McGuinn, Clark, and Crosby formed the Jet Set and started developing a fusion of folk-based lyrics and melodies, with arrangements in the style of the Beatles. In August 1964, the band&#x27;s manager Jim Dickson acquired an acetate disc of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; from Dylan&#x27;s publisher, featuring a performance by Dylan and Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott. Although the band members were initially unimpressed with the song, after McGuinn changed the time signature from Dylan&#x27;s  configuration to  time, they began rehearsing and demoing it. In an attempt to make it sound more like the Beatles, the band and Dickson elected to give the song a full, electric rock band treatment, effectively creating the musical subgenre of folk rock. To further bolster the group&#x27;s confidence in the song, Dickson invited Dylan to a band rehearsal at World Pacific Studios to hear their rendition. Dylan was impressed, enthusiastically commenting, &quot;Wow, you can dance to that!&quot; His endorsement erased any lingering doubts the band had about the song.
During this period, drummer Michael Clarke and bass player Chris Hillman joined, and the band changed their name to the Byrds over Thanksgiving 1964. Band biographer Johnny Rogan has remarked that the two surviving demos of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; dating from this period feature an incongruous marching band drum part from Clarke, but overall the arrangement is very close to the later single version.

===Production===
The master take of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was recorded on January 20, 1965, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, before the release of Dylan&#x27;s own version. The song&#x27;s jangling, melodic guitar playing (performed by McGuinn on a 12-string Rickenbacker guitar) was immediately influential and has remained so to the present day. The group&#x27;s complex vocal harmony work, as featured on &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, became another major characteristic of their sound. Due to producer Terry Melcher&#x27;s initial lack of confidence in the Byrds&#x27; musicianship, as a result of them not having gelled musically yet, McGuinn was the only Byrd to play on both &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and its B-side, &quot;I Knew I&#x27;d Want You&quot;. Rather than using band members, Melcher hired the Wrecking Crew, a collection of top L.A. session musicians (listed here), who (with McGuinn on guitar) provided the backing track over which McGuinn, Crosby, and Clark sang. By the time that sessions for their debut album began in March 1965, Melcher was satisfied that the band was competent enough to record its own musical backing. Much of the track&#x27;s arrangement and final mixdown was modeled after Brian Wilson&#x27;s production work for the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot;.

The Byrds&#x27; recording of the song opens with a distinctive, Bach-inspired guitar introduction played by McGuinn and then, like Dylan&#x27;s version, goes into the song&#x27;s chorus. Although Dylan&#x27;s version contains four verses, the Byrds perform only the song&#x27;s second verse and two repeats of the chorus, followed by a variation on the song&#x27;s introduction, which then fades out. The Byrds&#x27; arrangement of the song had been shortened during the band&#x27;s rehearsals, at the suggestion of Jim Dickson, in order to accommodate commercial radio stations, which were reluctant to play songs that were more than two-and-a-half minutes long. As a result, while Dylan&#x27;s version is five-and-a-half minutes long, the Byrds&#x27; version runs just short of two-and-a-half minutes. The lead vocal on the Byrds&#x27; recording of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was sung by McGuinn, who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day, somewhere between the vocal sound of John Lennon and Bob Dylan. The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions, as he told Rogan in 1997: &quot;I was singing to God and I was saying that God was the Tambourine Man and I was saying to him, &#x27;Hey, God, take me for a trip and I&#x27;ll follow you.&#x27; It was a prayer of submission.&quot;

===Reception===
The single reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the first recording of a Dylan song to reach number 1 on any pop music chart. In 2009, the band&#x27;s bassist Chris Hillman gave Bob Eubanks, a DJ on KRLA and later the host of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, credit for originally breaking the song on the radio in L.A.

Upon release, &quot;Record World&quot; picked it as its &quot;Sleeper of the Week&quot; and called it a &quot;funky and slow treatment of the Bob Dylan tune that has a lot to say. Moody and different treatment from a group going places.&quot; Band biographer Christopher Hjort has remarked that it is surprising that neither &quot;Billboard&quot; or &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazines reviewed the single, considering the efforts Columbia put into promoting the record. In the UK, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; described the single as, &quot;A Bob Dylan song of uncommon charm. Group is American, folksy and five-strong. Busy mandolin-style [&quot;sic&quot;] backing. Song is the big selling point, for sure.&quot; In his review for &quot;Music Echo&quot;, critic Brian Harvey described it as &quot;a folksy, guitar twangy, medium tempo swinger. It&#x27;s a busy number with lots of echo. Lead voice tells the story and has vocal group backing in the attractive chorus. The melody sticks even after one play.&quot;

Critic William Ruhlmann has argued that in the wake of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, the influence of the Byrds could be heard in recordings by a number of other Los Angeles-based acts, including the Turtles, the Leaves, Barry McGuire, and Sonny &amp; Cher. In addition, author and music historian Richie Unterberger sees the influence of the Byrds in recordings by the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and Love, while author John Einarson has said that both the Grass Roots and We Five enjoyed commercial success by emulating the Byrds&#x27; folk rock sound. Unterberger also feels that, by late 1965, the Beatles were assimilating the sound of the Byrds into their &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album, most notably on the songs &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;. Both Unterberger and author Peter Lavezzoli have commented that Dylan himself decided to record with electric instrumentation on his 1965 album &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; in part due to the influence of the Byrds&#x27; rock adaptation of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;.

As the 1960s came to a close, folk rock changed and evolved away from the jangly template pioneered by the Byrds, but, Unterberger argues, the band&#x27;s influence could still be heard in the music of Fairport Convention. Since the 1960s, the Byrds&#x27; jangly, folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music, with authors such as Chris Smith, Johnny Rogan, and Mark Deming, noting the band&#x27;s influence on various acts including Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., the Long Ryders, the Smiths, the Bangles, the Stone Roses, Teenage Fanclub, and the La&#x27;s.

In addition to appearing on the Byrds&#x27; debut album, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; is included on several Byrds&#x27; compilation and live albums, including &quot;The Byrds Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971&quot;, &quot;The Very Best of The Byrds&quot;, &quot;The Essential Byrds&quot;, &quot;The Byrds Play Dylan&quot;, and the live disc of The Byrds&#x27; &quot;(Untitled)&quot; album. The Byrds&#x27; version of the song appears on compilation albums that include hit songs by multiple artists. Two earlier demo recordings of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, dating from the World Pacific rehearsal sessions, can be heard on the Byrds&#x27; archival albums &quot;Preflyte&quot;, &quot;In the Beginning&quot;, and &quot;The Preflyte Sessions&quot;.

=== Personnel ===

According to Christopher Hjort:

The Byrds
*Roger McGuinnlead vocal, twelve-string electric guitar
*Gene Clarkharmony vocal
*David Crosbyharmony vocal

Additional musicians
*Hal Blainedrums
*Jerry Coleguitar
*Larry Knechtelbass guitar
*Bill Pitmanguitar

Note
*On the final recording, Leon Russell&#x27;s electric piano contribution was mixed out, and Hjort writes that Cole and Pitman&#x27;s guitars are &quot;barely audible&quot;. Jim Dickson, the Byrds&#x27; manager, suggests that Clark&#x27;s harmony vocal was mixed out and is only faintly audible due to bleed.

==Other recordings==
&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; has been performed and recorded by many artists and in different languages over the years, including at least thirteen versions recorded in 1965 alone. The Brothers Four recorded a commercial version before the Byrds, but were unable to release it due to licensing issues. Odetta included her version of the song on her album &quot;Odetta Sings Dylan&quot;, released early March 1965. Notable recordings of the song have been made by Judy Collins, Stevie Wonder, the Four Seasons, the Barbarians, and Chad and Jeremy. Other artists who have recorded the song include Alvin and the Chipmunks (1965), Glen Campbell (1965), the Beau Brummels (1966), the Lettermen (1966), Kenny Rankin (1967), Melanie (1968), Joni Mitchell (1970), Gene Clark (1984) and Crowded House (1989). William Shatner recorded a spoken-word cover of the song for his 1968 album &quot;The Transformed Man&quot;.

A reunited line-up of the Byrds, featuring Roger McGuinn, Chris Hillman, and David Crosby, performed &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; with Dylan at a Roy Orbison tribute concert on February 24, 1990. This live performance of the song was included on the 1990 box set &quot;The Byrds&quot;. At the October 1992 Bob Dylan 30th anniversary tribute concert at Madison Square Garden, McGuinn performed the song, backed by Tom Petty, Mike Campbell, and Benmont Tench, among others.

==In creative works==
&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; has been referenced in books and film, including Tom Wolfe&#x27;s non-fiction novel &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;, Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Carrie&quot;, the film &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, and the documentary film &quot;&quot;. The subject of the latter film, journalist Hunter S. Thompson, had &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; played at his funeral and dedicated his novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; to Dylan and the song. Ann Hui&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Song of the Exile&quot; begins with Maggie Cheung riding a bicycle through the streets of London while a street performer plays the song. The 2013 John Craigie song, &quot;I Wrote Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, is about a person that Craigie met in New Orleans who claimed to have written the original lyrics to &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Byrds&#x27; version of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was listed as the number 79 song on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and Dylan&#x27;s version was ranked number 106. It is one of three songs to place twice, along with &quot;Walk This Way&quot; by both Aerosmith and Run-DMC with Perry and Tyler, and &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; by both Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley. The Byrds&#x27; version was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998, and Dylan&#x27;s version was honored with the same award in 2002.

In 1989 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Byrds&#x27; version of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; as the number 86 single of the prior 25 years. That same year, music critic Dave Marsh listed it as number 207 in his list of the top 1001 singles ever made. In 1999, National Public Radio in the United States listed this version as one of the 300 most important American records of the 20th century. In the UK, music critic Colin Larkin listed the Byrds&#x27; version as the number 1 single of all time. Other UK publishers that have listed this song as one of the top songs or singles include &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, and &quot;Sounds&quot;. Australian music critic Toby Creswell included the song in his book &quot;1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them&quot;.

In a 2005 readers&#x27; poll reported in &quot;Mojo&quot;, Dylan&#x27;s version of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was listed as the number four all-time greatest Bob Dylan song, and a similar poll of artists ranked the song number 14. In 2002, &quot;Uncut&quot; listed it as the number 15 all-time Dylan song.

<text>Bosra (), formerly Bostra () and officially called Busra al-Sham (), is a town in southern Syria, administratively belonging to the Daraa District of the Daraa Governorate and geographically part of the Hauran region.
Bosra is an ancient city mentioned in 14th century BC Egyptian sources. A key Nabatean city, it became the prosperous provincial capital of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea following the dissolvement of the Nabatean kingdom. With the advent of Christianity, Bostra flourished as a Metropolitan Archbishopric, under the jurisdiction of Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East. It also became a Latin Catholic titular see and the episcopal see of a Melkite Catholic Archeparchy. 

Throughout its history under various Muslim rulers, the city maintained its strategic importance as Syria&#x27;s southern gateway. It attracted attention from Damascus&#x27; rulers and was governed by various lords, serving as a hub for Islamic learning and endowments. However, it declined into a village during the Ottoman era, only to be revitalized in the 20th century with the construction of the Hijaz railway and due to growing archaeological interest, later prompting tourism-focused development by the Syrian government. Today, it is a major archaeological site and has been declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Bosra had a population of 19,683 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the &quot;nahiyah&quot; (&quot;subdistrict&quot;) of Bosra which consisted of nine localities with a collective population of 33,839 in 2004. Bosra&#x27;s inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslim, although the town has a small Shia Muslim community.

== History ==

Bosra was the first Nabatean city in the 2nd century BC. The Nabatean Kingdom was conquered by Cornelius Palma, a general of Trajan, in 106 AD.

According to John Malalas, it was called Bostra () after Bostras, a Roman general who was sent into the country.

=== Roman and Byzantine era ===
Under the Roman Empire Bosra was renamed &quot;Nova Trajana Bostra&quot; and was the residence of the legio III &quot;Cyrenaica&quot;. It was made capital of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea. The city flourished and became a major metropolis at the juncture of several trade routes, in particular the Via Traiana Nova, a Roman road that connected Damascus to the Red Sea. It became an important centre for food production and during the reign of Emperor Philip the Arab Bosra began to mint its own coins. The two Councils of Arabia were held at Bosra in 246 and 247 AD.

By the Byzantine period, which began in the 5th century, Christianity became the dominant religion in Bosra (&quot;Βόσρα&quot; in Greek-Byzantine). The city became a Metropolitan archbishop&#x27;s seat (see below) and a large cathedral was built in the 6th century. Bosra was conquered by the Sasanian Persians in the early 7th century but was recaptured during the Byzantine reconquest.

===Islamic era===
Bosra played an important part in the early life of Muhammad, as described in the entry for the Christian monk Bahira. The forces of the Rashidun Caliphate under general Khalid ibn al-Walid captured the city from the Byzantines in the Battle of Bosra in 634. Throughout Islamic rule, Bosra would serve as the southernmost outpost of Bilad al-Sham, its prosperity being mostly contingent on the political importance of that city. Bosra held additional significance as a center of the pilgrim caravan between Damascus and the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the destinations of the annual &quot;hajj&quot; pilgrimage. Early Islamic rule did not alter the general architecture of Bosra, with only two structures dating to the Umayyad era (721 and 746) when Damascus was the capital of the Caliphate. As Bosra&#x27;s inhabitants gradually converted to Islam the Roman-era holy sites were utilized for Muslim practices. In the 9th-century Ya&#x27;qubi wrote that Bosra was the capital of the Hauran province.

After the end of the Umayyad era in 750, major activity in Bosra ceased for around 300 years until the late 11th-century. In the last years of Fatimid rule, in 1068, a number of building projects were commissioned. With the advent of Seljuk rule in 1076, increasing focus was paid to Bosra&#x27;s defenses. In particular, the Roman theater was transformed into a fortress, with a new floor added to the interior staircase tower. With the coming to power of the Burid dynasty in Damascus, the general Kumushtakin was allotted the entire Hauran plain as a fief by the &quot;atabeg&quot; Tughtakin. Under Kumushtakin, efforts to enhance the Muslim nature of the city increased with the construction of a number of Islamic edifices. Of these projects was the restoration of the Umari Mosque, which had been built by the Umayyads in 721. Another mosque commissioned was the smaller al-Khidr Mosque built at the northwestern part of the city, which was established under Kumushtakin, in 1134. Kumushtakin also had a &quot;madrasa&quot; constructed alongside the Muslim shrine honoring the &quot;mabrak an-naqa&quot; (&quot;camel&#x27;s knees&quot;), which marked the imprints of the camel the prophet Muhammad rode on when he entered Bosra in the early 7th-century. In 1147, King Baldwin III of Jerusalem led a Crusader force to capture the city, however, his attempt was thwarted, as the Damascene army led by Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Unur managed to garrison into Bosra&#x27;s citadel.

A golden age of political and architectural activity in Bosra began during the reign of Ayyubid sultan al-Adil I (1196–1218). One of the first architectural developments in the city was the construction of eight large external towers in the Roman theater-turned-fortress. The project began in 1202 and were completed in 1253, towards the end of the Ayyubid period. The two northern corner towers alone occupied more space than the remaining six. After al-Adil&#x27;s death in 1218, his son as-Salih Ismail inherited the fief of Bosra who resided in its newly fortified citadel. During Ismail&#x27;s rule, Bosra gained political prominence. Ismail used the city as his base when he claimed the sultanate in Damascus on two separate occasions, reigning between 1237–38 and 1239–45.

===Ottoman era===
In 1596 Bosra appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as &quot;Nafs Busra&quot;, being part of the &quot;nahiyah&quot; of Bani Nasiyya in the Qada of Hauran. It had a Muslim population consisting of 75 households and 27 bachelors, and a Christian population of 15 households and 8 bachelors. Taxes were paid on wheat, barley, summer crops, fruit- or other trees, goats and/or beehives and water mill.

According to the 1914 Ottoman population statistics, the district of Busra had a total population of 26.355, consisting of 22.485 Muslims, 3.096 Orthodox Greeks, 594 Catholic Greeks and 180 Protestants.

===Modern era===
Today, Bosra is a major archaeological site, containing ruins from Roman, Byzantine, and Muslim times, its main feature being the well preserved Roman theatre. Every year there is a national music festival hosted in the main theatre.

Significant social and economic changes have affected Bosra since the end of the French Mandate in 1946. While up until the 1950s the shopkeepers of Bosra were from Damascus, since then most shop owners are residents of the town. In the late Ottoman era and the French Mandate period, the agricultural relationship was between the small landowner and the sharecroppers, since agrarian reforms in the late 1950s and 1960s, the relevant relationship has been between the landowners and the wage laborers. Many of its residents have found work in the Gulf Cooperation Council states, sending proceeds to their relatives in Bosra. Social changes together with increased access to education have largely diminished the traditional clan life according to historian Hanna Batatu.

During the presidency of Hafez al-Assad (1970–2000), Bosra and the surrounding villages were left largely outside of government interference and, for the most part, were politically dominated by members of the prominent al-Mokdad clan who served as intermediaries of sorts between the residents of the town and the governor of Daraa and the Ba&#x27;ath Party branch secretary.

On 14 October 2012, there was intense gunfire from government forces stationed at checkpoints on the main road running through the town. On 13 November 2012, fierce fighting was reported in the east side of the town. By January 2013, after 22 months of conflict amid the ongoing Syrian Civil War, some refugees fleeing Bosra spoke of ever-escalating violence with many bodies being left in the streets during the violence. On 15 January 2013, it was reported that the citadel was used by the army to shell the town on a daily basis. Since the beginning of February 2014 the city was under the control of the Syrian Army. However, on 31 January 2015, the Army&#x27;s 5th Division confronted a contingent from the rebels near the famous Roman theater – fierce firefights broke out between the groups. On 1 February 2015, the Army forces shelled areas in the eastern neighborhood of the town. On 25 March 2015, Syrian rebels seized the town, ousting Syrian soldiers and allied militiamen after four days of intense battle.

Bosra was recaptured by the Syrian Arab Army on 2 July 2018, following the surrender of the rebel forces. The recapture was a part of the Daraa Offensive, which has involved the surrender and/or reconciliation of many rebel groups in the area.

== Landmarks==

Of the city which once counted 80,000 inhabitants, there remains today only a village settled among the ruins. The 2nd-century Roman theatre of Bosra, constructed probably under Trajan, is the only monument of this type with its upper gallery in the form of a covered portico which has been integrally preserved. It was fortified between 481 and 1231.

Further, Nabatean and Roman monuments, Christian churches, mosques and Madrasahs are present within the half-ruined enceinte of the city. The structure of the cathedral, a central plan with eastern apses flanked by 2 sacristies, exerted a decisive influence on the evolution of Christian architectural forms, and to a certain extent on Islamic style. Al-Omari Mosque of Bosra is one of the oldest surviving mosques in Islamic history.

Close by are the Kharaba Bridge and the Gemarrin Bridge, both Roman bridges.

==Climate==
Bosra has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;). Rainfall is higher in winter than in summer. The average annual temperature in Bosra is . About of precipitation falls annually.

== Demographics ==
In the late 1990s, Bosra had an estimated population of 12,000. Its population increased to 19,683 according to the 2004 census by the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics. The population of its metropolitan area was 33,839.

Bosra&#x27;s inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims and are mostly divided between seven major clans. The leading clan is the al-Miqdad who&#x27;s members immigrated to Bosra from al-Suwayda in the mid-18th-century. During this era they also dominated the nearby villages of Ghasm, Maaraba and Samaqiyat. However, the oldest clan of Bosra are the Hamd, a largely fair-skinned people, many members of which have blond hair and blue eyes. They claim to be descendants of the ancient Roman governor of Bosra, although other townspeople believe they are of Crusader origins. Regarding land ownership, the Hamd clan owns around 1,000 hectares in the town while the al-Miqdad clan owns roughly 12,000. The latter&#x27;s members were historically influential in the Hauran region and beyond, having had one of their own in the Ottoman parliament of Abdul Hamid II in Constantinople during the Young Turks period and in the Syrian parliament during the French Mandate period. As of the late 1990s, members of the al-Miqdad clan occupied the positions of mayor, the chief imam of the main al-Omari Mosque, the chief of the town&#x27;s bureau of antiquities as well as manager of Bosra&#x27;s carpet workshop and the owner of the principal coffeehouse. While their members traditionally resided in the eastern quarter of old Bosra, they are currently prevalent throughout the town.

Bosra also has a small Shia Muslim community of some fifty families. According to Palestinian American historian Hanna Batatu, the Shia inhabitants of Bosra were &quot;relatively recent arrivals,&quot; and immigrated to the town from the city of Nabatieh in South Lebanon. Most of the working members of the Shia community are artisans or laborers. Batatu also asserts that social changes in Bosra since Syrian independence have led to tribal diffusion, with intermarriage between the clans and between the Sunni and Shia communities having increased significantly.

<doc id="586345" wikidata="Q1119089" url="?curid=586345" title="Unrestricted submarine warfare">
<text>Unrestricted submarine warfare is a type of naval warfare in which submarines sink merchant ships such as freighters and tankers without warning. The use of unrestricted submarine warfare has had significant impacts on international relations in regard to both the First World War and the Second World War. Its history has been dominated by German decision making.

There have been attempts to limit the use of unrestricted naval warfare, with some dating back to before the turn of the 20th century as an extension of rules for surface raiders. While initially submarines operated successfully by attacking on the surface using deck guns, attacking without warning while submerged reduces the opportunity for the target to escape or defend itself if armed.

== History ==
Customary naval law (specifically, so called cruiser rules) specified that while enemy warships may be attacked freely, civilian and neutral ships can only be interfered with if carrying contraband (announced previously in a contraband list), and the lives of the crew should be protected. Formal limitations on warfare at sea date back to the 1899 Hague Convention.

However, the Imperial German navy was heavily criticised internally by high level officials for their relative inactivity at the start of WWI. To boost the role of the navy, and buoyed by early successes of U-boat warfare, Admiral Tirpitz and Admiral von Pohl suggested a plan whereby U-boats, given a free hand to attack shipping, could potentially force Britain into a &quot;concillatory mood&quot; in as few as six weeks. The admirals appealed to public opinion through press interviews, posing the submarines as &quot;miracle weapons&quot;, despite the extremely small number of vessels available. It was believed that a &quot;shock effect&quot; would cause shipping to cease, and that neutrals would judge the campaign a reasonable reprisal for the British naval blockade. Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg accepted this strategy on February 1, 1915, and a directive issued the next day, with a public announcement on the 4th.
This first campaign was not fully unrestricted as it was aimed at Allied vessels, with neutral shipping officially not to be targeted. Many submarine commanders also chose to adhere to cruiser rules anyway. However, the German Admiralty encouraged the U-boats to attack without warning and minimise efforts at identifying targets, as &quot;accidental&quot; sinking of neutral vessels was viewed to have a useful deterrent effect. In the end, the German campaign did not have a significant impact on Britain&#x27;s goods traffic, but took a heavy civilian toll, including to neutrals. In the most dramatic episode they sank in May 1915 in a few minutes, killing over a hundred American passengers. In the face of US anger, German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg obtained a secret directive to exclude passenger vessels from being targeted and to make strenuous measures to avoid striking neutral vessels, a measure made into a formal and public suspension of unrestricted warfare after the sinking of in August 1915. Submarines operated under prize rules for 1916 - indeed even during 1915 the majority of attacks were made on the surface.

Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, chief of the Imperial Admiralty staff, argued successfully in early 1917 to resume unrestricted attacks, at a greater scale than 1915 and thus hopefully successfully starve the British into surrender. The German high command realized the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare meant war with the United States but calculated that American mobilization would be too slow to stop a German victory on the Western Front. The decision made by Germany became one of the &quot;trigger mechanisms&quot; causing the United States, who were previously neutral, to join the war in favour of the British. While initially successful, the U-boats would once again fall short of the hopes of the German Admiralty.

After World War I, there was a strong push to construct international rules prohibiting submarine attacks on merchant ships. In 1922 the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France and Italy signed the Washington Treaty on Poison Gas and Submarines, to so restrict the use of submarines as to make them useless as commerce raiders. France did not ratify, so the treaty did not go into effect.

In 1936, states signed the London Protocol on Submarine Warfare. To be deemed acceptable, naval attacks needed to follow prize rules, which called for warships to search merchantmen and place crews in &quot;a place of safety&quot; before sinking them.

Interwar prohibitions on unrestricted submarine warfare have been described as being too unspecified, thus leading to disagreements over how to interpret the rules and agreements. For example, it was unclear what differentiated merchant ships from military ships, in particular given that Britain wanted to retain the rights to arm its merchants. Furthermore, it was considered impractical for small submarines to take on the crews of noncombatant ships due to a lack of space. Crews could be placed in emergency boats, but there was disagreement as to how safe that was.

Prior to World War II, 48 states had accepted the prohibitions on unrestricted submarine warfare, including the great power combatants during World War II. However states rapidly abandoned these restrictions: Mostly significantly Germany with War Order No. 154, and the US from the start of the War in the Pacific.

== Instances ==
There have been four campaigns of unrestricted submarine warfare, one in World War I and three in World War II:
#The U-boat campaign of World War I, waged intermittently by Germany between 1915 and 1918 against Britain and her allies. One of the most infamous acts was on May 7, 1915, when U-boat deliberately torpedoed the British Cunard luxury liner RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. Germany&#x27;s resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917, together with the Zimmermann Telegram, brought American entry into World War I on the British side.
#The Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. Between 1939 and 1945, it was waged between Nazi Germany and the Allies and also from 1940 to 1943 between Fascist Italy and the Allies.
#The Baltic Sea Campaigns on the Eastern Front, during World War II. Between 1941 and 1945, especially from 1942, it was waged between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, primarily in the Baltic Sea.
#The Pacific War during World War II, between 1941 and 1945, waged between the Allies (especially the US Navy) and the Japanese Empire.

The four cases were attempts to impose a naval blockade on countries, especially those heavily dependent on merchant shipping to supply their war industries and feed their populations (such as Britain and Japan). Of these, the US submarine effort was by far the most successful, working together with mines to reduce the Japanese merchant fleet to less than a quarter its initial tonnage.

<text>Gerald Theron Campion (23 April 1921 – 9 July 2002) was an English actor. He is best remembered for his role as Billy Bunter in a 1950s television adaptation (&quot;Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School&quot;) of books by Frank Richards (Charles Hamilton).

==Biography==

His father Cyril Theron Campion (1894–1961) – a playwright and screenwriter – and Blanche Louise Tunstall née Bear (1890–1933) – a first cousin of Charlie Chaplin – married in 1920 in London. Campion was born in Bloomsbury, London, an only child.

He won a place at RADA at age 15, and appeared in numerous films and television programmes – mostly comedies. In 1937, he appeared in Tavs Neiiendam&#x27;s radio play &quot;Inspiration to a Poet&quot; on the BBC Home Service.

His only major success was as Bunter, a juvenile role he played successfully despite being much older than his character (he was 40 when the series ended). Campion later reprised the role (now Lord Bunter of Hove, who had succeeded in betting shops and property) in the BBC Radio 7 series &quot;Whatever Happened to ...?&quot; in the episode that speculated on whether Bunter&#x27;s form master at Greyfriars School, Horace Henry Samuel Quelch, became a secret agent.

In 1979, he recorded an appearance in &quot;Shada&quot;, a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story which was not completed in its intended form.

After dropping out of acting, Campion ran clubs and restaurants in London&#x27;s Soho, the best known of which is Gerry&#x27;s, a long running private members&#x27; club attracting a mainly theatrical membership.

==Personal life==
Campion&#x27;s first marriage, with Jean M Sherman (Simmonds) (b. 1925) in London in 1947, ended in divorce in 1972. They had three children: Anthea (a singer who married composer Thomas Rajna); Anthony, born in 1948; and Angelica, born in 1962. His second marriage, with Susan (Suzie) Marks in 1973, ended with his death.

Campion lived in Wittersham, Kent for many years. He and his wife Suzie moved to France in 1991. He died in 2002 aged 81 in Agen, Aquitaine, France.

<doc id="586353" wikidata="Q2925426" url="?curid=586353" title="Tailed frog">
<text>The tailed frogs are two species of frogs in the genus Ascaphus, the only taxon in the family Ascaphidae . The &quot;tail&quot; in the name is actually an extension of the male cloaca. The tail is one of two distinctive anatomical features adapting the species to life in fast-flowing streams. These are the only North American frog species that reproduce by internal fertilization. They are among the most primitive known families of frogs.

Its scientific name means &#x27;without a spade&#x27;, from the privative prefix &quot;a-&quot; and the Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; (, &#x27;spade, shovel&#x27;), referring to the metatarsal spade, which these frogs do not have.

==Taxonomy==
Until 2001, the genus was believed to be monotypic, the single species being the tailed frog (&quot;Ascaphus truei&quot; Stejneger, 1899). However, in that year, Nielson, Lohman, and Sullivan published evidence that promoted the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (&quot;Ascaphus montanus&quot;) from a subspecies to its own species. Since then, the former species has been formally called the coastal tailed frog.

The genus &quot;Ascaphus&quot;, through mtDNA comparisons, has been grouped into a clade with the genus &quot;Leiopelma&quot; creating a sister taxon to all modern anurans. 

==General morphology==

The existence of the visible &quot;tail&quot; appendage makes this frog family distinct from all other frogs. It is usually classified in the ancient frog suborder Archaeobatrachia and further organized into a basal clade with Leiopelma that is considered a sister taxon to all other frogs. 

The &quot;tail&quot; is found only in males, and is actually part of the cloaca, used to insert sperm into the female during mating. This anatomical feature improves breeding success by minimizing loss of sperm in the turbulent, fast-flowing streams inhabited by this species. Thus, the tailed frogs exhibit internal fertilisation, rather than the external fertilisation found in other frogs. 

Ascaphidae and Leiopelmatidae are primitive to almost all other frogs in having nine amphicoelous vertebrae and a caudalipuboischiotibialis tail-wagging muscle in adults. a type of vertebrae seen mostly in fish and early terrestrial tetrapod fossils (such as fossil salamanders and fossil frogs. The joints in amphicoelous vertebrae allow for significant lateral movement of the vertebral column, seen most clearly when fish use their tail to generate propulsive force. An additional plesiomorphy is the presence of free ribs in adults, a characteristic only present in the basal group archaeobatrachia. 

Ascaphids lack the ability to vocalise, are small – around long – and are found in steep, fast-flowing streams in Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and northern California in the northwest United States, and southeastern British Columbia (Rocky Mountain Tailed Frog) and coastal BC (Coastal Tailed Frog).

Unique to the tailed frogs is the ability to secrete a series of antimicrobial peptides called ascaphins. These peptides share minimal genetic characteristics with other peptides secreted by frogs, yet show some similarities with antibacterial peptides found in African scorpions &quot;Pandinus imperator&quot; and &quot;Opistophthalmus carinatus&quot;. The ascaphin peptides are secreted through the skin and imperative in fighting bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;S. aureus&quot;.

The tailed frogs share certain characteristics with the &quot;Leiopelma&quot;, a genus of primitive frogs native to New Zealand, with which they are a phylogenetic sister taxa to all other anurans.

== Mating practices ==
When attempting to mate, males will lunge at the female, wrapping a forelimb around them to secure them initially in an inguinal amplexus formation (males wrap their digits around female anterior to the pelvic region, placing their head on the back and close to the rear of the female) and then in a ventral amplexus formation (female is flipped over and male and female venters face each other). From here, the male inserts the &quot;tail&quot; into the female, and squeezes the female to gain leverage before thrusting. During this process the female is relatively still, occasionally kicking during the insertion process. 

In some situations there is male-male competition for the female. In these situations, both males compete to enter the amplexus formation, eventually one establishing a better hold on the female and expelling the other male from the breeding process. Usually the male that is larger is more likely to succeed.

==General habitat==

The habitat of the tailed frog is cold, fast-moving streams with cobblestone bottoms. They are mostly aquatic, but adults may emerge during cool, wet conditions to forage terrestrially. Breeding season lasts from May through September, and females deposit their eggs in strings under rocks in fast-moving streams. Larvae take one to four years to metamorphose in the cool, fast-moving mountain streams. The amount of cobbles and fines (sand and similarly sized fine particles) in streams have been shown to be good indicators of tadpole abundance, with tadpole abundance being inversely proportional to concentration of fines and proportional to concentration of cobbles. 

Thermal tolerance range in adults is exceptionally low relative to other North American anurans, with eggs rarely found above 20 °C and adults and larvae regularly migrating along microhabitats to reach temperatures below 20 °C whenever possible. It would appear that they prefer temperatures 16 °C and below. Eggs develop best at temperatures between 5° and 13
5 °C. 

Because of this very narrow thermal tolerance, Adults may exhibit philopatry where temperatures are stable and low. However it has also been hypothesized that they may migrate to colder waters in autumn. Unfortunately, movements and migrational habits in &quot;Ascaphus&quot; have not been well documented, preventing any conclusive statements on migratory behavior or philopatry from being made with confidence. 

Adults forage primarily terrestrially along stream banks, but also occasionally feed underwater. A wide variety of food items is taken, including both aquatic and terrestrial larval and adult insects, other arthropods (especially spiders), and snails. Tadpoles consume small quantities of filamentous green algae and desmids. Large quantities of conifer pollen are consumed seasonally by tadpoles. 

During the day, adults seek cover under submerged substrates in the stream, or occasionally under similar surface objects close to the stream. Individuals have also been found in crevices in spray-drenched cliff walls near waterfalls. During winter, individuals are less active, especially inland, and appear to retreat beneath large logs and boulders. Tadpoles require cool streams with smooth-surfaced stones with a minimum diameter of . Tadpoles probably spend most of their time attached to such substrates by a large oral sucker. The large, sucker-like mouth parts of the tadpoles are a second distinctive feature of the species, enabling survival in turbulent water unsuitable for other frogs. They prefer turbulent water to smooth, swiftly flowing water.

<text>Millicent Mary Lillian Martin (born 8 June 1934) is an English actress, singer, and comedian. She was the lone female singer of topical songs on the weekly BBC Television satirical show &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; (known as TW3; 1962–1963), and won a BAFTA TV Award in 1964. For her work on Broadway, she received Tony Award nominations for &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot; (1977) and &quot;King of Hearts&quot; (1978), both for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. Other television roles include her recurring role as Gertrude Moon in the NBC sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; (2000–04) and Joan Margaret in &quot;Grace &amp; Frankie&quot; (2017–2022).

==Life and career==
Martin was born in Romford, Essex.

=== Theatre ===
Early clippings show Martin as one of the cast in the pantomime &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; starring Jimmy Hanley at the Granada Tooting in December 1949. The following year she was in &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the Pavilion Bournemouth in December 1950 and in May 1951 she appeared in &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; at the Playhouse, Oxford playing an &quot;enterprising&quot; pupil. December 1951, saw her in the pantomime &quot;Mother Goose&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham.

She attended the Italia Conti theatre school and not long after leaving the school, she made her Broadway debut alongside Julie Andrews in &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; in September 1954. She remained in the show until November 1955.

Her additional New York theatre credits include taking over as Dorothy Brock in the original Broadway production of &quot;42nd Street&quot; in the 1980s and performing the revue &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot; with Julia McKenzie and David Kernan in 1977, for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. She received a second Tony nomination for the musical &quot;King of Hearts&quot; (1978).

In London, Martin starred with Paul Scofield and James Kenney in &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot; at the Saville Theatre. In 1959, she had also appeared in &quot;The Crooked Mile&quot;. Also in West End, she starred opposite Jim Dale in &quot;The Card&quot; in 1975.

In 1988, Martin joined the London production of the Sondheim musical &quot;Follies&quot;, starring with Eartha Kitt.

In 2008, she appeared at the Open Air Theatre, Regent&#x27;s Park with Topol, Linda Thorson and Lisa O&#x27;Hare in the Lerner &amp; Lowe musical, &quot;Gigi&quot;.

=== Television ===
During the early 1960s, Martin was the resident singer of topical songs on the British weekly satire show &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot; (1962–1963). The day after the assassination of President Kennedy, Martin sang the tribute song &quot;In the Summer of His Years&quot; on the show, which was composed by Herb Kretzmer and David Lee just hours after the assassination. Her tribute was released as a single and &#x27;bubbled under&#x27; the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at No 104 in 1963 (but was outcharted by a cover version by Connie Francis, which reached No 46).

Martin won a BAFTA TV Award for Light Entertainment Personality in 1964. She has also released recordings in Swedish, such as the 7&quot; single &quot;Om du nånsin skulle ändra dej&quot;.

Martin had her own BBC television series between 1964 and 1966, titled &quot;Mainly Millicent&quot; for the first two series, and shortened to &quot;Millicent&quot; for the third and final series. For her work in this series she won the TV Society Award. In one episode, Martin and guest star Roger Moore performed a comedy skit in which Moore played secret agent James Bond some years before he was cast in the role. In the mid-1960s she guested, alongside Pete Murray and Kenneth Williams, in an edition of &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;.

She appeared with Morecambe and Wise in their series &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; in the 1960s.

In 1969, Sir Lew Grade wanted to make a comedy film series, starring Martin, that would appeal to both American and British audiences. He sent six comedy sketches of Martin to producer Sheldon Leonard, who came up with the premise of &quot;From a Bird&#x27;s Eye View&quot;. The series was not a success and was cancelled after 16 episodes had been filmed.

In 1977, on Jubilee Day, she appeared in a gala edition of BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee, performing in a double act with Julia McKenzie.

Martin appeared on $100,000 Pyramid in 1987 during the second week of the show&#x27;s longest lasting tournament.

Martin appeared as Gladys Moon in 13 episodes of &quot;Moon and Son&quot;, a 1992 BBC detective series created by Robert Banks Stewart, and co-starring John Michie.

In 2005, she had a small part in the film, &quot;Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont&quot; which starred Joan Plowright.

Her later television roles include Gertrude Moon, Daphne Moon&#x27;s Mancunian mother, in the American sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;. She has worked for the Disney Channel, starring in the shows &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;, &quot;Jonas&quot; and in the film &quot;Return to Halloweentown&quot;. Other performances include guest roles in &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Newhart&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. She also had a small role on an episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; and a key role in an episode of &quot;Modern Family&quot;.

In 2011, she guest-starred opposite her former &quot;Frasier&quot; daughter, Jane Leeves, in the TV Land series &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;. She has also had an appearance in the fourth season of &quot;Chuck&quot; as the mother of Hartley Winterbottom, who was given the first Intersect prototype and became Alexei Volkoff; she also guest-starred on an episode of the fourth season of &quot;Castle&quot; as a theatre critic who wrote a harsh review of a performance given by Castle&#x27;s mother.

From 2017 to 2022, she appeared in &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; as Joan-Margaret.

=== Film ===
In the mid-1960s, Martin appeared in the British feature films &quot;Nothing But the Best&quot; (1964), &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965), &quot;Stop the World – I Want to Get Off&quot; (1966), and &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966).

== Personal life ==
She was married to the pop singer Ronnie Carroll from 1958 to 1965, and subsequently to actor Norman Eshley; both marriages ended in divorce. She has been married to American Marc Alexander since 1978, and became a permanent resident of the United States.

<doc id="586357" wikidata="Q2264109" url="?curid=586357" title="Artificial general intelligence">
<text>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that matches or surpasses human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. This contrasts with narrow AI, which is limited to specific tasks. Artificial superintelligence (ASI), on the other hand, refers to AGI that greatly exceeds human cognitive capabilities. AGI is considered one of the definitions of strong AI.

Creating AGI is a primary goal of AI research and of companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta. A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI research and development projects across 37 countries.

The timeline for achieving AGI remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. As of 2023, some argue that it may be possible in years or decades; others maintain it might take a century or longer; a minority believe it may never be achieved; and another minority claims that it is already here. Notable AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton has expressed concerns about the rapid progress towards AGI, suggesting it could be achieved sooner than many expect.

There is debate on the exact definition of AGI and regarding whether modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are early forms of AGI. AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.

Contention exists over whether AGI represents an existential risk. Many experts on AI have stated that mitigating the risk of human extinction posed by AGI should be a global priority. Others find the development of AGI to be too remote to present such a risk.

== Terminology ==

AGI is also known as strong AI, full AI, human-level AI, human-level intelligent AI, or general intelligent action.

Some academic sources reserve the term &quot;strong AI&quot; for computer programs that experience sentience or consciousness. In contrast, weak AI (or narrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem but lacks general cognitive abilities. Some academic sources use &quot;weak AI&quot; to refer more broadly to any programs that neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.

Related concepts include artificial superintelligence and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans, while the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, for example, similar to the agricultural or industrial revolution.

A framework for classifying AGI in levels was proposed in 2023 by Google DeepMind researchers. They define five levels of AGI: emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman. For example, a competent AGI is defined as an AI that outperforms 50% of skilled adults in a wide range of non-physical tasks, and a superhuman AGI (i.e. an artificial superintelligence) is similarly defined but with a threshold of 100%. They consider large language models like ChatGPT or LLaMA 2 to be instances of emerging AGI.

== Characteristics ==
Various popular definitions of intelligence have been proposed. One of the leading proposals is the Turing test. However, there are other well-known definitions, and some researchers disagree with the more popular approaches.

=== Intelligence traits ===
Researchers generally hold that intelligence is required to do all of the following:
* reason, use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgments under uncertainty
* represent knowledge, including common sense knowledge
* plan
* learn
* communicate in natural language
* if necessary, integrate these skills in completion of any given goal
Many interdisciplinary approaches (e.g. cognitive science, computational intelligence, and decision making) consider additional traits such as imagination (the ability to form novel mental images and concepts) and autonomy.

Computer-based systems that exhibit many of these capabilities exist (e.g. see computational creativity, automated reasoning, decision support system, robot, evolutionary computation, intelligent agent). There is debate about whether modern AI systems possess them to an adequate degree.

=== Physical traits ===
Other capabilities are considered desirable in intelligent systems, as they may affect intelligence or aid in its expression. These include:
* the ability to sense (e.g. see, hear, etc.), and
* the ability to act (e.g. move and manipulate objects, change location to explore, etc.)
This includes the ability to detect and respond to hazard.

Although the ability to sense (e.g. see, hear, etc.) and the ability to act (e.g. move and manipulate objects, change location to explore, etc.) can be desirable for some intelligent systems, these physical capabilities are not strictly required for an entity to qualify as AGI—particularly under the thesis that large language models (LLMs) may already be or become AGI. Even from a less optimistic perspective on LLMs, there is no firm requirement for an AGI to have a human-like form; being a silicon-based computational system is sufficient, provided it can process input (language) from the external world in place of human senses. This interpretation aligns with the understanding that AGI has never been proscribed a particular physical embodiment and thus does not demand a capacity for locomotion or traditional &quot;eyes and ears&quot;.

===Tests for human-level AGI===
Several tests meant to confirm human-level AGI have been considered, including:

;The Turing Test (&quot;Turing&quot;) 
:Proposed by Alan Turing in his 1950 paper &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence,&quot; this test involves a human judge engaging in natural language conversations with both a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The machine passes the test if it can convince the judge it is human a significant fraction of the time. Turing proposed this as a practical measure of machine intelligence, focusing on the ability to produce human-like responses rather than on the internal workings of the machine.

: Turing described the test as follows:
: In 2014, a chatbot named Eugene Goostman, designed to imitate a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, reportedly passed a Turing Test event by convincing 33% of judges that it was human. However, this claim was met with significant skepticism from the AI research community, who questioned the test&#x27;s implementation and its relevance to AGI.

: More recently, a 2024 study suggested that GPT-4 was identified as human 54% of the time in a randomized, controlled version of the Turing Test—surpassing older chatbots like ELIZA while still falling behind actual humans (67%).

;The Robot College Student Test (&quot;Goertzel&quot;) 
: A machine enrolls in a university, taking and passing the same classes that humans would, and obtaining a degree. LLMs can now pass university degree-level exams without even attending the classes.

;The Employment Test (&quot;Nilsson&quot;) 
: A machine performs an economically important job at least as well as humans in the same job. AIs are now replacing humans in many roles as varied as fast food and marketing.

;The Ikea test (&quot;Marcus&quot;) 
: Also known as the Flat Pack Furniture Test. An AI views the parts and instructions of an Ikea flat-pack product, then controls a robot to assemble the furniture correctly.

;The Coffee Test (&quot;Wozniak&quot;) 
: A machine is required to enter an average American home and figure out how to make coffee: find the coffee machine, find the coffee, add water, find a mug, and brew the coffee by pushing the proper buttons. This has not yet been completed.

;The Modern Turing Test (&quot;Suleyman&quot;) 
: An AI model is given $100,000 and has to obtain $1 million.

===AI-complete problems===
A problem is informally called &quot;AI-complete&quot; or &quot;AI-hard&quot; if it is believed that in order to solve it, one would need to implement AGI, because the solution is beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm.

There are many problems that have been conjectured to require general intelligence to solve as well as humans. Examples include computer vision, natural language understanding, and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real-world problem. Even a specific task like translation requires a machine to read and write in both languages, follow the author&#x27;s argument (reason), understand the context (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author&#x27;s original intent (social intelligence). All of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.

However, many of these tasks can now be performed by modern large language models. According to Stanford University&#x27;s 2024 AI index, AI has reached human-level performance on many benchmarks for reading comprehension and visual reasoning.

==History==

===Classical AI===

Modern AI research began in the mid-1950s. The first generation of AI researchers were convinced that artificial general intelligence was possible and that it would exist in just a few decades. AI pioneer Herbert A. Simon wrote in 1965: &quot;machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.&quot;

Their predictions were the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s character HAL 9000, who embodied what AI researchers believed they could create by the year 2001. AI pioneer Marvin Minsky was a consultant on the project of making HAL 9000 as realistic as possible according to the consensus predictions of the time. He said in 1967, &quot;Within a generation... the problem of creating &#x27;artificial intelligence&#x27; will substantially be solved&quot;.

Several classical AI projects, such as Doug Lenat&#x27;s Cyc project (that began in 1984), and Allen Newell&#x27;s Soar project, were directed at AGI.

However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. Funding agencies became skeptical of AGI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful &quot;applied AI&quot;. In the early 1980s, Japan&#x27;s Fifth Generation Computer Project revived interest in AGI, setting out a ten-year timeline that included AGI goals like &quot;carry on a casual conversation&quot;. In response to this and the success of expert systems, both industry and government pumped money into the field. However, confidence in AI spectacularly collapsed in the late 1980s, and the goals of the Fifth Generation Computer Project were never fulfilled. For the second time in 20 years, AI researchers who predicted the imminent achievement of AGI had been mistaken. By the 1990s, AI researchers had a reputation for making vain promises. They became reluctant to make predictions at all and avoided mention of &quot;human level&quot; artificial intelligence for fear of being labeled &quot;wild-eyed dreamer[s]&quot;.

===Narrow AI research===
In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI achieved commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where AI can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as speech recognition and recommendation algorithms. These &quot;applied AI&quot; systems are now used extensively throughout the technology industry, and research in this vein is heavily funded in both academia and industry. , development in this field was considered an emerging trend, and a mature stage was expected to be reached in more than 10 years.

At the turn of the century, many mainstream AI researchers hoped that strong AI could be developed by combining programs that solve various sub-problems. Hans Moravec wrote in 1988: I am confident that this bottom-up route to artificial intelligence will one day meet the traditional top-down route more than half way, ready to provide the real-world competence and the commonsense knowledge that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs. Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical golden spike is driven uniting the two efforts.

However, even at the time, this was disputed. For example, Stevan Harnad of Princeton University concluded his 1990 paper on the symbol grounding hypothesis by stating: The expectation has often been voiced that &quot;top-down&quot; (symbolic) approaches to modeling cognition will somehow meet &quot;bottom-up&quot; (sensory) approaches somewhere in between. If the grounding considerations in this paper are valid, then this expectation is hopelessly modular and there is really only one viable route from sense to symbols: from the ground up. A free-floating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route (or vice versa) – nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level, since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings (thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer).

===Modern artificial general intelligence research===
The term &quot;artificial general intelligence&quot; was used as early as 1997, by Mark Gubrud in a discussion of the implications of fully automated military production and operations. A mathematical formalism of AGI was proposed by Marcus Hutter in 2000. Named AIXI, the proposed AGI agent maximises &quot;the ability to satisfy goals in a wide range of environments&quot;. This type of AGI, characterized by the ability to maximise a mathematical definition of intelligence rather than exhibit human-like behaviour, was also called universal artificial intelligence.

The term AGI was re-introduced and popularized by Shane Legg and Ben Goertzel around 2002. AGI research activity in 2006 was described by Pei Wang and Ben Goertzel as &quot;producing publications and preliminary results&quot;. The first summer school in AGI was organized in Xiamen, China in 2009 by the Xiamen university&#x27;s Artificial Brain Laboratory and OpenCog. The first university course was given in 2010 and 2011 at Plovdiv University, Bulgaria by Todor Arnaudov. MIT presented a course on AGI in 2018, organized by Lex Fridman and featuring a number of guest lecturers.

, a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research, and many contribute to a series of AGI conferences. However, increasingly more researchers are interested in open-ended learning, which is the idea of allowing AI to continuously learn and innovate like humans do.

=== Feasibility ===

As of 2023, the development and potential achievement of AGI remains a subject of intense debate within the AI community. While traditional consensus held that AGI was a distant goal, recent advancements have led some researchers and industry figures to claim that early forms of AGI may already exist. AI pioneer Herbert A. Simon speculated in 1965 that &quot;machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do&quot;. This prediction failed to come true. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen believed that such intelligence is unlikely in the 21st century because it would require &quot;unforeseeable and fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs&quot; and a &quot;scientifically deep understanding of cognition&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, roboticist Alan Winfield claimed the gulf between modern computing and human-level artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical faster-than-light spaceflight.

A further challenge is the lack of clarity in defining what intelligence entails. Does it require consciousness? Must it display the ability to set goals as well as pursue them? Is it purely a matter of scale such that if model sizes increase sufficiently, intelligence will emerge? Are facilities such as planning, reasoning, and causal understanding required? Does intelligence require explicitly replicating the brain and its specific faculties? Does it require emotions?

Most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, but some thinkers, like Hubert Dreyfus and Roger Penrose, deny the possibility of achieving strong AI. John McCarthy is among those who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but that the present level of progress is such that a date cannot accurately be predicted. AI experts&#x27; views on the feasibility of AGI wax and wane. Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median estimate among experts for when they would be 50% confident AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll, with the mean being 2081. Of the experts, 16.5% answered with &quot;never&quot; when asked the same question but with a 90% confidence instead. Further current AGI progress considerations can be found above &quot;Tests for confirming human-level AGI&quot;.

A report by Stuart Armstrong and Kaj Sotala of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute found that &quot;over [a] 60-year time frame there is a strong bias towards predicting the arrival of human-level AI as between 15 and 25 years from the time the prediction was made&quot;. They analyzed 95 predictions made between 1950 and 2012 on when human-level AI will come about.

In 2023, Microsoft researchers published a detailed evaluation of GPT-4. They concluded: &quot;Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.&quot; Another study in 2023 reported that GPT-4 outperforms 99% of humans on the Torrance tests of creative thinking.

Blaise Agüera y Arcas and Peter Norvig wrote in 2023 that a significant level of general intelligence has already been achieved with frontier models. They wrote that reluctance to this view comes from four main reasons: a &quot;healthy skepticism about metrics for AGI&quot;, an &quot;ideological commitment to alternative AI theories or techniques&quot;, a &quot;devotion to human (or biological) exceptionalism&quot;, or a &quot;concern about the economic implications of AGI&quot;.

2023 also marked the emergence of large multimodal models (large language models capable of processing or generating multiple modalities such as text, audio, and images).

In 2024, OpenAI released o1-preview, the first of a series of models that &quot;spend more time thinking before they respond&quot;. According to Mira Murati, this ability to think before responding represents a new, additional paradigm. It improves model outputs by spending more computing power when generating the answer, whereas the model scaling paradigm improves outputs by increasing the model size, training data and training compute power.

An OpenAI employee, Vahid Kazemi, claimed in 2024 that the company had achieved AGI, stating, &quot;In my opinion, we have already achieved AGI and it’s even more clear with O1.&quot; Kazemi clarified that while the AI is not yet &quot;better than any human at any task&quot;, it is &quot;better than most humans at most tasks.&quot; He also addressed criticisms that large language models (LLMs) merely follow predefined patterns, comparing their learning process to the scientific method of observing, hypothesizing, and verifying. These statements have sparked debate, as they rely on a broad and unconventional definition of AGI—traditionally understood as AI that matches human intelligence across all domains. Critics argue that, while OpenAI&#x27;s models demonstrate remarkable versatility, they may not fully meet this standard. Notably, Kazemi&#x27;s comments came shortly after OpenAI removed &quot;AGI&quot; from the terms of its partnership with Microsoft, prompting speculation about the company’s strategic intentions.

=== Timescales ===

Progress in artificial intelligence has historically gone through periods of rapid progress separated by periods when progress appeared to stop. Ending each hiatus were fundamental advances in hardware, software or both to create space for further progress. For example, the computer hardware available in the twentieth century was not sufficient to implement deep learning, which requires large numbers of GPU-enabled CPUs.

In the introduction to his 2006 book, Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century. , the consensus in the AGI research community seemed to be that the timeline discussed by Ray Kurzweil in 2005 in &quot;The Singularity is Near&quot; (i.e. between 2015 and 2045) was plausible. Mainstream AI researchers have given a wide range of opinions on whether progress will be this rapid. A 2012 meta-analysis of 95 such opinions found a bias towards predicting that the onset of AGI would occur within 16–26 years for modern and historical predictions alike. That paper has been criticized for how it categorized opinions as expert or non-expert.

In 2012, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton developed a neural network called AlexNet, which won the ImageNet competition with a top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, significantly better than the second-best entry&#x27;s rate of 26.3% (the traditional approach used a weighted sum of scores from different pre-defined classifiers). AlexNet was regarded as the initial ground-breaker of the current deep learning wave.

In 2017, researchers Feng Liu, Yong Shi, and Ying Liu conducted intelligence tests on publicly available and freely accessible weak AI such as Google AI, Apple&#x27;s Siri, and others. At the maximum, these AIs reached an IQ value of about 47, which corresponds approximately to a six-year-old child in first grade. An adult comes to about 100 on average. Similar tests were carried out in 2014, with the IQ score reaching a maximum value of 27.

In 2020, OpenAI developed GPT-3, a language model capable of performing many diverse tasks without specific training. According to Gary Grossman in a VentureBeat article, while there is consensus that GPT-3 is not an example of AGI, it is considered by some to be too advanced to be classified as a narrow AI system.

In the same year, Jason Rohrer used his GPT-3 account to develop a chatbot, and provided a chatbot-developing platform called &quot;Project December&quot;. OpenAI asked for changes to the chatbot to comply with their safety guidelines; Rohrer disconnected Project December from the GPT-3 API.

In 2022, DeepMind developed Gato, a &quot;general-purpose&quot; system capable of performing more than 600 different tasks.

In 2023, Microsoft Research published a study on an early version of OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4, contending that it exhibited more general intelligence than previous AI models and demonstrated human-level performance in tasks spanning multiple domains, such as mathematics, coding, and law. This research sparked a debate on whether GPT-4 could be considered an early, incomplete version of artificial general intelligence, emphasizing the need for further exploration and evaluation of such systems.

In 2023, the AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton stated that:

In May 2023, Demis Hassabis similarly said that &quot;The progress in the last few years has been pretty incredible&quot;, and that he sees no reason why it would slow down, expecting AGI within a decade or even a few years. In March 2024, Nvidia&#x27;s CEO, Jensen Huang, stated his expectation that within five years, AI would be capable of passing any test at least as well as humans. In June 2024, the AI researcher Leopold Aschenbrenner, a former OpenAI employee, estimated AGI by 2027 to be &quot;strikingly plausible&quot;.

== Whole brain emulation ==
While the development of transformer models like in ChatGPT is considered the most promising path to AGI, whole brain emulation can serve as an alternative approach. With whole brain simulation, a brain model is built by scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail, and then copying and simulating it on a computer system or another computational device. The simulation model must be sufficiently faithful to the original, so that it behaves in practically the same way as the original brain. Whole brain emulation is a type of brain simulation that is discussed in computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics, and for medical research purposes. It has been discussed in artificial intelligence research as an approach to strong AI. Neuroimaging technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and futurist Ray Kurzweil in the book &quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot; predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the computing power required to emulate it.

===Early estimates===
 For low-level brain simulation, a very powerful cluster of computers or GPUs would be required, given the enormous quantity of synapses within the human brain. Each of the 1011 (one hundred billion) neurons has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. The brain of a three-year-old child has about 1015 synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 1014 to 5×1014 synapses (100 to 500 trillion). An estimate of the brain&#x27;s processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 1014 (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second (SUPS).

In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 1016 computations per second (cps). (For comparison, if a &quot;computation&quot; was equivalent to one &quot;floating-point operation&quot; – a measure used to rate current supercomputers – then 1016 &quot;computations&quot; would be equivalent to 10 petaFLOPS, achieved in 2011, while 1018 was achieved in 2022.) He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.

===Current research===
The Human Brain Project, an EU-funded initiative active from 2013 to 2023, has developed a particularly detailed and publicly accessible atlas of the human brain. In 2023, researchers from Duke University performed a high-resolution scan of a mouse brain.

===Criticisms of simulation-based approaches===
The artificial neuron model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current artificial neural network implementations is simple compared with biological neurons. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological neurons, presently understood only in broad outline. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil&#x27;s estimate. In addition, the estimates do not account for glial cells, which are known to play a role in cognitive processes.

A fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from embodied cognition theory which asserts that human embodiment is an essential aspect of human intelligence and is necessary to ground meaning. If this theory is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (e.g., a robotic body). Goertzel proposes virtual embodiment (like in metaverses like &quot;Second Life&quot;) as an option, but it is unknown whether this would be sufficient.

== Philosophical perspective ==
=== &quot;Strong AI&quot; as defined in philosophy ===
In 1980, philosopher John Searle coined the term &quot;strong AI&quot; as part of his Chinese room argument. He proposed a distinction between two hypotheses about artificial intelligence:

* Strong AI hypothesis: An artificial intelligence system can have &quot;a mind&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot;.
* Weak AI hypothesis: An artificial intelligence system can (only) &quot;act like&quot; it thinks and has a mind and consciousness.

The first one he called &quot;strong&quot; because it makes a &quot;stronger&quot; statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond those abilities that we can test. The behaviour of a &quot;weak AI&quot; machine would be precisely identical to a &quot;strong AI&quot; machine, but the latter would also have subjective conscious experience. This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.

In contrast to Searle and mainstream AI, some futurists such as Ray Kurzweil use the term &quot;strong AI&quot; to mean &quot;human level artificial general intelligence&quot;. This is not the same as Searle&#x27;s strong AI, unless it is assumed that consciousness is necessary for human-level AGI. Academic philosophers such as Searle do not believe that is the case, and to most artificial intelligence researchers the question is out-of-scope.

Mainstream AI is most interested in how a program &quot;behaves&quot;. According to Russell and Norvig, &quot;as long as the program works, they don&#x27;t care if you call it real or a simulation.&quot; If the program can behave &quot;as if&quot; it has a mind, then there is no need to know if it &quot;actually&quot; has mind – indeed, there would be no way to tell. For AI research, Searle&#x27;s &quot;weak AI hypothesis&quot; is equivalent to the statement &quot;artificial general intelligence is possible&quot;. Thus, according to Russell and Norvig, &quot;most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don&#x27;t care about the strong AI hypothesis.&quot; Thus, for academic AI research, &quot;Strong AI&quot; and &quot;AGI&quot; are two different things.

=== Consciousness ===

Consciousness can have various meanings, and some aspects play significant roles in science fiction and the ethics of artificial intelligence:

* Sentience (or &quot;phenomenal consciousness&quot;): The ability to &quot;feel&quot; perceptions or emotions subjectively, as opposed to the ability to &quot;reason&quot; about perceptions. Some philosophers, such as David Chalmers, use the term &quot;consciousness&quot; to refer exclusively to phenomenal consciousness, which is roughly equivalent to sentience. Determining why and how subjective experience arises is known as the hard problem of consciousness. Thomas Nagel explained in 1974 that it &quot;feels like&quot; something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask &quot;what does it feel like to be a bat?&quot; However, we are unlikely to ask &quot;what does it feel like to be a toaster?&quot; Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e., has consciousness) but a toaster does not. In 2022, a Google engineer claimed that the company&#x27;s AI chatbot, LaMDA, had achieved sentience, though this claim was widely disputed by other experts.
* Self-awareness: To have conscious awareness of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be consciously aware of one&#x27;s own thoughts. This is opposed to simply being the &quot;subject of one&#x27;s thought&quot;—an operating system or debugger is able to be &quot;aware of itself&quot; (that is, to represent itself in the same way it represents everything else)—but this is not what people typically mean when they use the term &quot;self-awareness&quot;.

These traits have a moral dimension. AI sentience would give rise to concerns of welfare and legal protection, similarly to animals. Other aspects of consciousness related to cognitive capabilities are also relevant to the concept of AI rights. Figuring out how to integrate advanced AI with existing legal and social frameworks is an emergent issue.

==Benefits==
AGI could have a wide variety of applications. If oriented towards such goals, AGI could help mitigate various problems in the world such as hunger, poverty and health problems.

AGI could improve productivity and efficiency in most jobs. For example, in public health, AGI could accelerate medical research, notably against cancer. It could take care of the elderly, and democratize access to rapid, high-quality medical diagnostics. It could offer fun, cheap and personalized education. The need to work to subsist could become obsolete if the wealth produced is properly redistributed. This also raises the question of the place of humans in a radically automated society.

AGI could also help to make rational decisions, and to anticipate and prevent disasters. It could also help to reap the benefits of potentially catastrophic technologies such as nanotechnology or climate engineering, while avoiding the associated risks. If an AGI&#x27;s primary goal is to prevent existential catastrophes such as human extinction (which could be difficult if the Vulnerable World Hypothesis turns out to be true), it could take measures to drastically reduce the risks while minimizing the impact of these measures on our quality of life.

Advancements in medicine and healthcare

AGI would improve healthcare by making medical diagnostics faster, cheaper, and more accurate. AI-driven systems can analyse patient data and detect diseases at an early stage. This means patients will get diagnosed quicker and be able to seek medical attention before their medical condition gets worse. AGI systems could also recommend personalised treatment plans based on genetics and medical history.

Additionally, AGI could accelerate drug discovery by simulating molecular interactions, reducing the time it takes to develop new medicines for conditions like cancer and Alzheimer’s. In hospitals, AGI-powered robotic assistants could assist in surgeries, monitor patients, and provide real-time medical support. It could also be used in elderly care, helping aging populations maintain independence through AI-powered caregivers and health-monitoring systems.

By evaluating large datasets, AGI can assist in developing personalised treatment plans tailored to individual patient needs. This approach ensures that therapies are optimised based on a patient&#x27;s unique medical history and genetic profile, improving outcomes and reducing adverse effects.

Advancements in science and technology

AGI can become a tool for scientific research and innovation. In fields such as physics and mathematics, AGI could help solve complex problems that require massive computational power, such as modeling quantum systems, understanding dark matter, or proving mathematical theorems. Problems that have remained unsolved for decades may be solved with AGI.

AGI could also drive technological breakthroughs that could reshape society. It can do this by optimising engineering designs, discovering new materials, and improving automation. For example, AI is already playing a role in developing more efficient renewable energy sources and optimising supply chains in manufacturing. Future AGI systems could push these innovations even further.

Enhancing education and productivity

AGI can personalize education by creating learning programs that are specific to each student’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Unlike traditional teaching methods, AI-driven tutoring systems could adapt lessons in real-time, ensuring students understand difficult concepts before moving on.

In the workplace, AGI could automate repetitive tasks, freeing up workers for more creative and strategic roles. It could also improve efficiency across industries by optimising logistics, enhancing cybersecurity, and streamlining business operations. If properly managed, the wealth generated by AGI-driven automation could reduce the need for people to work for a living. Working may become optional.

Mitigating global crises

AGI could play a crucial role in preventing and managing global threats. It could help governments and organizations predict and respond to natural disasters more effectively, using real-time data analysis to forecast hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics. By analyzing vast datasets from satellites, sensors, and historical records, AGI could improve early warning systems, enabling faster disaster response and minimising casualties.

In climate science, AGI could develop new models for reducing carbon emissions, optimising energy resources, and mitigating climate change effects. It could also enhance weather prediction accuracy, allowing policymakers to implement more effective environmental regulations. Additionally, AGI could help regulate emerging technologies that carry significant risks, such as nanotechnology and bioengineering, by analysing complex systems and predicting unintended consequences. Furthermore, AGI could assist in cybersecurity by detecting and mitigating large-scale cyber threats, protecting critical infrastructure, and preventing digital warfare.

==Risks==
=== Existential risks ===

AGI may represent multiple types of existential risk, which are risks that threaten &quot;the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development&quot;. The risk of human extinction from AGI has been the topic of many debates, but there is also the possibility that the development of AGI would lead to a permanently flawed future. Notably, it could be used to spread and preserve the set of values of whoever develops it. If humanity still has moral blind spots similar to slavery in the past, AGI might irreversibly entrench it, preventing moral progress. Furthermore, AGI could facilitate mass surveillance and indoctrination, which could be used to create a stable repressive worldwide totalitarian regime. There is also a risk for the machines themselves. If machines that are sentient or otherwise worthy of moral consideration are mass created in the future, engaging in a civilizational path that indefinitely neglects their welfare and interests could be an existential catastrophe. Considering how much AGI could improve humanity&#x27;s future and help reduce other existential risks, Toby Ord calls these existential risks &quot;an argument for proceeding with due caution&quot;, not for &quot;abandoning AI&quot;.

==== Risk of loss of control and human extinction ====
The thesis that AI poses an existential risk for humans, and that this risk needs more attention, is controversial but has been endorsed in 2023 by many public figures, AI researchers and CEOs of AI companies such as Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Demis Hassabis and Sam Altman.

In 2014, Stephen Hawking criticized widespread indifference:

The potential fate of humanity has sometimes been compared to the fate of gorillas threatened by human activities. The comparison states that greater intelligence allowed humanity to dominate gorillas, which are now vulnerable in ways that they could not have anticipated. As a result, the gorilla has become an endangered species, not out of malice, but simply as a collateral damage from human activities.

The skeptic Yann LeCun considers that AGIs will have no desire to dominate humanity and that we should be careful not to anthropomorphize them and interpret their intents as we would for humans. He said that people won&#x27;t be &quot;smart enough to design super-intelligent machines, yet ridiculously stupid to the point of giving it moronic objectives with no safeguards&quot;. On the other side, the concept of instrumental convergence suggests that almost whatever their goals, intelligent agents will have reasons to try to survive and acquire more power as intermediary steps to achieving these goals. And that this does not require having emotions.

Many scholars who are concerned about existential risk advocate for more research into solving the &quot;control problem&quot; to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximise the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence? Solving the control problem is complicated by the AI arms race (which could lead to a race to the bottom of safety precautions in order to release products before competitors), and the use of AI in weapon systems.

The thesis that AI can pose existential risk also has detractors. Skeptics usually say that AGI is unlikely in the short-term, or that concerns about AGI distract from other issues related to current AI. Former Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder considers that for many people outside of the technology industry, existing chatbots and LLMs are already perceived as though they were AGI, leading to further misunderstanding and fear.

Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God. Some researchers believe that the communication campaigns on AI existential risk by certain AI groups (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, and Conjecture) may be an at attempt at regulatory capture and to inflate interest in their products.

In 2023, the CEOs of Google DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic, along with other industry leaders and researchers, issued a joint statement asserting that &quot;Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.&quot;

===Mass unemployment===

Researchers from OpenAI estimated that &quot;80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted&quot;. They consider office workers to be the most exposed, for example mathematicians, accountants or web designers. AGI could have a better autonomy, ability to make decisions, to interface with other computer tools, but also to control robotized bodies.

According to Stephen Hawking, the outcome of automation on the quality of life will depend on how the wealth will be redistributed:
Elon Musk considers that the automation of society will require governments to adopt a universal basic income.

<doc id="586365" wikidata="Q1972034" url="?curid=586365" title="Saunders-Roe A.36 Lerwick">
<text>The Saunders-Roe A.36 Lerwick was a British flying boat built by Saunders-Roe Limited (Saro). It was intended to be used with the Short Sunderland in Royal Air Force Coastal Command but it was a flawed design and only a small number were built. They had a poor service record and a high accident rate; of 21 aircraft, 10 were lost to accidents and one for an unknown reason.

==Design and development==
Air Ministry Specification R.1/36 (to meet Operational Requirement 32) was issued in March 1936 to several companies that had experience in building flying boats. The specification was for a medium-range flying boat for anti-submarine, convoy escort and reconnaissance duties to replace the Royal Air Force&#x27;s biplane flying boats such as the Saro London and Supermarine Stranraer. The specification called for a cruise speed of and a weight of no more than .

Designs were tendered by Saunders-Roe (S.36), Supermarine (Type 314), Blackburn Aircraft (b. 20) and Shorts. The Blackburn B.20 was a radical design that offered much better performance, by reducing the drag associated with a flying boat hull and so a prototype was ordered to test the concept. Of the other designs the Supermarine was the first choice with Saro and Shorts tied in second place. The Supermarine was ordered &quot;off the drawing board&quot; i. e. without requiring prototypes to be produced and flown first. Supermarine&#x27;s commitment to the Spitfire meant that work was not expected to start for two years and so the Ministry looked to the other designs. Saunders-Roe had redesigned the S.36 in the meantime—replacing low hull and gull wing with a deep body and high wing—and the Supermarine order was transferred to the S.36. The contract was issued in June 1937 to buy 21 of the S.36, receiving the service name Lerwick (after the town of Lerwick). The aircraft was a compact twin-engined, high-winged monoplane of all-metal construction, with a conventional flying boat hull, a planing bottom and two stabilising floats, carried under the wings on long struts. It was powered by two Bristol Hercules radial engines and initially had twin fins and rudders. For defence, the Lerwick was equipped with three powered gun turrets. The nose turret had a single 0.303 inch Vickers K gun; the other two had 0.303 Browning machine guns, two guns in the Nash &amp; Thompson FN.8 turret in the dorsal position and four in the Nash &amp; Thompson FN4.A turret at the tail. Offensive weapons were a total of of bombs or depth charges – four or eight bombs, or four depth charges, carried in two streamlined nacelles behind the engines, similar to the Martin PBM Mariner.

The first three aircraft were used as prototypes, with the first being launched on 31 October 1938, after numerous delays during design and construction. The Lerwick was immediately found to be unstable in the air, on the water and not suited to &quot;hands off&quot; flying. The latter was a major problem in an aircraft designed for long-range patrols. Numerous adjustments, including the addition of a greatly enlarged single fin and an increase in the wing angle of incidence, failed to remedy its undesirable characteristics, which included a vicious stall and unsatisfactory rates of roll and yaw. In service, several aircraft were lost because of wing floats breaking off, suggesting this was a structural weakness. Persistent problems with the hydraulics resulted in bomb doors sometimes dropping open during flight.

On one engine, the Lerwick could not maintain height, nor could it maintain a constant heading, as the controls could not counter the torque of one engine on maximum power. An engine failure would inevitably see the aircraft flying in slowly descending circles. On one occasion, the loss of an engine forced a Lerwick to make an emergency landing in the Caledonian Canal. The aircraft was then towed to Oban at the end of a string of coal barges.

==Operational history==
In mid-1939, four Lerwicks were allocated to 240 Squadron. By October, the squadron had stopped flying them and reverted to its older and slower Saro London flying boats. The Lerwick programme was cancelled on 24 October but restarted on 1 November. In December 1939, Air Vice-Marshal Sholto Douglas recommended that the Lerwicks be scrapped and Saunders-Roe put to building Short Sunderlands but the production change would have taken months and with the start of the Second World War, aircraft were urgently required.
Production continued and the type entered service with 209 Squadron based at Oban in 1940, replacing Short Singapores; the squadron soon began losing aircraft to accidents. During the service with 209 Squadron, all the Lerwicks were grounded twice for urgent safety modifications; on only two occasions were U-boats attacked by a Lerwick and neither submarine was damaged.

In April 1941, 209 Squadron began receiving the US Consolidated Catalina. The last of a total of 21 Lerwicks was delivered in May but the type was withdrawn from front-line service in the same month. Most of the remaining Lerwicks were transferred to Number 4 (Coastal) Operational Training Unit at Invergordon; three were sent to 240 Squadron for service trials at the highly-secret Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Helensburgh.

In mid-1942, the Lerwicks were briefly returned to service, for the purpose of operational training with 422 Squadron and 423 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force, based at Lough Erne. By the end of 1942, the type had been declared obsolete; by early 1943, the survivors had been scrapped.

<text>Frederick Arthur Round Emney (12 February 1900 – 25 December 1980) was an English character actor and comedian.

Emney was born in Prescot, Lancashire, the son of Blanche (née Round) and Fred Emney, a music hall entertainer. His great-uncle was the actor Arthur Williams. Emney junior grew up in London and was educated at Cranleigh School.

He made his film debut in 1935, having previously worked in music hall. He became a familiar figure to screen audiences, usually playing the &quot;posh fat bloke&quot;, usually gruff and invariably wearing a monocle. During the 1950s, he had his own television show which featured sketches and deft piano pieces often composed by him. Some were released on record. He had a short spell as straight man to puppets Pinky and Perky.

His sister Joan Emney was an actress who sometimes appeared with him in the same stage productions.

Fred Emney died in Bognor Regis, Sussex, on Christmas Day 1980.

<doc id="586374" wikidata="Q953618" url="?curid=586374" title="Miles Ahead (album)">
<text>Miles Ahead is an album by Miles Davis that was released in October 1957 by Columbia Records. It was Davis&#x27; first collaboration with arranger Gil Evans following the &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; sessions. Along with their subsequent collaborations &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1959) and &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; (1960), &quot;Miles Ahead&quot; is one of the most famous recordings of Third Stream, a fusion of jazz, European classical, and world musics. Davis played flugelhorn throughout.

== Background ==
Evans combined the ten pieces that make up the album into a suite, each flowing into the next without interruption; the only exception to this rule was on the title track since it was placed last on side A (this has been corrected on the CD versions). Davis is the only soloist on &quot;Miles Ahead&quot;, which features a large ensemble consisting of sixteen woodwind and brass players. Art Taylor played drums on the sessions and the then current Miles Davis Quintet member Paul Chambers was the bassist.

A fifth recording date involved Davis alone (re-)recording material to cover or patch mistakes or omissions in his solos using overdubbing. The fact that this album was originally produced in mono makes these inserted overdubbings rather obvious in the new stereo setting.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; gave &quot;Miles Ahead&quot; a four-star rating out of a possible four stars, and called the album &quot;a quiet masterpiece... with a guaranteed place in the top flight of Miles albums.&quot; Of Davis&#x27; flugelhorn, Kevin Whitehead of &quot;Cadence&quot; wrote that it &quot;seemed to suit [Davis] better than trumpet: more full-bodied, less shrill, it glosses over his technical deficiencies.&quot; The &quot;Penguin Guide&quot;, on the other hand, opined that &quot;the flugelhorn&#x27;s sound isn&#x27;t so very different from his trumpet soloing, though palpably softer-edged... [S]ome of the burnish seems to be lost.&quot; Tony Hall of &quot;Disc&quot; said the album &quot;one of the finest records of the decade&quot; and rated five stars and plus.

== Album cover ==
Davis was reportedly unhappy about the album&#x27;s original cover, which featured a photograph of a young white woman and child aboard a sailboat. He made his displeasure known to Columbia executive George Avakian, asking, &quot;Why&#x27;d you put that white bitch on there?&quot; Avakian later stated that the question was made in jest. For later releases of the record, however, the original cover-photo has been replaced by a photograph of Davis.

== Jon Hendricks&#x27; vocalization ==
Jon Hendricks had been working on vocalizing Miles&#x27; parts on the album for over 50 years, and Pete Churchill, on hearing this, approached him to talk about developing it with ensemble the London Vocal Project. Together they finished scoring all the parts and writing the lyrics, for the band parts as well as for Miles, which the LVP then rehearsed extensively. On February 17, 2017, the LVP performed the entire album at St Peter&#x27;s Church in New York, which was funded by Quincy Jones. The soloists were Anita Wardell, Michele Hendricks, Kevin Fitzgerald Burke, and Jessica Radcliffe.

<text>Fernando Álvaro Lamas y de Santos (January 9, 1915 – October 8, 1982) was an Argentine-American actor and director of the Golden Age of Argentine cinema. He is the father of actor Lorenzo Lamas.

==Biography==
===Argentina===
Fernando Álvaro Lamas y de Santos was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In this country, his movies included &quot;En el último piso&quot; (1942), &quot;Frontera Sur&quot; (1943), &quot;Villa rica del Espíritu Santo&quot; (1945), and &quot;Stella&quot; (1946). Lamas was also seen in &quot;The Poor People&#x27;s Christmas&quot; (1947), &quot;The Tango Returns to Paris&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Story of a Bad Woman&quot; (1948). He had the lead in &quot;La rubia Mireya&quot; (1949) alongside Mecha Ortiz, and a key role in &quot;De padre desconocido&quot; (1949), &quot;Vidalita&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Story of the Tango&quot; (1950). He also appeared in &quot;Corrientes, calle de ensueños&quot; (1949), and &quot;La otra y yo&quot; (1950). He was reportedly the third biggest star in the country. His first American film was &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1950) for Republic Pictures, shot on location in Argentina. Some scenes were filmed in the US, leading to Lamas going to Hollywood.

===MGM===

In September 1949, he signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and went on to play mainly &quot;Latin lover&quot; roles and occasionally sing in musicals.
In 1951, Lamas starred as Paul Sarnac in the musical, &quot;Rich, Young and Pretty&quot; with Jane Powell. He supported Greer Garson and Michael Wilding in &quot;The Law and the Lady&quot; (1952), which was a flop.

MGM gave him a star tenor part as Lana Turner&#x27;s love interest in the popular operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1952) by Franz Lehár. He romanced Elizabeth Taylor in &quot;The Girl Who Had Everything&quot; (1952), which was also successful. Lamas went to Paramount Pictures, where he was top-billed in &quot;Sangaree&quot; (1953). Back at MGM, he was Esther Williams&#x27; leading man in &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot; (1953), a big success. At Warner Bros. Lamas starred in &quot;The Diamond Queen&quot; (1954). He did &quot;Jivaro&quot; (1954) at Paramount then returned to MGM for a remake of &quot;Rose Marie&quot; (1954) supporting Howard Keel and Ann Blyth. It was popular, but failed to recoup its cost. At Paramount, he was Rosalind Russell&#x27;s leading man in &quot;The Girl Rush&quot; (1955). Lamas started appearing on television, including an adaptation of &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; for &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;. 

&quot;I couldn&#x27;t break the Latin lover image&quot;, Lamas later claimed. He co-starred on Broadway in the 1956 musical &quot;Happy Hunting&quot; with Ethel Merman, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award.

===Television===
Lamas did episodes of &quot;Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Bravado Touch&quot;), &quot;Climax!&quot; (&quot;Spider Web&quot;), &quot;Pursuit&quot; (&quot;Eagle in a Cage&quot;), &quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook&quot;, and &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, but returned to features with &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1960). He also guest starred in one episode of &quot;The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour&quot;
Lamas also appeared in the TV show &quot;Combat!&quot; (season five, episode four) &quot;Brothers.&quot;

===Europe===
Lamas moved to Europe with Esther Williams, who became his wife. He directed a film in which both starred, &quot;Magic Fountain&quot;, shot in 1961 and never released in the US. He went to Italy for &quot;Duel of Fire&quot; (1962), and &quot;Revenge of the Musketeers&quot; (1963). He helped write the Western &quot;A Place Called Glory&quot; (1965).

===Return to the U.S.===
Lamas returned to Hollywood. As an actor, he focused on television, with guest appearances on &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Laredo&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;, &quot;Hondo&quot;, and &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;. From 1965 to 1968, Lamas had a regular role as Ramon De Vega on &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, which starred Ben Gazzara; Lamas also directed some episodes.

He had a support role in &quot;Valley of Mystery&quot; (1967), a pilot for a series that did not proceed. He directed another feature film, &quot;The Violent Ones&quot;, which was released in 1967 and co-starred Aldo Ray and David Carradine. He was in &quot;Kill a Dragon&quot; (1967) and &quot;100 Rifles&quot; (1969), and had guest roles on &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;, &quot;The Macahans&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot;, &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, &quot;Dan August&quot;, &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;Bearcats!&quot;, &quot;Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, and &quot;McCloud&quot;.

===TV director===
Lamas started directing TV, as well: &quot;The Bold Ones: The Lawyers&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;Jigsaw John&quot;, &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Secrets of Midland Heights&quot;, &quot;Flamingo Road&quot;, and &quot;Code Red&quot;. As an actor, he was in the TV movies &quot;The Lonely Profession&quot; (1969) and &quot;Murder on Flight 502&quot; (1975). He also was seen in &quot;Bronk&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot; (which he also directed), &quot;Won Ton Ton: The Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976), &quot;Quincy M.E.&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot;, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, &quot;The Dream Merchants&quot;, and &quot;House Calls&quot;.

=== Last years and death ===
Lamas produced the TV movie &quot;Samurai&quot;, released in 1979. He directed episodes of &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; co-starring his son, Lorenzo. He also helmed &quot;Bret Maverick&quot; and several episodes of &quot;House Calls&quot;.

He had a supporting role in the series &quot;Gavilan&quot;, when he fell ill with cancer. His scenes were shot with Patrick Macnee.

Fernando Lamas died of pancreatic cancer in Los Angeles in 1982, aged 67. His ashes were scattered by close friend Jonathan Goldsmith from his sailboat.

==Personal life==
Lamas was married four times. His first marriage was to Argentine actress Perla Mux in 1940, and they had a daughter, Christina, before divorcing in 1944. His second marriage was in 1946 to Lydia Valeria Babacci; this marriage also produced a daughter, Alejandra Lydia. They were divorced in 1952. His third wife was the American actress Arlene Dahl. They were married in 1954. They were later divorced in 1960. Out of this marriage was born Lorenzo Lamas (born January 20, 1958). His longest marriage was to swimmer and actress Esther Williams in 1969, and they remained married until Lamas&#x27;s death in 1982.

==In popular culture==
His friend, actor Jonathan Goldsmith, took inspiration from Lamas for the character the Most Interesting Man in the World.
The most well-known parody of Fernando was on the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches that featured Billy Crystal.
In the recurring &quot;Fernando&#x27;s Hideaway&quot; sketch, Crystal used Lamas&#x27;s accent for inspiration, as well as a quote from the actor: &quot;It is better to look good than to feel good.&quot;

<text>Baton Rouge Magnet High School (BRMHS or Baton Rouge High) is a public magnet school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States, founded in 1880. It is part of the East Baton Rouge Parish School System with a student body of approximately 1500 students. The current building was built in 1926, and, as Baton Rouge High School, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The campus underwent a two-year renovation and expansion starting in 2010, resulting in the addition of two new wings to the main building. This renovation was completed and the school reopened in fall 2012. Baton Rouge High is also one of the highest-ranked schools in the state, and consistently wins state-level academic competitions. The school requires students to pass enrollment standards and exceed graduation standards. As a result, nearly all graduating students attend college.

==History==

In 1903, T. H. Harris was named principal of Baton Rouge High School. Five years later, he became the state education superintendent and held that post until 1940.

The present campus was put into use in 1925 (although some sources cite 1927 or 1928 as the year the new building opened) when the main four-story building was built. Additional buildings were added and renovations made during the 1950s. By 1972, the present facilities were completed and air conditioning was installed. In the fall of 1976, the school began operating under the new Magnet School Curriculum, and the Class of 1980 became the first graduating class to attend all four full years under the Magnet Program.
Numerous district and state championships have been won as is attested by the vast collection of trophies on view in the lobby. Though the major sports of football, basketball, and baseball were discontinued in 1976, the individual and life-time sports have continued a tradition of winning district and state championships. State and district rally honors have increased, as have the number of National Merit Students among the student body.

The main three to four story neo-Gothic brick and terra cotta building, along with a portion of the campus, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 6, 1986.

The 4th floor of the school used to be home to the band, orchestra, and pool for the swim team, but is now closed off to the student body. Elvis Presley played on the Baton Rouge High stage with Faron Young on May 2, 1955
The school also was used in 2009 as a location for the filming of parts of the film &quot;Ticking Clock&quot;.

The school had been temporarily moved to the old Lee High School building, due to renovations being done on the 1925 campus. Students returned to the renovated campus on August 8, 2012.
==Distinctions and awards==
The school was awarded the Blue Ribbon for Academic Excellence for the school years 1982–83 and 2003–04. The school offers 27 Advanced Placement classes, including Science Lab, with an additional American Government course speculated for 2008–2009. It has 20 honors courses, two dual enrollment courses through Baton Rouge Community College, and three foreign languages; French I-V, Spanish I-V, Latin I-V. Greek is offered sporadically and was last offered in 2012–2013. Due to faculty shortage, since 2007 Russian is no longer available. Similarly, German is no longer available as of 2022. Having a college-preparatory Magnet program, the school employs a rigorous curriculum resulting in almost all of its graduates attending college. The 270 students graduating in 2006 were offered over $8 million in college scholarships, with almost all going on to enter college.

Four graduates have also gone on to be named Rhodes Scholars after college.

It received a special award in 2004 from the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., distinguishing it as one of five schools in the nation excelling in performing arts. It was one of two high schools to receive this award. On March 21, 2005, the school performed and displayed aspects of its arts and performances programs on one of the Kennedy Center&#x27;s Millennium Stages.

The school is one of the few high schools in the nation to offer two student run radio stations on campus. The original FM station, WBRH, was joined in 1993 by an AM station, KBRH. They are both non-profit radio stations and are run with the financial support of the listening community. They publicly broadcast jazz on WBRH , and classic R&amp;B and local music on KBRH .

==Sports and athletics==

Baton Rouge Magnet High athletics competes in the LHSAA. The school has an unusual athletics program in that since 1976, it has not fielded a varsity football, basketball, or baseball team. This was a result of the school switching to the magnet program that year, changing the school&#x27;s official name from Baton Rouge High School to Baton Rouge Magnet High School.

===Athletic history===
The school has played in the 5A classification, the highest in the LHSAA, since moving up from 4A in 1998. It has won numerous state championships in many sports. Gymnastics and track and field programs are especially strong.

In 2003, the school had a banner year for sports, winning 5 state championships: women&#x27;s outdoor track, men&#x27;s outdoor track, women&#x27;s gymnastics, men&#x27;s gymnastics, and women&#x27;s cross country.

The women&#x27;s swim team was state runner-up in 2005. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s coach George Newport has won the city&#x27;s Coach of the Year award several times. Joanne Chien, class of 2010, won 5 individual state titles in her career, including setting a 5A record in the 100-yard backstroke in 2007.

The school&#x27;s football team won eight state championships in 1909, 1911, 1913, 1914, 1917, 1919, 1944 (Class 2A) and 1964 (Class 3A) before being disbanded in 1976. The team also made one unsuccessful appearance in the state title game in 1954 (Class 3A).

The school&#x27;s basketball team won State Championships in 1968 (3A), 1961 (3A), 1954 (2A), 1950 (2A), 1932 (1A), 1911 (2A), 1910 (1A), 1909 (1A)

The school has won the Southern Quality Ford Cup (previously Picadilly Cup), the all-sports trophy, several times, despite not competing in football, basketball, or baseball.

The cross-country program was a dominant force in the 1980s and early 1990s as the men&#x27;s team won 9 consecutive state titles from 1980 to 1988. The women&#x27;s program won 6 state titles and placed numerous individual state champions.

In recent times, the women&#x27;s outdoor track and field program has been one of the most dominant in the state, winning state championships in 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. They were also state runners-up in 2005 and 2006.

The men&#x27;s gymnastics team, as of the end of the 2010–2011 school year, under the tutelage of longtime coach Kevin Nee, has won 7 of the last 9 LHSAA state championships, including four straight from 2002 to 2005. In 2010, team Captain Chris Chu, class of 2011, won first all-around in the LHSAA state championship. The women&#x27;s team has placed in the top 3 in the state for 6 of the last 9 years, with one state championship in 2003.

The men&#x27;s cross country team has a two-time 5A state champion in Philipp Goettert (2006, 2007). Saul Rothschild was also a two-time state cross-country champion, in 1980 and 1981, when BRHS was classified as 3A (and the largest classification at the time was 4A).

Baton Rouge High also features a tennis team that has become more competitive in recent years. In the 2015–2016 season, Kelli Hu and Malini Bueche were runner-up at the regional and Division 1 state championships. They were also a part of the Girls Doubles All-Metro Team along with Baton Rouge High&#x27;s Ashley Alfred and Sophia Akinniyi. In the 2016–2017 season, the duo of Kelli Hu and Malini Bueche won the 5A regional championships, giving Baton Rouge High its first regional tennis victory in many years. Also, singles players Shola Akinniyi, Sophia Akinniyi, and Gabriel Young made it to the regional semifinals, and Logan Bueche advanced to the finals.

The soccer team competes in district 5 of the 5A classification of the Louisiana High School Athletic Association. As of 2011, the team has made the playoffs 6 of the last 7 years. In the 2010–2011 season, senior forward Naveed Asayesh scored 47 goals, placing him 3rd in the state and 2nd in 5A.

The women&#x27;s soccer team (as of 2010) has advanced to the regional playoffs (round of 16) each of the last four years, including reaching the state semifinals in 2009 as an underdog #6 seed, upsetting #3 Mt. Carmel 1–0 in the quarterfinals before losing to #1 Fontainebleau in a penalty kick shootout 3 to 2.

The girls&#x27; golf team placed 3rd in the 2010 Baton Rouge Metro High School Championship.

The most recent addition to the athletic roster is men&#x27;s bowling, which began play in the 2005–2006 school year, the same year the LHSAA held its first state championships in the sport.

In addition, the school has an intramural sports program consisting of American flag football, basketball, and volleyball.

==Visual and performing arts==
The school has music programs, including an award-winning choir, a jazz band and concert band, and a string orchestra.

The Choral Department has been directed by Robbie Giroir, the organist at St. Joseph Cathedral, for thirty years. They host an annual candlelight Christmas Concert in downtown Baton Rouge. Giroir has taken the Festival Singers, a small vocal ensemble, to venues around the world.

===Choral studies===
The BRMHS Department of Choral Studies offers choral singing, solo vocal literature, music theory, and the art of English handbell ringing. In 2007 the program had over seventy-five choristers.

The Choral Union is a principle choral ensemble of forty auditioned choristers. They perform in the Fall and Spring Concerts held in the Chapel of St. Alban&#x27;s on the LSU Campus, and the annual formal Candlelight Concert traditionally held in St. Joseph Cathedral in downtown Baton Rouge.

The Choral Union and Festival Singers have also performed in Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City. The Festival Singers have toured the United Kingdom where solo choral performances were given at Winchester Cathedral, St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Ely Cathedral, and the World War II Memorial Chapel (Ely). In 2005, the Festival Singers performed a concert tour of Germany and Austria.
In 2009, the Festival Singers went to Spain to perform in numerous cathedrals in cities such as Sevilla, Madrid, Toledo, Escorial, and Segovia. In 2011, they performed in Prague and Budapest. In February 2013, the Festival Singers traveled to Italy, where they toured and performed in the cities of Florence, Siena, Rome, and Pompeii, with a visit to the Vatican City where they performed in the final public audience of Pope Benedict XVI and sang a mass at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. In 2015, the Festival Singers traveled to Ireland, where they toured Armagh, Downpatrick, Galway, Connemara, Bunratty, Cashel, and Dublin. The BRMHS Festival Singers travel internationally every two years and are planning to travel to the Netherlands and Belgium in 2017.

Through competitive auditions, many BRMHS choristers are chosen for All-State and All-District Honor Choirs. Under the tenure of Robbie Giroir, the Department of Choral Studies has sung over twenty major choral works by noted composers and has produced over fifteen major musical productions on the BRMHS stage.

Many school Choristers have gone on to professional performing and music education careers that include Broadway and University Professors.

===Performing arts===
The school has the only student operated AM and FM radio stations in the country. The school was honored with a &quot;Creative Ticket in the Arts&quot; in 2005 by the Louisiana Division of the Arts and nominated for recognition on a national level.

In addition to the radio training program, the department offers multi-year courses in choral and instrumental music, drama, stagecraft, ballet, and television production.

The drama department produces several main stage and small stage plays each year. These include a Shakespearean play and a winter production in conjunction with the dance department. The later is performed each year for audiences of local elementary school children. The dance department also produces its own recitals, and many of the dancers perform with other dance companies.

The school offers instrumental courses including woodwind, jazz, and strings.

===Piano Department===
The piano department has a lab consisting of 19 full-size instruments, including Yamaha Clavinovas, and Rolands, as well as three 64-key Wurlitzer keyboards. Advanced students present two recitals each year. Students also perform for retirement homes and community functions. All styles of music are studied.

===Visual arts===
Visual artists at the school can take four years of art classes. Student artwork is displayed frequently at the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board office and various Baton Rouge galleries, and the department has its own show at the school each spring.

In 2008, art club members are finished a full-color mural on an outside wall of the school Performing Arts building. This mural no longer exists after the renovation, which left only the front part of the building intact.

===Orchestra===
The orchestra at Baton Rouge High, under the direction of Mr. Christopher Frazier, is also an award-winning program. They have performed in Carnegie Hall and at the Lincoln Center in New York City. The group has also participated in musical festival events in Atlanta, Memphis, and Dallas. The orchestra has over 100 members and also performs with the McKinley High Orchestra to form the BRM Orchestra. Placement in the orchestra of Baton Rouge Magnet High is determined by audition.

==Renovation project==

A large renovation and reconstruction project by the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board commenced in August 2010 and was completed in time for the start of the 2012–2013 school year. The project consisted of a complete renovation of the landmark school structure, and a demolition and reconstruction of the remaining structures. During the project, all students and staff were relocated to the previously shuttered Lee High School.

The Baton Rouge High Parent Faculty Club lead the way for safe storage of memorabilia items during renovations. Items were moved to storage prior to renovations and were safely returned when the renovations were completed.

<doc id="586393" wikidata="Q628072" url="?curid=586393" title="The Royal Scam">
<text>The Royal Scam is the fifth studio album by American rock band Steely Dan, released in May 1976, by ABC Records; reissues have been released by MCA Records since it acquired ABC in 1979. It was produced by Gary Katz. In the United States, the album peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, and it has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Music and lyrics==
In common with other Steely Dan albums, &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; is littered with cryptic allusions to people and events, both real and fictional. In a BBC interview in 2000, songwriters Walter Becker and Donald Fagen revealed that &quot;Kid Charlemagne&quot; is loosely based on Owsley Stanley, the notorious drug &quot;chef&quot; who was famous for manufacturing hallucinogenic compounds, and that &quot;The Caves of Altamira&quot; is about the loss of innocence, the narrative about a visitor to the Cave of Altamira who registers his astonishment at the prehistoric drawings.

&quot;The Fez&quot; has the distinction of being, other than the instrumental &quot;East St. Louis Toodle-Oo&quot; on &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; (1974), the only Steely Dan song with a credited writer other than Becker and Fagen. Of keyboardist Paul Griffin&#x27;s contribution to the song, Becker has said that &quot;There is an instrumental melody that Paul started playing in the session, and when we decided to build that melody up to a greater position, since we had some suspicion that perhaps this melody wasn&#x27;t entirely Paul&#x27;s invention, we decided to give him composer credit in case later some sort of scandal developed and he would take the brunt of the impact&quot;, while Griffin has said that Fagen already had the keyboard riff, and he just took it in a different direction. Fagen later said of Griffin, &quot;There are some musicians who are hacks, and then there are guys like Paul who can create something so different and unique they make the record.&quot; Chris Willman described the song in an August 22, 1993, article in &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;a cheerful ode to the importance of always wearing a condom&quot;.

===Reference to the Eagles===
&quot;Everything You Did&quot; features the lyric: &quot;Turn up the Eagles, the neighbors are listening.&quot; About the origin of the reference, Glenn Frey of the Eagles said: &quot;Apparently, Walter Becker&#x27;s girlfriend loved the Eagles, and she played them all the time. I think it drove him nuts. So, the story goes that they were having a fight one day and that was the genesis of the line.&quot; Later in 1976, in a nod back to Steely Dan for the free publicity, and inspired by the group&#x27;s lyrical style, the Eagles included the line: &quot;They stab it with their steely knives but they just can&#x27;t kill the beast&quot;, in their hit-song &quot;Hotel California&quot;. Frey explained: &quot;We just wanted to allude to Steely Dan rather than mentioning them outright, so &#x27;Dan&#x27; got changed to &#x27;knives&#x27;, which is still, you know, a penile metaphor.&quot; Given that the two bands shared a manager (Irving Azoff) and the Eagles have proclaimed their admiration for Steely Dan, this was more likely part of a friendly rivalry than a feud. Timothy B. Schmit, who sang backing vocals on &quot;The Royal Scam&quot;, joined the Eagles in 1977, after being a featured vocalist and bassist with Poco.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover features an image of a man in a suit sleeping on a bus stop bench in Boston and dreaming of skyscrapers with monstrous animal heads at the top. Zox originally created the painting of the skyscraper/beast hybrids for an unreleased Van Morrison album, and designer Ed Caraeff suggested superimposing a photograph of a sleeping vagrant taken by Charlie Ganse to make the cover for &quot;The Royal Scam&quot;. In the liner notes for the 1999 remastered reissue of the album, Fagen and Becker jokingly called it &quot;the most hideous album cover of the seventies, bar none (excepting perhaps &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;).&quot;

==Reception==

Upon its release, the album was not met with as much critical acclaim as its predecessors, with many reviewers finding that it did not show any musical progress. The original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review was more positive, however, and the magazine later gave the album five stars out of five in a Hall of Fame review.

In 2000, the album was voted number 868 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Singles==
*&quot;Kid Charlemagne&quot; spent three weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, reaching a peak position of number 82 in July 1976.
*&quot;The Fez&quot; spent five weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 59 in October 1976.
*&quot;Haitian Divorce&quot; spent nine weeks on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 17 in January 1977.

<doc id="586404" wikidata="Q2728811" url="?curid=586404" title="Premenstrual dysphoric disorder">
<text>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a mood disorder characterized by emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms. PMDD causes significant distress or impairment in menstruating people during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms occur in the luteal phase (between ovulation and menstruation), improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and are minimal or absent in the week after menses. PMDD has a profound impact on a people’s quality of life and dramatically increases the risk of suicidal ideation and even suicide attempts. Many people of reproductive age experience discomfort or mild mood changes prior to menstruation, but 5–8% experience severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS), causing significant distress or functional impairment. Within this population of reproductive age, some will meet the criteria for PMDD. 

PMDD&#x27;s exact cause is unknown. Ovarian hormone levels during the menstrual cycle do not differ between those with PMDD and the general population. But because symptoms are present only during ovulatory cycles and resolve after menstruation, it is believed to be caused by fluctuations in gonadal sex hormones or variations in sensitivity to sex hormones.

In 2017, National Institutes of Health researchers discovered that women with PMDD have genetic changes that make their emotional regulatory pathways more sensitive to estrogen and progesterone, as well as their chemical derivatives. The researchers believe this increased sensitivity may cause PMDD symptoms.

Studies have found that those with PMDD are more at risk of developing postpartum depression after pregnancy. PMDD was added to the list of depressive disorders in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; in 2013. It has 11 main symptoms, of which five must be present for a PMDD diagnosis. Roughly 20% of females have some PMDD symptoms, but either have fewer than five or do not have functional impairment.
First-line treatment for PMDD is with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can be administered continuously throughout the menstrual cycle or intermittently, with treatment only during the symptomatic phase (approximately 14 days per cycle). Hormonal therapy with oral contraceptives that contain drospirenone have also demonstrated efficiency in reducing PMDD symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy, whether in combination with SSRIs or alone, has shown to be effective in reducing impairment. Dietary modifications and exercise may also be helpful, but studies investigating these treatments have not demonstrated efficacy in reducing PMDD symptoms.

==Signs and symptoms==
Clinicians consider mood symptoms, physical symptoms and impact on the patient&#x27;s life in making the diagnosis of PMDD. Mood symptoms include emotional lability (rapidly changing emotions, sensitivity to rejection, etc.), irritability and anger that may lead to conflict, anxiety, feeling on edge, hopelessness, difficulty concentrating, appetite changes, sleeping more or less than usual, or feeling out of control. The physical symptoms are similar to the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. These include breast tenderness or swelling, joint pain, muscle pain, gaining weight, or feeling bloated.

Because of the broad variety in clinical presentation, the onset of symptoms only during or around the luteal phase is key for diagnosing someone with PMDD rather than any other mood disorders. PMDD follows a predictable, cyclic pattern. Symptoms begin in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation) and end or are markedly reduced shortly after menstruation begins. On average, the symptoms last six days but can start up to two weeks before menses, meaning symptoms can be felt for up to three weeks out of a cycle. Severe symptoms can begin and worsen until the onset of menstruation, with many not feeling relief until a few days after menstruation ends. The most intense symptoms occur in the week and days leading up to the first day of menstrual blood flow. The symptoms usually cease shortly after the start of the menstrual period or a few days after it ends. Various symptom and severity tracking questionnaires exist to document presence and severity of symptoms throughout consecutive menstrual cycles.

The International Society for the Study of Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD) defines two categories of premenstrual disorders: core PMD and variant PMD.

Core PMD has six characteristics, all mainly focusing on the cyclical nature of PMDD and its typical onset pre-menses tracked over the course of more than two menstrual cycles. The four classified variant PMDs involve more unexpected variables that cause the onset of premenstrual distress; such as, PMD with absent menstruation or premenstrual exacerbation, wherein the symptoms of another preexisting psychological disorder may be heightened as a result of PMDD onset.

== Epidemiology ==
About 5-8% of women who are of reproductive age experience severe premenstrual syndrome; most of them also meet the criteria for PMDD.

==Pathophysiology ==

PMDD mood symptoms are only present in menstruating women. Thus, symptoms do not occur during pregnancy, after menopause, or in women who have anovulatory cycles. Other mood disorders typically persist across all reproductive life events and are independent of a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle.

The current consensus on the cause of PMDD is a combination of heightened sensitivity to fluctuating levels of certain hormones (i.e. the reproductive hormones), environmental stress, and genetic predisposition. The sex steroids—estrogen and progesterone—are neuroactive; they have been noted in rat models to be involved in serotonin pathways. Serotonin is involved in mood regulation alongside estrogen, whose receptors are found in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus—the regions most known for their involvement in regulating one&#x27;s mood and cognition overall.

While the timing of symptoms suggests hormonal fluctuations as the cause of PMDD, a demonstrable hormonal imbalance in women with PMDD has not been identified. In fact, levels of reproductive hormones and their metabolites in women with and without PMDD are indistinguishable. It is instead hypothesized that women with PMDD are more sensitive to normal levels of hormone fluctuations, predominantly estrogen and progesterone, which produces biochemical events in the nervous system that cause the premenstrual symptoms. These symptoms are more predominant in women who have a predisposition to the disorder.

It is apparent that the premenstrual disorders are biologically driven and are not only psychological or cultural phenomena. PMDD has been reported by menstruating women worldwide, indicating a biological basis that is not geographically selective. Most psychologists infer that this disorder is caused by both a reaction to hormone flux and also genetic components. There is evidence of heritability of (retrospectively reported) premenstrual symptoms from several twin and family studies done in the 1990s, with the heritability of PMDD proving to be about 56%.

=== Genetic factors ===
Whether or not this disorder has a specific genetic basis is still being discussed in the academic community. The possible genetic factors contributing to PMDD also have yet to be thoroughly researched. However, multiple genetic factors that contribute to the moodiness, depression, irritability, increased appetite, trouble sleeping, acne, fluid retention, headaches, nausea, and other symptoms associated with this disorder have recently been identified.

Many studies have noted that a polymorphism of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF), a gene that helps support neurons in their function and survival in the brain by creating a protein that helps in the growth, maturation, and maintenance of these cells, may play a role in causing PMDD symptoms. This is because the result of this polymorphism mimics the hallmarks of PMDD: volatile moods, depression and irritability centered around the menstrual cycle. This gene has been studied extensively in its association with depression and, promisingly for PMDD research, mice homozygous for the BDNF polymorphism exhibited anxiety-like traits that fluctuated and changed around the mice&#x27;s estrus, analogous to the human&#x27;s menstruation, therefore mimicking some of the symptoms of PMDD.

=== Risk factors ===
Environmental stressors have also been found to prospectively increase risk for PMDD symptoms. Environmental components such as stress, hormonal fluctuation, and epigenetics play a key role in the pathology and onset of the disorder. Some studies have noted evidence of interpersonal trauma (domestic violence, physical or emotional trauma, or substance abuse) or seasonal changes (making PMDD potentially comorbid with seasonal affective disorder) having an impact on PMDD risk. But the most common pre-existing disorder found in those diagnosed with PMDD is major depression, wherein they either actually had it or were misdiagnosed when they should have only been diagnosed with PMDD. Finally, an easily modifiable risk factor for PMDD is cigarette smoking. One meta-analysis found dramatically increased risk of developing PMDD in menstruating women who smoke.

=== Relationship to pregnancy and menopause ===
Women with PMDD usually see their symptoms disappear while they are pregnant. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is primarily a mood disorder that is associated with onset of menstruation; pregnancy, menopause, and hysterectomies all cause menstruation to cease, thereby stopping the proposed sex steroid-/serotonin-caused symptoms from occurring. Although one might expect a higher rate of postpartum depression among those with PMDD, a large study of women with prospectively confirmed PMDD did not find a higher prevalence of postpartum depression than in controls. If a woman had experienced PPD beforehand, there was found to be a less-than 12% chance of PMDD pathology emerging—hardly any differentiation from the regular population of those who have never experienced postpartum depression. However, PMDD symptoms can get worse following pregnancy, or other associated events such as birth and miscarriage.

===Mental health comorbidities===
The lifetime incidence of other psychiatric disorders is high among women with PMDD. An older review article (2002) utilizing the previous edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) which used studies from 1966 to 2002 on PMS and mental health disorders and selected for patients who retrospectively met the diagnostic criteria for PMDD found that major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder often co-occur in PMDD. Another systematic review study suggests that patients with bipolar disorder, type I or II, have a higher incidence of PMDD. While the diagnosis of PMDD requires a mental health provider to determine that the symptoms a woman is facing are not due to an underlying mental or physical health condition, it is important to note that other conditions often co-occur and impact the quality of life and treatment plan for people with PMDD.

=== Suicidality ===

Previous links to suicidality and PMS have been made, but women with PMDD are more likely still to consider and attempt suicide even when controlling for mental health comorbidities. Despite the increase in suicidal ideation and attempts in this population, the data currently suggests that suicidal ideation or action is not more likely to occur during the late luteal phase when PMDD symptoms would occur. It is difficult to study whether treatment reduces suicidality because of the multifaceted reasons provided for suicidal ideation. However, treatment has been well documented to reduce physical and emotional symptoms of PMDD.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnostic criteria for PMDD are provided by a number of expert medical guides. Diagnosis can be supported by having women who are seeking treatment for PMDD use a daily charting method to record their symptoms. Daily charting helps to distinguish when mood disturbances are experienced and allows PMDD to be more easily distinguished from other mood disorders. With PMDD, mood symptoms are present only during the luteal phase, or last two weeks, of the menstrual cycle. While PMDD mood symptoms are of a cyclical nature, other mood disorders are variable or constant over time. Although there is a lack of consensus on the most efficient instrument by which to confirm a PMDD diagnosis, several validated scales for recording premenstrual symptoms include the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences (COPE), Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), and Prospective Record of the Severity of Menstruation (PRISM). In the context of research, standardized numerical cutoffs are often applied to verify the diagnosis. The difficulty of diagnosing PMDD is one reason that it can be challenging for lawyers to cite the disorder as a defense of crime, in the very rare cases where PMDD is allegedly associated with criminal violence.

===DSM-5===
The DSM-5 established seven criteria (A through G) for the diagnosis of PMDD, which are paraphrased below. There is overlap between the criteria for PMDD in the DSM-5 and the criteria found in the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP).

According to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of PMDD requires the presence of at least five of these symptoms, with one of the symptoms being numbers 1–4. These symptoms should occur during the week before menses and remit after initiation of menses. In order to meet criteria for the diagnosis, the symptoms should be charted prospectively for two consecutive ovulation cycles in order to confirm the temporal and cyclical nature of the symptoms. The symptoms should also be severe enough to affect normal work, school, social activities, and/or relationships with others.

The symptoms of Criteria A-C must have been met for most menstrual cycles that occurred in the preceding year, and must have caused significant impairment in family, work, school, or social functioning. (&quot;Criterion D&quot;).

Timing

Criterion A: During most menstrual cycles throughout the past year, at least 5 of the symptoms outlined in Criterion B and Criterion C must be present in the final week before the onset of menses, must start to improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and become minimal or absent in the week post-menses.

Symptoms

Criterion B: One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:

# Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings, feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection)
# Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts
# Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts
# Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge

Criterion C: One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present additionally, to reach a total of 5 symptoms when combined with present symptoms from &quot;Criterion B&quot; above:

# Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school, friends, hobbies).
# Subjective difficulty in concentration.
# Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.
# Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings.
# Hypersomnia or insomnia. 
# A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.
# Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of &quot;bloating&quot;, or weight gain.

Severity

Criterion D: The symptoms observed in Criteria A-C are associated with clinically significant distress or interference with work, school, usual social activities, or relationships with others (e.g., avoidance of social activities; decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).

Consideration of Other Psychiatric Disorders

&quot;Criterion E&quot;: The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), or a personality disorder—although it may co-occur with any of these disorders.

Confirmation of the Disorder

&quot;Criterion F&quot;: Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least two symptomatic cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation.

&quot;Criterion G&quot;: The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., drug abuse, a medication, other treatments) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

Clinically significant distress is not defined explicitly by the DSM-IV, where it has been critiqued by multiple scholars as being too vague, and potentially detrimental for those who have symptoms of depression, anxiety, or other mood disorders because they do not meet the clinical significance requirement.

===ICD 11===
Diagnostic criteria for PMDD are also provided by the 2016 World Health Organization&#x27;s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11-CM):

=== Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the International Society for the Study of Premenstrual Disorders ===
Other organizations that have published diagnostic criteria for PMDD include the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the International Society for the Study of Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD). The ISPMD was a consensus group established by an international multidisciplinary group of experts. The group&#x27;s diagnostic criteria for PMDD focus on the cyclic nature of the symptoms occurring during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, as well as the symptoms being absent after menstruation and before ovulation and causing significant impairment. The ISPMD diagnostic criteria for PMDD do not specify symptom characteristics or number of symptoms.

===Differential diagnosis===
Part of diagnosing PMDD is ruling out underlying psychiatric disorder or physical illness that can cause similar symptoms. That exhibits premenstrual exacerbation, the menopausal transition, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, as well as other mood disorders. Furthermore, many medical disorders are worsened prior to ordering menses, but these typically do not present strictly during the luteal phase.

Mood disorders – there is potential for patients to have psychiatric disorders with superimposed PMDD or psychiatric disorders. In order to establish the timeline of symptoms required for a diagnosis of PMDD symptoms need to be tracked using scales like the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences or the Daily Record of Severity of Problems.

Menopausal transition – affective symptoms associated with the menopausal transition most commonly start when menstrual cycle starts to become irregular or anovulatory, whereas PMDD symptoms occur during the luteal phase of ovulatory cycles.

Thyroid disorders—patients with both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism may present with affective symptoms. The patient&#x27;s history is very important to determine whether the provider should suspect thyroid disorders. Patients should also have thyroid hormone levels checked to ensure no underlying thyroid disorder is present.

==Treatment==

=== Medication ===
Several medications have been shown to effectively reduce the physical and emotional symptoms of PMDD.

=== Antidepressant treatment ===
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line medication. Women taking SSRIs to ease PMDD generally report &gt;50% alleviation in symptoms, which was significant improvement compared to placebo. Two approaches to dosing have been studied: continuous dosing (daily) and luteal dosing (14 days before menstruation and discontinuing at the onset of menses). Both dosing schedules have similar effectiveness with some recent studies demonstrating greater symptom control with continuous dosing.

Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have also been studied in the treatment of PMDD and shown efficacy in reducing symptoms. These are an alternative for patients who do not respond to SSRI&#x27;s. However, they are more likely to be dosed continuously due to SNRI discontinuation syndrome - a flu-like feeling caused by dropping blood levels of SNRI.

The rapid onset of anxiolytic and anti-dysphoric effects of SSRIs and SNRIs in PMDD contrast with their delayed efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD). Some SSRI and SNRIs have been demonstrated to induce inhibitory neurosteroid synthesis, with a select few observed to do so at doses inactive on serotonin reuptake. It has been proposed that this effect may underlie the accelerated efficacy of SSRIs and SNRIs in PMDD relative to MDD.

=== Anxiolytics ===
Two medications typically given to reduce acute anxiety have been studied in treatment for PMDD: alprazolam (Xanax) and buspirone. Alprazolam carries a risk of abuse and causes central nervous system depression and results of clinical trials have not shown benefit to treatment. Buspirone showed lower efficacy than SSRI, but may be used as an adjunctive treatment or alternative if SSRI side effects are intolerable to the patient.

=== Psychotherapy ===
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective for reducing premenstrual symptoms in women with (retrospectively-reported) PMS. CBT is an evidence-based approach for treating depression and focuses on the link between mood, thoughts, and actions to help women address current issues and symptoms. When CBT was compared to SSRI alone or in combination with SSRI, groups receiving CBT had significant improvement of PMS symptoms. Through the practice of CBT, women are better able to recognize and modify recurrent issues as well as thought and behavior patterns that interfere with functioning well or that make depressive symptoms worse. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that existing psychotherapies may be primarily useful for reducing impairment (rather than symptom severity) in PMDD.

=== Hormonal treatment ===

Oral contraceptives have been effective in reducing PMS symptoms, but only certain formulations have proven to be modestly effective in the treatment of PMDD. Transdermal estrogen and intrauterine devices containing levonorgestrel have also had modest efficacy.

Another FDA approved treatment for women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder who have impairments with function is an oral contraceptive with ethinylestradiol and drospirenone (progestin) taken on a 24-4 schedule (24 active pills, 4 inactive pills). Hormonal birth control containing drospirenone and low levels of estrogen (ethinylestradiol) helps relieve severe symptoms related to premenstrual dysphoric disorder, for at least the first three months that it is used. It is not clear if this approach is effective for more than three menstrual cycles. The placebo effect has not been ruled out. The idea behind using oral contraceptives is to suppress ovulation, therefore suppressing sex hormone fluctuations.

Another treatment, typically used when other options have failed, is injection of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) agonist with adjunctive estrogen and progesterone or tibolone. This is a last resort because GnRH antagonists can cause medical menopause by shutting down the body&#x27;s pathway for reproductive hormones called the hypothalamic, pituitary, gonadal axis. As a result, GnRH therapy presents increased risk of osteopenia (decreased bone density) and cardiovascular disease. This therapy is often reserved for patients considering surgical menopause to test the outcome of the surgery.

=== Surgical menopause ===
In a minority of patient who meet specific criteria and drug-based treatments are ineffective or produce significant side effects, hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy followed by estrogen replacement therapy is an option Typically, the uterus is removed during the same surgery, and the women is prescribed a low-dose estrogen patch to reduce the symptoms produced by surgically induced menopause. There are five guidelines that should be considered before undergoing a surgical treatment. The vast majority of women with PMDD will not require surgical treatment to experience resolution of symptoms.

* The diagnosis of PMDD must be confirmed
* GnRH agonist therapy must be the only medical therapy that has been effective and it must have been effective continuously for a minimum of six months
* Tolerance of estrogen replacement therapy has been tested
* The woman does not desire further children
* The woman&#x27;s age warrants several more years of therapy

=== Adjunctive and alternative treatments ===
Other proposed treatments include dietary modification, herbal remedies including St John&#x27;s Wort and chasteberry, acupuncture, and exercise. Some evidence suggests caffeine, sugar and alcohol intake may increase PMS symptoms. A review article claimed significant improvement of PMS symptoms with herbal treatments and acupuncture but the studies selected for review did not stratify severity of symptoms. Finally, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends regular aerobic exercise to reduce PMS symptoms. The first trials have been approved to study microdosing LSD for the treatment of PMS and PMDD.

==History==
In the 18th century, there were early accounts of weeping and other symptoms recurring almost every month, and in 1822 Prichard gave this description: &quot;Many women … display a degree of excitement and irritation … at the period of menstruation; these are chiefly females of very irritable habits. In such instances, … an unusual vehemence of feeling and expression is observed … or there is torpor and dejection of mind with a despondent disposition&quot;. In 1827 a German mother was acquitted of infanticide on the grounds of menstrual mood disorder. Premenstrual tension was also described in the French literature of the early 19th century. Nearly one hundred years later, there were American descriptions of a cyclic personality change appearing 10–14 days before, and ending dramatically at the menses.

The diagnostic category was discussed in the DSM-IIIR (1987), in which the proposed condition was named &quot;Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder&quot; and was included in the appendix as a proposed diagnostic category needing further study. Preparations for the DSM-IV led to debate about whether to keep the category at all, only keep it in the appendix, or remove it entirely; the reviewers determined that the condition was still too poorly studied and defined, so it was kept in the appendix but elaborated with diagnostic criteria to aid further study.

As preparations were underway in 1998 for the DSM-IV-TR, the conversation changed, as Eli Lilly and Company paid for a large clinical trial of fluoxetine as a potential treatment for the condition that was then conducted by Canadian academics and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1995. Other studies have been conducted as well, wherein all found that approximately 60% of women with PMDD in the trials improved with the drug; representatives from Lilly &amp; Co. and the FDA participated in the discussion.

Various strong stances were taken in said discussion. Sally Severino, a psychiatrist, argued that because symptoms were more prevalent in the United States, PMDD was a culture-bound syndrome and not a biological condition; she also claimed it unnecessarily pathologized the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle. Jean Endicott, another psychiatrist and chair of the committee, has argued that it was a valid condition from which women suffer and should be diagnosed and treated, and has claimed that if the symptoms were felt by males, far more effort and research would have been done by that moment. In the end the committee kept PMDD in the appendix.

The decision has been criticized as being driven by Lilly&#x27;s financial interests, and possibly by financial interests of members of the committee who had received funding from Lilly. Paula Caplan, a psychologist who had served on the committee for the DSM-IV, noted at the time of the DSM-IV-TR decision that there was evidence that calcium supplements could treat PMDD but the committee gave it no attention. She had also claimed that the diagnostic category is harmful to women with PMDD, leading them to believe they are mentally ill, and potentially leading others to mistrust them in situations as important as job promotions or child custody cases. She has called PMDD a fake disorder. Nada Stotland has expressed concern that women with PMDD may actually have a more serious condition like major depressive disorder or may be facing difficult circumstances—such domestic abuse—and therefore may have their true issues remain undiagnosed and mismanaged if their gynecologist diagnoses them with PMDD and gives them drugs to treat it.

The validity of PMDD was once more heavily debated when it came time to create the DSM-5 in 2008. In the end it was moved out of the appendix and into the main text as a formal category. A review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry published in 2014 examined the arguments against inclusion, which it summarized as:
# the PMDD label will harm women economically, politically, legally, and domestically;
# there is no equivalent hormone-based medical label for males;
# the research on PMDD is faulty;
# PMDD is a culture-bound condition;
# PMDD is due to situational, rather than biological, factors; and
# PMDD was fabricated by pharmaceutical companies for financial gain. 
Each argument was addressed and researchers found:
# No evidence of harm;
# no equivalent hormone-driven disorder has been discovered in men despite research seeking it;
# the research base has matured and many more reputable studies have been performed;
# several cases of PMDD have been reported or identified;
# a small minority of women do have the condition; and
# while there has been financial conflict of interest, it has not made the available research unusable.

It concluded that women have historically been under-treated and told that they were making their symptoms up, and that the formal diagnostic criteria would spur more funding, research, diagnosis and treatment for women with PMDD.

<text>Nebra (official name: Nebra (Unstrut), ) is a town in the district of Burgenlandkreis of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is situated on the river Unstrut. Nebra has become nationally and internationally known as the site where the Nebra sky disc, a notable Bronze Age artifact, was discovered. The town has a population of around 3,300.

== Geography ==
===Location===
Nebra lies between Querfurt and Naumburg on the Unstrut river in the west of Burgenlandkreis district.

=== Subdivisions===
=== Neighboring communities===
Neighboring towns are Querfurt, Barnstädt and Steigra (all three in Saalekreis) to the north, Karsdorf to the east, Bad Bibra to the south and Kaiserpfalz to the west.

==History==

The oldest historical documents mentioning Nebra date back to 876. Town privileges were acquired in the 12th century.

Nebra Castle was built in 1540 by the von Nißmitz brothers.

For many centuries, red sandstone was mined in the region which was used for castles and farmhouses.

Between 1952 and 1994, Nebra was the seat of the Nebra municipality in Halle district.

The name of the town was changed on 1 January 1998, from &quot;Nebra&quot; to &quot;Nebra (Unstrut)&quot;.

On 1 July 2009 the previously separate village of Wangen was merged with Nebra, and on 1 September 2010 the village Reinsdorf was annexed.

Nebra today features the Courths-Mahler archives and &quot;Arche Nebra&quot;, a museum on the history of the Nebra sky disk. The sky disc itself is exhibited at the Halle State Museum of Prehistory.

In 1962, four Magdalenian figurines were found near Nebra from the late Upper Paleolithic, which belong to the oldest known artwork in Saxony-Anhalt. The figures are 12,000 to 14,000 years old.

The Nebra sky disk was found in Wangen near Nebra in 1999. It only became public in 2002 when the finders tried to sell it and were eventually arrested following a sting operation in Basel, Switzerland. The sky disc is thought to have been created between 2100 and 1700 BCE and to have been buried in approximately 1600 BCE.

<text>Queanbeyan ( ) is a city in south-eastern New South Wales, Australia, located adjacent to the Australian Capital Territory in the Southern Tablelands region. Located on the Queanbeyan River, the city is the council seat of the Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council. At the , the Queanbeyan part of the Canberra–Queanbeyan built-up area had a population of 37,511.

Queanbeyan&#x27;s economy is based on light construction, manufacturing, service, retail and agriculture. Canberra, Australia&#x27;s capital, is located to the west, and Queanbeyan is a commuter town. The word &quot;Queanbeyan&quot; is the anglicised form of &quot;Quinbean&quot;, an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;clear waters&quot;.

== History ==
The first inhabitants of Queanbeyan were the Ngambri peoples of the Walgalu Nation. 

The town grew from a squattage held by ex-convict and inn keeper, Timothy Beard, on the banks of the Molonglo River in what is now Oaks Estate. The town centre of Queanbeyan is located on the Queanbeyan River, a tributary of the Molonglo River and approximately south-southeast of Oaks Estate.

Queanbeyan was officially proclaimed a township in 1838 when the population was about 50. The local parish was also known by that name and later still the member for the electorate of Queanbeyan held a seat in the legislative assembly of the colony of NSW. On 28 November 1837 the Colonial Secretary announced the appointment of Captain Alured Tasker Faunce as resident police magistrate at Queanbeyan. His homestead, called Dodsworth, was situated on the banks of the Queanbeyan river opposite the town. The town plan was laid out by surveyor James Larmer, in 1838.

Traces of gold were discovered in 1851 and lead and silver mines also flourished briefly. Settlers were harassed by bushrangers, of which James Shaw, William Millet, and John Rueben, John Tennant, Jacky Jacky, Frank Gardiner and Ben Hall were some of the more notorious. In 1836, a Post Office was established.

The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited (CBC, now part of the National Australia Bank) opened in Queanbeyan on 19 September 1859. The Bank of New South Wales began service in Queanbeyan in 1878. &quot;The Golden Age&quot; (now &quot;The Queanbeyan Age&quot;) was Queanbeyan&#x27;s first newspaper and was founded in 1860 by John Gale. In 1880 the residence of John James Wright, the first mayor of Queanbeyan, was constructed along the edge of the Queanbeyan River. In 1982 that building became the Queanbeyan Art Centre.

The Salvation Army claimed an outpost in Queanbeyan in 1884.

Queanbeyan became an increasingly successful primary producing district, and was proclaimed a Municipality in February 1885 incorporating an area of . The railway reached Queanbeyan railway station in 1887 and it became the junction for the lines going to Canberra and Bombala. The town is served by the thrice-daily NSW TrainLink Xplorer service between Canberra and Sydney.
William James Farrer, the wheat experimentalist, established Queanbeyan&#x27;s reputation as an agricultural district with his famous &quot;Federation&quot; rust-free strain, developed on his property &quot;Lambrigg&quot; at Tharwa. Farrer&#x27;s work was only slowly recognised elsewhere in Australia, but local farmers supported him, particularly in his development of &quot;Blount&#x27;s Lambrigg&quot;, another strain which in 1889 gave hope to farmers after the disastrous season of 1887 when crops had failed after heavy Christmas rains.

At the height of its rural prosperity Queanbeyan boasted sixteen public houses and six flourmills powered by wind, water, horse and steam. The Royal Hotel on Monaro Street opened in 1926. In Canberra alcohol was prohibited from 1911, at the time of the territory&#x27;s foundation, until 1928, when Federal Parliament had relocated from Melbourne. In that period many of the capital&#x27;s residents crossed the border to drink at one of Queanbeyan&#x27;s hotels.

Queanbeyan was granted city status on 7 July 1972. On 21 July 1975 the Queen&#x27;s Bridge was opened. This bridge took pressure off the existing bridge in linking Monaro Street directly to the east. From 1982 to 1989, the Canberra Raiders rugby league team played their home games in Queanbeyan, at Seiffert Oval.

Since December 2008, the Australian Defence Forces&#x27;s HQ Joint Operations Command has been based adjacent to the Kowen district of the Australian Capital Territory, just south of the Kings Highway, about 15 km east of Queanbeyan, and 15 km south of Bungendore, New South Wales.

On 3 December, Queanbeyan hosts an annual Festival of Ability as part of the Don&#x27;t DIS my ABILITY campaign, celebrating International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The event attracts more than 3,500 people and is a community celebration, acknowledging the strengths, skills and achievements of people with a disability in the Queanbeyan region.

Queanbeyan hosts several car shows through the year among them being Shannons Wheels in March 2020, and &quot;Terribly British Day&quot; in early December, a car and bike show that has been held in the Australian Capital Territory region since 1975. The show was in years past held on the lawns of Old Parliament House.

In March 2008, the Queanbeyan Performing Arts Centre – &quot;the Q&quot; – became the new home for the &quot;Queanbeyan Players&quot; who have provided over thirty years of live theatre and dramatic entertainment for the Queanbeyan community.

Canberra&#x27;s Harmonie German Club holds an Oktoberfest over a three-day period every year in October. Previously held at Exhibition Park in Canberra (EPIC), in 2017 the event moved over the border to the Queanbeyan Showground on 27–29 October.

In 2021 a scaled-down, 2 day, version of the Canberra-based National Folk Festival, cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, titled &quot;Good Folk&quot;, was held in Queanbeyan, across Saturday 3 April and Sunday 4 April.

== Historic places and monuments ==

*1838 Anna Maria Faunce memorial: The oldest memorial grave-stone in existence in Queanbeyan was/is that of Anna Maria Faunce (born 30 November 1838), the eight-month-old daughter of Captain Allured Tasker Faunce. The Memorial had not been seen for many years and was rediscovered by the Wheeler family. The broken stone pieces were taken to the Queanbeyan Museum to arrange for repairs, sighted in broken pieces in a box at the Museum in the late 1990s, but the location now, is unknown.
*1903 Queanbeyan Boer War memorial: Made of sandstone, the original memorial, had a gas light on top and was placed at the Monaro and Crawford Streets intersection in Queanbeyan, it was damaged when hit by a truck in the early 1950s and was repaired and re-erected on the same site. In 1955 the re-erected 1903 Boer War memorial was hit again by the same truck and same driver, Henry Ford, but this time it could not be repaired. As Veterans from the Boer War were still alive and wanted the 1903 Boer War memorial repaired/replaced, a public subscription was raised and a concrete replica memorial was cast and erected in 1964 in the centre-medium strip in Lowe Street, opposite the back of the Queanbeyan Courthouse. Although the memorial is a replica and although all the Boer War Veterans have since died, the remembrance, sentiment and respect for those who fought in the Boer War remains; Queanbeyan City Council undertakes regular conservation work, and the Queanbeyan RSL places a wreath on the Boer War Memorial each ANZAC DAY.
*1923 Soldiers Memorial: Originally named the Soldiers Memorial, unveiled on 25 April 1923 Anzac Day but over time this memorial has had many local names such as the World War 1 memorial, World War 1 and 2 memorial and the World Wars memorial etc. but for many years has also been referred to as the Memorial for all Wars and all who served, be they men or women, who gave service in any capacity. General manager (now retired) Hugh Percy was the man who kicked the local Queanbeyan ANZAC Day ceremony off and got it growing and now every year the local Queanbeyan ANZAC Day ceremony grows bigger and better.
*1936–1938 William Farrer memorial: Located on the central medium strip in Farrer Place, this sandstone and bronze memorial was unveiled in two ceremonies, 1936 and 1938. In 1936 the central sandstone column with the larger than life William Farrer bronze portrait bust at the top, with Raynor Hoff, the artist&#x27;s signature on the bust and the large central plaque with &quot;Farrer&#x27;s quote&quot; underneath the bust, were unveiled in 1936; The four smaller wheat-industry bronze-relief plaques (two on either side of the central sandstone column) were probably completed by other artists in Hoff&#x27;s studio and were unveiled in 1938, during Queanbeyan&#x27;s 1938 centenary celebrations.

<text>Le Grand Kallé et l&#x27;African Jazz, often simply referred to as African Jazz, was a popular and extremely influential Congolese rumba band from the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. Founded in 1953 in Léopoldville (modern-day Kinshasa) under Belgian colonial rule, the band was led by Joseph Kabasele Tshamala, popularly known by his stage name Le Grand Kallé. The group saw its heyday between 1958 and 1962, after which it was hit by defections by its members in 1963. It was briefly revived after 1966.

==History==
African Jazz emerged from the vibrant urban culture of Léopoldville during the last decade of Belgian rule in the Congo. Its music, driven by members of the rising African middle class, became popular during the move towards independence as an expression of rising national self-confidence. The new musical style, pioneered by the group, brought together foreign musical influences and western instruments with indigenous musical rhythms. The band itself was created at the initiative of Joseph Kabasele Tshamala, known as Le Grand Kallé, in 1953.

The band reached the apogee of its success between 1958 and 1962. Travelling to Belgium in 1960 at the time of negotiations on the Congo&#x27;s independence, African Jazz was one of the first groups to introduce African popular music into the European market. The band produced the hit &quot;Indépendance Cha Cha&quot; soon afterwards, which is a mixture between Lingala language and French loanwoards, that helped it become a hit both in Congo and outside the country&#x27;s borders.

During its early development, African Jazz maintained a strong rivalry with Leopoldville&#x27;s other major &quot;rumba orchestra&quot;, OK Jazz, led by Franco Luambo Makiadi. The rivalry manifested in a move towards different musical styles by both bands which would define the two schools of Congolese rumba that emerged in the period. African Jazz played an important role in introducing new musicians to the Congolese public. These included Nico Kasanda (known as Docteur Nico) and Tabu Ley Rochereau, both of whom would become important rumba musicians in their own right after the mid-1960s. Anthropologist Bob W. White has compared the &quot;clean, cosmopolitan, modernist sound&quot; of African Jazz by the mid-1960s with the &quot;more rootsy traditionalist sound&quot; of OK Jazz to illustrate the argument.

In July 1963, the African Jazz split with all its musicians leaving to form a new group, African Fiesta, leaving Kallé as African Jazz&#x27;s only member. In 1966, Kallé reconstructed the band with a new group of musicians and embarked on an overseas tour, but the new group fell apart in 1967–68 with musicians leaving to form a new band.

<text>Athene Seyler (31 May 188912 September 1990) was an English actress.

== Early life ==
She was born in Hackney, London; her German-born grandparents moved to the United Kingdom, where her grandfather Philip Seyler was a merchant in London. Athene Seyler was educated at Coombe Hill School in Surrey, a progressive co-educational school which disliked petitionary prayer and whose advanced biology classes studied Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. Seyler took part in an anti-blood sports demonstration, during which pupils captured the fox from the local hunt.

She was also active in the South Place Ethical Society during the 1920s, where her father Clarence H. Seyler took his family for many years to hear Moncure Conway lecture as an alternative to attending a religious Sunday service. Clarence ran a class for the study of Herbert Spencer, contributed to the South Place magazine on rationalist matters and wrote a treatise on birth control which he circulated privately among his family.

==Career==
Seyler first appeared on the stage in 1909, and was initially known as a stage actress. She made her film debut in 1921, and subsequently became known for playing slightly dotty old ladies in many British films from the 1930s to the 1960s.

In 1933, Seyler together with Nicholas Hannen, took a company which included Hannen&#x27;s daughter by his first marriage, Hermione Hannen, on a well-received tour of the Far East and Australia.

Her stage credits included Mrs Malaprop in &quot;The Rivals&quot;, Lady Bracknell in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and a double-act, with her good friend Dame Sybil Thorndike, as the murderous spinster sisters in &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;.

Her film and television career lasted into the 1960s, and included roles in &quot;The Citadel&quot; (1938), &quot;Night of the Demon&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1964, 1965). She was also a regular cast member in screen adaptations of Charles Dickens&#x27; novels. Although her silent film appearance in &quot;Pickwick&quot; (1921) is missing, she played the elderly fiancée in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1952). She was cast as a Chinese woman in &quot;Passport to China&quot; (1960).

Seyler virtually retired from acting after 1970 but continued making public appearances until well into the 1980s, and as a guest of Terry Wogan on his eponymous BBC chat show. In 1988, at the age of 99, she was the castaway on radio&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. In 1990, at the age of 101, she appeared at the National Theatre, talking about her long life and career.

Athene Seyler was President of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) from 1950, and a member of the Theatrical Ladies&#x27; Guild. She also wrote &quot;The Craft of Comedy&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1959. In 1989 she was honoured as &quot;Personality of the Century&quot; by the Grand Order of Water Rats.

==Marriages and relationships==

On 14 February 1914, she married James Bury Sterndale-Bennett (1889–1941), a grandson of the composer Sir William Sterndale Bennett, and they had a daughter, Jane Ann (1917–2015).

In 1922, she met and started living with fellow actor Nicholas &quot;Beau&quot; Hannen, son of Sir Nicholas Hannen. Hannen was married, and his wife refused a divorce. In 1928, Seyler formally changed her name to Athene Hannen, but she continued to use Seyler professionally. In 1960, she and Hannen were married after his wife died. At the age of 90, Seyler told the interviewer David McGillivray that &quot;she hadn&#x27;t been made a Dame because for most of her life she lived with a man who wasn&#x27;t her husband.&quot;

==Portraits==

The British National Portrait Gallery has numerous photos of Seyler.

The Australian National Portrait Gallery website has a portrait of Hannen and Seyler together.

==Death==

Athene Seyler died in 1990, aged 101, and her ashes were placed in the Hannen Columbarium in St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, Wargrave.

<doc id="586463" wikidata="Q1761524" url="?curid=586463" title="Supermarine Stranraer">
<text>The Supermarine Stranraer is a flying boat designed and built by the British Supermarine Aviation Works company at Woolston, Southampton. It was developed during the 1930s on behalf of its principal operator, the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was the RAF&#x27;s last and fastest biplane flying boat.

Derived from the Supermarine Scapa, the aircraft&#x27;s design was heavily shaped by Specification R.24/31, issued in 1931. After an initial rejection by the Air Ministry, Supermarine persisted with development as a private venture under the designation Southampton V. During 1933, a contract was placed for a single prototype; it was around this time that the type was named after Stranraer. First flown on 24 July 1934, the Stranraer entered frontline service with the RAF during 1937; most examples of the type were in service by the outbreak of World War II.

The Stranraers typically undertook anti-submarine and convoy escort patrols during the early years of the conflict. During March 1941, the model was withdrawn from frontline service, but continued to be operated in a training capacity until October 1942. In addition to the British-built aeroplanes, the Canadian Vickers company in Montreal, Quebec, also manufactured 40 Stranraers under licence for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). These Canadian Stranraers served in anti-submarine and coastal defence capacities on both Canada&#x27;s Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and were in regular service until 1946. Following their withdrawal from military service, many ex-RCAF Stranraers were sold off to fledgling regional airlines, with whom they served in various commercial passenger and freighter operations into the 1950s.

==Design and development==
===Background===

The Supermarine Stranraer, which was directly derived from the Supermarine Scapa, was the final aircraft in a series of flying boats designed by R. J. Mitchell for the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was produced by Supermarine at Woolston, Southampton between 1925 and 1936. Development of the series begab during the early 1930s, with Supermarine&#x27;s design team headed by Mitchell.

The project was pursued as a response to the Air Ministry&#x27;s issuing of Specification R.24/31 in 1931, which called for a general purpose coastal reconnaissance flying boat for the RAF. This specification demandeds included a payload greater than that of the Scapa and the ability to maintain level flight on only a single engine, which the Scapa could not do. Supermarine&#x27;s initial response to the specification was a larger model of the Scapa; the company competed against a bid from Saunders-Roe.

The Air Ministry favoured Saunders-Roe&#x27;s proposal and rejected Supermarine&#x27;s design. Despite this, Supermarine chose to continue development work on the design as a private venture, which was first known as the Supermarine Southampton V.

===Prototypes and production===
In 1933 a contract was placed for a single prototype powered by two Bristol Pegasus IIIM engines, and the type was named the Stranraer. On 27 July 1934 the first prototype, &quot;K3973&quot;, made its maiden flight, piloted by Joseph Summers. Over the following months, a relatively intense initial flight test programme was conducted. On 24 October 1934 it was delivered to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment (MAEE) at RAF Felixstowe for official trials. 

On 29 August 1935, soon after the completion of proving flights, an initial order for 17 aircraft (serial numbers &quot;K7287&quot; to &quot;K7303&quot;) was placed by the Air Ministry to fulfil Specification 17/35; six more aircraft (&quot;K9676&quot; to &quot;K9681&quot;) were ordered in May 1936. The first production standard aircraft made its first flight in December 1936, and entered service operation with the RAF on 16 April 1937. The final Stranraer was delivered on 3 April 1939. In addition, a total of 40 Stranraers were manufactured under licence in Canada by Canadian Vickers Limited, as both Supermarine and Canadian Vickers were subsidiaries of Vickers-Armstrongs.

==Description==

The Stranraer was a six-seater, twin-engined biplane flying boat. Its empty weight was , with a maximum take-off weight of .}

As the design of the Stranraer progressed, it was changed from that of the Scapa, having a two-bay structure. The Stranraer&#x27;s weight, and the surface area and span of its wings, were 12 per cent greater; the elevator was also 7 per cent larger, while the rudders featured trim tabs capable of holding the aircraft straight under single-engine flight. The Rolls-Royce Kestrel was initially considered as a powerplant, but eventually the moderately supercharged Bristol Pegasus IIIM radial engine was selected, . Much of the airframe was alclad, while detailed fittings were made of stainless steel; metal components were anodised as an anti-corrosion measure. For additional strength, a pair of interplane struts were introduced. The hull was considerably larger, its cross-section being increased by 18 per cent, yet having identical hydrodynamic performance. The forward gun was redesigned to be retractable, the middle gunner&#x27;s position was lowered, and a tail gunner position was added just aft of the control surfaces, completed with a hooded windshield. In general, the equipment of which the aircraft was to be fitted with were the result of lessons learnt from operations of the earlier Southamptons.

The production model of the Stranraer was different in a few aspects from the first prototype, chiefly of which being the installation of the more powerful Pegasus X engine. The engines were placed in nacelles under the upper wing, so that the propellers were well clear of any sea spray. Two petrol tanks, each of capacity, were placed in the centre section of the upper wing; petrol was fed by gravity, but fuel pumps were also incorporated.

The two-bladed wooden propellers of the prototype were replaced by three-bladed metal Fairey-Reed propellers when the aircraft went into production. . The redesigned wings were fabric-covered. The wing structure was redesigned to have two bays; the greater number of struts and wires used for the bays, which caused an increase in drag, meant the wings had to have a thinner profile. The wings were swept back to correct the balance.

The Stranraer was armed with three Lewis guns, positioned in the nose, dorsal and tail. The aircraft could carry up to of bombs.

==Operational history==
===Military use prior to September 1939===
The Stranraer and its contemporary, the Saro London, were the last multi-engine, biplane flying-boats to see service with the RAF. The RAF operated 17 Stranraers from 1937, although they were already considered obsolete when they entered service. Before the war, the type served primarily with No. 228 Squadron, No. 209 Squadron and No. 240 Squadron. Generally, the aircraft was not well-received, with numerous pilots considering its performance being typically marginal. Others noted that it had superior seaworthiness to several aircraft in common use, such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina. As early as 1938, some Stranraer squadrons had begun to re-equip themselves with other aircraft, such as the Short Sunderland and Short Singapore flying boats.

Early on in its career, Stranraers made several challenging long-distance flights; one such flight, covering , was performed during a single exercise during September 1938.

===Action during the Second World War===
No Stranraers saw action away from UK territorial waters during World War II. Immediately following the outbreak of the war in September 1939, Stranraers patrolled the North Sea, intercepting enemy shipping between Scotland and Norway. Aircraft assigned to such duties were typically armed with bombs underneath one wing and a single overload fuel tank underneath the other one. Use of the Stranraer for such patrols came to an end on 17 March 1941. Stranraers saw service with No. 240 Squadron, and limited numbers were deployed at the No. 4 (Coastal) Operational Training Unit. The final Stranraer flight in RAF service was conducted by &quot;K7303&quot; at Felixstowe on 30 October 1942.

Having acquired a less than favourable reception by flight and ground crews alike, the Stranraer gained a large number of derisive nicknames during its service life. It was sometimes referred to as a &quot;whistling shithouse&quot; because the toilet opened out directly to the air and when the seat was lifted, the airflow caused the toilet to make a whistling sound. The Stranraer also acquired &quot;Flying Meccano Set&quot;, &quot;The Marpole Bridge&quot;, &quot;Seymour Seine Net&quot;, &quot;Strainer&quot;, &quot;Flying Centre Section of the Lion&#x27;s Gate Bridge&quot;, as well as a more genteel variant of its usual nickname, &quot;Whistling Birdcage&quot;.

The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Stranraers were exact equivalents of their RAF counterparts. In Canadian service, they were usually employed in coastal patrol against submarine threats in a similar role to the British Stranraers. Aviation author Dirk Septer stated that no enemy action was ever recorded by the RCAF&#x27;s Stranraers. However, the crew of a 5 Squadron Stranraer, flown by Flight Lieutenant Leonard Birchall, were responsible for the capture of an Italian merchant ship, the &quot;Capo Nola&quot;, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, hours after Canada issued its declaration of war on Italy on 10 June 1940. The Canadian Vickers-built Stranraers served with the RCAF throughout the war, the last example being withdrawn on 20 January 1946.

===Civilian use===
From May 1935, the Stranraer was developed for civilian use into the Type 237. All the RCAF&#x27;s Stranraers were struck off charge between June 1939 and January 1946. Of the 40 aircraft acquired by the RCAF, half survived being destroyed or damaged during the war. In November 1944, 20 aircraft that had been withdrawn from active service in February earlier that year were purchased for civilian use, before being registered in Canada or the US.

After the end of World War II, 13 examples were sold through Crown Assets (Canadian government) and passed into civilian use; several served with Queen Charlotte Airlines (QCA) in British Columbia, operating until 1958. A re-engine project by the airline substituted Wright GR-1820-G202GA engines in place of the original Pegasus units.

Queen Charlotte Airlines became at one point the third-largest airline in Canada; it was popularly known as the &quot;Queer Collection of Aircraft&quot;. With limited money, it flew a mixture of types that were often the cast-offs of other operators. In QCA use, the Stranraer gained a more suitable reputation and was &quot;well liked&quot; by its crews. A total of eight surplus Stranraers were also sold to Aero Transport Ltd. of Tampa, Florida.

==Surviving aircraft==

A single Stranraer, 920/CF-BXO, survives in the collection of the Royal Air Force Museum London. This aircraft was built in 1940, one of 40 produced by Canadian Vickers. In service with the RCAF, it flew with several squadrons, on anti-submarine patrols, as a training aircraft and carrying passengers. In 1944, it was disposed of. It was flown by the civilian airline Canadian Pacific Airlines until 1947, then by Queen Charlotte Airlines, who replaced its original engines with American Wright R-1820 Cyclone engines. Queen Charlotte Airlines flew the aircraft on passenger flights until 1952, flying from Vancouver along the Pacific coast of British Columbia. It flew with several other private owners until it was damaged by a ship in 1966. In 1970, it was bought by the RAF Museum and transported to the UK.

Parts of a second Stranraer, 915/CF-BYJ, are owned by the Shearwater Aviation Museum, Halifax, Canada. This aircraft also operated with Queen Charlotte Airlines until it crashed on Christmas Eve 1949 at Belize Inlet, British Columbia. Most of the aircraft was recovered in the 1980s, with the exception of the forward fuselage and cockpit.

<text>is a Buddhist temple located in Uji, Kyoto Prefecture, approximately a 5-minute walk from Ōbaku Station. It is the head temple of the Japanese Ōbaku Zen school, and named after Wanfu Temple in Fujian, China. The mountain is likewise named after Mount Huangbo, where the Chinese temple is situated.

==History==
The temple was founded in 1661 by the Chinese monk Yinyuan Longqi (Ingen), officially opening in 1663.

In 1664, control of the temple passed to Muyan, after which many Chinese monks followed as head priests. Only the fourteenth priest and his successors are Japanese.

On May 21, 1673 (&quot;Enpō 1, 5th day of the 4th month&quot;) Yinyuan (Ingen) died at the temple.

The art of &quot;Senchadō&quot; is closely tied to the temple due to its founder.

==Architecture==
The temple structures were constructed in Ming China&#x27;s architectural style.

The arrangement of buildings also follows Ming Dynasty architectural style, representing an image of a dragon.
The temple features an exemplary &quot;gyoban&quot; (fish board, used to toll the hours).

==Art==
The temple&#x27;s main statue is a seated Gautama Buddha. Sculptures by the Chinese sculptor known as Han Do-sei and latticed balustrades can also be seen.

Above the gate of the temple is a carving of the Chinese Characters &quot;義一第&quot;, (read right-to-left, &quot;The First Principle&quot;) carved from the writing of Imakita Kosen and said to have been the artist&#x27;s eighty-fifth attempt before he finally wrote with a mind free from the distraction of a pupil&#x27;s criticism.

The temple treasure house contains a complete collection of Buddhist scriptures commissioned by Tetsugen Doko and completed in 1678, comprising approximately 60,000 printing blocks which are still in use. The production of the printing blocks was funded by donations collected throughout the country for many years and through many troubles.

On April 27, 2007, Seoul Metropolitan Police said that seven former employees of NCSoft are suspected of selling the &quot;Lineage III&quot; source code to a major Japanese game company. According to NCSoft, the potential damages may exceed .

===Worlds.com patent lawsuit===
Worlds.com CEO Thom Kidrin claimed the idea of a &quot;scalable virtual world with thousands of users&quot; is patented by his organization and targeted NCSoft for patent infringement in 2008, in what he says will be the first of many lawsuits against MMO developers. On April 23, 2010, the Worlds.com case settled, but the terms of the settlement were kept confidential. On July 22, 2010, Worlds.com requested the case be reopened.

===Richard Garriott termination===
Richard Garriott, lead developer of the failed MMORPG &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;, sued NCSoft for in damages concerning his termination from the company. Garriott asserted in his suit that he was forced out of the company and was made to sell his 400,000 shares in NCSoft&#x27;s stock, costing him millions of dollars. In addition, he claimed that the company was guilty of fraud by forging his resignation announcement. On July 30, 2010, a jury in a Texas federal court awarded him in damages. NCSoft described Garriott as someone &quot;who keeps finding different ways to turn the company into his personal ATM,&quot; and that &quot;Garriott left the company voluntarily to catch his ride to the International Space Station.&quot; Citing his questionable work ethic and the failure of his video game project despite an $84.4 million investment, NCSoft pulled the plug on the game after which Garriott announced he would be leaving the company. This came after he boarded a much-publicized news on his boarding of a Russian aircraft, which cost $30 million. Garriott again prevailed on appeal and NCSoft was required to pay an additional , bringing the total damages awarded to Garriott to .

===Closure of Paragon Studios and &quot;City of Heroes&quot;===
On August 31, 2012, NCSoft liquidated Paragon Studios and announced the closure of &quot;City of Heroes&quot;. Over 21,000 players signed an online petition contesting the shut-down and many used social media to promote their criticisms.

=== Major Company Reconstruction in South Korea ===
In 2024, NCSoft underwent significant restructuring in South Korea to tackle its financial challenges. The process began with the closure of its subsidiary, Ntreev Soft, leading to the layoff of 70 employees in January 2024 after enduring an 11-year deficit. Consequently, the development and service of &quot;Trickster M&quot;, &quot;Pro Baseball H2&quot;, and &quot;Pro Baseball H3&quot; were terminated. On October 21, 2024, NCSoft declared the main branch&#x27;s overhaul, which includes the formation of new teams into four business divisions, scheduled to be established as official subsidiaries on February 1, 2025.

* &quot;NC AI&quot; will oversee all AI development for games and applications, consolidating NCSoft&#x27;s AI and NLP teams into a single unit, led by the head of NCSoft&#x27;s NLP research, Lee Yeon-soo.
* &quot;Studio X&quot; will inherit the project &quot;Throne and Liberty&quot; from TL Heroes and continue its IP development, under the leadership of Choi Moonyoung, one of NCSoft&#x27;s three chief business officers.
* &quot;Studio Y&quot; will advance the development of &quot;&#x27;Project LLL&quot;, guided by Bae Jae-hyun, NCSoft&#x27;s vice president of game development.
* &quot;Studio Z&quot; will undertake the development of NCSoft&#x27;s new project &quot;TACTAN&quot;, currently in the design phase, led by Seo Min-seok.

In the wake of its restructuring, NCSoft will disband the remaining teams that have not been restructured and halt their projects. This includes the cancellation of the single-player action-adventure RPG &quot;Project M&quot; and the cessation of the newly released game &quot;Battle Crush&quot;. Additionally, the company will conduct staff layoffs and introduce a voluntary retirement program for its employees.

==Games==
In addition, NCSoft is also the developer and maintainer of a variety of web-based board games in Asian markets.

<doc id="586495" wikidata="Q7359127" url="?curid=586495" title="Roger Williams (soldier)">
<text>Sir Roger Williams (1539–1540 – 12 December 1595) was a Welsh soldier of fortune and military theorist, who served the Protestant cause, fighting against the Spanish in several theatres of war. Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester said that as a soldier he was &quot;worth his weight in gold&quot;. He was later a close associate of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and became a national hero because of his exploits fighting the Catholic League. He has been described as &quot;an obstreperous, opinionated Welsh soldier&quot; who was &quot;Essex&#x27;s devoted confederate and agent&quot;.

In his writings on the art of war, Williams was a strong advocate of the modernisation of armies and the exploitation of new military technologies.

Some Shakespeare scholars have suggested that he was the basis for the pugnacious Welsh captain Fluellen in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, a character who is also both argumentative and unflinchingly loyal.

==Life==
Born in Penrhos, Monmouthshire, Williams was the son of Thomas Williams and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of Sir William Vaughan. He was said by Anthony Wood to have attended Brasenose College, Oxford. He spent most of his life soldiering, mainly on the continent. In his own writings he says that his first experience of war was as a page under William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, participating in the storming of St. Quentin in 1557. Williams may have pursued his career in the service of Spain, before becoming associated with its enemies, though Sidney Lee thinks this is &quot;doubtful&quot;. He is said to have risen to the rank of Colonel in the Spanish forces.

Whether or not he ever served Spain, in 1572 Williams took part in a raid during the siege of Goes, South Beveland, an outpost of the main Spanish base at Middelburg which was also under siege. The garrison was far larger than they had expected and the attack failed, with many of the raiding party being killed. Williams and Rowland Yorke escaped by crawling out through ditches on their stomachs. In 1577 he joined John Norreys&#x27; expedition of English volunteers to the Low Countries, serving as Norreys&#x27; military adviser.

In the 1580s he was in the Netherlands fighting on behalf of William the Silent, Prince of Orange, against Spain. He was present when the Prince was assassinated in 1584, and helped capture the assassin, Balthasar Gérard. In 1585 he joined Earl of Leicester&#x27;s command in the Netherlands, to confront the Spanish forces under the Duke of Parma. Though the campaign was not a success, Leicester wrote: &quot;Roger Williams is worth his weight in gold, for he is noe more valiant than he is wise and of judgement to govern his doings&quot;. He was duly knighted after the Battle of Zutphen in 1586 by Leicester.

He also fought for the Protestant Elector of Cologne, Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, and fought with the Dutch soldier of fortune, Martin Schenck von Nydeggen in Westphalia. During the Siege of Venlo in 1586 Schenck and Williams came very close to killing the Duke of Parma.

In 1587, Williams and his regiment were in Sluys (Sluis) when the Duke of Parma laid siege to the town. After a heroic defence, the English and Dutch defenders were forced to surrender on 4 August. Parma gave generous terms; the garrison marched out with all their banners and baggage and all the honours of war. Parma sought Williams out and offered him a command where he would not have to fight either his fellow-countrymen or his co-religionists. Williams replied politely that if he ever fought in the service of any other than his queen, Elizabeth, it would be in the service &quot;of that hero of the Protestant cause, King Henry of Navarre.&quot;

Williams was in England to assist in the fight against the Spanish Armada in 1588. Williams accompanied Sir Francis Drake in the expedition to Spain and Portugal 1589, and later fought on behalf of the French Huguenots. He met the Earl of Essex in 1589, and the two became close when they were sent by Queen Elizabeth to lead an army as allies of Henry of Navarre against the Catholic League during the Spanish occupation of Brittany in 1592. He went on to serve Henry against the League during the late 1580s and 1590s, scored a major victory at the Battle of Arques. After Essex returned to England Williams became overall commander of the English forces supporting Henry and &quot;de facto&quot; envoy of the Queen. Shortly afterwards he captured Aumerle with only 600 men. During the Siege of Rouen in 1592, he almost killed Albanian-Italian leader Giorgio Basta in personal combat, slicing his neck and driving him and his men from the field. These actions made Williams a famous hero in England, and pamphlets of his exploits were published. Sir Henry Umton stated that King Henry was full of praise for Williams and his men, &quot;I never heard him give more honour to any service nor to any man than he doth to Sir Roger Williams and the rest&quot;.

He returned to England permanently in 1594, but broken in health he died the following year and his death elicited a great show of public mourning. He left his property to the Earl of Essex. He was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with &quot;full military honours&quot; in an expensive funeral funded by the Earl.

==Writings and assessments==
Williams was recognised as an expert on military matters by his contemporaries, and wrote &quot;A Brief Discourse of War, with his opinions concerning some part of Martial Discipline&quot; (1590). He also wrote &quot;Newes from Sir Roger Williams&quot; (1591). After his death his account of his experiences in the Netherlands was published as &quot;Actions of the Low Countries&quot; in 1618. Williams gave detailed analyses of the different methods and effectiveness of the Dutch and Spanish forces in the Netherlands, commending the discipline of Parma&#x27;s troops. He also examined methods of creating effective fortifications. Williams was a strong advocate of new weaponry, emphasising that the English army had to adapt to the new technology, as the traditional English longbow would soon be made obsolete by improved firearms. He argued that a combination of fireams and close-quarter deployment of pikes represented the future of warfare.

Williams has been called a &quot;fiery Welshman&quot;, who was &quot;rough around the edges, bloody minded, often lacking in self-control and, at times, slightly mad&quot;, but he was widely regarded as &quot;a soldier of the highest integrity&quot;. Amos Miller considered his &quot;A Brief Discourse of War&quot; to be one of the most important contributions to military theory of its day. Sidney Lee says that &quot;His letters and literary work prove him to have possessed command of a blunt and forcible vocabulary as well as much sagacity as a student of the art of war.&quot;

==Petition anecdote==
According to an anecdote recorded by the &quot;Camden Society&quot;, Williams once appeared before the queen with a petition she wished to avoid. When he pressed the matter, she dismissed him with the excuse that his new boots smelled too strongly of tanning.

The story includes the implausible assertion that Williams was a tailor before he was a soldier, which may result from a confusion about the pun on &quot;suit[e]&quot;, but Lee notes that his family, though members of the gentry, were relatively poor.

==Fluellen==
The similarity between the character of Williams and Shakespeare&#x27;s Fluellen (the pedantic Welsh officer obsessed by military &quot;disciplines&quot; in &quot;Henry V&quot;) was noted by the Victorian military historian Julian S. Corbett, who wrote that Williams, &quot;with his professional pedantry, his quaint and forcible turns of speech, his vanity and cool valour, was another &#x27;Fluellen&#x27;.&quot;. Likewise, Lee says that &quot;Like Shakespeare&#x27;s Fluellen, he was constitutionally of a choleric temper and blunt of speech&quot;.

Shakespeare scholar J. Dover Wilson made the leap from this to suggest that the character of Fluellen was in fact based on Williams. Wilson insisted that Fluellen was &quot;a careful and unmistakable portrait—a real portrait—of Sir Roger Williams, the Welsh soldier who had accompanied Essex during the French campaign of 1592 and had died, tended by Essex to the last, in 1595.&quot; He went on to claim that this was evidence that the play promoted the Earl of Essex&#x27;s 1599 expedition to Ireland: &quot;That this old friend [of Essex] should reappear in a stage-representation of Agincourt four years later is strong evidence that the play was intended to be associated with the hope of England.&quot; Wilson also argued that Williams was the author of the Martin Marprelate tracts.

E. K. Chambers accepted that &quot;Wilson has made a fair case for finding, traits of the Welsh soldier Sir Roger Williams in Fluellen&quot;. The connection has been supported by some other commentators. Several critics have noted that, while the characterisation of Fluellen may have been influenced by Williams, there is a major problem with equating the two, because Fluellen is a strong advocate of military tradition, unlike Williams, who was a moderniser. Fluellen&#x27;s debates with his colleagues appear to parody the war of words between Williams and his critics, but Fluellen supports the position of Williams&#x27; main opponent Sir John Smythe.

<text>MDL (Model Development Language, or colloquially also referred to as More Datatypes than Lisp or MIT Design Language) is a programming language, a descendant of the language Lisp. Its initial purpose was to provide high-level programming language support for the Dynamic Modeling Group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s (MIT) Project MAC. It was developed in 1971 on a PDP-10 running ITS and later ran on TENEX, TOPS-20, BSD, and AEGIS.

The initial development team consisted of Gerald Sussman and Carl Hewitt of the Artificial Intelligence Lab, and Chris Reeve, Bruce Daniels, and David Cressey of the Dynamic Modeling Group. Later, Stu Galley, also of the Dynamic Modeling Group, wrote the MDL documentation.

MDL was initially called &quot;Muddle&quot;. This style of self-deprecating humor was not widely understood or appreciated outside of Project MAC. So the name was sanitized to MDL.

MDL provides several enhancements to classic Lisp. It supports several built-in data types, including lists, strings and arrays, and user-defined data types. It offers multithreaded expression evaluation and coroutines. Variables can carry both a local value within a scope, and a global value, for passing data between scopes. Advanced built-in functions supported interactive debugging of MDL programs, incremental development, and reconstruction of source programs from object programs.

Although MDL is obsolete, some of its features have been incorporated in later versions of Lisp. Gerald Sussman went on to develop the Scheme language, in collaboration with Guy Steele, who later wrote the specifications for Common Lisp and Java. Carl Hewitt had already published the idea for the language &quot;Planner&quot; before the MDL project began, but his subsequent thinking on Planner reflected lessons learned from building MDL. Planner concepts influenced languages such as Prolog and Smalltalk. Smalltalk and Simula, in turn, influenced Hewitt&#x27;s future work on the actor model.

But the largest influence that MDL had was on the software genre of interactive fiction (IF). An IF game named Zork, sometimes called Dungeon, was first written in MDL. Later, Reeve, Daniels, Galley and other members of Dynamic Modeling went on to start Infocom, a company that produced many early commercial works of interactive fiction.

In 1980 Marc Blank and Joel Berez adapted the MDL language to create a subset called ZIL (Zork Implementation Language) which was used extensively by Infocom to create their award winning games. 

==Code sample==
This is a sample of PDP-10 MDL:
&lt;DEFINE EXIT-TO (EXITS RMS)
 #DECL ((EXITS) EXIT (RMS) &lt;UVECTOR [REST ROOM]&gt;)
 &lt;MAPF &lt;&gt;
 &lt;FUNCTION (E)
 #DECL ((E) &lt;OR DIRECTION ROOM CEXIT NEXIT DOOR&gt;)
 &lt;COND (&lt;TYPE? .E DIRECTION&gt;)
 (&lt;AND &lt;TYPE? .E ROOM&gt; &lt;MEMQ .E .RMS»

<doc id="586504" wikidata="Q4841599" url="?curid=586504" title="Baggy green">
<text>The baggy green is a cricket cap of dark myrtle green colour, which has been worn by Australian Test cricketers since around the turn of the twentieth century. The cap was not originally baggy as evidenced by photographs of early players. The cap has long been a symbol of national pride in Australia, and was described by the chief executive of the MCC as the &quot;most famous cricket cap in the world&quot;.

While respect for the baggy green cap has always been very high, it has grown in stature since the 1990s, chiefly due to the efforts of captains Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh. Waugh regularly expressed his belief that the honouring of the traditions of the game was critical to the success of a team: &quot;To be able to partake of these rituals and traditions has meant you have been awarded the highest honour in Australian cricket — you have been selected to play for your country.&quot; 

The baggy green cap was originally supplied to the player as part of a kit of equipment, and a new one was routinely issued for each tour, with the year number on it. In fact, a few former Australian players have been known to use the cap for &#x27;non-cricketing&#x27; purposes. Bill Lawry used the cap while cleaning his pigeon&#x27;s nest, while Bill Ponsford was known to wear the cap to protect his hair while painting the fence in front of his house. Ian Chappell never kept any of his baggy green caps. In the early 1990s an unofficial practice emerged amongst test players never to replace a baggy green cap, most notably by Steve Waugh. Although there is no official rule against a player obtaining a replacement cap from Cricket Australia, this almost never occurs, and the increasingly dilapidated state of an aging baggy green cap is a &quot;de facto&quot; symbol of seniority amongst the players in the team.

During his captaincy Taylor instituted a pre-match ceremony for the awarding of a cap. This continued under Waugh, who introduced a refinement whereby new players would receive their &quot;baggy green&quot; from a past player of a similar discipline (batsman, spin bowler, etc.). Ponting changed it again, making the presentation himself rather than using a former player. Another tradition instituted by Taylor (but suggested by Steve Waugh, and one that has also continued) is the practice of all players wearing the cap during the first session in the field of a Test match, as a symbol of solidarity. Even Shane Warne, known for his preference for a floppy sun hat, observed this tradition without question. Modern players seldom wear the baggy green cap while batting, choosing a protective helmet instead, especially when facing faster bowlers.

Baggy green caps can in some cases be prized as valuable sporting memorabilia. The cap worn by 
Sir Donald Bradman during his final season in 1948 sold in 2003 for A$425,000, and the 1953 cap of Keith Miller sold at auction for A$35,000. Even the caps of lesser-known players have fetched figures above A$10,000. The baggy green of Shane Warne was sold at auction, purchased by the Commonwealth Bank in January 2020 for A$1,007,500. Warne&#x27;s cap is to be taken on a national tour, and subsequently put on display in the International Cricket Hall of Fame. The proceeds from the auction were used to support emergency services responding to 2019–20 Australian bushfire season.

==Coat of arms==

Sometimes incorrectly called a &quot;crest&quot;, the &quot;achievement&quot; or coat of arms on the Baggy Green cap is a pre-federation symbol representing Australian commercial endeavours of the time: wool-growing, shipping, mining and agriculture.

It consists of: a crest (being a rising sun); over a torse (or wreath) of red and gold; over a shield (bearing images of a golden fleece, a sailing ship, a pick-axe and shovel and a garb of wheat, all quartered by a southern cross); supporters (being a kangaroo and an emu); all over a motto (&quot;Australia&quot;) on a scroll.

The baggy green worn by male players has the motto in gold on a red background; on the women&#x27;s baggy green, the motto and background colours are reversed.

Contrary to a common belief, with the exception of the supporters and the motto, this coat of arms is entirely different from the present and any former national coat of arms. Since 1912 the Coat of Arms of Australia has borne the badges of the six Australian states, enclosed and unified on a shield under a wreath of blue and gold bearing a Commonwealth Star.

The device on the cap is sometimes referred to as Australia&#x27;s Cricket Coat of Arms, although it has otherwise been abandoned by Cricket Australia. It is replicated on the protective helmet, but not on any other badged item of clothing worn by the Australian team. These now feature the current emblem of Cricket Australia, being a modern distorted shield with the ubiquitous Southern Cross on a green and gold field of a rising sun and a wicket casting a shadow on a pitch.

==Commercial availability==
Unlike virtually any other item of cricket kit, replicas of the Baggy Green are not licensed for sale by Cricket Australia, the theory being that the Baggy Green can never be bought, only earned. The item is not available from the Cricket Australia Store, or from Kookabura Sport, the company that manufactures the Baggy Green. Any replicas available online are unlicensed/counterfeit.

<doc id="586506" wikidata="Q1456020" url="?curid=586506" title="Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay">
<text>The Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay is a medium-bypass turbofan engine, developed from the RB.183 Mk 555 Spey core and using a fan scaled directly from the Rolls-Royce RB.211-535E4 to produce versions with a bypass ratio of 3.1:1 or greater. The IP compressor and LP turbine were designed using technology from the RB.211 programme. The engine was first run in August 1984. The Tay 650 had a new HP turbine which incorporated new technology which had been proven with the RB.211-535E4. This engine also had a new combustor for improved durability.
The Tay family is used on a number of airliners and larger business jets, including the Gulfstream IV family, Fokker 70 and Fokker 100, with a later version being used to re-engine Boeing 727-100s.

==Variants==
===Tay 611-8===

Originally designated 610-8, all but one training engine have now been converted to 611-8 standard. The newest variant is the 611-8C, which has cast HP1 turbine blades, larger fan from the 650-15, structural by-pass duct and FADEC.

All Tay engines use a 22-blade titanium fan, a 3-stage intermediate-pressure compressor coupled to the fan shaft, a 12-stage high-pressure compressor, a 2-stage high-pressure turbine and a 3-stage low-pressure turbine.

Thrust: 13,850 lbf (62 kN)
Aircraft: Tay 611 entered service in 1987 on the Gulfstream IV/IV-SP, for which it is the exclusive powerplant.

===Tay 620-15===

The 620-15 is internally identical to the 611-8 and externally similar to the 650-15.

Thrust: 13,850 lbf (62 kN)
Aircraft: Fokker 70 from 1994, Fokker 100 from 1988
===Tay 650-15===
Thrust: 15,100 lbf (67 kN)
Aircraft: Originally designed to re-engine the BAC One-Eleven (650-14, only two made; both have since been converted to 650-15 standard.), the 650-15 entered service on the Fokker 100 in 1989.

===Tay 651-54===
The 651-54 is internally identical to the 650-15. The externals and gearbox suit the Boeing 727.

Thrust: 15,400 lbf (69 kN)
Aircraft: Boeing 727-100 from 1992. Conversion from three JT8D-7 to three Tay 651-54 was carried out by the now defunct Dee Howard Aircraft Maintenance Company in San Antonio, Texas, for the United Parcel Service, but all aircraft have since been withdrawn from service. Only one private 727 was converted.

==Applications==
* BAC 1-11
* Boeing 727-100 QF
* Fokker 70
* Fokker 100
* Gulfstream IV
* Gulfstream G350/G400/G450
* Gulfstream X-54

==Engines on display==
* A Tay RB.183 620-15 is on public display at the City of Norwich Aviation Museum in Horsham St Faith, Norfolk.

<text>The transmigration program (, from Dutch, &quot;transmigratie&quot;) was an initiative of the Dutch colonial government and later continued by the Indonesian government to move landless people from densely populated areas of Indonesia to less populous areas of the country. This involved moving people permanently from the island of Java, but also to a lesser extent from Bali and Madura to less densely populated areas including Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua. The program is currently coordinated by Ministry of Transmigration.

The stated purpose of this program was to reduce the considerable poverty and overpopulation on Java, to provide opportunities for hard-working poor people, and to provide a workforce to utilize better the natural resources of the outer islands. The program, however, has been controversial as fears from native populations of &quot;Javanization&quot; and &quot;Islamization&quot; have strengthened separatist movements and communal violence. The incomers are mostly Madurese and Javanese but also from other populated areas such as Hindu Balinese.

==History==

===Under the Dutch===

The policy was first initiated by the Dutch colonial government in the early nineteenth century to reduce crowding and to provide a workforce for plantations on Sumatra. The program diminished during the last years of the Dutch era (the early 1940s) but was revived following Indonesian independence, in an attempt to alleviate the food shortages and weak economic performance during Sukarno&#x27;s presidency in the two decades following World War II.

In the peak year of 1929, in the Sumatra&#x27;s east coast, more than 260,000 contract workers were brought, 235,000 of them from Java. Workers entered into a contract several years long as coolie; if a worker asked for the early termination of the contract in the company (&#x27;desertion&#x27;), he could be punished with hard labour. The mortality rate was very high among the coolies and abuse was common.

===Post-independence===

After independence in 1949, under President Sukarno, the program continued and was expanded to send migrants to more areas of the archipelago such as Papua. At its peak between 1979 and 1984, 535,000 families (almost 2.5 million people) moved under the program. It had a significant impact on the demographics of some regions; for example, in 1981, 60% of the three million people in the southern Sumatra province of Lampung were transmigrants. During the 1980s, the program was funded by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank as well as by many Western governments who appreciated Suharto&#x27;s anti-communist politics. However, as a result of the 1979 energy crisis and increased transportation costs, the budget and plans for transmigration were severely reduced.

In August 2000, after the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the fall of the New Order, the Indonesian government again reduced the scale of the transmigration program due to a lack of funds.

Under the restructured Department of Manpower and Transmigration (Indonesian: &quot;Departemen Tenaga Kerja dan Transmigrasi&quot;) the Indonesian government maintains the transmigration program, although on a far smaller scale than in previous decades. The department assists in annually relocating approximately 15,000 families, or nearly 60,000 people. The rate has shown gradual increases in recent years with funding for transmigration activities at $270 million (2.3 trillion IDR) and a target of relocating 20,500 families in 2006. The program again intensified in 2019.

==Aims==
The stated purpose of the program, according to proponents in the Indonesian government and the development community, was to move millions of Indonesians from the densely populated inner islands of Java, Bali and Madura to the outer, less densely populated islands to achieve a more balanced population density. This would alleviate poverty by providing land and new opportunities to generate income for poor landless settlers. It would also benefit the nation as a whole by increasing the utilization of the natural resources of the less-populous islands. The program may have been intended to encourage the unification of the country through the creation of a single &quot;Indonesian&quot; national identity to augment or replace regional identities. The official position of the Indonesian government is that there is no separation of &quot;indigenous people&quot; and settlers in Indonesia, because Indonesia is a country &quot;of indigenous people, run and governed by and for indigenous people&quot;. It argues instead for the use of &quot;vulnerable population groups&quot; which can include both tribal groups and the urban poor.

==Effects==

=== Economic ===
In many examples, the program failed in its objective to improve the situation of the migrants. The soil and climate of their new locations were generally not nearly as productive as the volcanic soil of Java and Bali. The settlers were often landless people lacking in farming skills, let alone skills appropriate to the new land, thus compromising their own chances of success.

===Environmental===
Transmigration has also been blamed for accelerating the deforestation of sensitive rainforest areas, as formerly sparsely-populated areas experienced considerable increases in population. Migrants were often moved to entirely new &quot;transmigration villages&quot;, constructed in regions that had been relatively unimpacted by human activity. By settling on this land, natural resources were used up, and the lands became overgrazed, resulting in deforestation.

===Social and political===
Transmigration in Indonesia covers various regions throughout the country, including Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara region, and Papua. The program was originally intended to reduce density in densely populated areas such as Java and Bali and to develop the economy in relatively sparsely populated areas, which were considered to have great potential in the agriculture, plantation, and fisheries sectors.

However, transmigration often triggers social conflict, especially with indigenous people in the destination area. Indigenous people often feel marginalized and lose access to land and natural resources that are an important part of their lives.

The program has resulted in communal clashes between ethnic groups that have come into contact through transmigration. For example, in 1999, the local Dayaks and Malays clashed against the transmigrant Madurese during the Sambas riots and the Dayaks and Madurese clashed again in 2001 during the Sampit conflict, resulting in thousands of deaths and thousands of Madurese being displaced.

==Figures==
Transmigration from Java and Madura have resulted in large numbers of the population elsewhere, particularly in Sumatra, Borneo, and Papua. Based on 2010 census figures and ethnic prevalence, roughly 4.3 million transmigrants and their descendants live in North Sumatra, 200 thousand in West Sumatra, 1.4 million in Riau, almost a million in Jambi, 2.2 million in South Sumatra, 0.4 million in Bengkulu, 5.7 million in Lampung, 100 thousand in Bangka-Belitung, almost 400 thousand in Riau Islands, totalling some 15.5 million in Sumatra alone. In Kalimantan, there are some 700 thousand transmigrants and their descendants in West Kalimantan, 400 thousand in Central Kalimantan, almost 500 thousand in South Kalimantan, and over a million in East Kalimantan, totalling 2.6 million for the whole area. Though numbers are a state secret, well over a million transmigrants are thought to reside in Papua and West Papua. Total Javanese and other transmigrants in Indonesia number roughly 20 million throughout the country.

Transmigrants are not exclusively ethnic Javanese and/or Muslims. For example, in 1994, when East Timor was still part of Indonesia, the largest transmigrant group was Hindu Balinese (1,634 people) followed by Catholic Javanese (1,212 people).

==Criticism==
Indigenous peoples saw the program as a part of an effort by the Java-based Indonesian government to extend greater economic and political control over other regions, by moving in people with closer ties to Java and loyalty to the Indonesian state. The government agencies responsible for administering transmigration were often accused of being insensitive to local customary or &quot;adat&quot; land rights. This was especially true on Borneo with the Dayak population. In addition to general public criticism, the potential marginalization of native and Indigenous members of the host communities has also been highlighted in research surveying long-term effects of transmigration programs across a number of impacted communities.

The environmental damage associated with these projects was caused less by ignorance than by inattention, poor follow-up, and lack of accountability during project implementation. Many environmental issues were identified at project appraisal: the potential for soil erosion, the possibility of declining soil fertility, need for protection against pests and disease, possible adverse effects on wildlife and deforestation, impact on indigenous people, and the need to strengthen the borrower&#x27;s capacity for managing natural resources. But often, the audits found, the proposed mitigatory measures were unrealistic or were insufficiently monitored by the government.

===Papua===
In the provinces of Papua and West Papua, the program has resulted in the Papuan population of Melanesian origin totalling less than the population of non-Melanesian (principally Austronesian) origin in several locations. According to Papuan independence activists, the Papuans have lived on the New Guinea island for an estimated 50,000 years, but have been outnumbered in less than 50 years by mostly Javanese Indonesians. They criticize the program as part of &quot;an attempt to wipe out the West Papuans in a slow-motion genocide&quot;. There is open conflict between migrants, the state, and indigenous groups due to differences in culture—particularly in administration, and cultural topics such as nudity, food and sex. Religion is also a problem as Papuans are predominantly Christian or hold traditional tribal beliefs while the non-Papuan settlers are mostly Muslim. A number of Indonesians have taken Papuan children and sent them to Islamic religious schools.

The recorded population growth rates in Papua are exceptionally high due to migration.

Detractors of the program argue that considerable resources have been wasted in settling people who have not been able to move beyond subsistence level, with extensive damage to the environment and deracination of tribal people. However, very large scale American and Anglo-Australian strip mining contracts have been developed on the island, as well as other Indonesian islands.

The transmigration program in Papua was only formally halted by President Joko Widodo in June 2015.

<text>The Ulbricht Doctrine, named after East German leader Walter Ulbricht, was the assertion that normal diplomatic relations between East Germany and West Germany could occur only if both states fully recognised each other&#x27;s sovereignty. That contrasted with the Hallstein Doctrine, a West German policy which insisted that West Germany was the only legitimate German state.

East Germany gained acceptance of its view from fellow Communist states, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria, which all agreed not to normalise relations with West Germany until it recognised East German sovereignty.

West Germany eventually abandoned its Hallstein Doctrine, instead adopting the policies of Ostpolitik. In December 1972, a Basic Treaty between East and West Germany was signed that reaffirmed two German states as separate entities. The treaty also allowed the exchange of diplomatic missions and the entry of both German states to the United Nations as full members.

<text>The Rolls-Royce RB.44 Tay is a British turbojet engine of the 1940s, an enlarged version of the Rolls-Royce Nene designed at the request of Pratt &amp; Whitney. It saw no use by British production aircraft but the design was licence built by Pratt &amp; Whitney as the J48, and by Hispano-Suiza as the Verdon.

Two early production examples of the Tay were evaluated during 1950 by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough Airfield, Hampshire, in a specially modified Vickers Viscount.

<text>Nabu (, ) is the Babylonian patron god of literacy, the rational arts, scribes, and wisdom. He is associated with the classical planet Mercury in Babylonian astronomy.

==Etymology and meaning==
The Akkadian &quot;nabû&quot; means &quot;announcer&quot; or &quot;authorised person&quot;, derived from the Semitic root or . It is cognate with , , and , all meaning &#x27;prophet&#x27;.

==History==
Nabu was worshiped by the Babylonians and the Assyrians. Nabu gained prominence among the Babylonians in the 1st millennium BC when he was identified as the son of the god Marduk.

Nabu was worshipped in Babylon&#x27;s sister city Borsippa, from where his statue was taken to Babylon each New Year so that he could pay his respects to his father. Nabu&#x27;s symbols included a stylus resting on a tablet as well as a simple wedge shape; King Nabonidus, whose name references Nabu, had a royal sceptre topped with Nabu&#x27;s wedge. Clay tablets with especial calligraphic skill were used as offerings at Nabu&#x27;s temple. His wife was the Akkadian goddess Tashmet.

Nabu was the patron god of scribes, literacy, and wisdom. He was also the inventor of writing, a divine scribe, the patron god of the rational arts, and a god of vegetation. As the god of writing, Nabu inscribed the fates assigned to men and he was equated with the scribe god Ninurta. As an oracle he was associated with the Mesopotamian moon god Sin. In the Babylonian tradition, planet Mercury was connected with Ninurta (as well as Saturn); because in the MUL.APIN Ninurta is consistently identified with Mercury, and it is read that: &quot;Mercury whose name is Ninurta travels the (same) path the Moon travels.&quot; As Marduk took over the role of King of the gods from Enlil and inherited both his cultic roles and epithets as well as his position within the pantheon – the role of the most important son of the father of the gods that had previously belonged to Ninurta as son of Enlil (now replaced by Marduk); was thus taken over by Nabu, and Nabu became associated with the planet Mercury as well as being given connections with the moon god Sin, because as addressed in the MUL.APIN – even when Mercury was considered the planet of Ninurta, it still retained some moon-like aspects since it traveled the same path of the moon. 

Nabu wore a horned cap, and stood with his hands clasped in the ancient gesture of priesthood. He rode on a winged dragon known as Sirrush that originally belonged to his father Marduk. In Babylonian astrology, Nabu was identified with the planet Mercury.

Nabu was continuously worshipped until the 2nd century, when cuneiform became a lost art.

Today in Mandaean cosmology, the name for Mercury is &quot;Nbu&quot; (), which is derived from the name Nabu.

===Outside Mesopotamia===
Nabu&#x27;s cult spread to ancient Egypt. Names with Nabu in them are the most common theophoric names for Semitic speakers in Egypt as it was in the Neo-Babylonian texts. Nabu was also one of the Canaanite and Israelite deities worshipped in Elephantine and Aswan alongside gods like Yahweh, Nanay, Bethel, Anat, and the Queen of Heaven.

In the Hebrew Bible, Nabu is mentioned as &quot;Nəḇo&quot; () in Isaiah 46:1 and Jeremiah 48:1. 

In the Hellenistic period, Nabu was sometimes identified with Apollo as a giver of prophecies. As the god of wisdom and a divine messenger, Nabu was linked with the Greek god Hermes, the Roman god Mercury, and the Egyptian deity Thoth.

<text>Itsunen Shoyu (, 1601 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China – 1668 in Nagasaki, Japan) is famous as a Buddhist monk and painter who helped to establish Chan (Zen) in Japan. He was also the third abbot of Kofukuji Temple. In addition to his skill of painting, he also practices the art of Seal carving and cemented the popularity of this art in Japan.

In 1642 he travelled to Nagasaki as a trader in Chinese medicine, and in 1644 entered Kofukuji Temple, becoming its 3rd abbot in 1645. Established by monks immigrated from China, the temple was then a base of the Ōbaku school of Zen Buddhism in Japan. In 1654 after multiple requests he succeeded in persuading Yinyuan Longqi (Ingen Ryuki), the 33rd abbot of Wanfu Temple (Mount Huangbo, Fujian) to emigrate to Japan, where he founded Ōbaku, the third and final major Japanese Zen sect.

Itsunen was a talented late Ming style painter of Buddhist figural subjects, and is known to have copied works by Chen Xian brought to Japan by Yinyuan Longqi.

<doc id="586540" wikidata="Q242468" url="?curid=586540" title="Tailor">
<text>A tailor is a person who makes or alters clothing, particularly in men&#x27;s clothing. The Oxford English Dictionary dates the term to the thirteenth century. 
== History ==
Although clothing construction goes back to prehistory, there is evidence of tailor shops in Ancient Greece and Rome, as well as tailoring tools such as irons and shears. The profession of tailor in Europe became formalized in the High Middle Ages through the establishment of guilds. Tailors&#x27; guilds instituted a system of masters, journeymen, and apprentices. Guild members established rules to limit competition and establish quality standards. In 1244, members of the tailor&#x27;s guild in Bologna established statutes to govern their profession and required anyone working as a tailor to join the guild.

In England, the Statute of Artificers, passed in 1563, included the profession of tailor as one of the trades that could be entered only by serving a term of apprenticeship, typically seven years.

A typical tailor shop would have a master, a foreman, several journeymen, and apprentices. The apprentices, often beginning their training as young adolescents and indentured to the master by their parents (for a fee), performed menial tasks such as cleaning, managing the fires to heat the pressing-irons, running errands, and matching fabric and trims. Apprentices were also taught the &quot;tailor&#x27;s posture&quot;, to sit cross-legged on a raised board or bench while they sewed. A tailoring establishment then generally consisted of a well-appointed room in which the master would measure customers. Cutting, sewing, buttonholes, and finishing work were performed in adjoining rooms.
In England, there were many negative associations with the profession of tailoring. Tailors were often called &quot;snips&quot;, &quot;bodkins&quot;, &quot;thimbles&quot;, &quot;shreds&quot;, &quot;, and &quot;geese&quot; (referring to the tailor&#x27;s &quot;goose&quot; or iron). In William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, a tailor was variously called a &quot;thread&quot;, a &quot;thimble&quot;, and a &quot;rag&quot;. By reputation, tailors were generally presumed to drink to excess and to have effeminate tendencies (likely because of the view of sewing as a woman&#x27;s activity). Tailors were presumed to be physically weak and to have delicate constitutions. It was commonly asserted that their diets consisted of cabbage. In comics, they were portrayed as cuckolds or henpecked husbands. A common saying at the time was &quot;Nine tailors make a man&quot;.

As with other artisanal trades, tailors relied on the &quot;house of call&quot; or &quot;call houses&quot;, a trade club at which they could procure workmen. Sometimes, a skilled journeyman assigned by the call house would be taken on permanently by the master. Master tailors who failed to comply with laws of wages or hours could lose access to the call houses, and journeymen whose work was reported as poor could be removed from the call book. Many tailors became virtually blind from the extensive hours of stitching by hand with only candelight to illumine the work. The call for tailoring peaked in the winter, and tailors were often unemployed for several months over the summer.

During the 18th century, the profession began to shift toward large-scale and specialized production. A hierarchy of skills resulted, with the most prestigious level reserved for those who cut the cloth. &quot;Mere sewers&quot; ranked below the &quot;cutters&quot;. More respect was given to those who worked in a master&#x27;s workshop than those who took in piecework in their own home. Tasks grew more specialized; by the end of the century, one individual might focus solely on collars and sleeves.

The trade was one of the first in England to exhibit labor disputes, with tailors frequently on strike against lengthy working hours, low wages, and the use of laborers outside the workshop such as women and children. The strikes generally failed; some participants were imprisoned or transported to America or Australia. The unrest eventually influenced Parliament to establish rules for wages, hours, and working conditions in the tailoring industry. Tailors were one of the first trades in England to form a labor union.

The British census in 1851 identified 152,672 tailors, more than the entire railway industry at the time, and that number increased throughout the century. By then, living and working conditions of many tailors had deteriorated, but the trade was still the fourth largest of London professions. One factor was the growing availability and popularity of &quot;slops&quot;: cheap ready-made clothing. Another was a shift from the vast majority of tailors being engaged in workshops to most working outside the shops of employers. Master tailors who relied on outside workers saved themselves the costs of lighting and heating, as well as some supplies. Rather than pay for foremen to supervise the work, masters would fine the outside workers for inferior products. Using outside workers also freed masters from the legal constraints that dictated hours and wages. Tailors who worked outside of workshops began to use their wives and family members in manufacturing garments, which increased their production to maximize their incomes. Some tailors would subcontract aspects of the work to laborers. The house of call system was abandoned. When the Statute of Artificers was repealed in 1814, it abolished the apprenticeship requirement and so tailors could no longer control admission to the trade. Tailor strikes in 1827 and 1834 were largely motivated by opposition to employing women as outworkers. Unlike other industries, in which technological advances contributed to decline of trades, the changes to the work methods in the tailoring industry that led to its decline had occurred several decades before the development of the mechanical sewing machine.

== Tailoring ==

Tailoring men&#x27;s jackets by adding underlayers of padding became fashionable in Europe by the 14th century. Over the years, additional areas were padded to provide an understructure that helped the garment lie neatly on the body. By the 19th century, well-tailored garments were carefully fit to the wearer with a more subtly shaped understructure. Even with the advent of modern machines, nearly 75 percent of a custom-tailored suit&#x27;s stitching is still done by hand.

The earliest extant work on cutting by tailors is from Spain in 1580. Juan de Alcega, a Spanish tailor in the 16th century, published &quot;Libro de Geometría, practica, y traça&quot; (&quot;Book on Geometry, Practice, and Pattern&quot;) which documented methods of laying out patterns to achieve the most economical use of the fabric. Alcega illustrated 163 patterns to scale in 23 categories of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s garments. 

Master tailors used proprietary methods for creating their clothing patterns. Up until approximately 1790, patterns to be used for cutting were considered trade secrets to be exclusively owned by the masters. By the late 18th century, publications that not only printed patterns but also gave directions for cutting and layout were widely available.

In addition to patterns and templates, some master tailors and cutters use the rock of eye method of cutting: which is a freehand way of drafting a pattern by trusting your eye and experience rather than focusing on numbers. Instead of using pencil to draft the pattern, the rock of eye typically involves chalk to mark.

==Regional styles ==

Just as there are various methods of tailoring, there are also styles that differ regionally. This is due to different climates and cultures in the world, causing &quot;house style&quot; cuts of the trade.

===British cut===

The silhouette of a British cut suit is influenced by military tailoring, with a defined waist and shoulders. The target image is that of an upper-class gentleman.

The British cut of tailoring can be defined by various ways of inner construction. Since the United Kingdom has a cooler climate than (for example) the Mediterranean, the cut of the British is heavier, and bears a greater military influence. This style of canvassing has 3 layers, a wool or camel-hair canvas for the body, a horsehair chest piece for the breast area, and a flannel domette for a more masculine pronounced bulk. The shoulders of the British are more heavily padded. The fabrics used by the British are in the range of 9-13 oz due to the colder climate. This style of cut can be credited to Henry Poole &amp; Co, and H. Huntsman &amp; Sons. The British are also credited in creating their ever-so-popular trademark, the Drape cut, credited to Frederick Scholte who trained the founders of Anderson &amp; Sheppard.

===Italian cut===

An Italian cut suit offers a flattering shape with soft tailoring, aiming for the most attractive appearance for the wearer. A suit jacket in northern Italy will usually have a square shoulder, while in southern Italy, the Neapolitan tailoring preference is for a more natural shoulder.

Like the British cut, the Italian cut is defined by its inner construction. Since Italy lies in southern Europe and has a warm climate, the Italian tailors developed a cut that was light and cooler to coincide with the conditions. What they developed is called the Italian/European cut. This cut is more light, with fabrics ranging from 7-9 oz. This way of doing canvas has a range of 1-2 layers, a linen body canvas, and a light horsehair canvas. The Italian shoulder is more natural, and sometimes has a &quot;shirt sleeve&quot; with a roping head. The cut is also slimmer than the British, with a more casual setting. Cesare Attolini invented the lighter Neapolitan construction. The tailors credited with popularizing these cuts include Brioni and Rubinacci.

Bespoke suits created by an Italian tailor are called &quot;su misura&quot;. The average cost of a &quot;su misura&quot; suit is between and , although one might cost more than from the finest tailoring houses. A master tailor can create a suit in approximately 40 hours. The number of tailors in Italy decreases at a rate of 8 percent annually, with fewer than 750 tailors as of 2016.

===American cut===
The American cut of tailoring is a mix of the Italian and the British ways. The American cut is more baggy and full, with a natural shoulder that is lightly padded. American tailoring usually involves doing light canvas, where only the canvas and the flannel domette are used. The most well-known cut developed by the Americans is the Ivy League cut. The tailors credited with this cut remain anonymous.
