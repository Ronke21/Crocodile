<text>WWE Backlash is a professional wrestling event that is produced by the American company WWE, the world&#x27;s largest professional wrestling promotion. It is broadcast live and has been available through pay-per-view (PPV) since 1999 and via livestreaming since 2016. Since premiering in 1999, 19 events have been held, with its most recent 19th edition occurring at the LDLC Arena in Décines-Charpieu in the Metropolis of Lyon, France on May 4, 2024. With the exception of the events held from 2016 to 2020, the concept of the show is based around the backlash of WWE&#x27;s flagship event, WrestleMania.

The inaugural Backlash in April 1999 was the company&#x27;s first monthly PPV held after the discontinuation of the original In Your House shows, which were monthly PPVs held between the promotion&#x27;s &quot;Big Five&quot; PPVs at the time: Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series. The inaugural event had originally been advertised as an In Your House show, but the branding was dropped before the event took place. From its inception until 2009, Backlash held the position as the post-WrestleMania PPV and was held annually in April, with the exception of the 2005 event, which was held in May. After the 2009 event, Backlash was discontinued and replaced by Extreme Rules in 2010, but after seven years, it was reinstated in 2016 and held in September as that year&#x27;s post-SummerSlam PPV. The events in 2017 and 2018 were then held in May, but were not the post-WrestleMania PPVs. An event was originally scheduled for June 2019 but was canceled and replaced by a one-off event called Stomping Grounds. Backlash then returned in 2020 and was held that June. The 2021 event moved Backlash back to May as the post-WrestleMania 37 PPV, thus the event returned to its original concept with the 2021 and 2022 events titled as WrestleMania Backlash, but the 2023 event reverted to its original name while maintaining the post-WrestleMania theme. In addition to this theme, the 2024 event was titled Backlash France as it was WWE&#x27;s first PPV and livestreaming event held in France, as well as the first Backlash held outside of North America.

The 2002 event was WWE&#x27;s first PPV held following the implementation of the original brand extension the month prior. With the brand split in effect, the events in 2002 and 2003 featured wrestlers from both the Raw and SmackDown brands, but from 2004 to 2006, Backlash was held exclusively for the Raw brand. Following WrestleMania 23 in 2007, brand-exclusive PPVs were discontinued, thus the events from 2007 to 2009 featured wrestlers from Raw, SmackDown, and ECW, the latter of which was established as a third brand in 2006 but was disbanded in 2010. The brand split itself ended in 2011, but was reintroduced in mid-2016. Backlash was then reinstated as a SmackDown-exclusive PPV that year and was WWE&#x27;s first brand-exclusive PPV of the second brand split, and it was also SmackDown-exclusive in 2017. Following WrestleMania 34 in 2018, brand-exclusive PPVs were again discontinued, thus the events since have featured both the Raw and SmackDown brands.

==History==
From 1995 to 1999, the American professional wrestling company World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) ran a series of monthly pay-per-view (PPV) events titled In Your House, which were held between the promotion&#x27;s five major PPVs at the time: Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series. In April 1999, the WWF phased out the In Your House events to establish permanent names for monthly pay-per-views to be held between these five major events. Backlash was subsequently established to be held after WrestleMania XV, and it took place on April 25, 1999, at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island. Early advertising for the inaugural Backlash had featured the &quot;In Your House&quot; branding until it was quietly dropped in the weeks leading up to the pay-per-view. The concept of the pay-per-view was based around the backlash from WWF&#x27;s flagship event, WrestleMania.

A second Backlash event was held the following year after WrestleMania 2000, thus establishing Backlash as an annual PPV for the WWF. With the exception of the 2005 event, which was held in May, Backlash was held every April through the 2009 event. Throughout this time, it retained its position as the post-WrestleMania PPV. Following the 2009 event, however, Backlash was discontinued and replaced by Extreme Rules in 2010.

In March 2002, the WWF introduced the brand extension in which the roster was divided between the Raw and SmackDown brands, which is where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. The 2002 Backlash was in turn the promotion&#x27;s first PPV held following the implementation of the original brand split and it featured wrestlers from both brands. The month after the 2002 event, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE, which became an orphaned initialism in 2011). While the 2003 event also featured wrestlers from both brands, the 2004 event was held exclusively for the Raw brand and continued to be Raw-exclusive up through the 2006 event. Following WrestleMania 23 in 2007, WWE discontinued brand-exclusive PPVs, thus the events from 2007 to 2009 featured wrestlers from Raw, SmackDown, and ECW, which had been established as a third brand in 2006 but was disbanded in 2010, and the brand extension itself was dissolved in 2011.

After Backlash was discontinued following the 2009 event, it endured a seven-year hiatus. During this time in February 2014, WWE launched their online streaming service, the WWE Network, and in addition to traditional PPV, the events also became available on the Network. In mid-2016, WWE reintroduced the brand split and also brought back brand-exclusive PPVs. Due to the need for more PPV events, Backlash was reinstated, and the 2016 event was held exclusively for the SmackDown-brand and was WWE&#x27;s first brand-exclusive PPV of the second brand split. Backlash that year was also held in September after SummerSlam, thus ending its previous tradition of being the post-WrestleMania PPV. The 2017 event was moved up to May and was again SmackDown-exclusive. While the event was technically SmackDown&#x27;s first PPV held after WrestleMania 33, none of the matches were backlash from that WrestleMania. Furthermore, the Raw-exclusive PPV, Payback, was held between WrestleMania 33 and Backlash. The 2018 event was originally scheduled to be a Raw-exclusive PPV, but following WrestleMania 34 that year, WWE again discontinued brand-exclusive PPVs, thus events held since have featured wrestlers from both Raw and SmackDown. Although the 2018 event was held in May, the Greatest Royal Rumble was held between WrestleMania 34 and Backlash.

In 2019, Backlash was originally scheduled to be held in June, however, it was canceled and replaced by a one-off PPV called Stomping Grounds. Backlash then returned in 2020 and was held in June that year. The event was originally scheduled to be held in Kansas City, Missouri, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began affecting the industry in mid-March that year, WWE had to relocate its programming for Raw and SmackDown to the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida with no fans in attendance, although in late May, WWE began using Performance Center trainees to serve as the live audience. The 2020 event was in turn held at the Performance Center and was WWE&#x27;s first PPV event to be announced after the start of the pandemic.

In August 2020, WWE relocated Raw and SmackDown&#x27;s events to a bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome, which was first hosted at Orlando&#x27;s Amway Center. In December, the ThunderDome was relocated to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, and then in April 2021, it was relocated to the Yuengling Center in Tampa, Florida. The 2021 Backlash was in turn WWE&#x27;s first PPV held in the ThunderDome at the Yuengling Center. The event was originally scheduled to be held in June, but was moved up to May. This in turn positioned the 2021 event as the first PPV held after WrestleMania 37, thus the event returned to its original concept and was titled &quot;WrestleMania Backlash&quot;. The 2021 event was also the first Backlash to livestream on Peacock&#x27;s WWE Network channel, following the merger of the American version of the WWE Network under Peacock in March that year.

In July 2021, WWE resumed a live touring schedule. On February 11, 2022, WWE announced that the 2022 event would also be held under the &quot;WrestleMania Backlash&quot; name. On March 8, 2023, however, the 2023 event was announced and reverted the event series to its original name of Backlash while maintaining its post-WrestleMania theme. It was also announced to take place on Saturday, May 6, 2023, at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, Puerto Rico, marking the first WWE event held in Puerto Rico since New Year&#x27;s Revolution in 2005, and second event overall. 

In 2024, the event was announced to be held on Saturday, May 4, 2024, in the Lyon commune of Décines-Charpieu, at the LDLC Arena marking WWE&#x27;s first PPV and livestreaming event held in France, with the event in turn titled Backlash France, subsequently marking the first Backlash held outside of North America.

<doc id="594326" wikidata="Q13434222" url="?curid=594326" title="Trooper (band)">
<text>Trooper is a Canadian rock band formed by singer Ra McGuire and guitarist Brian Smith in 1975. The group is best known for their 1970s hits &quot;Raise a Little Hell&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Here for a Good Time (Not a Long Time)&quot;, &quot;The Boys in the Bright White Sports Car&quot;, &quot;General Hand Grenade&quot;, &quot;3 Dressed Up as a 9&quot;, &quot;Janine&quot;, &quot;Two for the Show&quot;, &quot;Oh, Pretty Lady&quot; and &quot;Santa Maria&quot;.

== History ==

=== Winter&#x27;s Green, Applejack, and the 1970s ===
In 1967, Ra McGuire and Brian Smith played in a band called Winter&#x27;s Green, which recorded two songs, &quot;Are You a Monkey&quot; and &quot;Jump in the River Blues&quot;, on the Rumble Records Label. &quot;Are You a Monkey&quot; later appeared on a rock collection: 1983&#x27;s &quot;The History of Vancouver Rock and Roll, Vol. 3&quot;.

In the early seventies, Winter&#x27;s Green changed their name to Applejack and added drummer Tommy Stewart and bassist Harry Kalensky to their line-up. Applejack became a very popular band in the Vancouver area, and began touring extensively in British Columbia. The band played a few original tunes such as &quot;Raise a Little Hell&quot; and &quot;Oh, Pretty Lady&quot;, as well as Top 40 songs by artists such as Neil Young and Chicago.

After hearing Applejack perform, Randy Bachman of Bachman–Turner Overdrive and The Guess Who signed the band to his &quot;Legend&quot; label. The band changed their name to Trooper, and Bachman produced the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Trooper&quot;, which contained the Canadian hits &quot;Baby Woncha Please Come Home&quot; and &quot;General Hand Grenade&quot;. Managed by Sam Feldman, Trooper began touring extensively in both Canada and the United States.

After moving from Legend Records to MCA Records, Trooper added Frank Ludwig on keyboards. Their 1975 debut album was followed by &quot;Two for the Show&quot; in 1976, which was certified Gold in Canada. The album contained the hits &quot;Two for the Show&quot;, and &quot;Santa Maria&quot;. The latter of the two hits was inspired from a trip by boat to Tugwell Island, near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.

Bassist Harry Kalensky was replaced by Doni Underhill before the recording of Trooper&#x27;s third studio album. &quot;Knock &#x27;Em Dead Kid&quot;, was released in 1977 and became the group&#x27;s first Canadian Platinum record. This album contained the hits &quot;We&#x27;re Here for a Good Time (Not a Long Time)&quot;, and &quot;Oh, Pretty Lady&quot;.

In 1978, &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot; went double-platinum and featured the group&#x27;s only successful U.S. single, &quot;Raise A Little Hell&quot;. This album also contained the hits &quot;Round, Round We Go&quot; and &quot;The Moment That It Takes&quot;, both of which were sung by keyboardist Frank Ludwig.

The band&#x27;s 1979 album, &quot;Hot Shots&quot;, broke all records for Canadian sales of a Canadian album, reaching Quadruple-Platinum status. &quot;Hot Shots&quot; was a greatest hits album containing original tracks of the most popular songs that had been released as singles for Trooper&#x27;s first four studio albums, as well as a remixed version of &quot;The Boys in the Bright White Sports Car&quot;. (originally released on &quot;Two for the Show&quot; in 1976), which became a hit single upon the release of &quot;Hot Shots&quot;.

Trooper&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Flying Colors&quot;, was released in 1979, and contained the hits &quot;Three Dressed Up as a Nine&quot; and &quot;Janine&quot;, the band&#x27;s highest-charting single to date, which pushed the album to attain Double-Platinum status.

Also in 1979, Frank Ludwig left the band and was replaced by Rob Deans, who performed on the next two albums.

=== 1980s ===
In April 1980, Trooper was honoured with a Juno Award for &quot;Group of the Year&quot;. Two of their albums (&quot;Hot Shots&quot; and &quot;Flying Colors&quot;, both released in 1979) were also nominated that year for &quot;Album of the Year&quot;.

Trooper&#x27;s self-produced seventh album &quot;Untitled&quot; released in October 1980, and &quot;Money Talks&quot; was released in 1982 and produced by Heart producer Mike Flicker and released on the RCA Label.

In 1980, Trooper severed their artist–producer relationship with Randy Bachman.

In 1983, Tommy Stewart left the band and was replaced on drums by Marc LaFrance. 

In October 1985, bassist John Dryden and drummer Ronnie Baran joined the band replacing Doni Underhill and Marc LaFrance respectively. 

In 1986, Trooper was without a permanent keyboardist, and Frank Ludwig re-joined the band as a temporary replacement on their summer tour.

&quot;The Last of the Gypsies&quot; was released in 1989 on the band&#x27;s self-owned &quot;Great Pacific Records&quot; label and distributed by Warner Music Canada. This was Trooper&#x27;s first studio album in six years, and was certified Canadian Gold. It appeared on the RPM Top 100 Albums chart that year. It contained the hits &quot;Boy With the Beat&quot;, and &quot;The Best Way (to Hold A Man)&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
&quot;Ten&quot;, released in 1991, contained the regional hit &quot;American Dream&quot;, and was the group&#x27;s tenth studio album.
Drummer John Stoltz played with the band from 1990 to 1995, when Lance Chalmers took his place and played with the band for eight years. In 1995, Gogo replaced Blaine Smith, becoming Trooper&#x27;s keyboardist and in 1996, bassist Scott Brown joined the band. Both Gogo and Brown continue to tour and perform with Trooper today.

In 1998, Trooper guest starred on &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; &quot;New Year&#x27;s Special&quot;. Their songs were also played in numerous episodes of &quot;22 Minutes&quot; throughout the 8th season (2000–01).

At the 1999 SOCAN Awards, Trooper songwriters Brian Smith and Ra McGuire received SOCAN Classic Awards for &quot;We&#x27;re Here for a Good Time&quot; and &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, presented for songs that have received over 100,000 documented radio plays, becoming deeply embedded in the fabric of Canadian radio and culture. Ra McGuire also received a Classic Award for the Trooper hit &quot;Two for the Show&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
In 2001, &quot;Shot Spots&quot;, a punk tribute to Trooper, was released on Visionary Records. It contains 30 Trooper songs performed by 30 Canadian punk bands (D.O.A., SNFU, Dirty Bird, Dayglo Abortions and others) and an introduction by Canadian comedian Rick Mercer. As detailed in a four-page 2004 photo essay by Todd Korol in Maclean&#x27;s Magazine and a two-page 2005 story in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; by Peter Cheney, Trooper is still very active and popular as a touring band, performing as many as 100 shows a year across Canada.

Trooper songwriters Brian Smith and Ra McGuire received a fourth SOCAN Classic Award in 2005, for &quot;Oh, Pretty Lady.&quot;

In April 2006, Trooper singer and songwriter, Ra McGuire, released his first book, published by Insomniac Press, &quot;Here For a Good Time – On the Road With Trooper, Canada&#x27;s Legendary Rock Band&quot;.

In Fall 2006, drummer Clayton Hill joined the band, and continues to tour and perform with Trooper today.

=== 2010 onwards ===
2010 saw Trooper celebrating their 35th Anniversary – starting with their performance at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics Victory Ceremony on February 21, which was broadcast across Canada and the world on networks such as CTV and MuchMusic, and ending with their performance on November 28 at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton for the 98th Grey Cup, with shows throughout the year and coast to coast, many which broke attendance records.

Trooper&#x27;s first official compilation album &quot;Hits From 10 Albums&quot; was released on July 1, 2010. The totally updated and re-mastered collection featured songs spanning the entirety of their recording career. John Kereiff of Gonzo Magazine called it &quot;THE summer album of 2010.&quot; Universal Music&#x27;s official Press Release named Trooper as &quot;one of Canada&#x27;s top five selling bands of all time&quot;.

On August 11, 2010, the members of Trooper enjoyed a private tour of the Gatineau Preservation Centre to see where Library and Archives Canada houses its collected Trooper archives. The Trooper archives consist of 401 photographs and a stack of textual records such as financial records, which McGuire and Smith donated in 2004, hoping to provide some insight to the Canadian music industry of the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s. McGuire, &quot;now 60, bald, and bespectacled&quot; had a chance to laugh when he read aloud from an old Toronto Sun clipping among the collection which described McGuire as &quot;a new teen idol.&quot; The band later made another donation to the archive, including some of their early demo recordings, lyrics sheets, and master tapes.

The band has also donated the massive 32-foot sign bearing Trooper&#x27;s logo, complete with strobe-lit stars once used to illuminate their shows, to the Canadian Museum of Civilization.

Trooper&#x27;s visit to the archive was covered by almost every major newspaper in Canada.

In 2012, Ra McGuire and Brian Smith were presented with the SOCAN National Achievement Award, which is presented to members who have had outstanding success, predominantly in the Canadian music industry, over the span of their career. They also received three SOCAN Classic Awards for &quot;Raise a Little Hell&quot;, &quot;General Hand Grenade&quot;, and &quot;Janine&quot;.

In November 2019, Brian Smith was presented with the Fraser Valley Music Lifetime Achievement Award.

=== 2021 ===

In November 2021, founding members Ra McGuire and Brian Smith announced their retirement. 

=== 2023 ===

On May 18, 2023 at the National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Trooper was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. Trooper was also inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame at the Rock of Fame event on September 28, 2023 at Massey Hall, Toronto.

=== 2024 ===
Trooper was inducted into the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame and unveiled their StarWalk star in front of the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver B.C. on September 6, 2024. Twenty former and current band members attended.

=== Current ===

With Smith and McGuire&#x27;s encouragement and blessing, Trooper continues to perform with Gogo, Scott Brown, and Clayton Hill, the longest running members of the band. Longtime west coast musician and Trooper guitar tech Steve Crane takes the lead guitar position, and international recording artist Paul Laine performs lead vocals.

<doc id="594329" wikidata="Q1471117" url="?curid=594329" title="Line of battle">
<text>The line of battle or the battle line is a tactic in naval warfare in which a fleet of ships forms a line end to end. The first example of its use as a tactic is disputed—it has been variously claimed for dates ranging from 1502 to 1652. Line-of-battle tactics were in widespread use by 1675.

Compared with prior naval tactics, in which two opposing ships closed on one another for individual combat, the line of battle has the advantage that each ship in the line can fire its broadside without fear of hitting a friendly ship. This means that in a given period, the fleet can fire more shots. Another advantage is that a relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concentration of fire on that part. The other fleet can avoid this by manoeuvring in a line itself, with a result typical for sea battles since 1675: two fleets sail alongside one another (or on the opposite tack).

==Background==
The first recorded mention of the use of a line of battle tactic is to be found in the &quot;Instructions&quot;, provided in 1500 by Manuel I, king of Portugal, to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean. The precision in the &quot;Instructions&quot; suggests that the tactic was in place before this date. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, &quot;The Art of War at Sea&quot;, Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, Fernão de Oliveira, recognized that at sea, the Portuguese &quot;fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses...&quot;. He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation.
Line-of-battle tactics had been used by the Fourth Portuguese India Armada at the Battle of Calicut (1503), under Vasco da Gama, near Malabar against a Muslim fleet. One of the earliest recorded deliberate uses is documented in the First Battle of Cannanore between the Third Portuguese India Armada under João da Nova and the naval forces of Calicut, earlier in the same year. Another early, but different form of this strategy, was used in 1507 by Afonso de Albuquerque at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, in the first conquest of Ormuz. Albuquerque commanded a fleet of six carracks manned by 460 men, and entered Ormuz Bay, being surrounded by 250 warships and a 20,000 men army on land. Albuquerque made his small fleet (but powerful in its artillery) circle like a carrousel, but in a line end-to-end, and destroyed most of the ships that surrounded his squadron. He then captured Ormuz.

From the mid-16th century, the cannon gradually became the most important weapon in naval warfare, replacing boarding actions as the decisive factor in combat. At the same time, the natural tendency in the design of galleons was for longer ships with lower forecastles and aftercastles, which meant faster, more stable vessels. These newer warships could mount more cannons along the sides of their decks, concentrating their firepower along their broadside, while presenting a lower target to their enemy.

==Development during the Anglo-Dutch battles of the early 1650s==
Until the mid-17th century, the tactics of a fleet were often to &quot;charge&quot; the enemy, firing bow chaser cannon, which did not deploy the broadside to its best effect. These new vessels required new tactics, and &quot;since ... almost all the artillery is found upon the sides of a ship of war, hence it is the beam that must necessarily and always be turned toward the enemy. On the other hand, it is necessary that the sight of the latter must never be interrupted by a friendly ship. Only one formation allows the ships of the same fleet to satisfy fully these conditions. That formation is the line ahead [column]. This line, therefore, is imposed as the only order of battle, and consequently as the basis of all fleet tactics.&quot; The Dutch admiral Maarten Tromp first used the line of battle tactic in the Fight in the Channel, although some have disputed this.
Captains on both sides of the First Anglo-Dutch War appear to have experimented with the technique in 1652, possibly including Robert Blake at the Battle of Dover (19 May 1652). Tromp faced Blake as he approached from Rye with 12 ships. After Tromp refused to strike sail in salute, a battle took place, but the Dutch, despite their superior numbers, failed to capture any English ships. The engagement was, according to the historian Ben Wilson, &quot;a good old-fashioned melee lacking any sophisticated tactics&quot;.

The Battle of the Kentish Knock (28 September 1652) revealed the weakness of the Dutch fleet, largely consisting of smaller ships, against the English. The Dutch consequently began a large shipbuilding programme. The Battle of Dungeness (30 November 1652) was a victory for the Dutch, and led to the revitalisation of the Commonwealth Navy. One innovation introduced by George Monck (the first English professional soldier to become a senior naval officer) and Deane was the Articles of War, which introduced the concept of Red, White, and Blue squadrons, each with an admiral, a vice admiral, and a rear admiral, The Articles of War established the line of battle as a tactic for naval warfare.

After 1652, battles would be determined by the ability of a line of battle to not be broken down. The line was difficult to maintain when ships performed differently from each other and were affected by the sea conditions and the &quot;chaos of conflict&quot;. At the Battle of Portland (18–20 February 1653), the English were scattered at the start of the battle, and so were unable to attack the Dutch fleet effectively. It was at Portland that Monck saw how little control admirals had in controlling a fleet and passing commands to his ships. One of the first precise written instructions adopting the line of battle tactic were contained in the English Navy&#x27;s Fighting Instructions, written by Blake and his colleagues, and published in 1653. &quot;Instructions for the better ordering of the Fleet in Fighting&quot;, issued on 29 March 1653, was the first clear evidence of the line of battle becoming official policy.
During the Battle of the Gabbard (2/3 June 1653), both fleets began parallel to each other, arranged in three squadrons nose to tail. The English ships were able to fire continuous broadsides, resulting in terrible loss of life and damage to the Dutch fleet. The Dutch were unable to approach the enemy at close quarters, their preferred tactic. This usually prevailed if they could isolate and attack individual ships. The tactic revealed by the Battle of the Gabbard was not new to naval warfare, but was a consequence of the reforms imposed on the English navy. The New Fighting Instructions meant that senior officers could more easily control their ship captains, who could no longer easily evade fighting, or race heroically ahead of the rest of the fleet.

The line-of-battle tactic favoured very large ships that could sail steadily and maintain their place in the line in the face of heavy fire. The change toward the line of battle also depended on an increased disciplining of society and the demands of powerful centralized government to keep permanent fleets led by a corps of professional officers. These officers were better able to manage and communicate between the ships they commanded than the merchant crews that often comprised large parts of a navy&#x27;s force. The new type of warfare that developed during the early modern period was marked by a successively stricter organization. Battle formations became standardized, based on calculated ideal models. The increased power of states at the expense of individual landowners led to increasingly larger armies and navies. A ship that was powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be called a &quot;ship of the line of battle&quot;, or &quot;line of battle ship&quot;. In time this became shortened to &quot;battleship&quot;.

==Problems associated with the tactic ==
The main problem with the line of battle was that when the fleets were of similar size, naval actions using it were generally indecisive. The French in particular were adept at gunnery and would generally take the leeward position to enable their fleet to retire downwind while continuing to fire chain-shot at long range to bring down masts. Eventually so many vessels in a line would be damaged that they would be forced to retire for repairs while the French took few casualties and very little damage.

Fleet commanders sometimes met with greater success by altering or abandoning the line of battle outright by breaking the enemy line and moving through it, as occurred during the Four Days Battle, Battle of Schooneveld, and the Battle of Trafalgar. Another tactic cut off and isolated part of the enemy&#x27;s line while concentrating a stronger force on it (as happened during the Battle of Texel and the Battle of the Saintes).

If the opposing fleets were of similar size, a portion of the line might be overwhelmed by focused gunfire of the entire enemy line by a tactic known as &quot;doubling&quot;. Ships broke through the enemy line and then, acting simultaneously with other vessels that remained on the original side, would engage the enemy fleet.

==Age of Steam and later developments==

In the years following the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, the British Admiralty carried out a radical reform of ship designbetween 1810 and 1840, every detail was altered, and more advances occurred during this period than had happened since the 1660s. There was, however, no change in the principle of the tactic of a line of battle. These alterations were superseded by changes brought about by the advance of steam power and industrially-produced armaments.

Marine steam engines replaced wind power during the 19th century, with HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; converted to steam in 1846, becoming the first steam ship of the line. The Crimean War showed that sailing ships needed to be converted if they were to be of any military use. The introduction of the gun turret, which made it impossible to have ships with a full rig, meant that by the 1870s, sail power had been abandoned. Battleships of the line were still in use in the early 20th century, using steam-driven propellers and armed with turrets. With the introduction of ironclad warships, ramming again became a method of attack, as occurred at the Battle of Lissa (1866), the first ever fleet engagement involving ironclad ships.

When ramming fell out of fashion, the logic of the line of battle tactic returned. It was used in the Battle of Tsushima (1905), the Battle of Jutland (1916), andfor the last timein the Battle of Surigao Strait (1944). The development of aircraft carriers as well as a wide variety of anti-ship missiles, particularly those that were cruise guided and/or had long range, meant that gun engagements were no longer decisive, so that there was no longer any need for a line-of-battle formation.

<doc id="594332" wikidata="Q42028" url="?curid=594332" title="Donald Rooum">
<text>Donald Rooum (20 April 1928 – 31 August 2019) was an English anarchist cartoonist and writer. He had an extremely long association with the &quot;Freedom&quot; newspaper in London, to which he regularly submitted his &quot;Wildcat&quot; comic strips.

In 1963 he played a key role in exposing Harold Challenor, a corrupt police officer who had unsuccessfully tried to frame him for carrying an offensive weapon, see below.

==Early life and education==
Donald Rooum was born in Bradford, Yorkshire. He registered as a conscientious objector but was pressured by his family into doing two years military service, starting January 1947. A resettlement grant following his discharge allowed him to study commercial design at Bradford Regional Art School from 1949 to 1953. A 1952 portrait of him by Frank Lisle, one of his lecturers at the School, is displayed in The Hepworth, Wakefield.

From 1954 to 1966 Rooum worked as a layout artist and typographer in London advertising agencies. He then worked as a lecturer in typographic design at the London College of Printing until 1983. He studied life sciences at the Open University from 1973 to 1979, and was awarded a first class degree in 1980. He was elected Member of the Institute of Biology (incorporated into the Society of Biology in October 2009) and became a Chartered Biologist in 2004.

Rooum lived with Irene Brown from 1954 to 1983 and they had four children: Josephine Anne (born 1956), Penelope Jane (born 1958 died 1960), Mathew Donald (born 1960) and Rebecca Jane (born 1962).

==Activism==
Rooum said that he first became interested in anarchism in 1944 when he visited Speaker&#x27;s Corner in London while on a Ministry of Food scheme which used schoolboys to pick hops in Kent. He subscribed to &quot;War Commentary&quot;, thus beginning a connection with Freedom Press which continued for over sixty years. During that time he was a writer for and an editor of &quot;Freedom&quot;, the name to which &quot;War Commentary&quot; reverted after the end of the Second World War.

In 1949, Rooum attended the annual Anarchist Summer School, which was held that year in Liverpool, and in which he &#x27;made a memorable impact on the anarchist movement in general.&#x27; He then became an outdoor speaker, initially in Market Street, Bradford, and later at Speaker&#x27;s Corner. He was a founding member of the Malatesta Club, an anarchist social club and venue that opened in London on May Day 1954. Rooum and Irene Brown worked as volunteers there.

In the long-running feud between Vernon Richards and &quot;Freedom&quot; on the one hand, and Albert Meltzer and &quot;Black Flag&quot; on the other, Rooum sided with Richards.

== Political affiliation ==
Rooum (1987) disclosed: &quot;The most influential source is Max Stirner. I am happy to be called a Stirnerite anarchist, provided &#x27;Stirnerite&#x27; means one who agrees with Stirner&#x27;s general drift, not one who agrees with Stirner&#x27;s every word.&quot; 

MacKay (2012) observed: &quot;From meeting anarchists in Glasgow during the Second World War, long-time anarchist activist and artist Donald Rooum ... combined Stirner and anarcho-communism.&quot;

==Role in the Challenor affair==

In 1963 Rooum exposed police corruption during demonstrations against the Greek State Visit in July by King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederika. Attempts were made to outlaw the demonstrations and demonstrators were given draconian prison sentences. The government was criticized in the press for the severity of the sentences which was followed by embarrassing climb-downs. Some of the sentences were overturned on appeal and the Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, was required to offer financial compensation.

Rooum proved that an offensive weapon had been planted on him. On 11 July, he had joined a demonstration against the royal party at Claridge&#x27;s hotel. He held up a banner reading, &quot;Lambrakis RIP&quot;, referring to a Greek MP and peace activist who had been murdered. According to Rooum&#x27;s account, the banner was confiscated by a police officer and read by four plain clothes men. Rooum asked, &quot;Can I have my banner back?&quot; He was approached by one of the officers: &quot;This big one with the short-back-and-sides stepped forward. &#x27;Can you have your &quot;what&quot; back?&#x27; &quot;&#x27;My banner.&quot; &quot;He smiled at me. &#x27;You&#x27;re fucking nicked, my old beauty,&#x27; he said, and gave me a terrific clout on the ear.&quot; At the police station, the officer, Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor, &quot;took from his pocket a screwed-up newspaper, which he opened with a flourish. Inside was a piece of brick. His smile widened. &#x27;There you are, my old beauty. Carrying an offensive weapon. You can get two years for that.&#x27;&quot; Rooum was a member of the National Council of Civil Liberties and he had, by good fortune, read some material on forensic science and so gave his clothes to his defence solicitor Stanley Clinton Davis for analysis. No brick dust was found in his pocket and Rooum convinced the magistrate that therefore no brick could have been there at the time of the alleged offence. There followed a public inquiry that criticised the police and led to the imprisonment of three officers. Rooum received £500 compensation (£9,655 at 2017 value) and other convictions were overturned. Challenor was deemed mentally unfit to plead and was committed to Netherne mental hospital. A subsequent enquiry found that he had probably begun developing paranoid schizophrenia for some months before the incident, but the lack of any successful prosecution against him was seen by some as evidence of further establishment corruption.

==Cartoonist==
In 1952, Philip Sansom invited Rooum to draw a regular cartoon strip for &quot;The Syndicalist&quot; and he contributed &quot;Scissor Bill&quot;. The name derived from an IWW name for a bosses&#x27; yes-man. From 1960, his cartoons started appearing in such outlets as &quot;She&quot;, &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;Private Eye&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Rooum has had a long relationship, with interruptions, with &quot;Peace News&quot;, his first work appearing for them in 1962. Originals of his cartoons for &quot;Peace News&quot; up to 1971, together with some for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, are stored at the British Cartoon Archive.

In 1974, Sansom invited Rooum to provide a cartoon for a monthly magazine he was working on, &quot;Wildcat&quot;. Rooum created a character of the same name. &quot;Wildcat&quot; ceased publication in 1975 but in 1980, when Sansom was again working on &quot;Freedom&quot;, he persuaded Rooum and the editorial collective to revive the &quot;Wildcat&quot; comic strip, which featured in every edition until &quot;Freedom&quot; ceased printing in 2014. In 2016, PM Press of California published &quot;Wildcat Anarchist Comics&quot;, a collection of his cartoons coloured by Jayne Clementson, with some autobiographical material, and &quot;What is Anarchism 2nd edition&quot;, an expanded version of the Freedom Press &quot;What is Anarchism&quot; 1992.

Rooum drew the &quot;Sprite&quot; strip for &quot;The Skeptic&quot; magazine from 1987. Also he illustrated several books, including &quot;Don&#x27;t you believe it!&quot; by John Radford. An exhibition of his work was held at Conway Hall London in 2008. Another exhibition, &#x27;Emotional need&#x27;, which featured &quot;Wildcat&quot;, the short film by Adam Louis-Jacob about Rooum&#x27;s black and white strip cartoons for &quot;Freedom&quot;, was held at Collective in Edinburgh in 2017.

<text>Cell proliferation is the process by which &quot;a cell grows and divides to produce two daughter cells&quot;. Cell proliferation leads to an exponential increase in cell number and is therefore a rapid mechanism of tissue growth. Cell proliferation requires both cell growth and cell division to occur at the same time, such that the average size of cells remains constant in the population. Cell division can occur without cell growth, producing many progressively smaller cells (as in cleavage of the zygote), while cell growth can occur without cell division to produce a single larger cell (as in growth of neurons). Thus, cell proliferation is not synonymous with either cell growth or cell division, despite these terms sometimes being used interchangeably.

Stem cells undergo cell proliferation to produce proliferating &quot;transit amplifying&quot; daughter cells that later differentiate to construct tissues during normal development and tissue growth, during tissue regeneration after damage, or in cancer.

The total number of cells in a population is determined by the rate of cell proliferation minus the rate of cell death.

Cell size depends on both cell growth and cell division, with a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell growth leading to production of larger cells and a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell division leading to production of many smaller cells. Cell proliferation typically involves balanced cell growth and cell division rates that maintain a roughly constant cell size in the exponentially proliferating population of cells. Cell proliferation occurs by combining cell growth with regular &quot;G1-S-G2-M&quot; cell cycles to produce many diploid cell progeny.

In single-celled organisms, cell proliferation is largely responsive to the availability of nutrients in the environment (or laboratory growth medium).

In multicellular organisms, the process of cell proliferation is tightly controlled by gene regulatory networks encoded in the genome and executed mainly by transcription factors including those regulated by signal transduction pathways elicited by growth factors during cellcell communication in development. Recently it has been also demonstrated that cellular bicarbonate metabolism, which is responsible for cell proliferation, can be regulated by mTORC1 signaling. In addition, intake of nutrients in animals can induce circulating hormones of the Insulin/IGF-1 family, which are also considered growth factors, and that function to promote cell proliferation in cells throughout the body that are capable of doing so.

Uncontrolled cell proliferation, leading to an increased proliferation rate, or a failure of cells to arrest their proliferation at the normal time, is a cause of cancer.

<text>In computing, uconv is a command-line tool that is bundled with International Components for Unicode that converts text files between different character encodings. It is very similar to the &quot;iconv&quot; command that is part of the Single UNIX Specification which is usually implemented using libiconv. In fact the command line options for transcoding are the same. The command &quot;uconv&quot; can also convert to and from various Unicode normalization forms. 

There is also an alternative implementation written in Ruby. It was written to supplement support of Japanese encoding in Ruby&#x27;s XML Parser.

<doc id="594342" wikidata="Q4917518" url="?curid=594342" title="Bishop College">
<text>Bishop College was a historically black college, founded in Marshall, Texas, United States, in 1881 by the Baptist Home Mission Society. It was intended to serve students in east Texas, where the majority of the black population lived at the time. In 1961 the administration moved the college into Dallas, Texas. It closed in 1988.

In 2006 the president of Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky reached out to Bishop College alumni, proposing to have them &quot;adopt&quot; his college as an alma mater. He offered scholarships to their descendants, with a chance to have their diploma read &quot;Bishop College&quot;. This was part of an effort to increase minority enrollment at Georgetown.

==History==
The college was founded by the Baptist Home Mission Society in 1881 as the result of a movement to build a college for African-American Baptists. Nathan Bishop, who had been the superintendent of several major school systems in New England, started this effort. Baylor University President Rufus C. Burleson secured a pledge of $25,000 from Judge Bishop to start the college during a meeting of the National Baptist Education Society meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

A committee of Baptist ministers from East Texas, where most African Americans then lived, selected a location in Marshall, on land belonging to the Holcomb Plantation, Wyalucing.

For the college&#x27;s first several decades, Bishop&#x27;s faculty and administration were staffed largely by European Americans. The first African American appointed as president was Joseph J. Rhoads, who started in 1929 and served through the Great Depression and World War II. During his presidency, Bishop phased out the high school preparatory programs associated with the college, which had operated to help students compensate for failures in public education. He emphasized the college&#x27;s new two-year ministerial program.

During the 1930s and 1940s, the ministerial program was developed as the Lacey Kirk Williams Institute. It moved to Dallas when the college moved in 1961. The Lacey Kirk Williams Institute evolved into a week-long seminar which attracted well-known preachers including Jesse Jackson and Martin Luther King Sr. in 1975. (source, Lloyd Thompson&#x27;s dissertation for North Texas University, p 34–35)

In 1961, after receiving a grant from the Hoblitzelle Foundation, Bishop moved to a campus in Dallas. It was able to attract more students there. In Dallas, enrollments increased, peaking at almost 2,000 students around 1970.

The college closed in 1988 after a financial scandal led to the revocation of its accreditation, and its eligibility to receive funds from charities such as the United Negro College Fund. Purchased in 1990 by Comer S. Cottrell, the campus is now used by Paul Quinn College.

In 2006, the president of Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky proposed a plan to Bishop College alumni to make Georgetown their adopted &quot;alma mater&quot;. Georgetown offers scholarships to children or grandchildren of Bishop alumni or students nominated by Bishop alumni. Upon graduation, these students receive diplomas with the name and insignia of Bishop College. Georgetown president William H. Crouch Jr. hopes the program will help the college reach its goal of increasing minority enrollment to 25% by 2012.

==Athletics==
The Bishop athletic teams were called the Tigers. The college was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as an NAIA Independent from 1965–66 to the school&#x27;s closure in 1987–88. The Tigers previously competed in the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC) from 1958–59 to 1964–65, and the South Central Athletic Conference from 1956–57 to 1957–58. They were also a founding member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) from 1920–21 to 1955–56, which is currently an NCAA Division I FCS athletic conference.

<doc id="594352" wikidata="Q944482" url="?curid=594352" title="Simeiz Observatory">
<text>Simeiz Observatory (also spelled Simeis or Simeïs) was an astronomy research observatory until the mid-1950s. It is located on Mount Koshka, Crimea, by the town of Simeiz.

Part of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, it is currently used for laser based studies of the orbits of satellites.

The Minor Planet Center (MPC) credits Simeiz Observatory as the location where a total of 150 minor planets were discovered by astronomers Grigory Neujmin, Sergey Belyavsky, Vladimir Albitsky, Grigory Shajn, Nikolaj Ivanov, Pelageya Shajn, Praskov&#x27;ja Parchomenko, Alexander Deutsch and Evgenij Skvorcov.

As of 2017, the discovery of the minor planet is directly credited to Simeiz Observatory by the MPC.

== History ==
The Simeiz Observatory was founded by Russian amateur astronomer Nikolai Maltsov, who later became a honored member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and after whom asteroid 749 Malzovia was named. In 1900, he built a tower for refractor at his land plot near Simeiz. In 1906 – a tower with dome for Zeiss double astrograph. Both towers are preserved and being used nowadays. In 1908, Maltsov handed his observatory to Pulkovo Observatory as a present. In 1912, the first astrophysical department of Pulkovo Observatory was officially opened at the south of Russia. Simeiz observatory is situated at the level of 360 m above sea level at southern mountainside of the Crimean mountains, at Koshka mountain. A main building was restored after the Second World War on the basis of old building in modernized style with balconies decorated by columns.

Research of interstellar space and star formation zones, discovery of star rotation, creation of stellar catalogues of radial velocities, study of chemical composition of stars and the Sun brought the world publicity to Simeiz Observatory. The results of research of stars and the Sun represents an independent value.

The department provides observing facilities for astronomers of international community and for its own staff. The following projects currently run:
# Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
# Multi-wavelength monitoring of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
# Solar and stellar activity investigations
# Molecular lines observations at mm wavelengths

== Discoveries ==
Minor planets, whose discovery is directly credited to the observatory (rather than a particular astronomer).
In the 1950s the observatory issued several lists of galactic emission nebulas, published by G. A. Shajn and V. F. Gaze (also transliterated Hase) in the Ukrainian &quot;Bulletin of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory&quot; (Izvestiya Krymskoi Astrofizicheskoi Observatorii) and known collectively as the Simeis catalogue. The catalogue includes Simeis 57 (the Propeller Nebula in Cygnus) and Simeis 147 (the Spaghetti Nebula in Auriga).

== History ==
The town of Seki was founded on April 1, 1889 with the early Meiji period establishment of municipalities. From the late Nara period through the Edo period, it had existed as Seki-juku, a post town on the Tōkaidō connecting the capital of Japan with the eastern provinces.

On January 11, 2005, Seki was merged into the expanded city of Kameyama and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

<text>Muk-jji-ppa is a variant of the two-player game rock paper scissors. It originated in South Korea.

# The game starts with an ordinary game of rock paper scissors (가위바위보).
# Once someone wins, they become the attacker and the other player becomes the defender
# The two then rhythmically show either 묵 (&quot;muk&quot;), 찌 (&quot;jji&quot;) or 빠 (&quot;ppa&quot;).
# The attacker must shout their move each turn before they make it
# The game ends when either:

The defender plays the same move as the attacker, who wins

or

The attacker shouts a word which doesn&#x27;t match the hand sign


== History ==
The basic idea of Muj-jji-ppa is known to be originated from Japan after the victory of the Russo-Japanese war. The game it originated from, じゃんけん (janken), came from China around the 17th century.

<doc id="594370" wikidata="Q59486" url="?curid=594370" title="Senate (Netherlands)">
<text>The Senate ( , literally &quot;First Chamber of the States General&quot;, or simply ; sometimes ) is the upper house of the States General, the legislature of the Netherlands. Its 75 members are elected on lists by the members of the twelve States-Provincial and four electoral colleges for the Senate every four years, within three months of the provincial elections. All provinces and colleges have different electoral weight depending on their population.

Members of the Senate tend to be veteran or part-time politicians at the national level, often having other roles. They receive an allowance which is about a quarter of the salary of the members of the lower house. Unlike the politically more significant House of Representatives, it meets only once a week.

It has the right to accept or reject legislative proposals but not to amend them or to initiate legislation. Directly after a bill has been passed by the House of Representatives, it is sent to the Senate and is submitted to a parliamentary committee. The committee decides whether the bill can be immediately put on the agenda of the full chamber or if there should first be preparatory study of the bill. If a bill is immediately put on the agenda of the full chamber, it is passed as a formality without a debate.

==Name==
Although this body is called the &quot;Senate&quot; in English, this is not a direct translation of its official Dutch name, the &quot;First Chamber of the States General&quot; or, in short, the &quot;First Chamber&quot;. Nevertheless, and in contrast to the Second Chamber, the name &quot;Senaat&quot; is also used often in the media. &quot;Member of the First Chamber&quot; (&quot;Eerste Kamerlid&quot;), &quot;member of the Senate&quot; (&quot;senaatslid&quot;) or &quot;senator&quot; (&quot;senator&quot;) are used, although the first one is the official and most used term.

==History==
The first constitution of the modern Netherlands, passed in 1814, re-established a unicameral States General. As it became clear that the former Southern Netherlands would be added to the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands, a newly instituted constitutional commission was tasked with drafting a new constitution. The southern members of the constitutional commission pressed for a bicameral system because of the conviction that their nobility should be given a place in the legislature. While the northern members were not enthusiastic about the proposal, they agreed under the condition that nobility would not be a requirement for membership. The new constitution, which came into effect on 24 August 1815, thus provided for a Senate consisting of forty to sixty members appointed by the king for life. The list of the first appointees was published on 16 September 1815 and the newly appointed chamber was first assembled on 21 September 1815 in Brussels in a joint assembly with the House of Representatives. In its early years, the Senate functioned as a bulwark of the Crown (the king and his ministers). Its members, appointed by the king from among the &quot;most significant of the country&quot;, were mostly confidants of the king who were often called upon to veto bills that displeased him. Such bills were usually private members&#x27; bills from the House of Representatives. The Senate remained in existence after the independence of Belgium in 1830, although its membership was halved to no fewer than twenty and no more than thirty members.

Much changed in the political sphere as a result of the Constitutional Reform of 1848, which introduced direct elections for the House of Representatives, which until then had been elected by provincial councils. The constitutional commission, under the chairmanship of Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, intended for the Senate to be directly elected as well, but the predominantly conservative House of Representatives blocked this, fearing that the two chambers would be too similar. Additionally, senators were expected to judge bills with more independence and distance from daily politics, as a &quot;chambre de reflection&quot;, which was deemed impossible when they would be forced to campaign for direct election.

It was therefore decided that the Senate would henceforth be elected by provincial councils. Its 39 seats were distributed among the provinces degressively proportional to population, and a third of its members would be elected for 9-year terms every three years using a majoritarian system. The position of the Senate and the criteria governing eligibility to stand for election were also among the changes. Monitoring the quality of legislation gradually came to be the main function of the Senate after 1848.

The existence and functioning of the Senate have been criticised throughout history, manifested in reports of state commissions, government proposals and private member&#x27;s bills calling for reform or abolition of the Senate. Abolition of the Senate was attempted by social democrats and progressive liberals in 1903, and again after World War I, but these proposals could not count on sufficient support.

However, reform came in 1922, five years after a constitutional amendment that introduced universal male suffrage and proportional representation to the House of Representatives. The constitutional amendment of 1922 brought proportional representation to the Senate as well. Rather than the seats being distributed among the provinces, the provinces were now organised into four groups of roughly equal population, each electing twelve or thirteen senators under party-list proportional representation. The term of senators was decreased to six years, with two of the four groups electing their senators every three years. The number of senators was increased from 50 to 75 in 1956, and the distribution of seats among groups of provinces was adapted to account for changes in population distribution.

The Senate was subjected to another reform in 1983. The term of senators was further reduced to four years, equal to that of Representatives. The system of groups of provinces and staggered elections was abolished in favour of quadrennial elections for the entire Senate in one nationwide constituency. The state commission which had paved the way for the constitutional reform had also recommended direct elections for the Senate, but the House of Representatives adopted a motion rejecting this proposal.

Several minor changes have since been adopted. In 2010, the possibility for party lists to enter into an electoral alliance was abolished, and the number of preference votes needed for a candidate to be elected was increased from 50% to 100% of the quota. The establishment of the three electoral colleges for the Caribbean Netherlands was made possible by the constitutional amendment of 2017. The members of the Caribbean electoral colleges were elected for the first time on 20 March 2019. Citizens of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba with Dutch nationality are entitled to vote. The establishment of a non-resident electoral college was made possible by the 2022 constitutional amendment.

==Elections and composition==
===Eligibility===
Any Dutch citizen aged 18 years or older who is qualified to vote can stand for election in either house of the States General. However, no one can simultaneously sit as a member in both houses.

===Electoral system===

The 75 senators are elected every four years by the members of the States-Provincial of the country&#x27;s twelve provinces and (since 2019) by electoral colleges of the Caribbean Netherlands and Dutch expatriates. The seats are distributed in one nationwide constituency using party-list proportional representation. Remainder seats are distributed using the highest averages method. The weight of a member&#x27;s vote is determined by the population of the province in which the voter is a member of the States-Provincial, at a ratio of approximately 1 vote per 100 residents. The table below shows the weight of members&#x27; votes per province as of the 2019 election.

==Parliamentary groups==
==College of President and Vice-Presidents==
The College of President and Vice-Presidents is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Senate. It consists of the president of the Senate and two vice-presidents.

<text>Gling-Gló is the only studio album by Björk Guðmundsdóttir &amp; tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar, consisting of Björk Guðmundsdóttir on vocals, Guðmundur Ingólfsson on piano, Guðmundur Steingrímsson on drums, and Þórður Högnason on bass. The album&#x27;s title &quot;Gling-gló&quot; is the Icelandic equivalent of the English onomatopoeia &quot;ding dong&quot;, referring to the sound that a bell makes.

Most of the songs were recorded on 1 September and 3 September 1990 at Stúdio Sýrland, except for two tracks, which were recorded on 23 August 1990. It was produced by Tómas Magnús Tómasson, the bassist of Stuðmenn. The album was released in October 1990 by Smekkleysa. It received mixed reviews by critics.

==Background and recording==
Most of the songs were recorded on 1 September and 3 September 1990 at Stúdio Sýrland. &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Loving that Man&quot; were recorded on 23 August 1990 on Ríkisútvarpið (National Icelandic Broadcasting Service) for &quot;Djasskaffi&quot;, a radio programme hosted by Ólafur Þórðarsson. It was produced by Tómas Magnús Tómasson, the bassist of Stuðmenn.

==Composition==
Most of the songs are sung in Icelandic. Several of these songs are covers of jazz standards translated and sung in Icelandic. Three are sung with a noticeably different musical arrangement: &quot;Bílavísur&quot; (originally &quot;The Blacksmith Blues&quot;), &quot;Ég veit ei hvað skal segja&quot; (Theresa Brewer&#x27;s &quot;Ricochet Romance&quot;) and &quot;Pabbi minn&quot; (&quot;O Mein Papa&quot;).

&quot;Þad sést ekki sætari mey&quot; is misattributed in the liner notes as a &quot;Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&quot; composition, but is instead an interpolation of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get a Man with a Gun&quot; from the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;.

==Track listing==

Note: 
The last track on the bonus edition, “I Can’t Help Loving That Man” is also known as “I Can’t Help Loving You” on certain versions of the album.

<doc id="594378" wikidata="Q2411119" url="?curid=594378" title="The Eulenspiegel Society">
<text>The Eulenspiegel Society, also known as TES, is the first BDSM organization founded in the United States. It was founded in 1971 and based in New York City.

==History==
The Eulenspiegel Society was the first BDSM organization founded in the United States. It was founded in 1971 in New York City by Pat Bond, a music teacher, and Fran Nowve, as an informal association and support group for masochists; sadists joined shortly after in that same year.

Bond placed an ad in &quot;Screw&quot; magazine in December 1970, reading:

The ad also ran in the &quot;East Village Other&quot;. Fran Nowve, using the name Terry Kolb, was the first person to answer the ad. She and Bond began The Eulenspiegel Society in 1971, and Nowve came up with its name.

In August 1971, The Eulenspiegel Society&#x27;s members voted to include sadists in the organization. The Eulenspiegel Society originally met in members&#x27; homes, and then met in rented space in theaters and churches. The organization was an active part of the 1970s sexual revolution, as well as LGBT activism, including marching in New York City Pride Parades beginning in the early 1970s. The organization also launched &quot;Prometheus&quot;, a decades-long-running magazine, in the early 1970s, exploring issues important to kinksters, ranging from advice columns and personal ads, to erotica and art, to conversation about the philosophy of consensual kink. The magazine now exists online.

From 1973 until he died in 1983, Jack Jackson, a black leatherman, was the first president of The Eulenspiegel Society; to “signal that he was forever one with the title”, The Eulenspiegel Society has not had a president since, leaving him as its only one. He was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame in 2021.

In 1992, The Eulenspiegel Society&#x27;s cofounder Pat Bond received the Steve Maidhof Award for National or International Work from the National Leather Association International.

In 1993, Leather Pride Night by The Eulenspiegel Society, Excelsior MC, GMS/MA, LSM, and NLA: Metro New York received the Large Event of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards.

In 1994, Barbara Nitke attended her first meeting of The Eulenspiegel Society to see a presentation by underground photographer Charles Gatewood. The couples she met in the SM scene fascinated her, and she began photographing them in 1994. They became the focus of her book, &quot;Kiss of Fire: A Romantic View of Sadomasochism&quot; (2003). It was among the first mainstream publications to examine the subject of BDSM.

In 1996, The Eulenspiegel Society hosted the first large BDSM convention, in celebration of its 25th anniversary. This event was so well attended that the organization took over two large clubs (Hellfire Club and The Vault) as well as a disco which was converted into a club. Over 1,300 people attended. This event inspired other leather organizations to hold annual conventions as well. In 1997, this event received the Large Event of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards.

The Eulenspiegel Society was one of the founding coalition partners of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, which was founded in 1997.

In 1999, Gary Switch posted to The Eulenspiegel Society&#x27;s USENET list &quot;TES-Friends&quot; proposing the term RACK (Risk-aware consensual kink) out of a desire to form a more accurate portrayal of the type of play that many engage in. Noting that nothing is truly 100% safe, not even crossing the street, Switch compared BDSM to the sport of mountain climbing. In both, risk is an essential part of the thrill, and that risk is minimized through study, training, technique, and practice.

In 2002, The Eulenspiegel Society reorganized as &quot;The TES Association.&quot; It retains rights to its original name and historical intellectual property.

In 2003, TES received the Large Club of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards.

In 2011, TES was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame (under the name Eulenspiegel Society).

In 2015, Bond and Nowve (the latter under the name Terry Kolb) were inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

==Organizational activities==
TES (pronounced &quot;Tess,&quot;) is an entirely volunteer-run nonprofit organization, including an elected board of directors. It &quot;promotes sexual liberation for all adults, especially for people who enjoy consensual S/M&quot;. It regards sexual liberation as a prerequisite for a &quot;truly free&quot; society and it is particularly concerned about the freedom of sexual minorities such as the BDSM community.

TES generally holds two classes each week (over 100 a year) in New York City, both general meetings, and ones hosted by special interest groups, ranging from bondage to meet-ups for novices interested in alternative sexualities. In 1996, TES hosted the first large BDSM convention, in celebration of its 25th anniversary. This event was so well attended that the organization took over two large clubs (Hellfire Club and The Vault) as well as a disco which was converted into a club. Over 1,300 people attended. This event inspired other leather organizations to hold annual conventions as well. It also hosts frequent social events, including parties. Membership includes discounts at participating stores and clubs. It also supports AIDS prevention education and organizations such as the Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, for which TES is a founding coalition partner.

==Name==
The Eulenspiegel Society took its name from Till Eulenspiegel, a character described as a &quot;foolish yet clever lad&quot; in medieval German folklore. It changed its legal name to &quot;The TES Association&quot; in 2002, although it still uses and is widely known by the original name. The original name, which cofounder Fran Nowve came up with, was inspired by a passage from Austrian psychoanalyst Theodor Reik&#x27;s &quot;Masochism in Modern Man&quot; (1941), in which he argues that patients who engage in self-punishing or provocative behavior do so in order to demonstrate their emotional fortitude, induce guilt in others, and achieve a sense of &quot;victory through defeat&quot;. Reik describes Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s &quot;peculiar&quot; behavior—he enjoys walking uphill, and feels &quot;dejected&quot; walking downhill—and compares it to a &quot;paradox reminiscent of masochism&quot;, because Till Eulenspiegel &quot;gladly submits to discomfort, enjoys it, even transforms it into pleasure&quot;.

<doc id="594381" wikidata="Q1931220" url="?curid=594381" title="Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk">
<text>Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk is a compilation album by the American singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley, released by Columbia Records on May 26, 1998, a year after his death. It comprises recordings Buckley made while working on his second album, &quot;My Sweetheart the Drunk&quot;, with the producer Tom Verlaine in 1996 and 1997. It was released after negotiation with Buckley&#x27;s mother, the owner of his estate, who feared that Sony was trying to exploit his legacy. It received positive reviews.

==Recording and release==
Buckley released his debut album, &quot;Grace&quot;, in 1994. He began recording his second album with the working title &quot;My Sweetheart the Drunk&quot; in late 1996 with the producer Tom Verlaine. Unsatisfied with the results, Buckley discarded the recordings and went to Memphis with his band to start anew. On the evening of May 29, 1997, Buckley went swimming in the Mississippi River and drowned. 

As Buckley left no will, his estate transferred to his mother, Mary Guibert. Soon after Buckley&#x27;s memorial ceremonies, Guibert learned that Sony was in the process of mixing and mastering the Verlaine recordings for release. This angered Guibert and Buckley&#x27;s band, as Buckley had not wanted to release them. Through her lawyer, Guibert sent a cease-and-desist letter to Sony.

Sony had not made back its investment on its record deal with Buckley and was eager to release a new album. However, Guibert would allow them to release only material that was &quot;worth using&quot;. They compromised on a double album, with the Verlaine recordings on one disc and Buckley&#x27;s later demos on the other. Guibert did not allow Sony to alter the demos, saying: &quot;If this was his body here and we were preparing it for his funeral, we would not put him in a suit. We would put him in a flower shirt and some black jeans and his Doc Martens and leave his hair all mussed up.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;My Sweetheart the Drunk&quot; received positive reviews. Biographers and critics wrote that Buckley had been &quot;reaching fruitfully in multiple directions&quot;. The biographers Dave Lory and Jim Irvin identified influences from Siouxsie and the Banshees on &quot;Nightmares by the Sea&quot; and &quot;Witches Rave&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; cited John Lennon and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan as references. The reviewer Steve Hochman likened the track &quot;Everybody Here Wants You&quot; to a &quot;70s-ish soul experiment worthy of Marvin Gaye or Al Green&quot;, and linked &quot;New Year&#x27;s Prayer&quot; to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot;.

During a 2011 interview, Tony Banks of Genesis commented of Buckley&#x27;s rendition of Genesis&#x27;s &quot;Back in N.Y.C.&quot;, &quot;I was very surprised that he did the whole thing including the funny bits. If I&#x27;d been him I would have just stuck to the main thing. But it was fun and quite sweet really, it was kind of &#x27;why not?&#x27;.&quot;

==Track listing==

<doc id="594386" wikidata="Q2667474" url="?curid=594386" title="Age of Sail">
<text>The Age of Sail is a period in European history that lasted at the latest from the mid-16th (or mid-15th) to the mid-19th centuries, in which the dominance of sailing ships in global trade and warfare culminated, particularly marked by the introduction of naval artillery, and ultimately reached its highest extent at the advent of steam power. Enabled by the advances of the related age of navigation, it is identified as a distinctive element of the early modern period and the Age of Discovery.

==Periodization==

Like most periodic eras, defining the age is inexact and serves only as a general description. The term is used differently for warships and merchant vessels.

By the 14th century naval artillery was employed in Europe, documented at the Battle of Arnemuiden (1338). The 15th century saw the Iberian naval ventures all the way along the African Atlantic coast and across the Atlantic Ocean, starting the Age of Discovery.

For warships, the age of sail runs roughly from the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the last significant engagement in which oar-propelled galleys played a major role, to the development of steam-powered warships.

===Golden Age of Sail===
The period between the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity (e.g. clippers and windjammers), is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Golden Age of Sail&quot;.

==Decline==
The second sea-going steamboat was Richard Wright&#x27;s first steamboat &quot;Experiment&quot;, an ex-French lugger; she steamed from Leeds to Yarmouth in July 1813. The first iron steamship to go to sea was the 116-ton &quot;Aaron Manby&quot;, built in 1821 by Aaron Manby at the Horseley Ironworks, and became the first iron-built vessel to put to sea when she crossed the English Channel in 1822, arriving in Paris on 22 June. She carried passengers and freight to Paris in 1822 at an average speed of 8 knots (9 mph, 14 km/h). 

The first purpose-built steam battleship was the 90-gun in 1850. Multiple steam battleships saw action during the Crimean War, especially the Allied (British, French and Ottoman) fleet Bombardment of Sevastopol as part of the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855). The first ironclad battleship, , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. In the March 1862 Battle of Hampton Roads, the ironclad fought , making this the first fight between ironclads.

The Suez Canal in the Middle East, which opened in 1869, was more practical for steamships than for sailing ships, achieving a much shorter European-Asian sea route, which coincided with more fuel-efficient steamships, starting with in 1865.

By 1873, the Age of Sail for warships had ended, with commissioned in 1871. &quot;Devastation&quot; was the first class of ocean-going battleships that did not carry sails.

Sailing ships continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s and 1930s, though steamships soon pushed them out of those trades as well. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from sophisticated dedicated support bases on land. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following trade winds. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in a fraction of the time it took a sailing ship.

Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small-scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as yachting and passenger sail excursion ships.

In recent decades, the commercial shipping industry has been reviving interest in wind assisted ships as a way to conserve fuel in the interest of sustainability.

== Legacy ==
A New Age of Sail has been predicted by some experts to occur by 2030, driven by a revolution in energy technology and a desire to reduce carbon emissions from maritime shipping through wind-assisted propulsion. The book &quot;Trade Winds: A Voyage to a Sustainable Future for Shipping&quot; discusses the potential of a return to wind propulsion through the firsthand experiences of Christiaan De Beukelaer, who spent five months aboard a sailing cargo ship in 2020.

<doc id="594387" wikidata="Q7382184" url="?curid=594387" title="Russian copulation">
<text>In cryptography, Russian copulation is a method of rearranging plaintext before encryption so as to conceal stereotyped headers, salutations, introductions, endings, signatures, etc. This obscures clues for a cryptanalyst, and can be used to increase cryptanalytic difficulty in naive cryptographic schemes (however, most modern schemes contain more rigorous defences; see ciphertext indistinguishability). This is of course desirable for those sending messages and wishing them to remain confidential. Padding is another technique for obscuring such clues.

The technique is to break the starting plaintext message into two parts and then to invert the order of the parts (similar to circular shift). This puts all endings and beginnings (presumably the location of most boilerplate phrases) &quot;somewhere in the middle&quot; of the version of the plaintext that is actually encrypted. For some messages, mostly those not in a human language (e.g., images or tabular data), the decrypted version of the plaintext will present problems when reversing the inversion. For messages expressed in ordinary language, there is sufficient redundancy that the inversion can almost always be reversed by a human immediately on inspection.

The English phrase suggests that it originally came from an observation about Russian cryptographic practice. However, the technique is generally useful and neither was, nor is, limited to use by Russians.

<text>Girls Aloud are a British-Irish pop girl group that was created through the ITV talent show &quot;&quot; in 2002. The line up consisted of members Cheryl, Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh. In 2012, the group was named as Britain&#x27;s biggest selling girl group of the 21st century so far, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK. The group achieved a string of twenty top-ten singles on the UK singles chart, including four number ones. They also achieved seven BPI certified albums, two of which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. They have been nominated for five Brit Awards and won one of them, Best Single in 2009 for &quot;The Promise&quot;.

The group&#x27;s main musical style is pop, and they have also experimented with other sounds including electropop, dance-pop and dance-rock throughout their career. The group&#x27;s collaborations with Brian Higgins and the production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim, because of an &quot;innovative&quot; approach to mainstream pop music. The group became one of the few British reality television acts to achieve continued success, amassing a fortune of £30 million by May 2010. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; listed them as the &quot;Most Successful Reality TV Group&quot; in the 2007 and 2011 edition. They also hold the record for &quot;Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group&quot; in the 2008 edition. 

The group disbanded in March 2013 following the conclusion of the . Harding died of breast cancer on 5 September 2021 at the age of 39. The remaining members reunited for a 2024 concert tour, The Girls Aloud Show, becoming the biggest UK arena tour of 2024.

==History==
===2002: &quot;Popstars: The Rivals&quot;===
Girls Aloud was formed on 30 November 2002 on ITV&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The concept of the programme, hosted by &quot;Big Brother&quot; presenter Davina McCall, was to produce a boy band and a girl group who would be &quot;rivals&quot; and compete for the 2002 Christmas number one single. Following the initial success of Hear&#x27;Say (winners of the original &quot;Popstars&quot; show), several thousand applicants attended auditions across the United Kingdom in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell. However, two of these were disqualified before the live shows began: Hazel Kaneswaran was found to be too old to participate, while Nicola Ward refused to sign the contract, claiming the pay the group would receive was too low. Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts were chosen as their replacements.

During October and November, the finalists took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating week-by-week between the girls and boys). Each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated until the final line-ups of the groups emerged. The five girls who made it into the group were Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Kimberley Walsh, and Sarah Harding; Javine Hylton missed out on a place in the group, despite previous expectations that she would be placed in the line-up. The group was named Girls Aloud and were managed by Louis Walsh, until 2005 when Hilary Shaw replaced him.

The new group competed with the boys&#x27; winning group, One True Voice to have 2002&#x27;s Christmas number one single. Girls Aloud won the battle with their single &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, produced by Brian Higgins and Xenomania. The song spent four consecutive weeks at number one and was certified platinum in March 2003. The song received critical acclaim; Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;it proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn&#x27;t make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture&quot;.

===2002–2005: &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; and &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot;===

After the success of their first single &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, Girls Aloud spent five months recording the follow-up single and their debut album. &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; was completed in April 2003 and released the following month. The album entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The second single, &quot;No Good Advice&quot;, was also released in May 2003 to similar success. Girls Aloud&#x27;s third single, &quot;Life Got Cold&quot;, charted at number three in August 2003. In November 2003, Girls Aloud released a cover version of the Pointer Sisters&#x27; 1980s dance hit &quot;Jump&quot;. The single, which charted at number two, accompanied a new edition of &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;.

After a brief hiatus, Girls Aloud released &quot;The Show&quot; in June 2004, the first single from &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot;, the group&#x27;s second album. The single entered the charts at number two. The next single, &quot;Love Machine&quot;, also peaked at number two in September 2004. Girls Aloud then recorded a cover of The Pretenders&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot; which was released as the official Children in Need charity single. The song was not well received by critics. The cover became Girls Aloud&#x27;s second number one single, holding the position for two weeks.

The album &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; was entirely written and produced by Xenomania. Upon its release on 29 November 2004, the album charted just outside of the top five and was quickly certified platinum. The final single from the album, &quot;Wake Me Up&quot;, was released in February 2005. It charted at number four, making it their first to miss the top three. In early 2005, the group was nominated for a BRIT Award for Best Pop Act. Following the album&#x27;s success, Girls Aloud announced their first tour, the What Will the Neighbours Say...? Tour, which took place in May 2005. The group also released their first DVD, &quot;Girls on Film&quot;.

===2005–2007: &quot;Chemistry&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Girls Aloud&quot;===

Following their first tour, Girls Aloud began work on their third studio album, &quot;Chemistry&quot;. The album peaked on the UK Albums Charts at number eleven and received platinum certification. The first single from the album, &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot; was released in August 2005. The single ended Girls Aloud&#x27;s run of top five singles when it charted at number seven. The follow-up single from the album, &quot;Biology&quot; was released in November 2005. The song was critically acclaimed; Peter Cashmore of &quot;The Guardian&quot; labeled it &quot;the best pop single of the last decade&quot;. The release was followed by a cover of Dee C. Lee&#x27;s &quot;See the Day&quot;, released in the Christmas week of 2005., following this they presented one-off TV Special, Christmas Mania, on ITV, where they sang songs taken from their Christmas album. Girls Aloud won the Heart Award for the single at the O2 Silver Clef Lunch. The group travelled to Australia and New Zealand in February 2006 to release &quot;Biology&quot; and &quot;Chemistry&quot;. Despite, a one-week promotional tour, &quot;Biology&quot; peaked at number twenty-six on the ARIA Singles Chart, failing to break the group in the Australian market. &quot;Whole Lotta History&quot;, the fourth and final single to be taken from &quot;Chemistry&quot;, was released in March 2006 and charted at number six.

In 2005, Girls Aloud filmed a one-off documentary entitled &quot;Girls Aloud: Home Truths&quot; for ITV2. The success of the show later made way for &quot;Girls Aloud: Off the Record&quot;, a six-part fly on the wall documentary series for E4. Girls Aloud then appeared in an episode of &quot;Ghosthunting with...&quot; (without Nadine) towards the end of 2006, in which Yvette Fielding guided them through haunted locations. In May 2006, Girls Aloud embarked on their first arena tour, named . In the same month, Girls Aloud were moved to Fascination Records, a sub-label of Polydor Records. 

In October 2006, Girls Aloud released their first greatest hits collection, &quot;The Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits&quot;. It debuted at number one on the UK album chart and went on to sell over one million copies. The album was accompanied by the single &quot;Something Kinda Ooooh&quot;. Girls Aloud became the first British act to reach the top five purely on download sales; the single peaked at number three following its physical release. The next single was a cover of &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; which peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart. In March 2007, Girls Aloud collaborated with fellow British girl group Sugababes for the cover of the song &quot;Walk This Way&quot; by Aerosmith. Billed as &quot;Sugababes vs. Girls Aloud&quot;, the song served as the official single for &quot;Comic Relief&quot; which became the group&#x27;s third number one. In May 2007, Girls Aloud embarked on their third tour, The Greatest Hits Tour.

===2007–2009: &quot;Tangled Up&quot; and &quot;Out of Control&quot;===

Girls Aloud released their fourth studio album, &quot;Tangled Up&quot;, in November 2007. The first single from the album, &quot;Sexy! No No No...&quot; peaked at number-five on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Call the Shots&quot; entered the top three. The third and final single from the album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Speak French&quot;, continued Girls Aloud&#x27;s top ten streak. The release of the single coincided with Girls Aloud&#x27;s second television series, &quot;The Passions of Girls Aloud&quot;. The show revolved around each member, with the exception of Coyle, achieving aspirations outside of the group. The group received their second Brit Award nomination in 2008, nominated for the Best British Group award. In May 2008, Girls Aloud embarked on the Tangled Up Tour which consisted of 34 concerts around the United Kingdom.

Girls Aloud then recorded two tracks for the soundtrack to the 2007 film, &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s&quot;. They made a cameo appearance in the film, as the school band. The soundtrack was released on 10 December 2007, and the music video for &quot;Theme to St. Trinian&#x27;s&quot; premiered in December 2007.

In November 2008, Girls Aloud released their fifth studio album, &quot;Out of Control&quot;. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and became their most successful studio album to date, being certified double platinum. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;The Promise&quot;, became the group&#x27;s fourth number one on the UK Singles Chart. The single also returned the group to the top two on the Irish Singles Chart. &quot;The Promise&quot; was awarded Best British Single at the 2009 Brit Awards; the group also performed the song during the ceremony. For the promotion of the album, Girls Aloud appeared in a variety show entitled &quot;The Girls Aloud Party&quot; which aired on 13 December 2008 on ITV.

The second single from &quot;Out of Control&quot;, &quot;The Loving Kind&quot; was produced by Xenomania. Peaking at number ten, it became the group&#x27;s twentieth consecutive top ten single. The final single from the album, &quot;Untouchable&quot; was released in April 2009. It peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the first single of the group to miss the top ten. The group embarked on the Out of Control Tour, from April to June 2009. A singles boxset collection was released to coincide with the tour.

In February 2009, Girls Aloud signed a new record deal with Fascination that would see the group release another three studio albums. In July 2009, the group announced that they were taking a year-long hiatus to pursue solo projects, and would reunite for a new studio album in 2010 which did not materialise. In September 2009, the group briefly interrupted the hiatus to do two shows supporting Coldplay along with Jay-Z at Wembley Stadium.

===2012–2013: &quot;Ten&quot;===
After three years of hiatus, Girls Aloud reunited for the group&#x27;s tenth anniversary. On 16 November 2012, the group released their new single, &quot;Something New&quot; – the official charity single for Children in Need. The single peaked at number-two on the UK Singles Chart. The group released their second greatest hits compilation, &quot;Ten&quot; on 23 November 2012. The second single taken from &quot;Ten&quot;, &quot;Beautiful &#x27;Cause You Love Me,&quot; was released on 17 December 2012, and failed to chart in the top-forty. A documentary special entitled &quot;Girls Aloud: Ten Years at the Top&quot; aired on ITV1 on 15 December 2012. In February 2013, the group embarked on . On 20 March 2013, the group performed their final concert at Echo Arena Liverpool. A few hours later, they announced their split on Twitter.

===2021: Death of Sarah Harding===
On 26 August 2020, group member Sarah Harding stated that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer that had advanced to &quot;other parts&quot; of her body. In March 2021, she said that the disease was terminal and that she &quot;won&#x27;t see another Christmas&quot;. She died on 5 September 2021 at the age of 39. On 24 July 2022, Girls Aloud appeared in Hyde Park, London, to raise awareness and money for breast cancer research. Tweedy, Roberts and Coyle participated in the event, with Walsh taking part in a remote event.

===2023–present: The Girls Aloud Show===
In November 2023, the group announced a 2024 tour – The Girls Aloud Show, serving as a dedication in memory of Harding and a &quot;celebration&quot; of the group&#x27;s music. Consisting of thirty shows, the tour opened in Dublin, Ireland in May 2024, and concluded in Liverpool, England in June. Grossing US$19.1 million from twenty shows, it became the biggest arena tour of 2024 in the UK.

The group held a concert at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London, England on 2 July. They also served as a headliner at Brighton Pride on 3 August.

On 6 November 2024, Girls Aloud announced &#x27;I&#x27;ll Stand By You (Sarah&#x27;s Version)&#x27;, their first single in 12 years, was due 17 November 2024, featuring newly discovered lead vocals from the late Sarah Harding from the original recording sessions. The release, marking the 20th anniversary of their original BBC Children in Need single, was announced as 2024&#x27;s Children in Need single and follows the song&#x27;s noteworthy inclusion in the setlist of The Girls Aloud Show.

==Other endeavours==
Girls Aloud came together with Mattel in 2005 to produce Fashion Fever Barbies. Each member designed the outfit and look of a doll modelled after themselves. In addition to live DVDs of their tours and both of Girls Aloud&#x27;s television series, the group has also released &quot;Girls on Film&quot; and &quot;Style&quot;. Official calendars were also issued annually from 2004 to 2009, the only exception being 2005. Girls Aloud co-wrote an autobiography titled &quot;Dreams That Glitter – Our Story&quot;. The book, named after a lyric in &quot;Call the Shots&quot;, was published in October 2008 through the Transworld imprint Bantam Press. Before the release, OK! magazine bought the rights to preview and serialise the book.

In 2007, Girls Aloud signed a £1.25m one-year deal to endorse hair care brand Sunsilk. The girls filmed a television advertisement and appeared in and magazine advertisements, with each of the five members being the face of a different shampoo. The same year, Girls Aloud also signed a deal with the UK division of Samsung. They endorsed mobile phones and MP3 players, made personal appearances and sang at Samsung events, and contributed to competition prizes, among other activities. The Samsung F210 Purple came with a 1GB memory card featuring Girls Aloud content. Girls Aloud appeared in television advertisements for Nintendo DS the following year. The group signed a deal to front a promotional campaign for a new low-calorie KitKat bar called &quot;Senses&quot; in March 2008. Sales increased 6.8% in the United Kingdom.

Beginning in 2009, Girls Aloud teamed with Eylure to release five sets of false eyelashes, each set designed by a different member of the band. A range of festival-themed lashes followed in 2010, while limited edition &quot;10th Anniversary&quot; lashes were released in 2012. Similarly, to celebrate their tenth anniversary, each member designed a charm bracelet for Pandora, available as either a complete bracelet or a &quot;starter&quot; bracelet.

===Philanthropy===
All five members of the group have been involved in charity work. Girls Aloud&#x27;s cover of The Pretenders&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot; was released as the official 2004 Children in Need single, with proceeds going to the charity. Nicola Roberts said, &quot;Hopefully if our single does well it&#x27;s a lot of money going to the charity.&quot; Their cover of Aerosmith and Run DMC&#x27;s &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, a collaboration with the Sugababes, was the official charity single for Comic Relief in 2007, recorded at Comic Relief co-founder and trustee Richard Curtis&#x27; request. Kimberley Walsh said, &quot;It&#x27;s a fantastic song and hopefully will raise tons of money for people living in really difficult situations here and in Africa.&quot; In March 2009, Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh, and various other celebrities climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Comic Relief. Walsh is also a charity ambassador for Breast Cancer Haven. She helped open a £2.2 million breast cancer centre in 2008 and participated in a &quot;heel-a-thon&quot; in 2009. In February 2011, Cheryl Cole launched her own charitable foundation named the &quot;Cheryl Cole Foundation with The Prince&#x27;s Trust following a meeting with The Trust&#x27;s President, Charles, Prince of Wales&quot;.

Girls Aloud celebrated their 10 years as a group by releasing another Children in Need single, &quot;Something New&quot;, which they performed on the &quot;Children in Need&quot; TV special on 16 November 2012.

==Artistry==

===Musical style===
Girls Aloud worked closely with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania throughout their career. Xenomania produced all of Girls Aloud&#x27;s albums and singles, excluding nine songs from their debut album, &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, the charity single &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and two songs from &quot;Ten&quot;. Of Higgins and Xenomania, Girls Aloud&#x27;s former manager Louis Walsh says, &quot;He just makes great songs for radio. They just jump out at you and stay in your brain.&quot; In a review of the group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Alexis Petridis exclaimed it &quot;proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn&#x27;t make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture.&quot; In response to Girls Aloud&#x27;s debut album, Jacqueline Hodges of BBC Music said that &quot;Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits.&quot;

Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; as &quot;a great album: funny, clever, immediate, richly inventive.&quot; He later wrote that &quot;Chemistry&quot; is &quot;a record that dispenses with the tiresome business of verses and instead opts for songs apparently constructed by stitching eight different choruses together.&quot; Talia Kraines of BBC Music exclaimed that Girls Aloud &quot;have resuscitated [pop music&#x27;s] corpse by wedding chart-friendly melodies to experimental avant-garde sounds&quot;. &quot;Biology&quot; was described as &quot;about as far from tired formula as you can possibly get. It sounds like three separate melodies condensed into one.&quot; Popjustice referred to the song as &quot;pop music which redefines the supposed boundaries of pop music.&quot; In a review for 2007&#x27;s &quot;Sexy! No No No...&quot;, Nick Levine of Digital Spy complimented Xenomania&#x27;s work on the song: sacrificing &quot;conventional song structure in the name of keeping [...] hooks coming thick and fast – and quite right too.&quot;

Despite being most generally associated with the pop genre Girls Aloud have experimented with other genres. In particular rock music with singles like &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, &quot;Graffiti My Soul&quot;, &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; and &quot;Sexy! No No No...&quot;.

===Influences===
The band members themselves are known to be fans of artists such as Ne-Yo and Oasis.

The group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; takes influence from a number of 1980s genres, such as synthpop, power pop, and new wave, and 1990s styles like big beat, drum and bass, and garage. The album received comparisons to girl groups such as Bananarama, The Bangles, and the Spice Girls. Similarities to Kylie Minogue and Madonna were also noted. A majority of the songs make use of guitars and electronic beats. The rise of indie rock also inspired Brian Higgins to &quot;blur the edges between commercial music and so-called &#x27;indie&#x27; music.&quot; He continued, &quot;pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise, through The Strokes and everything else. We were an independent company and we were as indie as the other bands around us. The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand.&quot; &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; further explores different subgenres of pop, especially electropop. Synthesizers are more prominent on the album, although the usage of guitar remains prominent in several songs. The backing track to &quot;Love Machine&quot;, composed by Xenomania musicians Tim Powell and Nick Coler, was inspired by The Smiths, while &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; includes a guitar riff inspired by garage rock.

&quot;Chemistry&quot; takes influences from a wide variety of sources, including &quot;everything from French chanson to piano-pounding blues to the clipped R&amp;B of the Small Faces&quot;. Rapping in the same vein as artists like Betty Boo and Neneh Cherry is prominent. Yahoo! Music says &quot;there&#x27;s nary a &#x27;formula&#x27; in sight. There are as many sudden tonal and tempo switches as the tricksiest Chicago art rock band. And all but one song here gives guitars a starring role.&quot; The songs are noticeably less rooted in electronic music, although &quot;Swinging London Town&quot; is &quot;a dark, squiggly synth pop epic a la Pet Shop Boys&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot; is composed of &quot;little Röyksopp-like keyboard riffs&quot;. Alternatively, &quot;Tangled Up&quot; features a dancier, more electronic sound, inspired by the success of their 2006 single &quot;Something Kinda Ooooh&quot;. &quot;Call the Shots&quot;, &quot;Close to Love&quot;, and &quot;Girl Overboard&quot; are all electropop numbers reminiscent of 1980s music. However, &quot;Control of the Knife&quot; is more inspired by reggae and ska, while &quot;Black Jacks&quot; recalls &quot;sixties psychedelica&quot;. &quot;Out of Control&quot; features a number of songs inspired by 1980s electropop, while also exploring retro styles. &quot;The Promise&quot; is a 1960s Spector-influenced number, while &quot;Rolling Back the Rivers in Time&quot; was compared to the works of Burt Bacharach.

===Legacy===
Girls Aloud&#x27;s debut single &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; and Sugababes&#x27; &quot;Round Round&quot;, both of which were produced by Xenomania, have been called &quot;two huge groundbreaking hits&quot;. Emily MacKay of &quot;NME&quot; deemed the two &quot;a whole new kind of pop&quot;. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; placed the song at number 15 on a list of 100 songs that defined the 2000s, while &quot;NME&quot; included it at number 39. Spinner.com named &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; the eighth best British song of the 2000s. In 2009, &quot;The Times&quot; included 2007&#x27;s &quot;Tangled Up&quot; at number 62 on a list of the decade&#x27;s best pop albums. MSN listed 2005&#x27;s &quot;Chemistry&quot; as one of the decade&#x27;s best albums. Girls Aloud were one of the pop acts to achieve continued success and longevity throughout the mid-2000s while R&amp;B and rock music became more popular. In a review for the group&#x27;s 2008 Tangled Up Tour, David Pollock of &quot;The Independent&quot; noted that &quot;Girls Aloud remain confidently the only pop show in town.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; stated, &quot;Not since ABBA and Michael Jackson has pure pop been so unanimously praised.&quot;

Girls Aloud are notably one of the few British reality television acts to achieve continued success and longevity. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Girls Aloud are the highest-earning UK reality television stars, having amassed a fortune of £25 million by May 2009. The figure was increased to £30 million the following year, following Cheryl&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The X Factor&quot;. All five members were included in a 2010 list of Britain&#x27;s richest stars under 30. Reviews of Girls Aloud&#x27;s debut album noted the high quality of the album compared to output from other reality show contestants. In 2004, David Hooper of BBC Music exclaimed that &quot;Girls Aloud are currently British pop royalty [...] in the ultra-fickle world of TV-generated pop, Girls Aloud have real staying power.&quot; Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie said, &quot;Girls Aloud really shouldn&#x27;t have made it as far as a second album. [...] There&#x27;s just one problem – the girls have a knack of coming up with utterly infectious pop songs&quot;.

Bono has referred to himself as a fan of the group, saying: &quot;I think Girls Aloud are at the cutting edge of pop music. They are a great band and they deserve to be centre stage.&quot; Chris Martin also said that he is a fan of the group, referring to them as &quot;the ultimate form of life,&quot; while Julie Burchill has stated that Girls Aloud are &quot;simply the most perfect pop group since The Monkees.&quot; In addition, Girls Aloud have had their music covered by artists as varied as Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party, and Coldplay, among others.

<text>Horbury is a town in the City of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is situated north of the River Calder about three miles (5 km) south west of Wakefield and two miles (3 km) to the south of Ossett. It includes the outlying areas of Horbury Bridge and Horbury Junction. At the 2001 census the Horbury and South Ossett ward of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council had a population of 10,002. At the 2011 census the population was 15,032. Old industries include woollens, engineering and building wagons for the railways. Horbury forms part of the Heavy Woollen District.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name Horbury is attested in 1086 as &quot;(H)orberie&quot;. It is derived from Old English &quot;horu&quot; &#x27;dirty land&#x27; and &quot;burh&quot; (in its dative form &quot;byrig&quot;), which translates as &#x27;filthy fortification&#x27; or &#x27;stronghold on muddy land&#x27;. Other spellings include Orberie, Horbiry and Horberie. The name possibly referred to a fortification near an old fording point of the River Calder.

===Manor===
The settlement predates the Domesday Book of 1086 in which Horbury and Crigglestone, on the south side of the River Calder, were the only parts of the Manor of Wakefield not described as &quot;waste&quot;. The survey recorded about 40 people and four ox-drawn ploughs in &#x27;Orberie&#x27; and &#x27;Crigeston&#x27; combined. About of land were in cultivation and much woodland. Horbury had a church dating from about 1106 which was a daughter church of the church in Wakefield and possibly replaced an earlier Saxon church. The Norman church had a tower, nave and chancel.

The Manor of Wakefield was given by the crown to the Earls Warenne in 1106 and was held by them until 1359.
Sir Robert de Horbiry and Sir John de Horbiry were stewards to the Earl de Warenne, who granted Sir John the village of Horbury and its lands for life. After the death of Sir John de Horbury in 1306, it became one of the constituent &#x27;graveships&#x27; of the Manor of Wakefield.

The oldest surviving house in the town is Horbury Hall in Church Street, built by Ralph Amyas, deputy steward of the Manor of Wakefield. It has been dated by dendrochronology to 1474. Other old buildings include the tithe barn. The land in Horbury was divided into three great fields, Northfield, Southfield and Westfield, and remains of medieval ridge and furrow of strip cultivation are visible in Carr Lodge Park.

===Horbury Bridge===

A wooden bridge spanned the River Calder on the road from Wakefield to Huddersfield in the 15th century. Money for its upkeep was left in local wills dated 1404 and 1492, a custom that continued into the 16th century. A stone-arched bridge that replaced the wooden structure in the 17th century lasted until it partly collapsed in 1918. A new bridge was completed in 1930 and was repaired in 1991 at a cost of £2 million. Horbury Bridge was flooded after heavy rain in 1946.

===Industrial history===

Wool spinning and cloth manufacture were important originally as cottage industries. At the start of the Industrial Revolution steam engines were installed at Race&#x27;s Mill in Dudfleet and Foster&#x27;s Mill on Engine Lane in 1795. Resistance to the implementation of new textile machinery and the factory system was shown when Luddites, who blamed the new factories for depriving weavers from earning a living in a time of widespread hunger and poverty, destroyed Fosters Mill.

Albion Mills and Millfield Mills were built in the 1870s. William Sykes&#x27;s sports goods works which became part of Slazengers was established at about this time. Slazenger had four factories which produced sports equipment. Since the factories closed the name is preserved in Slazengers Sports and Social Club, which has facilities and floodlit grounds for many different sporting activities.

Charles Roberts (1831–1892) who described himself as a joiner, moved the Buffer and Wagon Works he had established on Ings Road, Wakefield to a site at Horbury Junction in 1873. Between 1901 and 1956 the company built 110,000 railway wagons of varying types and by 1945 Charles Roberts and Co.&#x27;s works covered 45 acres including the adjacent site of the Horbury Junction Iron Company which it had taken over in 1923. During the First World War the firm was among the first to employ women who were employed to forge shell covers. During the Second World War, the wagon works was used for armament manufacture, and made 1,300 Churchill tanks, half a million naval shells and one and a half million trench mortar bombs. The Horbury Junction Iron Company site was used to build tram bodies for Blackpool and Sheffield trams.

The works later became owned by Procor and then Bombardier Inc. The last vehicles constructed at the site were Bombardier Voyager trains, the plant closed in 2005; the engineering company Eddison &amp; Wanless now occupies the site.

In 1905, Richard Sutcliffe (1849–1930), who had worked as part-time manager at Hartley Bank Colliery across the valley in Netherton, opened his Universal Works on the site of the old dye house mill on the Horbury-Wakefield boundary in 1905 and started to manufacture conveyor belts and mining machinery. In 1972 the company employed 742 people at its Horbury site.

==Governance==

Historically Horbury was a chapelry in the parish of Wakefield, in the lower division of the Wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley and part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Following the implementation of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Horbury became one of the 17 constituent parishes of the Wakefield Poor Law Union formed in 1837. Horbury Town Hall was commissioned by the Urban District Council; its foundation stone was laid by Joshua Harrop on 30 July 1902 and it was built by Henry Fallas &amp; Sons of Horbury.

==Geography==
Horbury encompasses the neighbourhoods of Horbury Bridge, named after the crossing of the River Calder and Horbury Junction, named after the railway junction. It covers an area of . The River Calder flows generally west to east in a wide valley across the south of the town alongside the Calder and Hebble Navigation which made the river navigable to Sowerby Bridge. The town centre is on a hill on the north side of the River Calder and most of the land slopes towards the river. The A642 Wakefield to Huddersfield road bypasses the town to the south of the town centre with a branch road to Horbury Junction. The B6128 goes through the town centre and connects with Ossett to the north. The M1 motorway passes to the east of the town with the nearest access at J40 A638 in Ossett.

==Demography==
In 2008 Horbury had a largely white population compared with Yorkshire and the Humber.
===Population change===
The population of Horbury in 2001 was 10,002

==Transport==
A network of local buses, coordinated by West Yorkshire Metro connects Horbury with Wakefield, Dewsbury, Ossett, and Huddersfield. The M1 motorway to the east of the town is accessed at junctions 39 at Durkar and 40 at Ossett.

Proposals were made for a railway through Horbury in the 1830s and an Act of Parliament was passed for the Manchester and Leeds Railway engineered by George Stephenson in 1836. Horbury has had three stations, Horbury &amp; Ossett at Horbury Bridge of 1840, Horbury Junction on Green Lane of 1853 and Millfield Road at Horbury Junction opened in 1927. All are closed.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio West Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, and Rhubarb Radio, a community based station. The town is served the local newspaper, &quot;Wakefield Express&quot; and &quot;The Horbury Ossett Community News&quot; which is a free local weekly paper printed and distributed throughout the town and Ossett. 

==Education==
Horbury Town School on Tithe Barn Street was enlarged in 1789 but it is not known when it was built. By 1870 there were 113 pupils paying fees of 3d to 6d weekly. It closed in 1886. The &quot;Gaskell School&quot; was built on New Road in 1842 by Daniel Gaskell of Lupset Hall. It was used until 1887. St Peter&#x27;s Church of England School was founded in 1849 close to the church. It was replaced by the present school in the early 1980s. In September 2010 St Peter&#x27;s Junior School amalgamated with Clifton Infant School to form a new primary school. A new building is proposed to be built on the current St Peter&#x27;s site with a completion date of September 2012.

Horbury Council School catering for all age groups on Northfield Lane was opened in 1913 becoming Horbury County Secondary Modern in 1952. The infant school remained on the site and the junior school moved to the Wesleyan School at Horbury Junction. In 1962 secondary pupils moved to a new school. The Northfield Lane school became Horbury County Junior School and Horbury County Infant School. After a fire in 2000 and a £1m upgrade the schools amalgamated, becoming Horbury Primary School in 2002.

Horbury Academy (formerly Horbury School) caters for pupils aged 11 to 16 in a new building completed in 2009 on the same site as the old one.

==Religion==

Horbury had a chapel of ease to the Church of All Saints in Wakefield, from before the time of the Domesday Book. The chapel was replaced by a Norman chapel with a nave and tower that stood until it was replaced by the present church in 1790. St Peter and St Leonard&#x27;s Church, the parish church, was designed by John Carr, the Horbury-born architect who built it in the Georgian neo-classical style between 1790 and 1794 at a cost to himself of £8,000. He is buried in a vault beneath the north aisle.
The foundation of St John&#x27;s Church at Horbury Bridge was in a mission meeting in a room in what is now the hairdressers in 1864. Funds were raised and the church was built with stone from Horbury Quarry in 1884. The curate, Sabine Baring-Gould, wrote the hymn &quot;Onward Christian Soldiers&quot; in 1865 for the Whitsun procession to Horbury Church. Another mission was set up at Horbury Junction in 1887 and St Mary&#x27;s Church was built in 1893.

A Methodist society was established in Horbury in about 1746, meeting for worship in a private house in Cluntergate. In 1765 the congregation built a chapel seating perhaps 200, also in Cluntergate, adjacent to the house which later became the Working Men&#x27;s Club. In 1824 a branch of Methodism called the New Connexion erected a chapel in Northgate; the Society was short-lived but the building survives to this day - as a private house. The Primitive Methodists built their first chapel in Horbury in 1841 in High Street, and four years later the Wesleyans built a chapel on the adjoining plot to replace the one in Cluntergate. The Free Methodists built a small chapel in Queen Street in 1857 which served them until 1900, when they built a larger one at the bottom of Bank Street which was bought by Nettleton&#x27;s in 1958.

The Primitive Methodists built a larger chapel in 1875 on the site of their 1841 building, and the Wesleyans similarly replaced their 1845 chapel in 1884. The Wesleyans had established a mission in Horbury Junction in 1878 and built a chapel there in 1887.

In 1958, many years after Methodist Union, the congregations of the former Wesleyan and Primitive churches amalgamated using the 1884 Wesleyan building for worship and the Primitive&#x27;s Sunday school for other activities. The congregation of the Horbury Junction chapel joined them in 1969.

In 2012 the 1884 building, having been found to be unsafe, was demolished and a new church was constructed further back from the High Street and connected to the old Sunday School. The new building was formally opened on 10 September 2016.

The Salvation Army corps&#x27; former headquarters on Peel Street is now disused, the congregation moving to the Leeds Road, Gawthorpe, Ossett premises. The former Tithe Barn Christian Centre, Westfield Road, is now similarly disused.

==Public services==
Horbury Library on Westfield Road was built in 1905 with a donation from the Carnegie foundation. It celebrated its centenary in 2005 with the making of a community tapestry, which now hangs in the library.
Horbury is policed by the West Yorkshire Police force from Ossett Police Station and is within the DA, Wakefield division, which covers the whole district. The statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service from Wakefield Fire Station. Hospital services are provided by the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust. Pinderfields Hospital is the nearest hospital with an Accident and Emergency department. Community health services, including GPs, district and community nurses, dentists and pharmacists, are co-ordinated by Wakefield District Primary Care Trust. Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority. Horbury&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is CE Electric via Yorkshire Electricity. Yorkshire Water manages Wakefield&#x27;s drinking and waste water with a Waste Water Treatment Works for the Horbury area on Dudfleet Lane.

==Notable people==
Architect John Carr was born in Horbury in 1723. His nephew bought Sunroyd House in 1789 and renamed it &quot;Carr Lodge&quot;. Horbury Bridge is known as the home of &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot;, the hymn written by Sabine Baring-Gould, when he was curate of the Horbury Bridge church. Stan Barstow, author of &quot;Joby&quot; and &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot;, was born in Horbury. In his autobiography, he said that Ossett and Horbury were the &quot;border country&quot; where the north-west of the coalfield merges with the south-east of the wool towns. William Baines, born in 1899, was a pianist and prolific composer who died in 1922 of tuberculosis; he composed two hundred works, the majority for solo piano.

Two children from Horbury, Christianne and Robert Shepherd, died of carbon monoxide poisoning while on holiday in Corfu in October 2006. Their deaths resulted in changes to health and safety policies in the travel industry. A memorial garden was opened at Horbury Primary School, which they both attended.

<doc id="594394" wikidata="Q892368" url="?curid=594394" title="Second-rate">
<text>In the rating system of the Royal Navy used to categorise sailing warships, a second-rate was a ship of the line which by the start of the 18th century mounted 90 to 98 guns on three gun decks; earlier 17th-century second rates had fewer guns and were originally two-deckers or had only partially armed third gun decks. A &quot;second rate&quot; was the second largest class of warships in a hierarchical system of six &quot;ratings&quot; based on size and firepower.

They were essentially smaller and hence cheaper versions of the three-decker first rates. Like the first rates, they fought in the line of battle, but unlike the first rates, which were considered too valuable to risk in distant stations, the second rates often served also in major overseas stations as flagships. They had a reputation for poor handling and slow sailing. They were popular as flagships of admirals commanding the Windward and/or Leeward Islands station, which was usually a Rear-admiral of the red.

==Rating==
Typically measuring around 2000 tons burthen and carrying a crew of 750, the second-rates by the second half of the 18th century carried 32-pounder guns on the gun deck, with 18-pounders instead of 24-pounders on the middle deck, and 12-pounders on the upper deck (rather than 18- or 24-pounders on first rates), although there were exceptions to this. Both first and second rates carried lighter guns (and, after 1780, carronades) on their forecastles and quarterdecks.

===Three-decker v two-decker===
The three-decker second-rate was mainly a British type, and was not built by other European navies to any great degree. As speed is mainly determined by length along the waterline, the three-deck second-rate was a slow sailer compared to both its two-deck equivalent and the first-rate ships. Being the same height as a first-rate but shorter meant they handled poorly and had a tendency to sail to leeward; was described by one of her lieutenants as sailing &quot;like a haystack&quot;. Their poor sailing abilities prompted Nelson, at Trafalgar, to order &quot;Prince&quot; and to approach the enemy at a lesser angle than the remainder of the column, in the hope that having more sail area exposed to the wind would enable these two ships to keep up. A near disastrous example of the three-decker&#x27;s maladroitness occurred on 25 December 1796 when, on sighting the enemy, the Channel Fleet attempted a hurried departure from Spithead: Four second-rates collided with one another while another ran aground.

Apart from its unhandiness, in terms of sheer firepower it was matched or even out-gunned by many of the large 80-gun and 74-gun two-deckers used by the French and Spanish navies. The additional height did, however, give the second rate an advantage in close combat with the further advantage of it being able to withstand punishment like a larger ship, but being much cheaper to build and maintain. It was sometimes mistaken by the enemy for a first-rate, which could possibly make enemy commanders reluctant to press an attack.

After the Napoleonic wars, new second rates in the Royal Navy mounted their guns (typically 90 or 91) on two decks once more, leaving the first rates as the only ships with three complete gun decks.

==Term==
The term &quot;second-rate&quot; has since passed into general usage as an adjective used to mean of suboptimal quality, inferior to something that is &quot;first-rate&quot;.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-22 (Air Standardization Coordinating Committee name: Blinder) was the first supersonic bomber to enter production in the Soviet Union. Manufactured by Tupolev, the Tu-22 entered service with Long-Range Aviation and Soviet Naval Aviation in the 1960s.

The aircraft was a disappointment, lacking both the speed and range that had been expected. It was also a difficult design to fly and maintain. It was produced in small numbers, especially compared to the Tupolev Tu-16 it was designed to replace. The aircraft was later adapted for other roles, notably as the Tu-22R reconnaissance aircraft and as a carrier for the long-range Kh-22 antiship missile.

Tu-22s were sold to other nations, including Libya and Iraq: Libyan Tu-22s were used against Tanzania and Chad, and Iraqi Tu-22s were used during the Iran–Iraq War.

==Development==
===Previous efforts===
Andrei Tupolev&#x27;s OKB-156 had successfully converted the Boeing B-29 Superfortress into the Tupolev Tu-4, while their suggestions to create a more advanced design were ignored as they fell from favour. In 1951, Stalin created OKB-23 under the direction of Vladimir Mikhailovich Myasishchev to build new long-range bomber designs, forming the bureaus by picking designers out of Tupolev&#x27;s OKB-156. OKB-23 began development of the four-engined Myasishchev M-4 intercontinental jet bomber.

To keep themselves in the bomber field, OKB-156 designed their own entry for a jet-powered bomber, the twin-engined Tupolev Tu-16 medium bomber. They were aware that the range of the design would not be enough to fill the intercontinental role of the M-4, and for this mission, they also proposed the four-turboprop Tupolev Tu-95. Ultimately neither the M-4 nor Tu-16 met their range requirements, leaving only the Tu-95 really able to carry out attacks against the US, with more limited performance. The M-4 was built only in small numbers, while the Tu-16 had much more widespread uses in a variety of roles.

===Supersonic replacements===
All of these aircraft were still being introduced when the State Committee for Aviation Technology (soon to become the Ministry of Aircraft Production, or MAP) announced a contest for supersonic designs that would replace all previous designs. Tupolev&#x27;s chief designer, Sergey Mikhailovitch Yeger, was determined not to lose to Myasishchev once again.

They quickly proposed a new design, Samolyot 103 (Plane 103). This was essentially a Tu-16 with four much more powerful engines, either Dobrynin VD-7s or Mikulin AM-13s. However, experience on the experimental Samolyot 98 tactical bomber design suggested that the 103 would not have supersonic performance. They decided to start over with a blank-sheet design.

After considering many possible solutions from TsAGI, Yeger eventually settled on what became Samolyot 105 in 1954. Among its features was the selection of a single pilot with no copilot, which allowed the cockpit to be narrower, as only one person had to be seated forward to see the runway. This had positive political aspects as it reduced crew size to three.

Myasishchev was also working to fulfill the requirement with his much larger Myasishchev M-50. It was designed to have intercontinental range, filling the role for which the M-4 was intended. Both the Tupolev and Myasishchev designs were approved for prototype production in 1954.

At the time, supersonic aerodynamics were still in their infancy, as were the engines that would power the designs. By this point, three engine models were being considered for the 105: the VD-5, the VD-7, and the new Kuznetsov NK-6. Of the three, the NK-6 offered the best performance, but was still in the initial stages of development. As the engines possibly would not meet their goals and leave the 105 underpowered, much attention was spent on cleaning up the aerodynamics to reach the required speed. This was notable in the design of the wing and landing gear, which were designed to be as &quot;clean&quot; as possible, with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage to allow the wing to be thinner.

Around the same time, LII wind tunnel experiments revealed a tendency for aircraft to pitch up around Mach 1. This led to the decision to move the engines from the wing roots, as in the Tu-16, to an unconventional external tail-mounted position, on either side of the vertical stabilizer. This location also reduced drag and inlet losses.

The wings were highly swept, between 52 and 55° to give little drag at transonic speeds, which led to poor take-off performance and high landing speeds.

===Prototypes===
The first prototype 105 was completed and shipped to the Flight Test and Development Base at Zhukovsky in August 1957. It flew for the first time on 21 June 1958, flown by test pilot Yuri Alasheev. Initial flights quickly demonstrated that the design had neither the speed nor range that was expected. Around this time, TsAGI read KGB intelligence reports about the area rule for minimizing transonic aerodynamic drag, and this design was applied to 105. A key problem was that the wing root was too thick to properly exploit this effect and to further thin it, a new landing-gear design was introduced, along with several more changes to the layout of the cabin and tail areas.

The result of all of these changes was the 105A, which first flew on 7 September 1959. Serial production of 20 examples was issued around this time, even before testing had completed. The first serial-production Tu-22B bomber, built by Factory No. 22 at Kazan, flew on 22 September 1960, and the type was presented to the public in the Tushino Aviation Day parade on 9 July 1961, with a flypast of 10 aircraft. It initially received the NATO reporting name &#x27;Bullshot&#x27;, which was deemed to be inappropriate, then &#x27;Beauty&#x27;, which was deemed to be too complimentary, and finally &#x27;Blinder&#x27;. Soviet crews called it &quot;shilo&quot; (awl) because of its shape.

===Into service===
The Tu-22 entered service in 1962, but it experienced a considerable number of problems, resulting in widespread unserviceability and several crashes. Amongst its many faults was a tendency for aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin at supersonic speed, distorting the control rods and causing poor handling. The landing speed was greater than of the previous bombers and the Tu-22 had a tendency to pitch up and strike its tail on landing – though this problem was eventually resolved with the addition of electronic stabilization aids. Even after some of its problems had been resolved, the Blinder was not easy to fly, and was maintenance-intensive. Among its unpleasant characteristics was a wing design that allowed aileron reversal at high speeds. When the stick had been neutralized following such an event, the deformation of the wing did not necessarily disappear, but could persist and result in an almost uncontrollable aircraft.

Pilots for the first Tu-22 squadrons were selected from the ranks of &quot;First Class&quot; Tu-16 pilots, which made transition into the new aircraft difficult, as the Tu-16 had a co-pilot, and many of the &quot;elite&quot; Tu-16 pilots selected had become accustomed to allowing their co-pilots to handle all the flight operations of the Tu-16 except for take-offs and landings. As a consequence, Tu-16 pilots transitioning to the single-pilot Tu-22 suddenly found themselves having to perform all the piloting tasks, and in a much more complicated cockpit environment. Many, if not most, of these pilots were unable to complete their training for this reason. Eventually, pilots were selected from the ranks of the Su-17 &quot;Fitter&quot; crews, and these pilots made the transition with less difficulty.

===Variants===

By the time the Tu-22B (Blinder-A) entered service, its operational usefulness had been found to be limited. Despite its speed, it was inferior to the Tu-16 with respect to combat radius, weapon load, and serviceability. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev believed that ballistic missiles were the way of the future, and bombers like the Tu-22 were in danger of cancellation. As a result, only 15 (some sources say 20) Tu-22Bs were built.

While the Tu-22 was being introduced, the Strategic Rocket Forces branch was created in 1959, and Tupolev, along with other project backers, understood that manned bombers were falling out of favor as a means of delivering nuclear weapons. To save the program, Tupolev proposed a long-range aerial reconnaissance version of the aircraft, which could be modified in the field to return it to a bombing role.

The resulting combat-capable Tu-22R (Blinder-C) entered service in 1962. The Tu-22R could be fitted with an aerial refueling probe that was subsequently fitted to most Tu-22s, expanding their radius of operation; 127 Tu-22Rs were built, 62 of which went to the Soviet Naval Aviation (AVMF) for maritime patrol use. Some of these aircraft were stripped of their cameras and sensor packs and sold for export as Tu-22Bs, although in other respects, they apparently remained more comparable to the Tu-22R than to the early-production Tu-22Bs.

A trainer version of the Blinder, the Tu-22U (Blinder-D), was fielded at the same time; it had a raised second cockpit for an instructor pilot. The Tu-22U had no tail guns, and was not combat-capable; 46 were produced.

To deploy the brand new Kh-22 (AS-4 Kitchen) anti-ship missile, a new aircraft had to be used, as the Tu-95 was too slow, and the Tu-16 could not carry it, thanks to its weight. Because of this, the Tu-22 was developed as a missile carrier, the Tu-22K (Blinder-B). It first entered service in December 1968,with 76 built between 1965 and 1969. The Tu-22K had the ability to carry a single Kh-22 in a modified weapons bay. It was deployed both by Long Range Aviation and AVMF.

The last Tu-22 subtype was the Tu-22P (Blinder-E) electronic warfare version, initially used for electronic intelligence gathering. Some were converted to serve as stand-off electronic countermeasure jammers to support Tu-22K missile carriers. One squadron was usually allocated to each Tu-22 regiment.

The Tu-22 was upgraded in service with more powerful engines, in-flight refueling (for those aircraft that did not initially have it), and better electronics. The -D suffix (for &quot;Dalni&quot;, long-range) denotes aircraft fitted for aerial refueling.

Tu-22s were exported to Iraq and Libya during the 1970s. An Egyptian request was refused as a result of Soviet objections to the Yom Kippur War.

==Design==
The Tu-22 has a low-middle mounted wing swept at an angle of 55°. The two large turbojet engines, originally Dobrynin VD-7M, later Kolesov RD-7M2, are mounted atop the rear fuselage on each side of the large vertical stabilizer, with a low-mounted tailplane. Continuing a Tupolev OKB design feature, the main landing gear are mounted in pods at the trailing edge of each wing. The highly swept wings gave little drag at transonic speeds, but resulted in very high landing speeds and a long take-off run. This limited the design to &quot;first-class airfields&quot;, those with runways at least long.

The Tu-22&#x27;s cockpit placed the pilot forward, offset slightly to the left, with the weapons officer behind and the navigator below, within the fuselage, sitting on downwards-firing ejector seats. The downward direction meant the minimum altitude for ejection was , which precluded their use during take-off and landing, when most accidents occur. The crew entered the plane by lowering the seats on rails and then climbing external stepladders, sitting in the seats, and then being cranked upward into the cockpit.

The cockpit layout was also criticized by the pilots; it was filled with levers and handles that gained it comparisons to a hedgehog, and some of those controls could not be reached by the pilots, who took to flying with metal hooks and other &quot;ad hoc&quot; devices. Adding to its problems was a very high panel on the right, which blocked the view of the runway during landing if the aircraft had to crab against a wind from the left. This led to it being forbidden for flight by new pilots in crosswind conditions above fresh breeze on the Beaufort scale.

Air for the crew was provided by a bleed air system on the engine compressors. This air was hot and had to be cooled before being pumped into the cockpit. This cooling was provided by a large total-loss evaporator running on a mixture of 40% ethanol and 60% distilled water (effectively vodka). This system garnered the aircraft one of its many nicknames, the &quot;supersonic booze carrier&quot;. As the system vented the coolant after use, the aircraft could run out during flight, and comfort had to be balanced by the possibility of running out of coolant. Numerous cases of Tu-22 crews drinking the coolant mixture and becoming paralytically drunk led to a crackdown by Soviet Air Force authorities. Access to the bombers after flights was restricted, and more frequent checks were made on coolant levels. This higher level of security, however, did not end the practice.

The Tu-22&#x27;s defensive armament, operated by the weapons officer, consisted of a remotely controlled tail turret beneath the engine pods, containing a single R-23 gun. The turret was directed by a small PRS-3A Argon gun-laying radar due to the weapons officer&#x27;s total lack of rear visibility (and generally much more accurate and precise fire control than optical aiming). The bomber&#x27;s main weapon load was carried in a fuselage bomb bay between the wings, capable of carrying a variety of free-fall weapons – up to 24 FAB-500 general-purpose bombs, one FAB-9000 bomb, or various nuclear bombs. On the Tu-22K, the bay was reconfigured to carry one Raduga Kh-22 (AS-4 Kitchen) missile semirecessed beneath the fuselage. The enormous weapon was big enough to have a substantial effect on handling and performance, and was also a safety hazard.

The early Tu-22B had an optical bombing system (which was retained by the Tu-22R), with a Rubin-1A navigation/attack radar. The Tu-22K had the Leninets PN (NATO reporting name &#x27;Down Beat&#x27;) to guide the Kh-22 missile. The Tu-22R could carry a camera array or an APP-22 jammer pack in the bomb bay as an alternative to bombs. Some Tu-22Rs were fitted with the Kub ELINT system, and later with an under-fuselage pallet for M-202 Shompol side-looking airborne radar, as well as cameras and an infrared line scanner. A few Tu-22Ks were modified to Tu-22KP or Tu-22KPD configuration with Kurs-N SIGINT equipment to detect enemy radar systems and provide compatibility with the Kh-22P antiradiation missile.

==Operational history==

===Libya===

The Libyan Arab Republic Air Force used the Tu-22 in combat against Tanzania in 1979 as part of the Uganda–Tanzania War to help its Ugandan allies, with a single Tu-22 flying a completely unsuccessful bombing mission against Mwanza on 29 March 1979.

The Libyan aircraft were also used against Chad as part of the Chadian–Libyan conflict, with strikes into western Sudan and Chad. Libyan Tu-22s flew their first mission over Chad on 9 October 1980 against Hissène Habré&#x27;s forces near the Chadian capital of N&#x27;Djamena. Occasional bombing raids by small numbers of Tu-22s against targets in Chad and Sudan, including a raid on Omdurman in September 1981, which killed three civilians and injured 20 others, continued to be performed until a ceasefire was arranged in November 1981.

Fighting restarted in July 1983, with Libyan air power, including its Tu-22s, being used in attacks against forces loyal to Habré, before a further ceasefire stopped the fighting until Libyan-assisted forces began a fresh offensive in early 1986. On 17 February 1986, in retaliation for the French Operation Épervier (which had hit the runway of the Libyan Ouadi Doum Airbase one day earlier), a single Tu-22B attacked the airfield at N&#x27;Djamena. Staying under French radar coverage by flying low over the desert for more than , it accelerated to over Mach 1, climbed to and dropped three heavy bombs. Despite the considerable speed and height, the attack was extremely precise; two bombs hit the runway, one demolished the taxiway, and the airfield remained closed for several hours as a consequence. The bomber ran into technical problems on its return journey. U.S. early warning reconnaissance planes based in Sudan monitored distress calls sent by the pilot of the Tu-22 that probably crashed before reaching its base at Aouzou (maybe hit by antiaircraft guns that fired in N&#x27;Djamena airport). On 19 February, another LARAF Tu-22 attempted to bomb N&#x27;Djamena once again. Libyan sources have claimed that this attempt was spoiled when the Tu-22 was detected while approaching N&#x27;Djamena, and two Mirage F1s were scrambled to intercept it. However, French officers present in Chad don&#x27;t recall any contact with Libyan aircraft on that day. One bomber was shot down by captured 2K12 Kub (SA-6) surface-to-air missiles during a bombing attack on an abandoned Libyan base at Aouzou on 8 August 1987. One eyewitness report suggests that the pilot ejected, but his parachute was seen on fire.

Another Blinder was lost on the morning of 7 September 1987, when two Tu-22Bs conducted a strike against N&#x27;Djamena. A French battery of MIM-23 Hawk SAMs of the 402nd Air Defence Regiment shot down one of the bombers, killing the East German crew. This raid was the last involvement of the Tupolev Tu-22 with the Chadian–Libyan conflict.

The last flight of a Libyan Blinder was recorded on 7 September 1992. They are probably now unserviceable because of a lack of spare parts, although seven are visible at the Al Jufra Air Base at . They were reportedly replaced by Su-24s.

===Iraq===

Iraq used its Tu-22s in the Iran–Iraq War from 1980 to 1988. Offensive operations started on the first day of the war, when a Tu-22 based at H-3 Air Base struck an Iranian fuel depot at Mehrabad International Airport, Tehran, which in conjunction with other Iraqi attacks resulted in a shortage of aviation fuel for the Iranians in the early period of the war. Otherwise, these early attacks were relatively ineffective, with many raids being aborted owing to Iranian air defences and operations being disrupted by heavy Iranian air strikes against Iraqi airfields. Iran claimed three Tu-22s shot down during October 1980, one on 6 October over Tehran, and two on 29 October, one near Najafabad by an AIM-54 Phoenix missile launched by an F-14 interceptor and one over Qom.

Iraq deployed its Tu-22s during the War of the Cities (along with Tu-16s, Su-22s and MiG-25s), flying air-raids against Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz, with these attacks supplemented by Iraqi Scud and Al Hussein missiles. Iran retaliated against Iraqi cities with its own Scuds. The Iraqi Air Force were particularly enthusiastic users of the gargantuan FAB-9000 general-purpose bomb, which skilled Tu-22 pilots could deploy with impressive accuracy, using supersonic toss bombing techniques at stand-off distances and allowing the aircraft to escape retaliatory anti-aircraft fire. Usage of the FAB-9000 was so heavy that the Iraqis ran low of imported Soviet stocks and resorted to manufacturing their own version, called the Nassir-9.

Iraqi Tu-22s were also deployed in the last stages of the &quot;Tanker War&quot;. On 19 March 1988, four Tu-22s together with six Mirage F.1s carried out a raid against Iranian oil tankers near Kharg Island. The Tu-22s sank one supertanker and set another on fire, while Exocet missiles from the Mirages damaged another tanker. A second strike against Kharg Island later that day was less successful, encountering alerted Iranian defences, with two Tu-22s being shot down. These were the final operations carried out by Iraq&#x27;s Tu-22s during the Iran–Iraq war. Iraq lost seven Tu-22s during the war, with several more badly damaged. The remaining Iraqi Tu-22s were destroyed by American air attacks during the 1991 Gulf War.

===Soviet Union===
The only Soviet combat use of the Tu-22 occurred in 1988, during the Soviet withdrawal from the war in Afghanistan. Tu-22P Blinder-E electronic jammers were given the task of covering the withdrawal route back to the Soviet Union. Radar-jamming Tu-22PD aircraft covered Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers operating from the Mary-2 airfield in the Turkmen SSR on missions in Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. They protected the strike aircraft against Pakistani F-16 air defence activity and suppressed radar systems, which could aid Pakistani F-16 attacks on the Soviet bombers in the border region. Tu-22PD crews were also tasked with photoreconnaissance missions, to assess bomb damage, in addition to their primary electronic warfare missions.

The Tu-22 was gradually phased out of Soviet service in favor of the more-capable Tupolev Tu-22M. At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 154 remained in service, but none are now believed to be used.

==Variants==

In total, 311 Tu-22s of all variants were produced, the last in 1969. Production numbers were: 15 of bomber version (B), about 127 of reconnaissance versions (R, RD, RK, RDK and RDM), 47 of ELINT versions (P and PD), 76 of missile carriers (K, KD, KP and KPD) and 46 of training versions (U and UD).

<text>August and Everything After is the debut studio album by American rock band Counting Crows, released September 14, 1993, on Geffen Records. The album was produced by T Bone Burnett and featured the founding members of the band: Steve Bowman (drums), David Bryson (guitar), Adam Duritz (vocals), Charlie Gillingham (keyboards), and Matt Malley (bass). Among the several session musicians used for the album was multi-instrumentalist David Immerglück, who later joined the band as a full-time member in 1999, as well as Burnett, who also provided additional guitar work.

Four singles were released from the album, the highest charting of which was &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;, which peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; US Radio Songs Chart and number 2 on several genre-specific &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The album itself was well received by critics and has gone multi-platinum in several countries, including the U.S. where it has sold over seven million copies, and peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

The album cover depicts handwritten lyrics to a song called &quot;August and Everything After&quot;, but the band decided against featuring the song on the album; it was not until over a decade later that it was played as part of one of their live concerts. The song &quot;August and Everything After&quot; was released on January 24, 2019, as an Amazon Original.

On September 18, 2007, a two-disc deluxe edition of the album was issued. The first disc contains the original album, remastered by Adam Ayan at Gateway Mastering, with six demos added as bonus tracks. The second disc is taken from the band&#x27;s penultimate performance during the &quot;August&quot; tour, recorded at Élysée Montmartre in Paris, France, on December 9, 1994.

The album &quot;August &amp; Everything After: Live at Town Hall&quot; was released on August 29, 2011, featuring live recordings of the songs from this album. More than 6 million copies of the album have been sold by February 2002 in the US.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;Enlisting accordions, mandolin, pedal steel, and harmonica to flavor the usual rock instrumentation, the Crows play transliterated Celtic-rock not unlike the Hooters&#x27;. Such music seems to require a sense of self importance, and the quintet is not lacking&quot;.

<text>Gundelia or tumble thistle is a low to high (20–100 cm) thistle-like perennial herbaceous plant with latex, spiny compound inflorescences, reminiscent of teasles and eryngos, that contain cream, yellow, greenish, pink, purple or redish-purple disk florets. It is assigned to the family Asteraceae. Flowers can be found from February to May. The stems of this plant dry-out when the seeds are ripe and break free from the underground root, and are then blown away like a tumbleweed, thus spreading the seeds effectively over large areas with little standing vegetation. This plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle-East. Opinions differ about the number of species in &quot;Gundelia&quot;. Sometimes the genus is regarded monotypic, Gundelia tournefortii being a species with a large variability, but other authors distinguish up to nine species, differing in floret color and pubescence. Young stems are cooked and eaten in the Middle-East and are said to taste like a combination of artichoke and asparagus.

== Description ==
&quot;Gundelia tournefortii&quot; is a spiny hemicryptophyte with stems 20–100 cm tall that branch from the base. The first growth of the plant consists of a rosette of leaves. All parts contain a milky latex. The parts above the surface break from the root and may be blown away by the wind as a tumbleweed, assisting in the dispersion of the seed. All counts executed so far arrive at eighteen chromosomes (2n=18).

=== Root, stems and leaves ===
The plant develops a woody, vertical rootstock of up to 4 cm in diameter, at the surface usually covered by the remains of old leaves. The leaves are sessile or decurrent at their base with spiny wings, and alternate set along the stems. The lowest leaves are usually 7–30 cm long and 4–16 cm wide, pinnately dissected and the sections of the larger leaves may be pinnately parted themselves, and have a dentate or serrate margin, all tipped with spines. The midvein and sideveins are prominent, whitish, sometimes tinged purple. The leaf surface may be covered in spiderweb-like hairs, that tend to wither away quickly.

=== Inflorescence ===
The stem divides into ten or more branches, each of which is topped by a compound spiny ovoid inflorescence of 4–8 cm in diameter, which may be covered in dense arachnoid hairs. This inflorescence is unusual for members of the family Asteraceae, as each true flowerhead is so far reduced as to only contain one floret, which is surrounded by its own involucre. Five to seven of these monofloral flowerheads combine into secondary flowerheads, each subtended by a spiny bract hardly or substantially longer than the secondary flowerheads, with only the centre floret developing a cypsela, and the surrounding ones only producing pollen. These secondary flowerheads later break free from the globose assembly of flowerheads that sit on the end of each branch of the stem during the tumbleweed-stage. Remarkable for a member of the tribe Cichorieae are also the disk florets, a trait that is further only present in &quot;Warionia saharae&quot;.

The pentameric corollas are usually 7–10  mm long, gloomy purple or yellowish outside, white to bright yellow, greenish, flesh colored or silvery to red purple inside, with spreading narrow lobes of 3–4 mm mm  long  and about 1 mm wide, the tube hairless inside. The five merged anthers form a cylinder of 4–6  mm long, yellow or brownish in color. The style arms are also brownish.

Pollen is covered in acute spines.

=== Fruit and seed ===

The involucral bracts of the secondary flowerheads are merged into a brown, durable, hard cup with a fibery fringe. Each contains only one cypsela of about 8 mm long, 5 mm at its widest, somewhat dorsally compressed, narrow at its base and widest beyond halflength, with the pappus at its tip consisting of a 2 mm high cup, narrowest at its base.

=== Characters common to all Asteraceae ===

Like in all Asteraceae, the pentameric flowers have anthers that are fused together forming a tube through which the style grows. The style picks up the pollen on hairs along its length and splits into two style branches at its tip. These parts sit on an inferior ovary that grows into an indehiscent fruit in which only one seed develops (a so-called cypsela). All florets (in this case only one) are set on a common base (the receptacle), and are surrounded by several rows of bracts, that form an involucre. A particular character of &quot;Gudelia&quot; that is rare among the Asteraceae is that florets are gender specialised, with the central floret being functionally hermaphrodite and the marginal florets being functionally male.

=== Characters common to Cichorieae ===

Tumble thistles are assigned to the Cichorieae-tribe that shares anastomosing latex canals in both root, stem and leaves, and has flower heads only consisting of one type of floret. In &quot;Warionia&quot; and &quot;Gundelia&quot; these are exclusively disk florets, while all other Cichorieae only have ligulate florets. &quot;Gundelia&quot; is unique in the complex morphology of the inflorescences.

=== Differences with other genera ===

&quot;Warionia&quot; and &quot;Gundelia&quot; share a thistle-like appearance, anastomosing latex-ducts, floral heads that only contain disk florets, spurred anthers, and styles with branches and highest part of the scape covered with long hairs. &quot;Gundelia&quot; however is herbaceous, has monofloral primary flowerheads combined into groups of five to seven, the centre floret hermaphrodite, the marginal florets functionally male, and those groups combined in ovoid spiny florescences at the end of the stem, and spiny leaves, florets dull yellow to dull purple on the inside, purple to rusty on the outside. Warionia is a shrub, has many dandelion-yellow florets in each flowerhead, single or with two or three together at the end of the branches, the leaves dentate but not spiny.

&quot;Scolymus&quot; is also a thistle-like herbaceaceous perennial with anastomosing latex-ducts, related to &quot;Gundelia&quot;, but it has many yellow, orange or white ligulate florets in each flowerhead, which are arranged with many in a spike-like inflorescence, or with a few at the end of the stems.

=== Phytochemistry ===

&quot;Gundelia&quot; contains several essential oils, with large proportions (20–25% each) of thymol and .

== Taxonomy ==

=== Taxonomic history ===

As far as known, the tumble thistle was first collected during an expedition by Leonhard Rauwolf (1573–1575), and this specimen can now be found in the National Herbarium in Leiden, the Netherlands. Tournefort, Von Gundelsheimer and Claude Aubriet also collected this plant while traveling through Greece, Turkey, former Armenia and Persia (1700–1702). Since Von Gundelsheimer was the first to have sighted the plant, his companions began to call it &quot;Gundelia&quot;. Tournefort already observed the remarkable morphology of the compounded flowerheads. Carl Linnaeus in 1753 adopted and published this name, providing the correct name. Henri Cassini in 1821 suggested to assign this species to the tribe Vernonieae. In 1828 he specified this assignment to the Vernonieae-Rolandreae, a group formalized by Christian Friedrich Lessing as subtribe Rolandrinae in 1831. Following a change in the interpretation of the complex inflorescence, Cassini rejected the interpretation by Linnaeus, and erected the genus &quot;Gundelsheimera&quot;, which is illegitimate as it is based on the same type specimen. Next, George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1873 placed the species in the tribe Arctotideae, subtribe Gundelieae (corrected name Gundelinae). Pierre Edmond Boissier in 1875 thought this taxon sufficiently divergent to erect the tribe Gundelieae. Karl August Otto Hoffmann misspelled the genus name as &quot;Grundelia&quot;, while remarking that &quot;Gundelsheimera&quot; is a synonym. Other authors hesitantly considered a position for &quot;Gundelia&quot; in the Cardueae sensu lato. It recently has also been combined with &quot;Warionia&quot; in the tribe Gundelieae by C. Jeffrey.

=== Number of species ===

The earliest descriptions of &quot;Gundelia&quot; recognise that the corollas could be cream, flesh coloured or purplish. Linnaeus regarded the genus as monospecific, but distinguished plants with purple corollas as variety &quot;β&quot;. Bornmüller in 1939 distinguished a forma &quot;purpurascens&quot;. Other infraspecific taxa differ only in leaf characters. Many modern authors recognise only &quot;Gundelia tournefortii&quot; with a wide variation in corolla color, or both &quot;G. tournefortii&quot; and a much more uniform &quot;G. aragatsi&quot; with brown red corollas and very downy inflorescences. Other species distinguished by some authors are &quot;G. armeniaca&quot; , &quot;G. dersim&quot; , &quot;G. glabra&quot; and &quot;G. munzuriensis&quot; , &quot;G. rosea&quot; , &quot;G. tenuisecta&quot; and &quot;Gundelia vitekii&quot; .

=== Modern classification ===

Debate on the number of subtaxa remains and some authors think there is only one species, &quot;Gundelia tournefortii&quot;. Others also recognise &quot;G. aragatsi&quot;, a form only known from Armenia, that has brown red corollas and very felty inflorescences. Some even distinguish up to nine different taxa. &quot;Gundelia&quot; is now assigned to the Cichorieae-tribe, as the basal member of the Scolyminae-subtribe.

=== Phylogeny ===

According to recent genetic analyses, the genus &quot;Gundelia&quot; is related to the genera &quot;Hymenonema&quot;, &quot;Scolymus&quot; and &quot;Catananche&quot;. This results in the following relationship tree.
=== Etymology ===

Pedanius Dioscorides called this plant silybum. The genus &quot;Gundelia&quot; is named to honor Andreas von Gundelsheimer (1668–1715), a German botanist, while the species name &quot; tournefortii&quot; was named after Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, a French botanist, who together undertook a botanical journey to the Levant, during which the species was collected, described and illustrated.

== Distribution ==

&quot;Gundelia tournefortii&quot; is mostly found in the Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey and in the province of Muş. In autumn, the dried yellow layers of the plant cover all the mountains, so much so that the degree that can be seen even from space. The tumble thistle can be found in Cyprus, Turkey (Anatolia), Armenia, Azerbaijan, Northern Iraq, northern Iran, Afghanistan, western Syria, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. It has been introduced in Algeria.

== Ecology ==

&quot;Gundelia&quot; grows on limestone, igneous rock or reddish soils, in steppe, open oak or pine woodland, or between coppices, as weed in barley- or cornfields, fallowed or deserted fields, and in roadsides. It can be found at altitudes up to 2500 m. It is pollinated by insects such as honey bees and pollen feeding beetles, such as the Garden Chafer.

== Cultivation ==

Seeds germinate slowly and may take several years. Seedlings can be planted outside but required light, well-drained soil, and protection against frost. Growth is slow during the first year. Plants can be grown in the rock garden, or on raised beds. &quot;Gundelia&quot; is probably hardy to about −15 °C when the drainage is good. Plants have been grown intermittently at the École de Botanique and in what is currently known as the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, since the 18th century.

== Uses ==

=== Food ===

Early in the year, &quot;Gundelia&quot; plants growing in the wild are cut at the base and the thorns are removed. Leaves, stems, roots, and particularly the undeveloped flowerheads can be eaten. The base of the young leaves which is still under the surface is used by Bedouin and Arabs to make akkub soup. In the West Bank, young flowerheads, stems and leaves are collected between March and May, and are then fried in olive oil, mixed with a stew of meat chops until well done, and served mixed with yogurt. &quot;Gundelia&quot; is said to taste like something between asparagus and artichoke. Another dish is to put a trimmed inflorescence in a meatball, fry these in olive oil and then simmer them in a sauce containing lemon juice. In the mountainous area in south Kurdistan (Iraqi Kurdistan), &quot;Gundelia&quot; is still being used as a vegetable, but in Palestine where it is numbered among the few, wild edible plants, collecting for the market resulted in a decline in the plant population and collecting is restricted to personal use by the Israeli occupation.

A chewing gum can be made from the latex, a fact that is already mentioned by Tournefort in 1718, and is called &quot;kenger sakızı&quot; in Turkish. The fruits as well as roots can be roasted and ground to be used as substitute coffee, and is known as &quot;kenger kahvesi&quot;. In recent times, mature seeds have been used to extract oil. Remains of charred inflorescences of &quot;Gundelia&quot; from the neolithic found in Turkey and Iraq indicate that oil was pressed from the seeds as long as at least 10,000  years ago.
The seeds are edible (called سِسّي &quot;Sissi&quot; in Iraq); dried, salted and roasted are sold in nut shops, they taste similar to sun flower seeds.

The cypselas contain almost 7% oleic acid and 12½% linoleic acid, making the oil comparable to soybean, corn, sunflower and sesame oils. Commercial use would be dependent on plant breeding to improve crop yield, suitability for harvesting and for food processing, such as selection of spineless plants.

=== Traditional uses ===

Traditionally, &quot;Gundelia&quot; is used to treat a wide variety of ailments such as liver diseases, diabetes, chest pain, heart attacks, pain in the chest and the stomach, leukoderma, diarrhea and bronchitis.

=== Fodder ===

Fully grown foliage is used to feed livestock in spite of the spines, both fresh (in Syria and Palestine) and dry (in Kurdistan and Iran).

== Culture ==

Some Bible scholars think that the tumbleweed that is spoken of in Psalm 83, verse 14 &quot;Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like galgal before the wind&quot; is &quot;Gundelia&quot;. Akkub, the biblical name for this species, is already mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud.

<text>Leftover Salmon is an American jam band from Boulder, Colorado, formed in 1989. The band&#x27;s music is a blend of bluegrass, rock, country, and Cajun/Zydeco (Polyethnic Slamgrass). Over their thirty years as a band, Salmon has released seven studio albums and three live albums. The band celebrated their continuing thirty-year career with the release of the biographical book, &quot;Leftover Salmon: Thirty Years of Festival!&quot; and a vinyl box-set re-release of all of their studio albums.

==History==
The band formed in 1989 when members of the Salmon Heads (Vince Herman, Dave Dorian, and Gerry Cavagnaro) combined with members of the Left Hand String Band (Drew Emmitt and Glenn Keefe) to play a New Year&#x27;s Eve show in 1989 at the Eldo in Crested Butte, Colorado. Herman had previously played with Emmitt in the Left Hand String Band and had called on his former bandmates Emmitt and Keefe to fill in for some missing members of the Salmon Heads for the New Year&#x27;s Eve show. They chose the name Leftover Salmon on the drive to the show.

The synergy worked and the result was Leftover Salmon. The lineup changed significantly over the years, but the &quot;Big Three&quot; – Drew Emmitt, Vince Herman, and Mark Vann — remained the heart of the band until Vann&#x27;s death in 2002.

After the independent release of &quot;Bridges to Bert&quot; in 1993 and the 1995 live follow-up &quot;Ask the Fish&quot;, Leftover Salmon gained a spot on the H.O.R.D.E. festival tour and a contract with Hollywood Records. Their Hollywood debut and second studio album, &quot;Euphoria&quot; with guest keyboardist Pete Sears, continued to define their eclectic sound and introduced many songs that became their most notable. They released four albums with the Disney Music Group-owned label. In 1999, Nashville Sessions was released, with guests Waylon Jennings, Jerry Douglas, Lucinda Williams, John Bell, Del McCoury, Ronnie McCoury, Béla Fleck, Sam Bush, John Cowan, Todd Park Mohr, Earl Scruggs, Randy Scruggs, Jeff Hanna, Sally Van Meter, Jeff Coffin, Jo-El Sonnier, Taj Mahal, Danny Boone and Reese Wynans. In 2000, Bill McKay, formerly of The Derek Trucks Band, joined the band on keyboards and vocals and the band recorded several of his songs. He remained with the band until late 2011.

In March 2002, founding member and banjoist Mark Vann died from cancer. He was succeeded by Matt Flinner and then Noam Pikelny.

In 2003, the band teamed up with David Lowery and Johnny Hickman of Cracker (and formerly Camper Van Beethoven) to release the critically acclaimed 10-song album, &quot;O&#x27; Cracker Where Art Thou?&quot; (Pitch a Tent), 2003, which was a compilation of ten of Cracker&#x27;s best songs done Leftover Salmon style. 

In 2004, the band announced they were going on hiatus at the end of that year.

An award-nominated documentary film of Leftover Salmon, titled &quot;Years in Your Ears&quot;, was released on DVD in November 2006. 

Leftover Salmon reunited in 2007 and played six performances, including the High Sierra Music Festival in Quincy, California, the All Good Festival in West Virginia, as well as Denver and Boulder, Colorado shows in late December. Leftover Salmon marked their unofficial return to the stage with a performance at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival on Sunday, June 24, 2007, as &quot;Drew Emmitt and Vince Herman and Friends.&quot; They were introduced by Jeff Austin of Yonder Mountain String Band with the line, &quot;We know what it might say in the program, but I think we all really know what&#x27;s going on here.&quot;

Despite their various successful side projects, Leftover Salmon played seven times during the summer of 2008 and 2009. For a special New Years run, the band celebrated 20 years as a band by returning to the site of their first show in Crested Butte, Colorado: The Eldo. The band played four shows through Denver and Boulder during this run while celebrating their 20th anniversary. Since moving Andy Thorn into the banjo role, the band has been touring more than usual with small runs throughout the country.

On May 22, 2012, the band released their first album since their hiatus. The album was called &quot;Aquatic Hitchhiker&quot;. An extensive promotional tour followed including the Summer Camp Music Festival and the Telluride Bluegrass Festival.

Starting on June 19, 2012, the band is the featured &quot;house band&quot; at the Whales Tail Bar in Breckenridge, Colorado, on the &quot;After the Catch&quot; episodes of &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;.

In 2015, they released the studio album &quot;High Country&quot; and the following year released a compilation double album of live performances with the title &quot;25&quot;. They released their next studio album, &quot;Something Higher&quot;, in 2018.

As the band neared their 30th anniversary they were profiled in the book &quot;Leftover Salmon: Thirty Years of Festival!&quot; by author Tim Newby. The book chronicled the band&#x27;s long influential history and their role in the development of the jam band and jamgrass scenes. In 2019, keyboardist Erik Deutsch left the group to join The Chicks.

<text>In software distribution and software development, a README file contains information about the other files in a directory or archive of computer software. A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, or codice_5 (to indicate the use of Markdown)

The file&#x27;s name is generally written in uppercase. On Unix-like systems in particular, this causes it to stand outboth because lowercase filenames are more common, and because the codice_6 command commonly sorts and displays files in ASCII-code order, in which uppercase filenames will appear first.

==Contents==
A README file typically encompasses:

* Configuration instructions
* Installation instructions
* Operating instructions
* A file manifest (a list of files in the directory or archive)
* Copyright and licensing information
* Contact information for the distributor or author
* A list of known bugs
* Troubleshooting instructions
* Credits and acknowledgments
* A changelog (usually aimed at fellow programmers)
* A news section (usually aimed at end users)

== History ==
The convention of including a README file began in the mid-1970s. Early Macintosh system software installed a Read Me on the Startup Disk, and README files commonly accompanied third-party software.

In particular, there is a long history of free software and open-source software including a README file; the GNU Coding Standards encourage including one to provide &quot;a general overview of the package&quot;.

Since the advent of the web as a &quot;de facto&quot; standard platform for software distribution, many software packages have moved (or occasionally, copied) some of the above ancillary files and pieces of information to a website or wiki, sometimes including the README itself, or sometimes leaving behind only a brief README file without all of the information required by a new user of the software. 

The popular source code hosting website GitHub strongly encourages the creation of a README fileif one exists in the main (top-level) directory of a repository, it is automatically presented on the repository&#x27;s front page. In addition to plain text, various other formats and file extensions are also supported, and HTML conversion takes extensions into accountin particular a codice_5 is treated as GitHub Flavored Markdown.

==As a generic term==
The expression &quot;readme file&quot; is also sometimes used generically, for other files with a similar purpose. For example, the source-code distributions of many free software packages (especially those following the Gnits Standards or those produced with GNU Autotools) include a standard set of readme files:

Also commonly distributed with software packages are an FAQ file and a codice_8 file, which lists planned improvements.

<doc id="594419" wikidata="Q3566398" url="?curid=594419" title="Warren Kinsella">
<text>Warren James Kinsella (born August 1960) is a Canadian lawyer, author, musician, political consultant, and commentator. Kinsella has written commentary in most of Canada&#x27;s major newspapers and several magazines, including &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, the &quot;National Post,&quot; &quot;The Walrus&quot;, and Postmedia newspapers. He appeared regularly on the Sun News Network. Kinsella is the founder of the Daisy Consulting Group, a Toronto-based firm that engages in paid political campaign strategy work, lobbying and communications crisis management.

==Early life and education==
Kinsella is the son of physician and medical ethicist Douglas Kinsella, founder of the National Council on Ethics in Human Research (NCEHR). He attended Carleton University from 1980 to 1984, earning a Bachelor of Journalism.

==Career==
In the 1980s, Kinsella was a reporter at the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; and later the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;.

Later, as a lawyer, Kinsella was a partner in the law firm McMillan Binch. He left the legal firm in 2002 and co-founded the consulting firm, Navigator. In 2006, he left to found his own agency, Daisy Consulting Group, a Toronto-based firm that engages in paid political advertising, lobbying and communications crisis management.

=== Politics ===

==== Federal politics ====

===== Liberal Party =====
Kinsella served as a media adviser to opposition leader Jean Chrétien&#x27;s office and as a strategist in the Canadian federal Liberal Party&#x27;s 1993 election campaign &quot;task force&quot;. After the Liberals won the election, Kinsella became chief of staff to federal Public Works minister David Dingwall. Lawrence Martin noted in his book &quot;Iron Man&quot; that Kinsella was accused by Peter Donolo, Chrétien&#x27;s communications director, of being overtly aggressive and seeing enemies everywhere. In addition, Martin noted that many Liberal MPs expressed concern about Kinsella&#x27;s behaviour. However, Kinsella was a favourite of Aline Chrétien, the Prime Minister&#x27;s wife, which meant that the complaints were ignored.

Kinsella ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1997 federal election in the riding of North Vancouver but was defeated by Reform incumbent Ted White.

During his last stint as a national campaign headquarters worker during the 2000 Canadian federal election, he appeared on CTV&#x27;s Canada AM brandishing a purple Barney dinosaur doll to mock what he claimed were Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day&#x27;s creationist beliefs. Public affairs consultant Robin Sears in &quot;Policy Options&quot; used this incident to compare him to American political consultant James Carville and argued that &quot;The Carvillites and their young fans were less concerned with the substance of politics or its impact on citizens&#x27; building contempt for politics than with their personal scores.&quot;

After the 2000 federal election, Kinsella was a vocal supporter of Chrétien during the intra-party struggle that resulted in Chrétien being replaced by Paul Martin. In &quot;Iron Man&quot;, Lawrence Martin noted that Kinsella saw Paul Martin and his followers &quot;as almost much an enemy&quot; as the opposition parties, and favored working against the Martin faction. He would work on Liberal leadership campaigns for Allan Rock and Sheila Copps in opposition to Martin. He later admitted to quitting the Liberal Party when then-cabinet minister Herb Dhaliwal had his Vancouver South-Burnaby riding association taken over by the Martin forces in November 2002.

Starting in November 2008, Kinsella worked briefly for Liberal leadership candidate Michael Ignatieff. One long-time senior Liberal questioned the hiring of Kinsella, calling him a &quot;human shrapnel machine.&quot; Later that month Kinsella apologized for a post in his video blog that jokingly mentioned that his regular Chinese restaurant sold &quot;cat meat.&quot; Kinsella resigned from Ignatieff&#x27;s campaign in May 2009, citing treatment of fired colleagues.

Kinsella publicly considered seeking the Liberal nomination for the 2015 federal election in Toronto—Danforth, but ultimately demurred in the belief that he would not be approved as a nominee. He argued that Justin Trudeau&#x27;s inner circle had played a role in the ouster of Jean Chretien as Prime Minister. He has been a critic of Trudeau&#x27;s leadership. During the 2019 election, Kinsella sent tweets accusing the Prime Minister of buying drinks for Faith Goldy, making false accusations of a suppressed Globe &amp; Mail story, and linking to a fake website that advocated Chrystia Freeland as leader of the Liberal Party. After the election, Kinsella praised Trudeau by stating that since the election there had been &quot;no stunts, no selfies, no over-saturation&quot;.

===== Gomery inquiry =====
During the Gomery Commission&#x27;s inquiry into the Sponsorship scandal, Justice John Gomery was told that Kinsella, while chief of staff to Minister of Public Works David Dingwall, wrote a letter to the department&#x27;s Deputy Minister, Ran Quail in 1994 requesting Chuck Guité be appointed to review the government&#x27;s advertising and communications strategy. Quail said he viewed the letter as political interference into civil service affairs, while Dingwall and Kinsella characterized the letter as a request rather than a directive. No finding of any fault was found in Gomery&#x27;s report relating to Kinsella&#x27;s conduct.

===== Green Party =====
Kinsella worked for the Canadian Green Party during July 2019 in the run-up to the 2019 Canadian federal election. This work was a temporary arrangement and involved &quot;Kinsella setting up a quick-response unit for the Greens.&quot;

===== Conservative Party of Canada =====
In October 2019, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; reported that Kinsella&#x27;s consulting firm, Daisy Group, had, according to an anonymous source, been hired by the Conservative Party of Canada to create a campaign attempting to discredit Maxime Bernier and the People&#x27;s Party of Canada. Neither the Conservative Party nor Kinsella would confirm or deny that they had been working together. Bernier filed a complaint to the Commissioner of Canada Elections. On October 19 2019, Kinsella deactivated his Twitter and Facebook accounts and posted a statement on his website that he is &quot;pulling back from (social) media.&quot; On October 22, Kinsella called on the Commissioner of Canada Elections to investigate the role that his own firm played.

On 29 October 2019 Kinsella said on his podcast that he would not reveal the who hired his company, maintaining that it was protected by solicitor-client privilege but stated the campaign should have been disclosed earlier. On November 2, Kory Teneycke cited Andrew Scheer&#x27;s handling of the Kinsella story as one reason for questioning Scheer&#x27;s future as the leader of the Conservative Party. While, CBC revealed, on November 26, 2019, a recording describing Kinsella&#x27;s contempt of Bernier and identified that Conservative campaign manager Hamish Marshall and co-chair, John Walsh knew about the campaign and were watching. Kinsella is heard telling the staff that they need to &quot;draw blood&quot;. After filing a $1 million lawsuit, Kinsella later settled out of court with the source; who was a former Daisy Employee, Aziza Mohammed. On December 8 the Globe and Mail reported that it was a lack of clarity &quot;what other activities were part of the project&quot; and that &quot;The Conservative Party will eventually have to report all of its spending and third-party contracts to Elections Canada&quot;. While, Kinsella and his firm did not break the Elections Canada Act (which only governs spending), CBC News suggested that story might not end.

In February 2020, Bernier launched a lawsuit against Kinsella alleging defamation by branding Bernier a racist, in relation to the 2019 election. The lawsuit sought an admission of defamation and $325,000 in damages. In November 2021, the court dismissed the lawsuit, based on Ontario&#x27;s Anti-SLAPP legislation, determining that it was not proven that the defamation concerns outweighed the importance of protecting free speech. Bernier was ordered in February 2022 to pay $132,000 in legal costs to Kinsella.

===== North Vancouver Electoral Result =====





=== Provincial politics ===
==== Ontario Liberals ====
Kinsella was a long time supporter of Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty, and was a fixture in Ontario Liberal Party election campaigns while McGuinty was leader. The Hill Times stated that Kinsella was the individual that branded Ontario Progressive Conservatives Leader John Tory&#x27;s promise to publicly fund faith-based schools during the 2007 election &quot;into a Canadian version of Nixon&#x27;s racist Southern strategy&quot;. He would apologize for a blog post during the campaign suggesting that Progressive Conservative MPP Lisa MacLeod would rather bake cookies than be seen with farm activist Randy Hillier; MacLeod would later use the remark as the humorous title for a cookbook.

Kinsella supported Sandra Pupatello in the 2013 Liberal Party of Ontario leadership convention that chose a successor to McGuinty. The leadership was won by Kathleen Wynne. Kinsella was sharply critical of Wynne&#x27;s campaign during the 2014 Ontario election, and subsequently.

==== Ontario Progressive Conservatives ====
On October 31, 2019, &quot;the Globe and Mail&quot; reported that a spokesperson for Autistics for Autistics (A4A), an Ontario Autism advocacy group, threatened litigation against Kinsella after warning Kinsella&#x27;s Daisy firm over a suspected connection between free media training provided by his firm and the Ontario government led by premier Doug Ford. Kinsella stated that his work was unrelated with strategic advice and media training provided to Minister of Children, Community and Social Services Lisa MacLeod and her political staff in March 2018 over the restrictions to the provincial autism program. While House leader Paul Calandra, who was asked by reporters if he would release the contract, stated that Daisy&#x27; firm services was for social assistance not autism

==== Municipal politics ====
Kinsella advised John Tory in the 2003 Toronto mayoral election.

In 2014 mayoral election, Kinsella assisted Olivia Chow&#x27;s campaign. On August 20, 2014, Kinsella tweeted &quot;Is John Tory&#x27;s SmartTrack, you know, Segregationist Track?&quot;, and posted a photo featuring Tory and an edited speech bubble stating that Jane/Finch and Rexdale were intentionally excluded from the plan. Kinsella apologized for the incident. Daisy Consulting later announced that they had fired Chow as a client due to remarks regarding Kinsella. After a Twitter showdown between Tory&#x27;s strategist Nick Kouvalis; Kinsella sued Kouvalis for $100,000 libel suit over tweets that Kinsella alleges were slanderous. Kouvalis was later reported by the Toronto Star as the person responsible for bring Kinsella as an advisor to John Tory during the 2018 Toronto mayoral election.

On November 16, 2018 the OPP charged Mark Grimes along with outgoing city councillor Justin Di Ciano for allegedly filing false campaign expenses for the 2014 municipal elections, contrary to the Municipal Elections Act. In order to fight the allegations, then-councillor Di Ciano and Grimes hired the firm of strategist Kinsella to compile a &quot;research&quot; dossier on him and political foes such as CBC News. A few months later, Grimes faced litigation by Kinsella for allegedly failing to pay invoices for services rendered by Kinsella&#x27;s Daisy Group.

==== Writing ====
In 1997, Kinsella published the novel &quot;Party Favours&quot;, a thinly veiled &quot;roman à clef&quot; about the Chrétien government similar to the 1996 American novel &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. The novel was initially credited to &quot;Jean Doe&quot;, with Kinsella only later revealing himself as the real author.

Macleans associated &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; with dirty politics because &quot;His political books are thick with tales of dirty tricks and nasty business in Ottawa&#x27;s corridors of power, and he is an admitted and most gleeful practitioner of both.&quot;

Kinsella runs a blog that is famous in Canadian political circles for Kinsella&#x27;s on-and-off feuds with other bloggers, including one with columnist Ezra Levant that prompted Kinsella to initiate a defamation suit claiming $5,000,000 in damages.

In March 2019, Kinsella started as a &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; columnist. After, it was revealed Kinsella&#x27;s consulting firm worked with the Conservative Party. Canadaland reported that &quot;Sun&quot; management did not respond to questions about whether they were aware of Kinsella doing paid work on behalf of the Conservatives, but a spokesperson for parent company Postmedia stated in an email that &quot;Postmedia is unaware of any financial arrangement that Warren Kinsella might have had with a political party while writing a column for the Toronto Sun. If we had been aware of such an arrangement, we would have disclosed that relationship, as is our standard practice.&quot;

<doc id="594422" wikidata="Q1508611" url="?curid=594422" title="Moulin Rouge (1952 film)">
<text>Moulin Rouge is a 1952 British historical romantic drama film directed by John Huston from a screenplay he co-wrote with Anthony Veiller, based on the 1950 novel of the same name by Pierre La Mure, and produced by John and James Woolf. The film follows artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec as he navigates the bohemian subculture of 19th-century Paris, centered around the Moulin Rouge, a burlesque venue. It was screened at the 14th Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Lion.

The film stars José Ferrer, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Suzanne Flon, Eric Pohlmann, Colette Marchand, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Katherine Kath, Theodore Bikel, and Muriel Smith.

==Plot==
In 1890 Paris, crowds gather at the Moulin Rouge as artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec finishes a bottle of cognac while sketching the dancers. Regular patrons arrive: singer Jane Avril teases Henri, dancers La Goulue and Aicha argue, and owner Maurice Joyant offers Henri free drinks for a promotional poster. After closing, Henri reveals his 4-foot-6-inch (137 cm) stature. A flashback shows that, as a child, he injured his legs in a fall, which never healed due to a genetic disorder from his parents being first cousins.

On his way home to Montmartre, Henri helps streetwalker Marie Charlet escape the police. Impressed by her lack of judgment about his disability, Henri allows her to stay with him. He soon realizes poverty has made her both harsh and free from societal hypocrisy. After a night out, she insults a portrait he painted of her, and he throws her out, sinking into alcoholism. His landlady contacts his mother, who urges him to find Marie to lift his spirits. Henri finds her drunk in a café, where she admits she stayed with him only to save money for her boyfriend, who has now left her. Depressed, Henri returns home and contemplates suicide but finds sudden inspiration to complete the Moulin Rouge poster. Surviving his crisis, he arranges for Marie to receive money for a new life.

Henri delivers the poster to Maurice, who accepts it despite its unconventional style. His success grows, but one of his risqué portraits leads his father to denounce his work. Henri continues depicting Parisian nightlife, gaining fame but few friends. One day, he meets a young woman, Myriamme, on the Pont Alexandre III, seemingly about to jump into the Seine. She assures him she is not suicidal and throws a key into the river. Later, while shopping with Jane Avril, Henri recognizes Myriamme modeling gowns. A friend of Jane&#x27;s, she lives independently. Henri is surprised when Myriamme reveals she bought his portrait of Marie at a flea market. The key Myriamme discarded belonged to a suitor, Marcel de la Voisier, who wanted her as a lover but refused to marry her. Though cynical about love, Henri begins to fall in love with her.

One evening, Henri and Myriamme encounter La Goulue, now a washed-up, drunken figure, and Henri realizes the Moulin Rouge has become respectable. Myriamme informs Henri that Marcel has proposed. Henri bitterly congratulates her. When she asks if he loves her, Henri lies and says he does not, believing she is toying with his feelings. The next day, Henri receives a letter from Myriamme, confessing her love and that his bitterness has ruined their chance at happiness. He rushes to her apartment, but she has already left.

A year later, Henri, now an alcoholic, is found drunk in a dive bar, still obsessed with Myriamme&#x27;s letter. Taken home, he suffers from delirium tremens and hallucinates cockroaches. While trying to fend them off, he falls down the stairs. Taken to his family&#x27;s chateau, his condition worsens. On his deathbed, Henri&#x27;s father informs him he will be the first living artist to be exhibited in the Louvre and begs for forgiveness. In his final moments, Henri envisions figures from his Moulin Rouge paintings dancing around his room.

==Cast==
==Production==
In the film, José Ferrer portrays both Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and his father, the Comte Alphonse de Toulouse-Lautrec. To transform Ferrer into Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, various techniques were employed, including the use of platforms, concealed pits, special camera angles, makeup, and costumes. Short body doubles were also utilized. Ferrer designed and used a set of knee pads that allowed him to walk on his knees, simulating Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s distinctly shorter stature. Ferrer received significant praise not only for his performance but also for his willingness to have his legs strapped in this manner for the role.

It was reported that John Huston asked cinematographer Oswald Morris to render the color scheme of the film to look &quot;as if Toulouse-Lautrec had directed it&quot;. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was shot in three-strip Technicolor. The Technicolor projection print is created by dye transfer from three primary-color gelatin matrices. This permits great flexibility in controlling the density, contrast, and saturation of the print. Huston asked Technicolor for a subdued palette, rather than the sometimes-gaudy colors &quot;glorious Technicolor&quot; was famous for. Technicolor was reportedly reluctant to do this.

The film was shot at Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, Surrey, England, and on location in London and Paris.

The budget was £434,264 plus $160,000 to cover the fees of John Huston, José Ferrer and Zsa Zsa Gabor.

==Reception==
===Critical===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;This long and pretentious film is, like Pierre La Mure&#x27;s book, not an accurate biography of Lautrec, but an attempt to evoke the kind of man he was and to paint a vivid fresco of his period and background. ...The dialogue, with its attempts at smart and worldly wise aphorisms, the deadly even pace and unrelenting detachment add up only to two hours of innate boredom, relieved from time to time by some striking effects of colour. The sets, costumes and photography are, indeed, on a much higher level than the rest; there are moments when the surface achieves a fine visual approximation of Lautrec&#x27;s Paris, and as a result of which the vulgarity of the treatment appears all the more discordant. The acting is chiefly remarkable for a constant babel of foreign accents, among which the most extraordinary are Zsa Zsa Gabor&#x27;s high-pitched Viennese exclamations.&quot;

=== Box office ===
During its first year of release it earned £205,453 in UK cinemas and grossed $9 million at the North American box office.

According to the National Film Finance Corporation, the film made a comfortable profit.

Ferrer received 40 per cent of the proceeds from the film as well as other rights. This remuneration gave rise to a prominent U.S. Second Circuit tax case, &quot;Commissioner v. Ferrer&quot; (1962), in which Ferrer argued that he was taxed too much.

===Accolades===
The film was not nominated for its color cinematography, which many critics found remarkable. Leonard Maltin, in his annual Movie and Video Guide declared: &quot;If you can&#x27;t catch this in color, skip it.&quot;

In an interview shortly after his successful film version of &quot;Cabaret&quot; opened, Bob Fosse acknowledged John Huston&#x27;s filming of the can-can in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; as being very influential on his own film style.

The &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; theme song became well known and made it onto the record industry charts.

The film was nominated for inclusion on the American Film Institute list of 100 Greatest Film Scores, but was not included on the final list.

==Digital restoration==
The film was digitally restored by FotoKem for Blu-ray debut. Frame-by-frame digital restoration was done by Prasad Corporation removing dirt, tears, scratches and other defects. In April 2019, a restored version of the film from The Film Foundation, Park Circus, Romulus Films, and MGM was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.

<doc id="594432" wikidata="Q5419944" url="?curid=594432" title="Executive president">
<text>An executive president is the head of state who exercises authority over the governance of that state, and can be found in presidential, semi-presidential, and parliamentary systems.

They contrast with figurehead presidents, common in most parliamentary republics, in which the president serves symbolic, nonpolitical roles (and often is appointed to office by parliament) while the prime minister holds all relevant executive power. A small number of nations, like South Africa and Botswana, have both an executive presidency and a system of governance that is parliamentary, with the President elected by and dependent on the confidence of the legislature. In these states, the offices of president and prime minister (as both head of state and head of government respectively) might be said to be combined.

The above examples notwithstanding, executive presidencies are found in presidential systems and semi-presidential systems.

To prevent the abuse of power, checks and balances are implemented through the legislative and judiciary bodies. For example, in the United States one method is impeachment whereby the president can be held accountable if others deem their actions unconstitutional, with the most recent example being the impeachment trials of President Donald Trump.

== Elections ==
In parliamentary republics, presidents are most commonly chosen by the legislature. However, in those countries with both a prime minister and a president, methods differ. For example, in Czechia a majority vote from the public elects the president.

In full presidential systems and parliamentary systems with a constitutional presidency, the president is elected independently of the legislature. There are several methods in which to do this, including the plurality system and the two-round system. Whilst these methods use the popular vote, not all presidents are chosen in this way. For example, to be elected in the United States, a candidate must win a majority of the votes from the Electoral College, not the popular vote.

In the corporate environment, the head of a company is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), with the president being second in command. Leading the company&#x27;s executive group rather than the overall company, the executive president in this instance is responsible for day-to-day operations. In small businesses, the CEO and executive president are the same, whereas in larger companies the roles are carried out by two separate people.

==Plot==
When complications arise during her breast augmentation surgery, 20th-century exotic dancer Cleo (Jennifer Sky) is put into suspended animation. Waking 525 years in the future, Cleo joins two women in their fight against the Baileys, armed flying machines that now control Earth&#x27;s surface. Her team leader, Hel (Gina Torres), is commanded by a mysterious female entity called &quot;Voice&quot;, who relays orders via a communications implant under Hel&#x27;s right ear. Voice controls many other teams and gives them their orders in a similar fashion, in effect, forming a resistance to the Baileys, with their ultimate goal to retake the Earth&#x27;s surface. Their final team member is Sarge (Victoria Pratt), whose sister belongs to a cult that regards the Baileys with reverence and willingly sacrifices themselves to them.

Humanity has moved underground and built a complex of elaborate shafts and tunnels, created by the &quot;shaft builders&quot; to survive the Bailey menace. Cleo wows the 26th-century denizens with her philosophical sayings, many of which come from 20th-century popular culture.

<text>: &quot;Throughout this article, the term &quot;pound&quot; and the £ symbol refer to the Pound sterling.&quot;
Corporation tax in the United Kingdom is a corporate tax levied in on the profits made by UK-resident companies and on the profits of entities registered overseas with permanent establishments in the UK.

Until 1 April 1965, companies were taxed at the same income tax rates as individual taxpayers, with an additional profits tax levied on companies. Finance Act 1965 replaced this structure for companies and associations with a single corporate tax, which took its basic structure and rules from the income tax system. Since 1997, the UK&#x27;s Tax Law Rewrite Project has been modernising the UK&#x27;s tax legislation, starting with income tax, while the legislation imposing corporation tax has itself been amended, the rules governing income tax and corporation tax have thus diverged. Corporation tax was governed by the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (as amended) prior to the rewrite project.

Originally introduced as a classical tax system, in which companies were subject to tax on their profits and companies&#x27; shareholders were also liable to income tax on the dividends that they received, the first major amendment to corporation tax saw it move to a dividend imputation system in 1973, under which an individual receiving a dividend became entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid by the company paying the dividend. The classical system was reintroduced in 1999, with the abolition of advance corporation tax and of repayable dividend tax credits. Another change saw the single main rate of tax split into three. Tax competition between jurisdictions reduced the main corporate tax rate from 28% in 2008–2010 to a flat rate of 19% as of April 2021.

The UK government faced problems with its corporate tax structure, including European Court of Justice judgements that aspects of it are incompatible with EU treaties. Tax avoidance schemes marketed by the financial sector have also proven an irritant, and been countered by complicated anti-avoidance legislation.

The complexity of the corporation tax system is a recognised issue. The Labour government, supported by the Opposition parties, carried through wide-scale reform from the Tax Law Rewrite project, resulting in the Corporation Tax Act 2010. The tax has slowly been integrating generally accepted accounting practice, with the corporation tax system in various specific areas based directly on the accounting treatment.

Total net corporation tax receipts were a record high of £56 billion in 2016–17.

==History==

Until 1965, companies were subject to income tax on their profits at the same rates as was levied on individual taxpayers. A dividend imputation system existed, whereby the income tax paid by a company was offset against the income tax liability of a shareholder who received dividends from the company. The standard rate of income tax in 1949 was 50%. If the company paid a £100 dividend, the recipient would be treated as if he had earned £200 and had paid £100 in income tax on it – the tax paid by the company fully covered the tax due from the individual on the dividend paid. If, however, the individual was subject to tax at a higher rate (known as &quot;surtax&quot;), he (not the company) would be liable to pay the additional tax.

In addition to income tax, companies were also subject to a profits tax, which was deducted from company profits when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on dividends (profits distributed to shareholders) than on profits retained within the company. By penalising the distribution of profits, it was hoped companies would retain profits for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War. The tax did not have the desired effect, so the distributed profits tax was increased by 20% by the post-war Labour government to encourage companies to retain more of their profits. At the time of Hugh Gaitskell&#x27;s 1951 budget, the profits tax was 50% for distributed profits and 10% for undistributed profits.

A series of reductions in the profits tax were brought in from 1951 onwards by the new Conservative government. The tax rates fell to 22.5% on distributed profits and 2.5% on undistributed profits by 1957, but the profits tax was no longer income tax-deductible. Derick Heathcoat-Amory&#x27;s Budget of March 1958 replaced the differential profits tax with a single profits tax measure, applicable to both retained and distributed profits. This gradual decrease, and final abolition, of taxes on capital distributions reflected ideological differences between the Conservative and Labour parties: the Conservative approach was to distribute profits to capital holders for investment elsewhere, while Labour sought to force companies to retain profits for reinvestment in the company in the hope this would benefit the company&#x27;s workforce.

===Finance Act 1965===
Finance Act 1965 replaced the system of income tax and profits tax from 1 April 1965 with the Corporation Tax, which re-introduced aspects of the old system. Corporation Tax was charged at a uniform rate on all profits, but additional tax was then payable if profits were distributed as a dividend to shareholders. In effect, dividends suffered double taxation. This method of corporation tax is known as the classical system and is similar to that used in the United States. The effect of the tax was to revert to the distribution tax in operation from 1949 to 1959: dividend payments were subject to higher tax than profits retained within the company. Finance Act 1965 also introduced a capital gains tax, at a rate of 30%, charged on the gains arising on the disposal of capital assets by individuals. While companies were exempted from capital gains tax, they were liable to corporation tax on their &quot;chargeable gains&quot;, which were calculated in substantially the same way as capital gains for individuals. The tax applied to company shares as well as other assets. Before 1965, capital gains were not taxed, and it was advantageous for taxpayers to argue that a receipt was non-taxable &quot;capital&quot; rather than taxable &quot;revenue&quot;.

===Advance corporation tax===

The basic structure of the tax, where company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income, remained unchanged until 1973, when a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments. Unlike the previous imputation system, the tax credit to the shareholder was less than the corporation tax paid (corporation tax was higher than the standard rate of income tax, but the imputation, or set-off, was only of standard rate tax). When companies made distributions, they also paid the advance corporation tax (known as ACT), which could be set off against the main corporation tax charge, subject to certain limits (the full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed). Individuals and companies who received a dividend from a UK company received a tax credit representing the ACT paid. Individuals could set off the tax credit against their income tax liability.

On introduction, ACT was set at 30% of the gross dividend (the actual amount paid plus the tax credit). If a company made a £70 dividend payment to an individual, the company would pay £30 of advance corporation tax. The shareholder would receive the £70 cash payment, plus a tax credit of £30; thus, the individual would be deemed to have earned £100, and to have already paid tax of £30 on it. The ACT paid by the company would be deductible against its final &quot;mainstream&quot; corporation tax bill. To the extent that the individual&#x27;s tax on the dividend was less than the tax credit – for example, if his income was too low to pay tax (below £595 in 1973–1974) – he would be able to reclaim some or all of the £30 tax paid by the company. The set-off was only partial, since the company would pay 52% tax (small companies had lower rates, but still higher than the ACT rate), and thus the £70 received by the individual actually represented pre-tax profits of £145.83. Accordingly, only part of the double taxation was relieved.

ACT was not payable on dividends from one UK company to another (unless the payor company elected to pay it). Also, the recipient company was not taxed on that dividend receipt, except for dealers in shares and life assurance companies in respect of some of their profits. As the payor company would have suffered tax on the payments it made, the company that received the dividend also received a credit that it could use to reduce the amount of ACT it itself paid, or, in certain cases, apply to have the tax credit repaid to them.
The level of ACT was linked to the basic rate of income tax between 1973 and 1993. The March 1993 Budget of Norman Lamont cut the ACT rate and tax credit to 22.5% from April 1993, and 20% from April 1994. These changes were accompanied with a cut of income tax on dividends to 20%, while the basic rate of income tax remained at 25%. Persons liable for tax were lightly affected by the change, because income tax liability was still balanced by the tax credit received, although higher rate tax payers paid an additional 25% tax on the amount of the dividend actually received (net), as against 20% before the change. The change had bigger effects on pensions and non-taxpayers. A pension fund receiving a £1.2 m dividend income prior to the change would have been able to reclaim £400,000 in tax, giving a total income of £1.6 m. After the change, only £300,000 was reclaimable, reducing income to £1.5 m, a fall of 6.25%.

Gordon Brown&#x27;s summer Budget of 1997 ended the ability of pension funds and other tax-exempt companies to reclaim tax credits with immediate effect, and for individuals from April 1999. This tax change has been blamed for the poor state of British pension provision, while usually ignoring the more significant effect of the dot-com crash of 2000 onwards when the FTSE-100 lost half its value to fall from 6930 at the beginning of 2000 to just 3490 by March 2003. Despite this, critics such as Member of Parliament Frank Field described it as a &quot;hammer blow&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; described it as a swindle, with the hypothetical £1.5 m income described above falling to £1.2 m, a fall in income of 20%, because no tax would be reclaimable.

====Abolition of advance corporation tax====
From 6 April 1999 ACT was abolished, and the tax credit on dividends was reduced to 10%. There was a matching reduction in the basic income tax rate on dividends to 10%, while a new higher-rate of 32.5% was introduced which led to an overall effective 25% tax rate for higher rate taxpayers on dividends (after setting this &quot;notional&quot; tax credit against the tax liability).While non-taxpayers were no longer able to claim this amount from the treasury (as opposed to taxpayers who could deduct it from their tax bill), the 20% ACT (which would have previously been deducted from the dividend before payment) was no longer levied.

ACT that had been incurred prior to 1999 could still be set off against a company&#x27;s tax liability, provided it would have been able to set it off under the old imputation system. In order to keep the stream of payments associated with advance corporation tax payment, &#x27;large&#x27; companies (comprising the majority of corporation tax receipts) were subjected to a quarterly instalments scheme for tax payment.

===Rates===
====Main and small companies&#x27; rates====
On its introduction in 1965, corporation tax was charged at 40%, rising to 45% in the 1969 Budget. The rate then fell to 42.5% in the second Budget of 1970 and 40% in 1971. In 1973, alongside the introduction of advance corporation tax (ACT), Conservative chancellor Anthony Barber created a main rate of 52%, together with a smaller companies&#x27; rate of 42%. This apparent increase was negated by the fact that under the ACT scheme, dividends were no longer subject to income tax.

The 1979 Conservative Budget of Geoffrey Howe cut the small companies&#x27; rate to 40%, followed by a further cut in the 1982 Budget to 38%. The Budgets of 1983–1988 saw sharp cuts in both main and small companies&#x27; rates, falling to 35% and 25% respectively. Budgets between 1988 and 2001 brought further falls to a 30% main rate and 19% small companies&#x27; rates. From April 1983 to March 1997 the small companies&#x27; rate was pegged to the basic rate of income tax. During the 1980s there was briefly a higher rate of tax imposed for capital profits.

====Starting rate and non-corporate distribution rate====
Chancellor Gordon Brown&#x27;s 1999 Budget introduced a 10% starting rate for profits from £0 to £10,000, effective from April 2000. Marginal relief applied meaning companies with profits of between £10,000 and £50,000 paid a rate between the starting rate and the small companies&#x27; rate (19% in 2000).

The 2002 Budget cut the starting rate to zero, with marginal relief applying in the same way. This caused a significant increase in the number of companies being incorporated, as businesses that had operated as self-employed, paying income tax on profits from just over £5,000, were attracted to the corporation tax rate of 0% on income up to £10,000. Previously self-employed individuals could now distribute profits as dividend payments rather than salaries. For companies with profits under £50,000 the corporation tax rate varied between 0% and 19%. Because dividend payments come with a basic rate tax credit, provided the recipient did not earn more than the basic rate allowance, no further tax would be paid. The number of new companies being formed in 2002–2003 reached 325,900, an increase of 45% on 2001–2002.

The fact that individuals operating in this manner could potentially pay no tax at all was felt by the government to be unfair tax avoidance, and the 2004 Budget introduced a Non-Corporate Distribution Rate. This ensured that where a company paid below the small companies&#x27; rate (19% in 2004), dividend payments made to non-corporates (for example, individuals, trusts and personal representatives of deceased persons) would be subject to additional corporation tax, bringing the corporation tax paid up to 19%. For example, a company making £10,000 profit, and making a £6,000 dividend distribution to an individual and £4,000 to another company would pay 19% corporation tax on the £6,000. Although this measure substantially reduced the number of small businesses incorporating, the Chancellor in the 2006 Budget said tax avoidance by small businesses through incorporation was still a major issue, and scrapped the starting rate entirely.

===Historic tax revenues===
The following graph shows UK corporation tax revenue from 1999 to 2017:

===Taxable profits and accounting profits===
The starting point for computing taxable profits is profits before tax (except for a life assurance company). The rules for calculating corporation tax generally ran in parallel with income tax until 1993, when the first statutory rule to move profit reporting into line with generally accepted accounting practice was introduced, although the courts were already moving towards requiring trading profits to be computed using general accountancy rules.

The Finance Act 1993 introduced rules to make tax on exchange gains and losses mimic their treatment in a company&#x27;s financial statements in most instances. The Finance Act 1994 saw similar rules for financial instruments, and in the Finance Act 1996 the treatment of most loan relationships was also brought into line with the accounting treatment. The Finance Act 1997 saw something similar with rental premiums. A year later, the Finance Act 1998 went even further, making it clear that taxable trading profits (apart from those accruing to a Lloyd&#x27;s corporate name or to a life assurance company) and profits from a rental business are equal to profits calculated under generally accepted accounting practice (&quot;GAAP&quot;) unless there is a specific statutory or case law rule to the contrary. This was followed up by the Finance Act 2004, which provided that where a company with investment business could make deductions for management expenses, they were calculated by reference to figures in the financial statements.

====International Financial Reporting Standards====
From 2005, all European Union listed companies have to prepare their financial statements using the &quot;International Financial Reporting Standards&quot; (&quot;IFRS&quot;), as modified by the EU. Other UK companies may choose to adopt IFRS. Corporation tax law is changing so that, in the future, IFRS accounting profits are largely respected. The exception is for certain financial instruments and certain other measures to prevent tax arbitrage between companies applying IFRS and companies applying UK GAAP.

===Avoidance===
Tax avoidance is defined by the UK government as &quot;bending the rules of the tax system to gain a tax advantage that Parliament never intended&quot;. Unlike most other countries, most UK tax professionals are accountants rather than lawyers by training.

Until 2013, the UK had no general anti-avoidance rule (&quot;GAAR&quot;) for corporation tax. However, it inherited an anti-avoidance rule from income tax relating to transactions in securities, and since then has had various &quot;mini-GAARs&quot; added to it. The best known &quot;mini-GAAR&quot; prevents a deduction for interest paid when the loan to which it relates is made for an &quot;unallowable purpose&quot;. In 2013, the government introduced a General Anti-Avoidance Rule to manage the risk of tax avoidance.

Finance Act 2004 introduced disclosure rules requiring promoters of certain tax avoidance schemes that are financing- or employment-related to disclose the scheme. Taxpayers who use these schemes must also disclose their use when they submit their tax returns. This is the first provision of its kind in the UK, and Finance Act 2005 has shown a number of tax avoidance schemes being blocked earlier than would have been expected prior to the disclosure rules.

===Need for greater revenues===
In the early twenty-first century the government sought to raise more revenues from corporation tax. In 2002 it introduced a separate 10% supplementary charge on profits from oil and gas extraction businesses, and Finance Act 2005 contained measures to accelerate when oil and gas extraction business have to pay tax. Instead of paying their tax in four equal instalments in the seventh, tenth, thirteenth and sixteenth month after the accounting period starts, they will be required to consolidate their third and fourth payments and pay them in the thirteenth month, creating a cash flow advantage for the government. Finance (No. 2) Act 2005 continued measures specifically relating to life assurance companies. When originally announced (as Finance (No.3) Bill 2005) Legal &amp; General told the Stock Exchange that £300 m had been wiped off its value, and Aviva (Norwich Union) announced that the tax changes would cost its policy holders £150 m.

==Method of charge==
Powers to collect corporation tax must be passed annually by parliament, otherwise there is no authority to collect it. The charge for the financial year (beginning 1 April each year) is imposed by successive finance acts. The tax is charged in respect of the company&#x27;s accounting period, which is normally the 12-month period for which the company prepares its accounts. Corporation tax is administered by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC).

===Assessment===
Corporation tax is levied on the net profits of a company. Except for certain life assurance companies, it is borne by the company as a direct tax.

Up until 1999 no corporation tax was due unless HMRC raised an assessment on a company. Companies were, however, obliged to report certain details to HMRC so that the right amount could be assessed. This changed for accounting periods ending on or after 1 July 1999, when self-assessment was introduced. Self-assessment means that companies are required to assess themselves &quot;and take full responsibility for that assessment&quot;. If the self-assessment is wrong through negligence or recklessness, the company can be liable to penalties.
The self-assessment tax return needs to be delivered to HMRC 12 months after the end of the period of account in which the accounting period falls (although the tax must be paid before this date). If a company fails to submit a return by then, it is liable to penalties. HMRC may then issue a determination of the tax payable, which cannot be appealed – however, in practice they wait until a further six months have elapsed. Also, the most common claims and elections that may be made by a company have to be part of its tax return, with a time limit of two years after the end of the accounting period. This means that a company submitting its return more than one year late suffers not only from the late filing penalties, but also from the inability to make these claims and elections.

From 2004 there has been a requirement for new companies to notify HM Revenue &amp; Customs of their formation, although HMRC receives notifications of new company registrations from Companies House. Companies will then receive an annual notice CT603, approximately 1–2 months after the end of the company&#x27;s financial period, notifying it to complete an annual return. This must also include the company&#x27;s annual accounts, and possibly other documents, such as auditors&#x27; reports, that are required for certain companies.

===Schedular system===
In the United Kingdom the &quot;source rule&quot; applies. This means that something is taxed only if there is a specific provision bringing it within the charge to tax. Accordingly, profits are only charged to corporation tax if they fall within one of the following, and are not otherwise exempted by an explicit provision of the Taxes Acts:

Notes:

#In practice companies do not get taxed under Schedule F. Most companies are exempted from Schedule F and there is a provision for those companies which are taxed on UK dividends (i.e. dealers in shares (stock)) that removes the charge from Schedule F to Schedule D.
#A Controlled Foreign Company (&quot;CFC&quot;) is a company controlled by a UK resident that is not itself UK resident and is subject to a lower rate of tax in the territory in which it is resident. Under certain circumstances, UK resident companies that control a CFC pay corporation tax on what the UK tax profits of that CFC would have been. However, because of a wide range of exemptions, very few companies suffer a CFC charge.
#Schedules B, C and E used to, but no longer, exist.
#Authorised unit trusts and OEICs are not liable to tax on their chargeable gains.
Schedule D is itself divided into a number of cases:

Notes:
#Cases II and IV only apply to income tax and not corporation tax.

Strictly speaking, Corporation Tax Act 2010 replaces the historic terminology &quot;Schedule A&quot;, &quot;Schedule D Case I&quot; etc. with more descriptive terms but this does not affect the substantive application of the schedular system so that, for example, different rules apply for utilising tax losses depending upon the nature of the income under which the losses arises.

====Relief for expenses====
Most direct expenses are deductible when calculating taxable income and chargeable gains. Notable exceptions include any costs of entertaining clients. Companies with investment business may deduct certain indirect expenses known as &quot;expenses of management&quot; when calculating their taxable profits. A similar relief is available for expenses of a life assurance company taxed on the I minus E basis which relate to the company&#x27;s basic life assurance and general annuity business. Donations made to charities are also normally deducted in calculating taxable income if made under Gift Aid.

===Rates and payment===
The 2007 Budget announced a main rate cut from 30% to 28%, effective from April 2008. At the same time, the small companies&#x27; rate was increased from 19% to 20% from April 2007, 21% in April 2008, to stop &quot;individuals artificially incorporating as small companies to avoid paying their due share of tax, a practice if left unaddressed would cost the rest of the taxpaying population billions of pounds&quot;.

The rate of corporation tax is determined by the financial year, which runs from 1 April to the following 31 March. Financial year FY17 started on 1 April 2017 and ends on 31 March 2018. Where a company&#x27;s accounting period straddles a financial year in which the corporation tax rate has changed, the company&#x27;s profits for that period are split. For example, a company paying small companies&#x27; rate with its accounting period running from 1 January to 31 December, and making £100,000 of profit in 2007, would be deemed to have made 90/365*£100,000 = £24,657.53 in FY06 (there are 90 days between 1 January and 31 March), and 275/365*£100,000=£75,34.47 in FY07, and would pay 19% on the FY06 portion, and 20% on the FY07 portion.

From 1 April 2010 HM Revenue &amp; Customs updated their terminology and the former Small Companies&#x27; Rate is now called Small Profits Rate.

Notes:
#The bands shown on the right hand side are divided by one plus the number of associates (usually the only associates a company has are fellow group companies, but the term is more widely defined)
#The reduced rates do not apply to close investment holding companies (companies controlled by fewer than 5 people (plus associates) or by their directors/managers, whose main activity is the holding of investments). Nor do they apply to companies in liquidation after the first 12 months.
#Authorised unit trusts and open-ended investment companies are taxed at the basic rate of income tax which is 20% as of 2010
#Life assurance companies are taxed using the above rates on shareholder profits and 20% on policy holder profits
#Companies active in the oil and gas extraction industry in the UK or on the UK Continental Shelf are subject to an additional 10% charge on their profits from those activities

Most companies are required to pay tax nine months and a day after the end of an accounting period. Larger companies are required to pay quarterly instalments, in the seventh, tenth, thirteenth and sixteenth months after a full accounting period starts. These times are modified where an accounting period lasts for less than twelve months. From 2005 onwards, for tax payable on oil and gas extraction profits, the third and fourth quarterly instalments are merged, including the supplementary 10% charge.

In the financial year 2004–2005, approximately 39,000 companies paid corporation tax at the main rate. These 4.7% of active companies are responsible for 75% of all corporation tax receipts. Around 224,000 companies paid the small companies rate, with 34,000 benefiting from marginal relief. 264,000 were in the starting rate, with 269,000 benefiting from the lower band of marginal relief. The total revenue was £41.9bn from 831,885 companies. Only 23480 companies had a liability in excess of £100,000.

===HM Revenue and Customs powers of enquiry===
HMRC has one year from the normal filing date, which is itself one year after the end of the period of account, to open an enquiry into the return. This period is extended if the return is filed late. The enquiry continues until all issues that HMRC wish to enquire about a return are dealt with. However, a company can appeal to the Commissioners of Income Tax to close an enquiry if they feel there is undue delay.

If either side disputes the amount of tax that is payable, they may appeal to either the General or Special Commissioners of Income Tax. Appeals on points of law may be made to the High Court (Court of Session in Scotland), then the Court of Appeal, and finally, with leave, to the House of Lords. However, decisions of fact are binding and can only be appealed if no reasonable Commissioner could have made that decision.

Once an enquiry is closed, or the time for opening an enquiry has passed, HMRC can only re-open a prior year if they become aware of an issue which they could not reasonably have known about at the time, or in instances of fraud or negligence. In fraud or negligence cases, they can re-open cases from up to 20 years ago. After an HMRC enquiry closes, or after final determination of an issue by the courts, the taxpayer has 30 days to amend their return, and make additional claims and elections, if appropriate, before the assessment becomes final and conclusive. If there is no enquiry, the assessment becomes final and conclusive once the period in which the Revenue may open an enquiry passes.

==Relief from double taxation==
There is a risk of double taxation whenever a company receives income that has already been taxed. This could be dividend income, which will have been paid out of the post-tax profits of another company and which may have suffered withholding tax. Or it could be because the company itself has suffered foreign tax, perhaps because it conducts part of its trade through an overseas permanent establishment, or because it receives other types of foreign income.

Double taxation is avoided for UK dividends by exempting them from tax for most companies: only dealers in shares suffer tax on them. Where double taxation arises because of overseas tax suffered, relief is available either in the form of expense or credit relief. Expense relief allows the overseas tax to be treated as a deductible expense in the tax computation. Credit relief is given as a deduction from the UK tax liability, but is restricted to the amount of UK tax suffered on the foreign income. There is a system of onshore pooling, so that overseas tax suffered in high tax territories may be set off against taxable income arising from low tax territories. From 1 July 2009, new rules were introduced to exempt most non-UK dividends from corporation tax so these double taxation rules in respect of non-UK dividends will be of less common application in practice after that date.

==Loss relief==
Detailed and separate rules apply to how all the different types of losses may be set off within the computations of a company. A detailed explanation of these can be found in: &quot;United Kingdom corporation tax loss relief&quot;.

===Group relief===
The UK does not permit tax consolidation, where companies in a group are treated as though they are a single entity for tax purposes. One of the main benefits of tax consolidation is that tax losses in one entity in a group are automatically relievable against the tax profits of another. Instead, the UK permits a form of loss relief called &quot;group relief&quot;.

Where a company has losses arising in an accounting period (other than capital losses, or losses arising under Case V or VI of Schedule D) in excess of its other taxable profits for the period, it may surrender these losses to a group member with sufficient taxable profits in the same accounting period.
The company receiving the losses may offset them against their own taxable profits. Exceptions include that a company in the oil and gas extraction industry may not accept group relief against the profits arising on its oil and gas extraction business, and a life assurance company may only accept group relief against its profits chargeable to tax at the standard shareholder rate applicable to that company. Separate rules apply for dual resident companies.

Full group relief is permitted between companies subject to UK corporation tax that are in the same 75% group, where companies have a common ultimate parent, and at least 75% of the shares in each company (other than the ultimate parent) are owned by other companies in the group. The companies making up a 75% group do not all need to be UK-resident or subject to UK corporation tax relief. An open-ended investment company cannot form part of a group.

Consortium relief is permitted where a company subject to UK corporation tax is owned by a consortium of companies that each own at least 5% of the shares and together own at least 75% of the shares. A consortium company can only surrender or accept losses in proportion to how much of that company is owned by each consortium group.

==Interaction with European law==
Although there are no European Union directives dealing with direct taxes, UK laws must comply with European legislation. In particular, legislation should not be discriminatory under the EC treaty. A number of cases where UK tax laws are believed to be discriminatory have been brought to the European Court of Justice, usually with respect to freedom of establishment and freedom of movement of capital. Key cases which have been decided include:

*&quot;Hoechst&quot; – where the Court found that the way the partial imputation system operated prior to its abolition in 1999 was discriminatory;
*&quot;Lankhorst-Hohorst&quot; – a German case which implied that the UK&#x27;s transfer pricing and thin capitalisation legislation may have been contrary to EU legislation (the 2004 Finance Act made changes to counter this threat);
*&quot;Marks and Spencer&quot; – where it was claimed that UK parents should be able to relieve the losses of overseas subsidiaries against the tax profits of their UK subgroup (On 7 April 2005, the Advocate-General gave an opinion supporting the claim of a UK parent to offset losses of its EU subsidiaries, where no effective loss relief was available in the EU Member States the subsidiaries were resident in). However, in the final judgment, a compromise agreement was reached in which the national interest to prevent excessive loss of tax was held to outweigh in most circumstances the restriction on the freedom of movement of capital. Accordingly, although no specific new legislation has been introduced, relief for overseas losses will only be available where they may not be utilised in the overseas jurisdiction;
*&quot;Cadbury Schweppes&quot; – where it was ruled that CFC rules are only acceptable if they relate to wholly artificial arrangements intended to escape the UK tax normally payable.

Also, the case of &quot;ICI v Colmer&quot; led to the UK amending its definition of a group, for group relief purposes. Previously, the definition required that all companies and intermediate parent companies in a group to be UK resident.

There are also a number of other cases making their way, slowly, up to the European Court. In particular:

* A group litigation order arguing that dividends received from overseas companies should be exempt from tax in the same way as dividends received from UK companies are exempted from tax;
* Claims that the UK CFC legislation is contrary to EU law (notably Vodafone).

==Recent developments==

===Corporation tax reform===
There have been a number of proposals for corporation tax reform, although only a few have been enacted. In March 2001, the government published a technical note &quot;A Review of Small Business Taxation&quot;, which considered simplification of corporation tax for small companies through the closer alignment of their profits for tax purposes with those reported in their accounts. In July of that year, the government also published a consultation document, &quot;Large Business Taxation: the Government&#x27;s strategy and corporate tax reforms&quot;. It set out the strategy for modernising corporate taxes and proposals for relief for capital gains on substantial shareholdings held by companies.

In August 2002, &quot;Reform of corporation tax – A consultation document&quot; was published, outlining initial proposals for the abolition of the Schedular system. This was followed up in August 2003 by &quot;Corporation tax reform – A consultation document&quot;, which further discussed the possible abolition of the Schedular system, and also whether the capital allowances (tax depreciation) system should be abolished. It also made proposals that were ultimately enacted in Finance Act 2004. (The first two of these listed below were in response to threats to the UK tax base arising from recent European Court of Justice judgments.) The changes were to:
*Introduction of transfer pricing rules for UK-to-UK transactions. Transfer pricing rules require certain transactions to be deemed to have taken place at arm&#x27;s length prices for tax purposes where they did not in fact take place as such.
*Merging thin capitalisation rules with the transfer pricing rules. Thin capitalisation rules limit the amount a company can claim as a tax deduction on interest when it receives loans at non-commercial rates (from connected parties, for example).
*Extension of the deduction for management expenses to all companies with an investment business. Previously a company had to be wholly or mainly engaged in an investment business to qualify.

In December 2004, &quot;Corporation tax reform – a technical note&quot; was published. It outlined the government&#x27;s decision to abolish the schedular system, replacing the numerous schedules and cases with two pools: a trading and letting pool; and an &quot;everything else&quot; pool. The Government had decided that capital allowances would remain, though there would be some reforms, mostly affecting the leasing industry.

===Other enactments===
Other main reforms enacted, include:

*Relief from tax on chargeable gains on disposals of substantial shareholdings in trading companies and groups (enacted by Finance Act 2002).
*Introduction of UK to UK transfer pricing rules, coupled with the merging of the thin capitalisation rules with the transfer pricing rules (enacted by Finance Act 2004).
*Extension of management expenses rules so that companies do not need to be investment companies to receive them, coupled with a specific rule preventing capital items being deductible as management expenses (enacted by Finance Act 2004).

<doc id="594445" wikidata="Q447773" url="?curid=594445" title="Bette Nesmith Graham">
<text>Bette Nesmith Graham (March 23, 1924 – May 12, 1980) was an American typist, commercial artist, and the inventor of the correction fluid Liquid Paper. Born as Bette Clair McMurry, she married Warren Nesmith at the age of 19 and became the mother of the musician and producer Michael Nesmith, who later became the guitarist of The Monkees. After Warren returned from serving in World War II, the couple divorced, leaving Bette to raise Michael as a single mother. She married Robert Graham in 1962, and he helped her run the lucrative Liquid Paper business that she had founded a few years prior.

==Biography==
Born in 1924 in Dallas, Texas, Bette Graham dropped out of Alamo Heights High School in San Antonio at the age of seventeen and went to secretarial school. By 1951, she had worked her way up to the position of executive secretary for W. W. Overton, the Chairman of the Board of the Texas Bank and Trust. Around this time, electric typewriters were becoming increasingly popular, and Graham and her colleagues at the bank began experiencing trouble with the new IBM electric typewriters. The messy carbon-film ribbons used in typewriters and the primarily mechanical set-ups of the devices made it especially difficult to erase and fix mistakes neatly. Users typically had to retype entire pages because of one small error, which made correcting errors a painstaking and time-consuming process. As a result, Graham was determined to find a more efficient alternative, leading her to develop the first prototype of &quot;Liquid Paper&quot; in 1956.

==Career==
The original inspiration for Graham&#x27;s breakthrough innovation came as she observed painters decorating the bank windows for the holidays. Rather than remove their mistakes entirely, the painters simply covered any imperfections with an additional layer. Applying the artists&#x27; technique of painting over mistakes, Graham began experimenting with mixing white, water-based tempera paint to match the color of the bank stationery and cover up her typing errors. After developing her initial mixture, Graham first used it in the office and saw remarkable results; by using a watercolor brush to apply the correction fluid, her boss never even noticed any concealed mistakes. Her invention began as a kitchen and garage operation, where she used her kitchen blender to mix the correction fluid and then poured it into empty nail polish bottles. She named the first batch of her new invention &quot;Mistake Out&quot;, and she hired her son and his friends to work on assembling the product for $1 per hour in her garage.

When the other secretaries realized how well Graham&#x27;s invention worked, they asked her for their own supplies of the correction fluid. The inventor sold her first batch of &quot;Mistake Out&quot; in 1956, and soon she was working full-time to produce and bottle it from her North Dallas home. Her son Michael – who would later achieve fame as a member of the pop group The Monkees – and his friends helped to fill the growing number of orders for Mistake Out. Graham continued to make improvements to her product, testing different angles of cut on the nail polish brush for easier application. Additionally, she experimented with alternative formulas that allowed for quicker drying times. Before long, she was selling about 100 bottles of Mistake Out every month.

In 1958, Graham renamed her refined product &quot;Liquid Paper&quot; and applied for a patent and a trademark that same year. Although she was fired from her bank job for spending excessive time on her invention, she received a patent for her product and gained General Electric as one of her big corporate clients. Graham&#x27;s Liquid Paper Company experienced tremendous growth over the next decade. By 1967, the company had its own corporate headquarters and automated production plant, and sales were in excess of one million units per year. In 1975, Graham moved operations into a 35,000-sq. ft. international Liquid Paper headquarters building in Dallas. At the height of her success, her company was making 25 million bottles of Liquid Paper per year.

In 1979, she opted to sell the company to Gillette Corporation for over $47.5 million. Graham then established two foundations, the Gihon Foundation, which gave grants and financial support to promote women in the arts, and the Bette Clair McMurray Foundation, which did the same for women in business. She died on May 12, 1980, due to complications of a stroke. She left her fortune to her son, who took over her foundations.

==Management style==
From the start, Graham ran her company with a unique combination of spirituality, egalitarianism, and pragmatism. Raised a Baptist, Graham converted to Christian Science in 1942, and this faith inspired the development of her corporate &quot;Statement of Policy&quot;. Part code of ethics, part business philosophy, it covered everything from her belief in a &quot;Supreme Being&quot; to a focus on decentralized decision making and an emphasis on product quality over the pursuit of profit. She also believed that women could bring a more nurturing and humanistic quality to the male world of business, and provided a greenbelt with a fish pond, an employee library, and a childcare center in her new company headquarters in 1975.

==Legacy==
Her only son, musician Michael Nesmith, inherited half of his mother&#x27;s estate of over $50 million. A portion financed the Gihon Foundation which established the Council on Ideas, a think tank with a retreat center located north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, active from 1990 to 2000 and devoted to exploring world problems. Additionally, a portion of Graham&#x27;s estate financed the Betty Clair McMurray Foundation, which focuses on supporting projects such as the exhibit &quot;Texas Women, A Celebration of History,&quot; career guidance for unwed mothers, shelter and counseling for battered women, and college scholarships for mature women. As part of its effort to acknowledge prominent people who had been previously overlooked, in 2018 &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for her.

<text>Desiccators are sealable enclosures containing desiccants used for preserving moisture-sensitive items such as cobalt chloride paper for another use. A common use for desiccators is to protect chemicals which are hygroscopic or which react with water from humidity.

The contents of desiccators are exposed to atmospheric moisture whenever the desiccators are opened. It also requires some time to achieve a low humidity. Hence they are not appropriate for storing chemicals which react quickly or violently with atmospheric moisture such as the alkali metals; a glovebox or Schlenk-type apparatus may be more suitable for these purposes.

Desiccators are sometimes used to remove traces of water from an almost-dry sample. Where a desiccator alone is unsatisfactory, the sample may be dried at elevated temperature using Abderhalden&#x27;s drying pistol.

==Constituents==
The lower compartment of the desiccator contains lumps of silica gel, freshly calcined quicklime, Drierite, molecular sieves, phosphorus pentoxide, (not as effective) anhydrous calcium chloride, or other desiccant to absorb water vapor. The substance needing desiccation is put in the upper compartment, usually on a glazed, perforated ceramic plate. The ground-glass rim of the desiccator lid must be greased with a thin layer of vacuum grease, petroleum jelly or other lubricant to ensure an airtight seal.

In order to prevent damage to a desiccator the lid should be carefully slid on and off instead of being directly placed onto the base.

==Operation==
In laboratory use, the most common desiccators are circular and made of heavy glass. There is usually a removable platform on which the items to be stored are placed. The desiccant, usually an otherwise-inert solid such as silica gel, fills the space under the platform. Colour changing silica may be used to indicate when it should be refreshed. Indication gels typically change from blue to pink (if the indicator is cobalt(II) chloride) as they absorb moisture but other colours may be used.

A stopcock may be included to permit the desiccator to be evacuated. Such models are usually known as vacuum desiccators. When a vacuum is to be applied, it is a common practice to criss-cross the vacuum desiccator with tape, or to place it behind a screen to minimize damage or injury caused by an implosion. To maintain a good seal, vacuum grease is usually applied to the flanges.

<text>A precept (from the , to teach) is a , instruction, or order intended as an authoritative rule of action.

==Religious law==
In religion, precepts are usually commands respecting moral conduct.

===Christianity===
The term is encountered frequently in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures:

The usage of precepts in the Revised Standard Version of the Bible corresponds with that of the Hebrew Bible. The Septuagint (Samuel Rengster edition) has Greek &quot;entolas&quot;, which, too, may be rendered with precepts.

====Latin Catholicism====

The Latin Church of the Catholic Church&#x27;s canon law, which is based on Roman Law, makes a distinction between &quot;precept&quot; and &quot;law&quot; in Canon 49:

In Catholicism, the &quot;Commandments of the Church&quot; may also be called &quot;Precepts of the Church&quot;.

===Buddhism===

In Buddhism, the fundamental code of ethics is known as the Five Precepts (&quot;Pañcaśīla&quot; in Sanskrit, or &quot;Pañcasīla&quot; in Pāli), practiced by laypeople, either for a given period of time or for a lifetime. The precepts also relate to right speech, action and livelihood aspects of the Noble Eightfold Path, which is essential in Buddhist practices. There are other levels of precepts, varying amongst traditions. In Theravadin tradition, there are Eight Precepts, Ten Precepts, and the Patimokkha. Eight Precepts are a more rigorous practice for laypeople. Ten Precepts are the training rules for &quot;samaneras&quot; and &quot;samaneris&quot;, novice monks and nuns, respectively. The Patimokkha is the basic Theravada code of monastic discipline, consisting of 227 rules for monks, (&quot;bhikkhus&quot;) and 311 rules for nuns (&quot;bhikkhunis&quot;).

==Secular law==
In secular law, a precept is a command in writing; a species of writ issued from a court or other legal authority. It is now chiefly used of an order demanding payment (in the UK, for example, the term is applied by local precepting authorities as part of the Council Tax system). The Latin form &quot;praecipe&quot; (i.e., to enjoin, command) is used of the note of instructions delivered by a plaintiff or his lawyer to be filed by the officer of the court, giving the names of the plaintiff and defendant.

==Higher education==
Princeton University uses the term &quot;precept&quot; to describe what many other universities refer to as recitations: large classes are often divided into several smaller discussion sections called precepts, which are led by the professor or graduate teaching assistants. Precepts or recitations usually meet once a week to supplement the lectures and provide a venue for discussion of the course material.

<doc id="594462" wikidata="Q635363" url="?curid=594462" title="Bukit Jalil National Stadium">
<text>The Bukit Jalil National Stadium (Malay: &quot;Stadium Nasional Bukit Jalil&quot;, Jawi: ) is a multi-purpose stadium in Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. With a capacity of 87,500, it is the largest stadium in Southeast Asia, the fourth largest in Asia, and the fifteenth largest in the world.

It was officially inaugurated by then Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad on 11 July 1998, ahead of the 1998 Commonwealth Games and staged its opening ceremony. Since then, it has become the main venue for other international events, such as the 2001 Southeast Asian Games and the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. Nowadays it hosts most of the Malaysian international football matches, national level competition finals such as the Malaysia FA Cup, Malaysia Cup, athletic events and concerts.

It was built alongside other sport venues in the National Sports Complex by the United Engineers Malaysia, and designed by Arkitek FAA, Weidleplan Consulting GMBH and Schlaich Bergermann Partner. A membrane structure is used for the roof, and most of the materials were reinforced concrete. Prior to this stadium, Stadium Merdeka served as the national stadium of Malaysia.

== History ==
The stadium was built on 1 January 1995 to host the 1998 Commonwealth Games. It finished exactly on 1 January 1998. After the 1998 Commonwealth Games in September, the stadium became the home stadium for the Malaysia national football team, replacing the Shah Alam Stadium and the Merdeka Stadium. It also served as the main stadium of the 2001 Southeast Asian Games, 2006 FESPIC Games, 2008 ASEAN University Games and 2017 Southeast Asian Games.

National Stadium&#x27;s capacity makes it the 21st largest stadium in the world and the 9th largest football stadium in the world. It was built by United Engineers Malaysia, Bhd and designed by Arkitek FAA. It was completed three months ahead of schedule. Designed to host a multitude of events, the National Stadium is the central and most prominent sports venue at the 1.2 km2 National Sports Complex in Bukit Jalil.

Malaysia&#x27;s previous national stadium was the Merdeka Stadium before the National Sports Complex was constructed. Malaysia also uses other stadiums for their football matches such as KLFA Stadium, MBPJ Stadium and the Shah Alam Stadium.

The stadium, along with the National Sports Complex, is currently undergoing a major renovation at a combined cost of RM1.34 billion as a part of KL Sports City project in 2 phases. Project 1 (Phase 1) has been completed ahead and for the 2017 SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur, with a new Populous-designed facade that covers the exterior of the stadium with twisted vertical louvres which are also LED-lighted, as well as recolouring the seats to a yellow-black design and upgraded facilities. After the 2017 ASEAN Para Games, Project 2 (Phase 2) will commence, and will add a retractable roof, retractable seats, comfort ventilation and new sports and lifestyle facilities.

===Pitch issues===
On 18 February 2020 to prevent another issue regarding the football pitch again in the future, the Malaysian Stadium Corporation (PSM) and Malaysia Ministry of Youth and Sports (KBS) plan to upgrade the pitch from cow grass to zeon zoysia grass with an estimated cost of RM10 Million. The cost included the use of specialise machine and equipment for the grass. The plan upgrade will start later this year and is expected to be completed within the next three months.

== Stadium facilities ==
The stadium is equipped with the following facilities:
* 105 m x 68 m Zeon Zoysia pitch
* 9 laned 400m synthetic track
* 6m x 60m warming up track
* 1,500 flux floodlights
* Broadcast Studios
* Coloured Video Matrix Scoreboards
* High-tech Cathode Ray Tube Video Screen Board
* Individual &quot;paddles&quot; containing LED pixels at the seats

== Entertainment uses ==

<doc id="594467" wikidata="Q449439" url="?curid=594467" title="Miguel Miramón">
<text>Miguel Gregorio de la Luz Atenógenes Miramón y Tarelo, known as Miguel Miramón, (29 September 1831 – 19 June 1867) was a Mexican conservative general who disputed the Mexican presidency with Benito Juarez at the age of twenty seven during the Reform War, serving between February 1859 and December 1860. He was the first Mexican president to be born after the Mexican War of Independence.

A cadet in military school at the beginning of the Mexican–American War, Miramón saw action at the Battle of Molino del Rey and the Battle of Chapultepec during the American invasion of Mexico City. After the triumph of the liberal Plan of Ayutla in 1855, Miramón participated in a series of conservative counter coups until his efforts merged with the wider Reform War led by conservative president Félix María Zuloaga. The first year of the war was marked by a series of conservative victories achieved by Miramón, leading the press to dub him &quot;Young Maccabee&quot;. After a moderate faction of conservatives overthrew Zuloaga in an effort to reach a compromise with liberals, a conservative junta of representatives elected Miramón as president. Miramón would lead the conservatives for the rest of the war, leading two sieges against the liberal capital of Veracruz, where Benito Juárez maintained his role as president of the Second Federal Republic. The second siege failed after the United States Navy intercepted Miramón&#x27;s naval forces, and liberal victories accumulated hereafter, ending the war in 1860. Miramón escaped the country and went into exile in Europe, being received at the Spanish court.

He returned to Mexico in 1862 during the early stages of the Second French intervention, offering his assistance to the Second Mexican Empire. Emperor Maximilian was a liberal and in order to diffuse conservative opposition to the Empire, he sent Miramón to Prussia, ostensibly to study military tactics. As the Empire began to falter, Miramón returned to Mexico, and joined Maximilian until the fall of the Second Mexican Empire in May 1867. The restored Mexican government had Miramón, Maximilian and Tomas Mejía court martialed and sentenced to death. They were shot on June 19, 1867.

==Early life==
Miramón was born in Mexico City on September 29, 1831, into a very traditional family of partial French heritage. His grandfather was from the province of Béarn. He was the son of Colonel Bernardo de Miramón and his wife Carmen Tarelo. He was one of twelve children and enrolled in the military college on February 10, 1846. The Mexican–American War broke out a few months later. As the Americans entered Mexico City, Miramón himself would join the fighting and during the first weeks of September in 1847, he saw action at the Battle of Molino del Rey and the Battle of Chapultepec, being wounded and being taken prisoner during the latter. He was released in June, 1848 after the war had ended.

In military school he went through the regular grades of promotion, from corporal to lieutenant of artillery. In 1852 he served in Jalisco, and in 1853 was in some actions under generals Mariano Salas and Rosas Landa in the department of Mexico. After that he saw much active service, and rose rapidly through the ranks, being made a brevet lieutenant colonel on 6 July 1855, and on the 30th of the same month a fully commissioned lieutenant colonel.

==La Reforma==
During the period of La Reforma, Miramón participated in the various conservative counter revolutions after the triumph of the liberal Plan of Ayutla in 1855. He joined Antonio de Haro y Tamariz at Zacapoaxtla in 1856, fighting at the head of the 10th and 11th battalions at the Loma de Montero. He saw action at the goteras de Puebla on March 10, but went into hiding when the city fell.

In October, 1856, he was second in command of a conservative revolt proclaimed at Puebla. With a thousand soldiers, he defended the city for forty three days against an army of six thousand man, causing great damage to the liberal forces. When the city finally fell Miramón refused to surrender and instead at the head of one hundred and fifty men fled and took the city of Toluca on January 18, 1857, seizing some artillery and then heading to the town of Temascaltepec where he was wounded and defeated. He was imprisoned, but escaped in September, soon after joining the reactionary forces in the South. As second in command, he captured the city of Cuernavaca and in January 1858 to Mexico City where the Plan of Tacubaya led by Félix Zuloaga had overthrown the liberal government of Ignacio Comonfort, also inaugurating what came to be known as the Reform War.

==Reform War==
===Early role===
Miramón would play a key role in the initial offensive, and the series of conservative victories that occurred during 1858. On March 10, 1858, Miramón was a commander at the Battle of Salamanca, which opened up the interior of the country to the conservatives.

On July 24, Miramón and Tomas Mejía captured Guanajuato, and they captured San Luis Potosí September 12. The liberal commander of the north, Santiago Vidaurri was then defeated by them at the Battle of Ahualulco on September 29. By October the conservatives were at the height of their strength.

On December 20, 1858, about a year since he first came to power, Zuloaga had to face a pronunciamiento against himself led by a moderate faction of the conservatives who wished to compromise with the liberal government. Miguel María de Echegaray pronounced at Ayotla with a plan to summon a congress to frame a constitution suitable for the nation. Zuloaga passed measures to put down the revolt, assuming personal command of the forces at the capital, and forbidding all interaction with the rebels. He passed a manifesto condemning Echeagaray who was stripped of his post in the army. Manuel Doblado was also arrested.

A modified form of the Ayotla Plan was proclaimed by Manuel Robles Pezuela on December 23, and found some military support in the capital. Zuloaga offered to resign if the objection was to him personally, but would not assent if the plan was meant to overthrow his conservative principles. Miramón was offered command of the plan, but he rejected it.

The Plan of Ayotla was actually an offshoot of the aforementioned fusionist party, a moderate faction, which did not seek to abandon conservative principles, but did seek an end to the war by seeking compromise with the liberals. Manuel Robles Pezuela arrived at the national palace on the morning of December 24, when he assumed the presidency.

Robles Pezuela sent commissioners out to gain adherence to his plan, and began to assemble a junta of representatives ignoring, however the conservative hero Miguel Miramón, upsetting conservative hardliners. Robles, however eventually conceded in granting Miramón representation.

The Junta assembled on December 30, 1858, and proceeded to elect a president. Miramón won with 50 votes against Robles’ 46, though the latter was authorized to act as provisional president until Miramón arrived in the capital.

Meanwhile, Zuloaga still claiming the presidency, agreed to officially pass on the presidency to Miramón on January 31, 1859. To keep him from changing his mind, Miramón had him sent to the interior.

===Presidency===
Miramón&#x27;s most important military priority was now the capture of Veracruz. He left the capital on February 16, leading his troops in person along with his minister of war. Meanwhile, Aguascalientes and Guanajuato had fallen to the liberals. Liberal troops in the West were led by Degollado and headquartered in Morelia, which now served as a liberal arsenal. The conservatives meanwhile, feeling the effects of the malarial climate, abandoned the siege of Veracruz by March 29. Degollado made another attempt on Mexico City in early April and was utterly routed in Tacubaya by Leonardo Márquez, who captured a large amount of war material, and who also in this battle gained infamy for including medics among those executed in the aftermath of the battle.

On April 6, the Juárez government was recognized by the United States, and on July 12, the liberal government nationalized the property of the church, and suppressed the monasteries, the sale of which provided the liberal war effort with new funds, though not as much as had been hoped for since speculators were waiting for more stable times to make purchases.

Miramón met the liberal forces in November at which a truce was declared and a conference was held on the matter of the Constitution of 1857 and the possibility of a constituent congress. Negotiations broke down, however and hostilities resumed on the 12th after which Degollado was routed at the Battle of Las Vacas.

On December 14, 1859, the Juárez government signed the Mclane Ocampo Treaty, which granted the U.S. perpetual rights to transport goods across three key trade routes in Mexico, including troops, and granted Americans an element of extraterritoriality. The treaty caused consternation among the conservatives, the European press, and members of Juárez&#x27; cabinet, however the issue was rendered moot when the U.S. Senate failed to approve the treaty.

Meanwhile, Miramón was preparing another siege of Veracruz, heading out of the capital on February 8, once again leading his troops in person along with his war minister, hoping to rendezvous with a small naval squadron led by the Mexican General Marin, and disembarking from Havana. The United States Navy however had orders to intercept it.

Miramón arrived at Medellin on 2 March, and awaited for Marin&#x27;s attack in order to begin the siege. The American steamer &quot;Indianola&quot; however had anchored itself near the fortress of San Juan de Ulua, in order to defend Veracruz from attack.

On March 6, Marin&#x27;s squadron, composed of the General Miramón, and the Marques de la Habana, arrived in Veracruz, and captured by Captain Jarvis of the U.S. Navy. The ships were sent to New Orleans, along with the now imprisoned General Marin, depriving the conservatives of an attacking force and the substantial amount of artillery, guns, and rations that they were carrying on board for delivery to Miramón.

Miramón&#x27;s effort to siege Veracruz was abandoned on 20 March, and he arrived back in the capital on April 7. The conservatives had also been suffering defeats in the interior losing Aguascalients and San Luis Potosi before the end of April. Degollado was sent into the interior to lead the liberal campaign as their enemies now ran out of resources. He appointed Uraga as Quartermaster General

Uraga split his troops and attempted to lure Miramón out strategically to isolate him, however On late May however, Uraga then committed the strategic blunder of attempting to assault Guadalajara with Miramón&#x27;s troops behind him. The assault failed and Uraga was taken prisoner.

Miramón was routed however, on August 10, in Sialo, which resulted in his commander Tomas Mejía being taken prisoner, and Miramón retreated to Mexico City. In response to the disaster, Miramón resigned as president, but the conservative junta only elected him president again after a two days interregnum.

By the end of August, liberals were preparing for a decisive final battle. The capital was cut off from the rest of the country. Guadalajara was surrounded by 17,000 liberal troops while the conservatives in the city only had 7000. The conservative commander Castillo surrendered without firing a shot, and was allowed to leave the city with his troops. Meanwhile, Leonardo Márquez was routed on 10 November, attempting to reinforce Castillo without being aware of his surrender.

Miramón on November 3 convoked a war council including prominent citizens to meet the crisis and by November 5 it was resolved to fight until the end. The conservatives were now struggling with a shortage of funds, and increasing defections. Nonetheless, Miramón gained a victory when he attacked the liberal headquarters of Toluca on 9 December, in which almost all of their forces were captured.

General Gonzalez Ortega however approached the capital with reinforcements. The decisive battle took place on December 22, at San Miguel Calpulalpan. The conservatives had 8000 troops and the liberals 16,000. Miramón lost and retreated back towards the capital.

Another war council now agreed to surrender. The conservative government fled the city, and Miramón intending to head towards the coast and Márquez escaped into the mountains of Michoacan. The triumphant liberals entered the city with 25,000 troops on 1 January 1861, and Juárez entered the capital at January 11.

==Second Mexican Empire==
On his way to the coast Miramón was intercepted at the town of Jico, near Jalapa, but he was saved by chance while two of his companions, Diaz y Ordonez fell into the hands of the liberals. Miramón hid in Jalapa and later left to Europe on board the French steamer &quot;Le Mercure&quot;. In response to Miramón&#x27;s financial raids on British citizens during the war, the British government complained to the French government. Juárez also sought Miramón&#x27;s arrest. On December 2, 1861, Miramón was received and honored at the Spanish court.

He did not remain long in Europe, and returned during the Tripartite Expedition of French, Spanish, and English forces. He was hardly received warmly by the expeditionary forces, who at this point were simply on a debt collection mission with no intention of upending the Juárez government, and the English representative Dunlop had Miramón arrested and exiled to Cuba, prohibiting Miramón from returning to Mexico.

The tripartite coalition however fell apart, once it became clear that France unilaterally intended to overthrow the Mexican government and organize a client state with the help of conservative collaborators like Juan Almonte. The French entered the capital on June 10, 1863. On June 16 the French government nominated 35 Mexican citizens to constitute a Junta Superior de Gobierno who were then tasked with electing a triumvirate that were to serve as the executive of the new government. The three elected were Juan Almonte, Archbishop Labastida, and Jose Mariano Salas. The Junta was also to choose 215 Mexican citizens who together with the &quot;Junta Superior&quot; were to constitute an Assembly of Notables that was to decide upon the form of government. On 11 July, the Assembly published its resolutions, that Mexico was to be a constitutional monarchy and that Ferdinand Maximilian of Habsburg was to be invited to accept the Mexican throne. The executive was then officially changed into the Regency of the Mexican Empire.

It was at this point that Miramón successfully reentered the country by way of the northern frontier, arriving in Mexico City on July 28, 1863, and offering his services to the regency. Maximilian accepted the throne of Mexico in April, 1864, and arrived in the nation about a month later. Ironically, given the conservatives’ role in bringing him to power, Maximilian was a liberal, who believed in accepting the progressive laws over which the Reform War had been fought over, and in order to neuter conservative opposition to this, he sent his conservative generals out of the country including Miramón who was sent to Berlin in order to study the organization of the Prussian Army.

Miramón only returned to Mexico on November 9, 1866, when the Empire was already faltering. There were rumors that Maximilian was going to abdicate and leave the nation, and Miramón considered putting himself at the head of the conservative armies as he had been during the Reform War, but when Miramón arrived, Maximilian was still in power, and deciding to remain loyal to the Empire, Miramón offered him his services. He advised Maximilian not to abdicate, and offered to fight for him, even at the cost of his life.

After a council at Orizaba which decided against his abdication, Maximilian intended to return to Mexico City, first remaining at Puebla for nearly three weeks, and making preparations for the campaign. The country was divided into three great military districts the western, comprising the provinces north of Colima, including Durango and Chihuahua; the eastern, stretching from Aguascalientes and Tampico northward; and the central, embracing all the vast remainder to Chiapas. Miramón, who took command of the western district, had already set out to create his army, with little regard for the means to be employed, but Mejía in the east stood at the head of nearly 4,000 men; and Márquez, controlling the centre, had 4,000 under Méndez in Michoacan, and fully 2,000 at Puebla, Maximilian assumed the supreme command, and issued orders for the active formation of the new national army as well as militia.

Unfortunately for the Empire, the Western and Eastern military district were in possession of the Republicans, as well as the region south of Puebla, while the few remaining central provinces were overrun by hostile bands and about to be invaded by the Republican armies. Funds and resources were also lacking. Meanwhile, arms and funds from the United States were pouring into the Republic armies.

On January 27, 1867, Miramón triumphantly captured Aguascalientes and nearly succeeded in capturing Juárez, the retreat of Governor Auza managing to save him. Miramón however, did not intend to advance any further, satisfied with the forced loan and the diversion he had created among the Republicans, he retired to join Castillo at San Luis Potosi. The Republican general Mariano Escobedo figured out his intentions and intercepted him at San Jacinto at February 1, leading to a complete rout. Miramón escaped with Castillo and took refuge in Querétaro. The Republicans had by then captured Guanajuato, and then Morelia. The Imperialists retreated from Michoacan to the borders of San Luis Potosi and fell back upon Querétaro.

===Siege of Queretaro===
Maximilian joined the army at Querétaro along with Minister Aguirre, Leonardo Márquez, and López with the sum of fifty thousand pesos, with sixteen hundred men and twelve cannons. Maximilian reached Querétaro on February 19, and was received by enthusiasm Miramón and the other generals meeting him at a formal reception.

A few days after their arrival a review of the troops was held, showing 9,000 men with 39 cannon, including about 600 Frenchmen, Miramón was placed at the head of the infantry, of which Castillo and Casanova received each a division, Méndez assuming command of the reserve brigade, in which López served as colonel, Mejía became chief of the cavalry, Reyes of engineers, and Arellano of the artillery. To, Márquez, chief of the general staff, was accorded the foremost place, greatly to the anger of Miramón. Maximilian, Miramón, Márquez, Mejía, and Méndez became known as &quot;the five magic M&#x27;s&quot; of the Empire.

In the first council of war that had been held on February 22, it had been agreed to fight the Republicans at once, before their combined forces became too strong, but ultimately this strategy, which historian Bancroft suggests could have achieved victory, was rejected at the behest of Márquez. As the liberals began to surround Querétaro, Márquez then suggested to flee to Mexico City, still held by the Imperialists, gather their forces and face the liberal armies in one final decisive battle, but this was deemed as impractical.

On March 5, the Republican forces came into view of the defenders at Querétaro, and began to prepare for a siege. After the fighting had begun Márquez once again brought up his plan of retreating to Mexico, but Miramón and others strongly opposed him. Miramón planned to lead a counterattack to recover the hill of San Gregorio on March 17. When the time arrived however, a false alarm arose that the Imperialist headquarters were under attack, leading the counterattack to be put off.

Miramón now placed his support for a plan to destroy the Western besieging lines therefore providing a way to retreat if needed. Márquez was assigned to go to Mexico City to seek reinforcements. Miramón was assigned to provide a distraction and on March 22 he led an expedition down the valley, which captured a quantity of provisions. Márquez was able to depart during the night with 1200 horsemen and Miramón now became the leading general at Querétaro.

After the Imperialists repulsed another Republican assault, leaving the latter with 2000 deaths, Miramón, during an award ceremony, took one of the medals and asked to decorate the Emperor for his conduct during the battle, which Maximilian accepted, and wore as the most valued of his decorations.

On April 1 Miramón led a counterattack to the hill of San Gregorio, but lack of reinforcements left the attack without any decisive results.

As any news of Márquez failed to arrive, a mission was sent to Mexico City to see what happened. Miramón urged Maximilian to leave as well but, the latter chose to stay. The mission failed, and now leading officers outright urged surrender.

The Imperialists now planned to fight their way out of Querétaro, and as preparation Miramón planned an attack on the Cimatario Hill on April 27, to which he advanced with 2000 men. The Imperialist repulsed the Republican forces, dispersing thousands and taking 500 prisoners, but the Imperialists squandered vital time planning their next move, and Republican reserves arrived to provide a defeat.

The Imperialists now sought to break through the enemy lines and seek refuge in the ranges of Sierra Gorda, and possibly reach the coast. The movement was planned for May 15.

Unfortunately for the Imperialists, before these plans were carried out they were betrayed by Colonel Miguel López, and on the night of May 14, he opened the gates of Querétaro to the Republican forces in exchange for a sum of gold.

Surprised by enemy troops at night, Miramón fought back, and he was shot in the face, being carried by friendly forces to the house of a Querétaro physician, Dr. Licea, who then turned Miramón over to the Republicans.

==Court martial and execution==
Maximilian, Miramón, and Mejía were tried for violating an 1862 Decree passed in the early stages of the French Intervention, against traitors and invaders. After the trial, a unanimous verdict of guilty was brought forth on the night of June 14, and the sentence of death was passed.

Among those who pled President Juárez to spare their lives was Miramón&#x27;s wife who weeping with her two children, fainted at the foot of the president. Maximilian wrote to his European relatives asking them to take care of Miramón&#x27;s wife and her children.

The three condemned were led to the Cerro de las Campanas outside of Querétaro on the morning of June 19. Miramón and Mejía stood to the side of Maximilian, but the latter then remarked to Miramón that “a brave soldier is respected by his sovereign; permit me to yield to you the place of honor,” and Miramón was subsequently given the center position. Before being executed he read a brief piece disavowing the charge of traitor. All three were executed at around seven in the morning.

<doc id="594468" wikidata="Q15361" url="?curid=594468" title="Baix Camp">
<text>Baix Camp () is a comarca located in the region of Camp de Tarragona, in Catalonia.The capital is the city of Reus.

Baix Camp is located on the coast, between Tarragonès to the northeast and Baix Ebre to the south. It also borders the comarques of Priorat, Ribera d&#x27;Ebre, Conca de Barberà, Alt Camp, and Tarragonès.

== Population ==
Almost 150,000 people inhabit Baix Camp. The population has increased gently since the middle of the twentieth century, with population growth averaging 1.5% annually during the last three decades. Growth is not evenly distributed, however, but is strongly focused on Reus, the industrial and commercial centre of the region. Around two-thirds of the inhabitants of Baix Camp live in Reus, which from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries was the second most populous city in Catalonia, after Barcelona. Taking Catalonia as a whole, the place of Reus in the population rankings has now slipped to tenth. Within Baix Camp, the only other municipality with more than 10,000 inhabitants is Cambrils.

== Economy ==
In the agricultural sector almonds and hazelnuts are a major crops, together representing 30% of primary sector production. Viticulture has never regained the level of dominance that it enjoyed before the European Phylloxera epidemic that peaked in the 1870s. High dependency on almonds and hazelnuts nevertheless leaves the entire regional economy vulnerable to declining world market prices that have accompanied increased globalization of the agricultural sector. Some price protection is afforded to growers by protected designation for &quot;Hazelnuts from Reus&quot; which actually covers not just production from Reus but also that from neighboring Alt Camp, Tarragonès, Priorat, Conca de Barberà and Terra Alta.

== Municipalities ==
After the capital Reus, the major cities are Cambrils and Mont-roig del Camp; other significant towns are Riudoms and Selva del Camp.

Smaller municipalities:
* North of Reus, at the foot of Puig d&#x27;en Cama: Castellvell del Camp and Almoster.
* In the Mountains of Prades: Prades, Capafonts, Arbolí, and l&#x27;Albiol.
* In the valley of the river Maspujols: Vilaplana, l&#x27;Aleixar, and Maspujols.
* In the valley of the river Alforja: Alforja, les Borges del Camp, and Vinyols i els Arcs.
* Between the ranges of Puig Marí and Puig-server: Riudecols.
* In the valley of the ravine of Ànima Blanca: Montbrió del Camp, and Botarell.
* Near Mont-roig del Camp: Vilanova d&#x27;Escornalbou, Colldejou, and la Torre de Fontaubella
* At the western edge of the comarca: Pratdip and the municipality of Vandellòs i l&#x27;Hospitalet de l&#x27;Infant.

<doc id="594470" wikidata="Q586146" url="?curid=594470" title="Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter">
<text>The Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter is a long-range heavy military cargo aircraft developed from the B-29 and B-50 bombers. Design work began in 1942, the first of three prototype XC-97s flew on 9 November 1944 and the first of six service-test YC-97s flew on 11 March 1947. All nine were based on the 24ST alloy structure and Wright R-3350 engines of the B-29, but with a larger-diameter fuselage upper lobe (making a figure of eight or &quot;double-bubble&quot; section) and they had the B-29 vertical tail with the gunner&#x27;s position blanked off. The first of three heavily revised YC-97A incorporating the re-engineered wing (higher-strength 75ST alloy), taller vertical tail and larger Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 engines of the B-50 bomber, flew on 28 January 1948 and was the basis of the subsequent sole YC-97B, all production C-97s, KC-97s and civilian Stratocruiser aircraft. Between 1944 and 1958, 888 C-97s in several versions were built, 811 being KC-97 tankers. C-97s served in the Berlin Airlift, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Some aircraft served as flying command posts for the Strategic Air Command, while others were modified for use in Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadrons (ARRS).

==Design and development==
The C-97 Stratofreighter was developed towards the end of World War II by fitting a second lobe on top of the fuselage and wings of the B-29 Superfortress with the tail, wing, and engine layout being nearly identical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swanborough / Bowers 1989, p. 125&quot;&gt;Swanborough and Bowers 1989, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The XC-97 and YC-97 can be distinguished from the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser and later C-97s by the shorter fin, and later ones by the flying boom and jet engines on the tanker models.

The prototype XC-97 was powered by the same Wright R-3350 engines as used in the B-29. The XC-97 took off for its first flight on November 9, 1944, just after the death of Boeing president Philip G. Johnson.
On 9 January 1945, the first prototype, piloted by Major Curtin L. Reinhardt, flew from Seattle to Washington, D.C. in 6 hours 4 minutes, an average speed of with of cargo. The tenth and all subsequent aircraft were fitted with the Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Major engines and taller fin and rudder of the B-50 Superfortress.

The C-97 had clamshell doors under its tail so that two retractable ramps could be used to drive in cargo, but it was not a tactical airlifter able to deliver to primitive forward bases. The doors could not be opened in flight, but could be removed to carry out air drops. The C-97 had a useful payload of , which could include two 2½-ton trucks, towed artillery, or light tracked vehicles such as the M56 Scorpion. The C-97 featured cabin pressurization, which made long flights more comfortable.

The C-97 was developed into the civilian Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, a transoceanic airliner that could be fitted with sleeper cabins and featured a lower deck lounge. The first Stratocruiser flew on July 8, 1947. Only 56 were built.

== Operational history ==
The C-97 entered service in 1947, during a period of rapid development of heavy transport aircraft. Only 77 were built before the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II was delivered in 1950, with nearly twice the payload capacity of the C-97. The USAF Strategic Air Command operated C-97 Stratofreighters from 1949 to 1978. Early in its service life, it served as an airborne alternative SAC command post. While only 77 C-97 transports were built, 811 were built as KC-97 Stratofreighters for inflight refueling. The KC-97 began to be phased out with the introduction of the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker in 1957. Many KC-97s were later refitted as C-97G transports and equipped several squadrons of the U.S. Air National Guard.

One YC-97A (45–59595) was used in the Berlin Airlift during April 1949, operating for the 1st Strategic Support Squadron. It suffered a landing gear accident at Gatow and by the time it was repaired, the Soviet Blockade was lifted.

C-97s evacuated casualties during the Korean War. C-97s also participated in the Biafran airlift, delivering relief materials to Uli airstrip in Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War. Flying under the cover of darkness and at treetop level to evade radar, at least two C-97s were lost.
Only one C-97 is still airworthy at the present day, (S/N 52-2718, named &quot;Angel of Deliverance&quot;) operated by the Berlin Airlift Historical Foundation. It is painted as YC-97A 45–59595, the only C-97 to participate in the Berlin Airlift.

The Israelis turned to Stratocruisers and KC-97s when they could not buy the preferred C-130. They adapted Boeing 377 Stratocruiser airliners into transports, including many using C-97 tail sections including the loading ramps. Others were adapted with swiveling tails and refueling pods. One Israeli C-97 was downed by an Egyptian SA-2 Guideline missile on 17 September 1971, while flying as an electronic counter-measures platform some 12 miles from the Suez Canal.

==Variants==
;XC-97: military designation of the prototype Boeing 367, three built.
;YC-97: cargo transport, six built.

;YC-97A: troop carrier, three built.
;YC-97B: fitted with 80 airliner-style seats, later redesignated C-97B, in 1954 became C-97D, retired to MASDC 15 December 1969.
;C-97A: transport, 50 built.
;KC-97A: Three C-97As were converted into aerial refueling tankers with rear loading door removed and a flight refueling boom added. After the design was proven, they were converted back into the standard C-97A.
;C-97C: Second production version, 14 built; those used as medical evacuation transports during the Korean War were designated MC-97C. 
;VC-97D: staff transport and flying command post conversions, three C-97As converted.

==Accidents and incidents==
;22 May 1947: USAAF XC-97 &quot;43-27472&quot; crashed in a wheat field near Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and caught fire, killing five of seven crew on board.
;6 June 1951: USAF C-97A &quot;48-0398&quot; crashed near Kelly Air Force Base due to a possible asymmetric flap extension on takeoff, killing all nine crew on board.
;15 October 1951: After taking off from Lajes Field, Azores, USAF C-97A &quot;49-2602&quot; of the Military Air Transport Service went missing on a flight from Lajes AFB (LFB), Azores to Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts. The aircraft was piloted by Captain John Francis Dailey Jr. and had a crew of 11. A total of 50 aircraft and ships searched the intended route but no trace of the aircraft or crew was ever found.
;22 October 1951: USAF C-97A &quot;48-0413&quot; crashed and burned next to a runway at Kelly AFB, killing four of six on board.
;22 March 1957: USAF C-97C &quot;50-0702&quot; &quot;en route&quot; to Tokyo went missing over the Pacific Ocean, with 10 crew and 57 passengers on board. It is the deadliest incident ever involving the C-97.
;8 August 1957: USAF C-97 en route to Hawaii from US. No.1 engine lost its propeller and damaged No.2 engine. Aircraft flew for 5 hours at 150 ft altitude to land at Hilo.
;19 January 1958: USAF C-97A &quot;49-2597&quot; en route to Kwajalein from Honolulu went missing over the Pacific Ocean with seven crew on board. The U.S. Navy confirmed that debris found 277 miles to the southwest of Honolulu, was wreckage of the plane.
;29 June 1964: USAF HC-97G &quot;52-2773&quot;, along with USAF HC-54D &quot;42-72590&quot;, were performing pararescue training and photography missions for the NASA Gemini program when the HC-54 banked to the right, colliding with the HC-97 and shearing off the wing and tail section; both aircraft crashed in the water off Bermuda, killing 17 on board both aircraft; seven survived after they jumped before the aircraft collided. The cause was probably incapacitation of the HC-54 pilot.
;26 September 1969: A Nordchurchaid C-97G, (N52676), struck trees and crashed while on final approach to Uli Airstrip, killing all five on board.
;30 July 1987: After taking off, a C-97G (HI-481) operated by Belize Air International (a cargo airline) crashed onto the Mexico City-Toluca highway after the cargo shifted, killing 5 of 12 on board and 44 on the ground.

<text>WW International, Inc., formerly Weight Watchers International, Inc., is a global company headquartered in the U.S. that offers weight loss and maintenance, fitness, and mindset services such as the Weight Watchers comprehensive diet program. Founded in 1963 by Queens, New York City homemaker Jean Nidetch, WW&#x27;s program has three options as of 2019: online via its mobile app and website, coaching online or by phone, or in-person meetings.

In 2018, the company rebranded to &quot;WW&quot; to reflect &quot;its development from focusing on weight loss to overall health and wellness.&quot;

==Company history==
===Inception===
Weight Watchers was conceived by Jean Nidetch, a housewife and mother living in Queens, New York City, who had been overweight most of her life and had tried pills, hypnosis, and numerous fad diets, all of which only led to regained weight. In 1961, at the age of 38, she weighed 214 pounds and an acquaintance mistook her for being pregnant. She entered a free 10-week weight-loss program sponsored by the New York City Board of Health&#x27;s obesity clinic. The program was called the &quot;Prudent Diet&quot; and had been developed in the 1950s by Dr. Norman Jolliffe, head of the board&#x27;s Bureau of Nutrition. The plan included the dictums &quot;No skipping meals. Fish five times a week. Two pieces of bread and two glasses of skim milk a day. More fruits and vegetables.&quot; and eating liver once a week. It prohibited alcohol, sweets, and fatty foods, included a list of allowed foods and the quantities allowed, and encouraged weighing portions.

Although Nidetch lost 20 pounds on the ten-week program, she did not like the way the clinic&#x27;s leader imparted information at the weekly meetings. Discussion was discouraged; in addition, Nidetch&#x27;s motivation was threatened by her urge to binge on Mallomar cookies. She therefore began a weekly support group in her apartment, initially inviting six overweight friends, which within two months grew to 40 women each week. She introduced the &quot;Prudent Diet&quot;, a single page from the New York City Board of Health, to her fellow weight-loss seekers, and the group provided empathy, rapport, mutual understanding, support, and sharing of stories and ideas. The meetings also included a weekly weigh-in, and Nidetch developed a rewards system including prizes for weight-loss milestones. In October 1962, Nidetch achieved her target weight of 142 pounds, and maintained the weight loss; according to her she never exceeded 150 pounds thereafter.

As interest grew, Nidetch coached groups in other neighborhoods. One group was at the home of Al and Felice Lippert, and after the Lipperts successfully lost weight, Al, who was a businessman in the garment industry, talked Nidetch into making a business out of her endeavor.

===Launch, IPO, and sale to Heinz===
Nidetch and the Lipperts launched Weight Watchers Inc. in Queens in 1963 with Nidetch as president and evangelist. They rented public meeting venues and charged participants $2 per weekly meeting; the first official meeting, in May 1963, attracted 400 attendees. Nidetch led groups and trained others to lead groups as well.

Al Lippert, in charge of the business end of the company, franchised it in 1964, using a razor/razorblade model of an inexpensive franchise fee offered to graduates from the company&#x27;s programs who had kept the weight off, with 10% of gross earnings as royalties to the parent company. By 1967, the company was international, with 102 franchises in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Great Britain, and Israel.

Felice Lippert was in charge of recipe development, nutrition, and food research; the first Weight Watchers cookbook, published in 1966, sold more than 1.5 million copies. By January 1968, the company had more than one million members worldwide, and, with the help of Matty Simmons&#x27; and Leonard Mogel&#x27;s Twenty First Century Communications, Inc., &quot;Weight Watchers Magazine&quot; was launched, publishing 300,000 copies of its first issue.

By 1968, the company had 91 franchises in 43 states, and to expand further overseas Al Lippert took the company public as Weight Watchers International Inc.; the initial 225,000 shares, offered at $11.25 a share, began trading enthusiastically, rising to over $30 by the end of the first day. Lippert also initiated lines of Weight Watchers prepared food, spas, camps for overweight kids, and weight-loss products such as scales and travel kits.

Nidetch, with her slim, well-dressed image, charisma, and flair for motivational speaking, remained the public face of the company. In 1970 she published &quot;The Memoir of a Successful Loser: The Story of Weight Watchers&quot;, which documented the original Weight Watchers plan. In 1973 she resigned as president of the company to devote herself to public relations – traveling, being interviewed, and speaking to large audiences about the program&#x27;s success.

In the mid-1970s, the company moved away from simply dieting and more toward &quot;eating management&quot;, developing tailored options to meet the varying needs of its members, including a specialized food plan for the management of weight-loss plateaus, and a maintenance plan. 

In 1975, the publication of &quot;Weight Watchers&quot; magazine was taken over by Family Media (the publishers of &quot;Family Health&quot; magazine).

By the late 1970s, the company and its operations and divisions had grown too large and complex for Lippert to manage, and it was sold, along with its food licensees, to the H. J. Heinz Company in 1978 for $72 million. Lippert remained chairman and signed on to remain CEO for a few years, and Nidetch remained in her role as consultant. In the late 1980s, the company&#x27;s three divisions – support-group meetings division, food line, and publications and media – were still increasingly profitable year-over-year.

===Private-equity acquisition and second IPO===

In 1990, with competition from Jenny Craig, Slim-Fast, Healthy Choice, and Nutrisystem, earnings began to decline. The Heinz parent company competed by introducing newly developed Weight Watchers &quot;Smart Ones&quot; frozen meals. In 1997, to replace its previous system of counting and weighing food, Weight Watchers introduced the POINTS system, an algorithmic formula which quantifies a food portion for the purposes of healthy weight loss based on carbohydrates, fat, and fiber content.

In 1999, Heinz, while retaining the rights to the Weight Watchers name for use in certain
food categories, sold the company to the private equity firm Artal Luxembourg, for $735 million in a leveraged buyout led by the Invus Group, which manages Artal and which is run by Raymond Debbane. Artal put up $224 million and Weight Watchers financed the rest of the buyout with debt. Debbane became chairman of Weight Watchers. In 2001 Debbane organized an initial public offering for Weight Watchers and took it public again. As of 2018, Artal remains the company&#x27;s largest shareholder.

In 2000, the new owners reacquired the license to publish &quot;Weight Watchers Magazine&quot; from Time Inc., where Heinz had offloaded it in 1996 and where it had performed poorly; circulation recovered quickly, and the magazine was redesigned in 2003.

In 2001, the company launched WeightWatchers.com. In 2007, it launched Weight Watchers Online for Men. Competitor Nutrisystem, Inc. also had a men&#x27;s line.

In late 2010 Weight Watchers overhauled its POINTS system and replaced it with PointsPlus (ProPoints outside the U.S.); under the new system, fruits and non-starchy vegetables were zero points, and processed foods had higher points than they did before.

From 2012 to 2015, although it had its own app and e-tools since 2009, the company faced stiff competition from free smartphone fitness apps, many of which included a social-media group-support system, and from wearable fitness monitors such as Fitbit.

===2014–2018===
In April of 2014, Tech Crunch leaked Weight Watchers was in talks to acquire virtual fitness training startup Wello. Weight Watchers confirmed the acquisition the following month, which spurred a series of acquisitions in the digital therapeutics space. One year later, in April and May of 2015, Weight Watchers also acquired 5 minute fitness app Hot 5 and the online community and &quot;selfie startup&quot; Weilos. Features of Weilos would later be relaunched as Weight Watcher&#x27;s Connect product, an online community in-app and on the web.

In October 2015, Oprah Winfrey partnered with Weight Watchers. Winfrey bought a 10% stake in the company, became its spokesperson, joined its board of directors, and lost weight on the program, plus she helped launch a new holistic lifestyle and fitness program called &quot;Beyond the Scale&quot;. The late-2015 Oprah effect did not prevent a subsequent downward trend in 2016, largely attributed to challenges from Nutrisystem and the proliferation of free apps and websites aimed at helping people manage their weight, but linked also by some, to a faulty initial tech rollout of the new program&#x27;s app. CEO James Chambers resigned on September 30, 2016. He was replaced as CEO in July 2017 by Mindy Grossman, who had played a role in growing digital sales revenue for HSN.

In December 2017, the company introduced WW Freestyle (called WW Flex outside the U.S.), which allows people to carry over unused &quot;SmartPoints&quot; through the week, and lists more than 200 zero-points foods, including various lean proteins, that do not need to be tracked. In February 2018 CEO Grossman announced a new direction and purpose for the company: to move beyond mere dieting to being a &quot;partner in health and wellness&quot; and inspiring healthy habits for real life. Subscriptions to Weight Watchers rebounded significantly by mid 2018, credited to Winfrey&#x27;s influence and to Grossman&#x27;s tri-fold efforts of revamping the program, improving tech offerings, and giving the company a more broad-based appeal.

In August 2018, the company acquired Kurbo, Inc, rebranding the free mobile app directed at children and teenagers as &quot;Kurbo by WW&quot;.

In September 2018, the company re-branded itself WW International, Inc., as it shifted its focus more broadly to overall health and wellness, including fitness. It adopted a new tagline, &quot;Wellness that Works&quot;. The company stopped requiring users to have a weight loss goal in order to join and renamed its in-person meetings to Wellness Workshops. WW&#x27;s app was relaunched with features to track other health-related goals. Its FitPoints system has been marketed as allowing individuals to choose activities which have the biggest impact on their health. At that time the company also began a partnership with the meditation app Headspace to offer customized mindfulness content for members.

As part of the rebrand, WW introduced a new program, WellnessWins, that rewarded members for behaviors that encourage healthier habits, which were redeemable for products, services, and experiences. The company also announced Connect, a digital community, which would include micro-community Groups.

==Business model==
Weight Watchers&#x27; business model is one of a subscription-based program of support, plus a variety of purchasable products, media, services, and technologies. Its brand identity has been framed around Weight Watchers being a community, and its website is intrinsic to its effectiveness. Particularly in the 21st century, the company has increasingly marketed itself as a health and wellness brand rather than a weight-loss brand, and its dietary plans emphasize fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and foods high in whole grains and low in trans fats. Also in the 21st century, the company has increasingly tried to effectively and competitively balance its digital and offline offerings. As of 2019, the program offered weight-loss support via the app and website, in-person workshops and personal coaching.

===Products and services===
Weight Watchers&#x27; primary sources of income are subscriptions to the program.

The company provides a weight-management program (myWW+) and a food plan (SmartPoints); customers can participate in the program via in-person group meetings and/or digitally, and are provided with individualized information, support, and coaching.

It also receives income from Weight Watchers–branded services and products, which include publications such as &quot;Weight Watchers&quot; magazines, Weight Watchers cookbooks, and food guides and restaurant guides with points values. It sells its own bars and snacks, and licenses the Weight Watchers trademark to a variety of prepared foods, beverages, and other products and services.

===Weight-loss plans and formats===
The original Weight Watchers dietary plan in the 1960s was roughly based on the &quot;Prudent Diet&quot;, developed by Dr. Norman Jolliffe at the New York City Board of Health. It was based around lean meat, fish, skim milk, and fruits and vegetables, and it banned alcohol, sweets, and fatty foods. It had lists of allowed and prohibited foods, and was more structured than subsequent versions of the Weight Watchers program. It recommended weighing food portions, and prohibited skipping meals or counting calories.

The company has regularly changed and updated its diet plans and formats, to reflect current nutritional and obesity science and to accommodate consumer awareness and demand.

*In 1979 Weight Watchers introduced PepStep (or Personal Exercise Plan), a walking or stair-climbing exercise program to benefit members&#x27; weight loss, developed by a doctor specializing in exercise and cardiac rehabilitation. With this additional element Weight Watchers became one of the first weight-loss companies, along with the Pritikin program, to promote the importance of regular exercise.
*By 1980, the company expanded its dietary plan to allow for substitutions and more flexibility. It introduced three routines: a &quot;full choice&quot; plan with the most options; a &quot;limited choice&quot; plan with fewer options and less leeway; and a &quot;no choice&quot; plan with no substitutions and no options, which was the most calorie-restrictive and was to be followed for no more than two weeks.
*In 1984 the company added Quick Start, which was a more spartan, temporary eating plan designed to produce faster, motivation-boosting weight loss in the first few weeks of the program. It was the company&#x27;s first exchange-based diet, where foods within categories could be exchanged for each other. This was expanded in 1986 to Quick Start Plus, with higher-fat options and Personal Choice options.
* In 1984 Weight Watchers also launched its At Work program, held for groups of 15 or more in office places, for people who were otherwise unable to attend community meetings. The meetings are held either before work, during the lunch break, or after work, and the fees are usually subsidized by the employer.
*In 1988, Weight Watchers launched the Quick Success program, a plan that was easier and more flexible, particularly for working women. It also allowed for a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, and increased the minimum daily vegetable intake from two to three.
* In 1997 Weight Watchers completely replaced its exchange-based diets with the POINTS system (also originally called 1-2-3 Success), a proprietary algorithmic formula which quantifies a food portion for the purposes of healthy weight loss based on carbohydrates, fat, and fiber content.
*In 2000 the company rolled out Winning Points, a more personalized version of the POINTS system, which encompassed self-observation, behavior modification, and fitness and activity, and which did not have any food exclusions.
*In 2004, Weight Watchers launched the Turn Around program, which gave people two plans to choose from, and aimed to teach participants how to eat normal food, in sensible portions, and to increase their exercise. The Flex Plan option allowed dieters to eat anything they wanted as long as they stayed within their points allowance; activity points could be earned by exercise. The Core Plan option (later known as &quot;Simply Filling&quot;) dispensed with points entirely and included a list of foods that could be eaten &quot;until satisfied&quot;, and a list of foods to be avoided.
*In December 2008, Weight Watchers eliminated the Core Plan and introduced the Momentum Plan, designed to help members understand how consuming certain filling foods helped them to eat less and prevent overeating.
*In late 2010 Weight Watchers overhauled its POINTS system and replaced it with PointsPlus (ProPoints outside the U.S.); under the new system, fruits and non-starchy vegetables are zero points, and processed foods have higher points than they did before.
* In December 2012 the company rolled out Weight Watchers 360, which did not change its PointsPlus plan but added behavioral modification and support, mindfulness, control of and planning for one&#x27;s eating environment, and new apps, and also added an optional wearable fitness monitor to purchase called ActiveLink.
*In September 2014, Weight Watchers began syncing its apps with wearable fitness monitors such as Fitbit and Jawbone, so that the activity of members who own those devices is instantly uploaded and tracked and converted to points.
*In December 2014, Weight Watchers launched two new services: Personal Coaching and 24/7 Expert Chat. Personal Coaching provides individuals with a Weight Watchers-certified coach who helps them develop an individualized weight management plan and is available via phone, text, and email for subsequent consultations. 24/7 Expert Chat allows members all-hours access to Weight Watchers-certified coaches who can offer instant advice when users encounter weight-loss or dieting crises.
*In December 2015 the company rolled out a new holistic lifestyle and fitness program called &quot;Beyond the Scale&quot;. The program uses SmartPoints, an updating of the points system which takes into consideration the nutritional value of a food, and helps steer people away from junk foods, sugar, and saturated fat. That same month, the company launched Connect, a social-media platform via its app where members receive support from other members.
*In December 2017, Weight Watchers introduced WW Freestyle (called WW Flex outside the U.S.), which allows people to carry over unused points through the week, and lists more than 200 zero-points foods, including various lean proteins, that do not need to be tracked.
*In November 2021, WW introduced a new program called PersonalPoints which now uses AI to adjust your points and zero-point food list based on individual preferences. In addition, extra points can now be earned for drinking at least 60 fl oz of water daily and for every cup of non-starchy vegetables.

==Reception==
As of July 2018, Weight Watchers was the most widely used commercial diet in the world. In addition to the U.S., as of 2018 it had operations in countries including Canada, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil. Its main long-term competitors in the commercial weight-loss company genre are Jenny Craig and Nutrisystem. Weight Watchers has been included in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s rankings for 40 most popular diets and has also been listed as No.1 for weight loss and best commercial diets.

For Weight Watchers customers who choose to attend meetings, in addition to supplying information and lifestyle tips, meetings operate as support groups that provide empathy, rapport, and mutual understanding, as well as positive reinforcement.

Some therapists have said that focusing on counting calories or points, as promoted by WW, can lead to a disordered relationship with food and hunger. Previously the company&#x27;s prepared foods had been criticized as containing preservatives and other additives; as of late 2018 Weight Watchers has removed all artificial sweeteners, flavors, colors, and preservatives from products carrying the company&#x27;s name, and dropped or reformulated most of the food products it once produced.

In August 2019, WW released &quot;Kurbo by WW&quot;, a weight management and health app directed at children and teenagers. It has been criticized by some experts on nutrition and eating disorders for encouraging dieting in children as young as 8. Christy Harrison, a registered dietician, wrote in &quot;the New York Times&quot;, &quot;programs like this are fertile ground for disordered eating&quot; and that efforts to lose weight &quot;are especially troubling when imposed on children who aren&#x27;t in a position to make their own choices and who haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to develop a peaceful relationship with food and their bodies.&quot; However, an article in the journal &quot;Childhood Obesity&quot; concluded that it could be &quot;part of the piece of the puzzle to improving health in youth&quot;, despite the authors&#x27; concerns with the marketing of the app emphasizing weight loss. An uncontrolled three-month study of the app used by children between 8 and 17 said that it was &quot;highly effective&quot; based on an average reduction in of 0.26, and a survey of weight management apps published in JMIR mHealth and noted that of their list, only Kurbo involved health care professionals in its development.

As a result of the release of &quot;Kurbo by WW&quot;, WW&#x27;s corporate headquarters in New York City were protested on September 13, 2019, and as of September 2019 a change.org petition asking Weight Watchers to &quot;remove your weight loss app for kids&quot; had over 110,000 signatures.

<doc id="594480" wikidata="Q4743993" url="?curid=594480" title="American High (TV series)">
<text>American High is an American documentary television show about the lives of fourteen students at Highland Park High School, located in the city of Highland Park, Illinois. The series originally aired on Fox and was canceled after four episodes. It was later picked up by PBS and aired in its entirety. The series was created by R. J. Cutler, a documentary filmmaker. The show received the 2001 Emmy Award for Outstanding Non-Fiction Program.

The theme song &quot;American High (Now It&#x27;s Everything)&quot;, was written and performed by Bouncing Souls.

An earlier Fox Network documentary series from 1991, &quot;Yearbook&quot; also covered the lives of suburban Chicago high school students.

==Plot==
Kaytee&#x27;s gift for song steers an inner turmoil about her future. Morgan&#x27;s sullen and needy exterior masks his true compassion. After revealing his deepest secret to his peers, what&#x27;s next for Brad? Who are they? These are real teenagers who unleash their adolescent anxieties amid their triumphs in American High. At the brink of adulthood, they face some of the toughest decisions and harshest realizations of their lives during the 1999-2000 school year at a suburban Chicago high school. But these kids aren’t actors. The situations aren’t contrived. The programs are not scripted. Cameras roll and the ensuing drama is riveting and real.

American High is an innovative drama series from Academy Award-nominated filmmaker R.J. Cutler (&quot;The War Room,&quot; &quot;The Perfect Candidate&quot;). Following the lives of a group of students as they deal with their personal conflicts – both at home and at school – from the first day of senior year through graduation, the series is culled from 10 months of documentary footage shot by Cutler and his production team, which includes some of America&#x27;s leading documentary filmmakers. Also featured in the series are scenes from hundreds of hours of &quot;video diaries&quot; shot by the students themselves. This remarkable combination of professional footage and student-shot video provides a window into what it&#x27;s like to be a teenager growing up in America today.

Brimming with exuberance, hipness and stylish editing, American High boasts authenticity as well as addictive drama. &quot;They trusted our crews to tell their stories truthfully and honestly,&quot; says producer Cutler of the students. &quot;I wanted this to be as honest as any of the best cinéma vérité documentaries.&quot; And Cutler has succeeded, with scenes that are often brutally frank. The footage from the students’ own video diaries is among the most fascinating.

These scenes capture an eclectic mix of characters baring their souls as they confront conflicts with powerful emotions. Precocious Kaytee, the gifted singer/songwriter whose music fills the hallways at school and creates decision-making dilemmas for her. Easygoing and athletic Robby, whose best friend is Brad – the first high-profile kid to announce his homosexuality, confronts the future of his shaky relationship with Sarah. Anna, whose intimidating beauty affords her everything except what she really wants – a boyfriend. Mike (&quot;Kiwi&quot;), the star football kicker whose future hinges on a successful season. One of the series’ most dynamic characters, rebellious Morgan, comes across as angry and needy, masking a compassionate and sensitive nature. Half a dozen other students reveal complex natures and share their innermost feelings.

<doc id="594481" wikidata="Q11263" url="?curid=594481" title="Cadaqués">
<text>Cadaqués (; ) is a town in the Alt Empordà &quot;comarca&quot;, in the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. It is on a bay in the middle of the Cap de Creus peninsula, near Cap de Creus cape, on the Costa Brava of the Mediterranean. It is a two-and-a-quarter-hour drive from Barcelona, and thus it is accessible not only to tourists but also to people who want a second home for weekends and summers. In 2018, Cadaqués had an official population of 2,752, but up to ten times as many people can live in the town during the peak of the summer tourism season.

Cadaqués has a special place in art history. Commanding charcoals, by local artist Eliseu Meifrèn, of the 19th century Cadaqués beleaguered by a winter tramontane, can be seen at the Cadaqués museum. Fren was the first modern artist to live in Cadaqués and gave the town many of his works and a marble top table on which he sketched many of its turn-of-the-century fishermen.

Salvador Dalí often visited Cadaqués in his childhood, and later kept a home in Port Lligat, a small village on a bay next to the town. A summer holiday here in 1916, spent with the family of Ramon Pichot is seen as especially important to Dalí&#x27;s artistic career. Other notable artists, including Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, Marcel Duchamp, Richard Hamilton, Albert Ràfols-Casamada, Antoni Pitxot, Henri-François Rey, Melina Mercouri and Maurice Boitel also spent time here. Cadaqués is mentioned in the story &quot;Tramontana&quot; by Gabriel García Márquez.

The interesting submarine life of this sleepy fishing village was studied for several years by phycologist Françoise Ardré, long before Cadaqués was discovered and transformed into a tourism destination. On Mondays there is a travelling market in Cadaqués, located near the parking lot. This market has a wide variety of products.

A Jewish community once existed in the medieval period, and the old Jewish quarter in Cadaqués can still be visited today.
== Name ==
Cadaqués is a phonetic spelling of the contraction of Catalan (Cape of Rocks). In medieval documents, both Cadaqués and Cadaquers spellings coexisted together.

== History ==
=== Relationship with Cuba ===


In the early 20th century a large number of inhabitants of Cadaqués travelled or emigrated to Cuba (the figure has been estimated as one third of a village of approximately 1200 people). Many of these immigrants were financially successful in Cuba and returned to Cadaqués where they constructed large and ornate houses. These houses can still be seen in the town (for example; the &quot;Casa Blava&quot;, &quot;Blue House&quot; in English). A person returned from Cuba was referred to as an &quot;Americano&quot; among other names.

=== Traditions ===
Women of the village traditionally fetched water using a glazed earthenware jug called a &quot;doll&quot;. The colour of the glazing was green. Similar earthenware can still be seen used as decorations. A number of photos exist showing women carrying these &quot;dolls&quot; on their heads (covered with a protective cloth).

Owing to Cadaqués&#x27;s proximity to the French border and its isolation by land, the village had a tradition of running contraband. See the writings of Josep Pla.

== Language ==

Even though people speak Spanish the village of Cadaqués has its own variant or dialect of the Catalan language. One of the most notable features is that the definite articles are different from standard Catalan, namely, they are &quot;sa&quot; (feminine) and &quot;es&quot; (masculine) instead of the normal Catalan definite articles &quot;la&quot; and &quot;el&quot;. This feature is shared with the variant of Catalan spoken in the Balearic Islands. The explanation for this (see &quot;El Vocabulari de Cadaqués&quot;, Ernesta Sala i Bruses) is that when the Catalan ruler Jaume I conquered the Balearic Islands in the Middle Ages he re-colonized the islands with people from the Empordà region of Catalonia. Because Cadaqués has remained relatively isolated from the surrounding region (owing to its geography), the mediaeval speech patterns have been preserved.

Another aspect of the speech variant of Cadaqués is the alteration of the first person singular of certain verbs: conjugations that normally end in &quot;o&quot; end in &quot;i&quot; in the Cadaqués variant. For example, &quot;a vegades agafi molt per Cala Nans&quot; (informant was an approximately 90-year-old fisherman). In standard Catalan this would be &quot;a vegades agafo molt per Cala Nans&quot; (meaning: sometimes I catch a lot at Cala Nans) The speech variant of Catalan has most similarities with the Catalan spoken in Ibiza (Balearic Islands).

The Catalan variant of Cadaqués is referred to as &quot;cadaquesenc&quot; by the local people and also has many lexical items.
Examples include:
* &quot;rastell&quot;: a street (normally with a steep slope) which is formed with pieces of slate stone placed in a vertical position. These types of streets are very characteristic of the streets of Cadaqués.
* &quot;grop&quot;: a black rain cloud
* &quot;llagut&quot;: a small boat
* &quot;talaia&quot;: an elevated castle or look-out which could warn the village of danger or transmit other signals (example: approaching ships) – compare with the &quot;talaiots&quot; of Menorca.
* &quot;xarxi&quot;: a (fishing) net, as opposed to &quot;xarxa&quot; in standard Catalan
* &quot; Norai&quot;: a stone cylindrical building with a large stone on the top that fishermen used to attach their boats.

== Tourism ==
=== Main sights ===
* Salvador Dalí House-Museum
* Church of St. Mary (late-17th century) is the church that most stands out in the views of the town.
* Hermitage of Sant Sebastià, a large house located high on Pení Mountain behind Cadaqués. It is a private residence not open to the public. The hermitage is surrounded by cork trees, and is built on a steep slope.
* Natural Park of Cap de Creus and the lighthouse located at the most easterly point on the mainland of Spain and the Iberian peninsula.

=== Hiking ===
The GR 92 long distance footpath, which roughly follows the length of the Mediterranean coast of Spain, has a staging point at Cadaqués. Stage 2 links northwards to Llançà, a distance of , whilst stage 3 links southwards to Roses, Girona, a distance of .

== Geology ==

Cadaqués and the surrounding peninsula known as the Cap de Creus owes its beauty in part to its complex geology. The rocks here were pushed up when the Pyrenees were formed, and are mostly metamorphic schists which turn a golden colour in the Mediterranean sun.

Add to that the weather: this is one of the wildest spots on the Costa Brava in the winter (Costa Brava means &quot;wild coast&quot;), so the migmatites and schists are battered and eroded by the Tramuntana wind which whips off the mountains and by a sea that appears as if it is boiling in the force 8 winds.

The Cadaqués migmatites formed under extreme pressure and temperatures: a partial melt. They are halfway between an igneous and metamorphic rock. The area also contains a lot of schist: a medium grade metamorphic rock that has been flattened into sheets. White blocks of pegmatite mark where molten rock was squeezed through the older metamorphics at the end of the orogeny or mountain building.

The geological history has been exposed by erosion from wind and sea, and many geologists have mapped the area for this reason.

== Chinese replica ==
In 2010, a Chinese developer, China Merchants Zhangzhou, announced its intention to build a near-exact copy of Cadaqués on more than of land on Xiamen Bay in China. The replica village is projected to house some 15,000 Chinese holidaymakers. Building is reported to begin in September or October 2010.
In 2017, the housing development Kadakaisi was still in construction.

<text>Meno (; , &quot;Ménōn&quot;) is a Socratic dialogue written by Plato around 385 BC., but set at an earlier date around 402 BC. Meno begins the dialogue by asking Socrates whether virtue (in , &quot;aretē&quot;) can be taught, acquired by practice, or comes by nature. In order to determine whether virtue is teachable or not, Socrates tells Meno that they first need to determine what virtue is. When the characters speak of virtue, or &quot;aretē&quot;, they refer to virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work showcases Socratic dialectical style; Meno, unable to adequately define virtue, is reduced to confusion or aporia. Socrates suggests that they seek an adequate definition for virtue together. In response, Meno suggests that it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it. 

Socrates challenges Meno&#x27;s argument, often called &quot;Meno&#x27;s Paradox&quot;, &quot;Learner&#x27;s Paradox&quot;, or the &quot;Arabic Paradox&quot;, by introducing the theory of knowledge as recollection (&quot;anamnesis&quot;). As presented in the dialogue, the theory proposes that souls are immortal and know all things in a disembodied state; learning in the embodied is actually a process of recollecting that which the soul knew before it came into a body. Socrates demonstrates recollection in action by posing a mathematical puzzle to one of Meno&#x27;s slaves. Subsequently, Socrates and Meno return to the question of whether virtue is teachable, employing the method of hypothesis. Near the end of the dialogue, Meno poses another famous puzzle, called &quot;the Meno problem&quot; or &quot;the Value Problem for Knowledge&quot;, which questions why knowledge is valued more highly than true belief. In response, Socrates provides a famous and somewhat enigmatic distinction between knowledge and true belief.

==Characters==
Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot; is a Socratic dialogue in which the two main speakers, Socrates and Meno (also transliterated as &quot;Menon&quot;), discuss human virtue: what it is, and whether or not it can be taught. Meno is visiting Athens from Thessaly with a large entourage of slaves attending him. Young, good-looking and well-born, he is a student of Gorgias, a prominent sophist whose views on virtue clearly influence that of Meno&#x27;s. Early in the dialogue, Meno claims that he has held forth many times on the subject of virtue, and in front of large audiences.

One of Meno&#x27;s slaves also has a speaking role, as one of the features of the dialogue is Socrates&#x27; engagement with the slave to demonstrate his idea of &quot;anamnesis&quot;: certain knowledge is innate and &quot;recollected&quot; by the soul through proper inquiry.

Another participant later in the dialogue is Athenian politician Anytus, later one of the prosecutors of Socrates, with whom Meno is friendly.

==Dialogue==
===Introduction of virtue===
The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates to tell him whether virtue can be taught. Socrates says that he does not know what virtue is, and neither does anyone else he knows. Meno responds that, according to Gorgias, his Sophist mentor, virtue means different for different people, that what is virtuous for a man is to conduct himself in the city so that he helps his friends, injures his enemies, and takes care all the while that he personally comes to no harm. Virtue is different for a woman, he says. Her domain is the management of the household, and she is supposed to obey her husband. He says that children (male and female) have their own proper virtue, and so do old men—free or slaves. Socrates objects: there must be some virtue common to all human beings.

Socrates rejects the idea that human virtue depends on a person&#x27;s sex or age. He leads Meno towards the idea that virtues are common to all people, that &quot;sophrosunê&quot; (&#x27;temperance&#x27;, i.e. exercise of self-control) and &quot;dikê&quot; (aka &quot;dikaiosunê&quot;; &#x27;justice&#x27;, i.e. refrain from harming others) are virtues even in children and old men. Meno proposes to Socrates that the &quot;capacity to govern men&quot; may be a virtue common to all people. Socrates points out to the slaveholder that &quot;governing well&quot; cannot be a virtue of a slave, because then he would not be a slave.

One of the errors that Socrates points out is that Meno lists many particular virtues without defining a common feature inherent to virtues which makes them thus. Socrates remarks that Meno makes many out of one, like somebody who breaks a plate.

Meno proposes that virtue is the desire for good things and the power to get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not recognize evil. The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for the fact that so many people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.

No satisfactory definition of virtue emerges in the &quot;Meno&quot;. Socrates&#x27; comments, however, show that he considers a successful definition to be unitary, rather than a list of varieties of virtue, that it must contain all and only those terms which are genuine instances of virtue, and must not be circular.

===Meno&#x27;s paradox===
Meno asks Socrates:And how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you do not know? What will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? And if you find what you want, how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did not know?Socrates rephrases the question, which has come to be the canonical statement of Meno&#x27;s paradox or the paradox of inquiry:
===Dialogue with Meno&#x27;s slave===

Socrates responds to this sophistical paradox with a &quot;mythos&quot; (&#x27;narrative&#x27; or &#x27;fiction&#x27;) according to which souls are immortal and have learned everything prior to transmigrating into the human body. Since the soul has had contact with real things prior to birth, we have only to &#x27;recollect&#x27; them when alive. Such recollection requires Socratic questioning, which according to Socrates is not teaching. Socrates demonstrates his method of questioning and recollection by interrogating a slave who is ignorant of geometry.

Socrates begins one of the most influential dialogues of Western philosophy regarding the argument for inborn knowledge. By drawing geometric figures in the ground Socrates demonstrates that the slave is initially unaware of the length that a side must be in order to double the area of a square with 2-foot sides. The slave guesses first that the original side must be doubled in length (4 feet), and when this proves too much, that it must be 3 feet. This is still too much, and the slave is at a loss.

Socrates claims that before he got hold of him the slave (who has been picked at random from Meno&#x27;s entourage) might have thought he could speak &quot;well and fluently&quot; on the subject of a square double the size of a given square. Socrates comments that this &quot;numbing&quot; he caused in the slave has done him no harm and has even benefited him.
Socrates then adds three more squares to the original square, to form a larger square four times the size. He draws four diagonal lines which bisect each of the smaller squares. Through questioning, Socrates leads the slave to the discovery that the square formed by these diagonals has an area of eight square feet, double that of the original. He says that the slave has &quot;spontaneously recovered&quot; knowledge which he knew from a past life, without having been taught. Socrates is satisfied that new beliefs were &quot;newly aroused&quot; in the slave.

After witnessing the example with the slave boy, Meno tells Socrates that he thinks that Socrates is correct in his theory of recollection, to which Socrates agrees:

===Anytus===
Meno now beseeches Socrates to return to the original question, how virtue is acquired, and in particular, whether or not it is acquired by teaching or through life experience. Socrates proceeds on the hypothesis that virtue is knowledge, and it is quickly agreed that, if this is true, virtue is teachable. They turn to the question of whether virtue is indeed knowledge. Socrates is hesitant, because, if virtue were knowledge, there should be teachers and learners of it, but there are none.

Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises as the son of Anthemion, who earned his fortune with intelligence and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is that men do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates&#x27; accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.

===True belief and knowledge===
After the discussion with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno for his own thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests that they have made a mistake in agreeing that knowledge is required for virtue. He points out the similarities and differences between &quot;true belief&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot;. True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to &quot;stay in their place&quot; and must be &quot;tethered&quot; by what he calls &quot;aitias&quot; (&#x27;calculation of reason&#x27; or &#x27;reasoned explanation&#x27;), immediately adding that this is &quot;anamnesis&quot;, or recollection.

Whether Plato intends that the tethering of true beliefs with reasoned explanations must always involve &quot;anamnesis&quot; is explored in later interpretations of the text. Socrates&#x27; distinction between &quot;true belief&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as &quot;justified true belief&quot;. Myles Burnyeat and others, however, have argued that the phrase &quot;aitias logismos&quot; refers to a practical working out of a solution, rather than a justification.

Socrates concludes that, in the virtuous people of the present and the past, at least, virtue has been the result of divine inspiration, akin to the inspiration of the poets, whereas a knowledge of it will require answering the basic question, &quot;what is virtue?&quot;. In most modern readings these closing remarks are &quot;evidently ironic&quot;, but Socrates&#x27; invocation of the gods may be sincere, albeit &quot;highly tentative&quot;.

This passage in the Meno is often seen as the first statement of the problem of the value of knowledge or &quot;the Meno problem&quot;: &quot;how is knowledge more valuable than mere true belief?&quot; The nature of knowledge and belief is also discussed in the &quot;Thaetetus&quot;.

==Meno and Protagoras==
&quot;Meno&quot; theme is also dealt with in the dialogue &quot;Protagoras&quot;, where Plato ultimately has Socrates arrive at the opposite conclusion: virtue &quot;can&quot; be taught. Likewise, while in &quot;Protagoras&quot; knowledge is uncompromisingly this-worldly, in &quot;Meno&quot; the theory of recollection points to a link between knowledge and eternal truths.

<doc id="594488" wikidata="Q466436" url="?curid=594488" title="Shattered Glass (film)">
<text>Shattered Glass is a 2003 biographical drama film about journalist Stephen Glass and his scandal at &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Written and directed by Billy Ray in his feature directorial debut, the film is based on a 1998 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article of the same name by H. G. Bissinger and chronicles Glass&#x27; fall from grace when his stories were discovered to be fabricated. It stars Hayden Christensen as Glass, alongside Peter Sarsgaard, Chloë Sevigny, and Steve Zahn.

The film premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2003, and received a North American limited release on November 26, 2003. Although a commercial failure, &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; received acclaim from critics, with particular praise for Christensen and Sarsgaard&#x27;s performances.

==Plot==
In 1998, Stephen Glass is an associate editor at &quot;The New Republic&quot;. The youngest and least experienced of the magazine&#x27;s staff, Glass enjoys popularity with his colleagues for his entertaining stories. Glass serves under editor Michael Kelly, who holds loyalty with the writers. However, conflict between Kelly and publisher Marty Peretz results in Peretz firing Kelly. Reporter Charles Lane is promoted by Peretz to replace Kelly, despite being disliked by the staff due to his cold reputation.

Glass writes a story entitled &quot;Hack Heaven&quot; that details a teenage hacker being hired by a large software firm he infiltrated. The story reaches Forbes Digital Tool, where reporter Adam Penenberg finds no corroborating evidence for what Glass described. When contacted by Penenberg about being unable to reach the individuals in his story, Glass provides a number with a Palo Alto area code for the firm that, when dialed, goes immediately to voicemail. Later in the day, Lane receives a brief call from an individual identifying as the firm&#x27;s chairman. Glass and Lane also partake in a conference call with the Forbes staff, which further erodes the story&#x27;s credibility and prompts Glass to claim he was tricked by his sources.

Lane, looking to protect Glass from the Forbes staff, has Glass take him to the convention center where the story took place, but learns that it was closed during the events Glass wrote about. He also finds that the restaurant where the hackers supposedly had dinner afterwards closes in the mid-afternoon. With the story contradicted by this information, Glass tells Lane he only relied on sources for information and falsified his first-hand experiences to improve the story. Lane decides to suspend Glass instead of firing him due to his popularity, but upon discovering Glass&#x27;s brother lives in Palo Alto, he realizes Glass had his brother pose as the firm&#x27;s chairman. After confronting Glass with this knowledge, Lane re-reads Glass&#x27;s previous stories and comes to the realization several were also falsified. With his deception exposed, Glass is fired by Lane.

Despite initial pushback, Lane receives support from &quot;The New Republic&quot; staff for bringing Glass&#x27;s deception to light, while the magazine&#x27;s attorney questions Glass over which stories of his were fabricated. Closing titles reveal Penenberg&#x27;s article on Glass was hailed as a breakthrough for internet journalism, &quot;The New Republic&quot; determined 27 of Glass&#x27;s 41 stories were either partially or completely fabricated, Kelly was killed while covering the Iraq War, Glass earned a Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown and wrote a novel paralleling his own life, and Lane joined &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

==Cast==
Caroline Goodall portrays Highland Park High School teacher Mrs. Duke in the classroom sequences imagined by Glass. Louis Philippe Dandenault, Morgan Kelly, Christian Tessier, James Berlingieri, and Brett Watson appear as the Young Republicans described in one of Glass&#x27;s stories. In Glass&#x27;s depiction of &quot;Hack Heaven&quot;, Owen Roth plays Ian Restil, Bill Rowat plays George Sims, Michele Scarabelli plays Ian&#x27;s mother, and Terry Simpson plays Joe Hiert. Alec Shumpert, a fictional associate editor at &quot;George&quot;, is played by Andrew Airlie. Phillip Cole plays the security guard at the convention center, Mark Camacho appears as Glass&#x27;s attorney and Lynne Adams appears as a companion of Kelly. Making uncredited appearances are Sean Cullen as &quot;The New Republic&quot;&#x27;s attorney and the film&#x27;s editor Jeffrey Ford as the voice of a security guard at the magazine&#x27;s office.

==Production==
Producer Craig Baumgarten, working with HBO executive Gaye Hirsch, optioned H.G. Bissinger&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine article about Stephen Glass for an HBO original movie. They hired screenwriter Billy Ray based on the script he had written for the TNT film &quot;Legalese&quot;. Ray grew up with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as his heroes and studied journalism for a year. It was this love for journalism that motivated him to make &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;.

A sudden change in management put the film into turnaround and it remained inactive for two years until Cruise/Wagner Productions bought it from HBO. They took it to Lionsgate and Ray asked the studio if he could direct in addition to writing it. The challenge for Ray was to make the subject matter watchable because, according to the filmmaker, &quot;watching people write is deadly dull ... in a film like this, dialogue is what a character is willing to reveal about himself, and the camera is there to capture everything else&quot;. The breakthrough for Ray came when he realized that the film&#x27;s real protagonist was not Glass but Chuck Lane. According to Ray, &quot;as fascinating as Stephen Glass is by the end of the movie people would want to kill themselves – you just can&#x27;t follow him all the way&quot;. He used the Bissinger article as a starting point, which gave him a line of dialogue on which to hook the entire character of Glass: &quot;Are you mad at me?&quot; According to Ray, &quot;you can build an entire character around that notion, and we did&quot;.

The character of Caitlin Avey is an amalgamation of Glass&#x27;s friends and &quot;The New Republic&quot; allies Hanna Rosin and Jonathan Chait.

To prepare for the film, Ray interviewed and re-interviewed key figures for any relevant details. He signed some of them as paid consultants and gave several approval over the script. Early on, he spent a considerable amount of time trying to earn the trust of the people who had worked with Glass and get them to understand that he was going to be objective with the subject matter. The real Michael Kelly was so unhappy about how he was portrayed in Bissinger&#x27;s article that he threatened to sue when Ray first contacted him about the film and refused for two years to read Ray&#x27;s script, which he eventually approved. Ray attempted to contact Glass through his lawyers but was unsuccessful. Lionsgate lawyers asked Ray to give them an annotated script where he had to footnote every line of dialogue and every assertion and back them up with corresponding notes.

The night before principal photography began in Montreal, Ray screened &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; for the cast and crew. He shot both halves of the film differently – in the first half, he used hand-held cameras in the scenes that took place in the offices of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, but when the &quot;Forbes&quot; editors begin to question Glass, the camerawork was more stable.

Ray&#x27;s original cut of the film was a much more straightforward account of events, but he became dissatisfied while editing the film and raised additional funds to shoot the high school scenes that bookend the film.

On April 3, 2003, a little more than six months before the film was released, Michael Kelly was killed while reporting on the invasion of Iraq. The film is dedicated to his memory.

==Release==
&quot;Shattered Glass&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Telluride Film Festival, the Boston Film Festival, the Woodstock Film Festival, the Mill Valley Film Festival, and the Austin Film Festival before opening on eight screens in New York City and Los Angeles on October 31, 2003. It grossed $77,540 on its opening weekend. It eventually earned $2,220,008 in North America and $724,744 in other markets for a total worldwide box office of $2,944,752.

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 92% rating, based on 168 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A compelling look at Stephen Glass&#x27; fall from grace.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 38 critics.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as: Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four and felt the film was well-cast and &quot;deserves comparison with &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; among movies about journalism&quot;. In a dissenting review from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, J. Hoberman dismissed the film as &quot;self-important yet insipid&quot; and asks, &quot;&quot;Shattered Glass&quot; begs a larger question: What sort of culture elevates Glass for his entertainment value, punishes him for being too entertaining, rewards his notoriety, and then resurrects him again as a moral object lesson?&quot;

Sarsgaard&#x27;s performance as Charles Lane was singled out by several critics for praise. &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four and wrote of him: &quot;Sarsgaard deserves more credit than he&#x27;ll probably get for his multi-layered performance&quot;. &quot;Premiere&quot;″s Glenn Kenny wrote, &quot;it&#x27;s Peter Sarsgaard, as the editor who serves Glass his , who walks away with the picture, metamorphosing his character&#x27;s stiffness into a moral indignation that&#x27;s jolting and, finally, invigorating&quot;. His performance ended up winning numerous awards, including &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; citations from the Boston Society of Film Critics, Kansas City Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics, Online Film Critics Society, San Francisco Film Critics Circle, and the Toronto Film Critics Association, as well as nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards and the Golden Globes. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; placed his portrayal of Chuck Lane at number six on a list of the best performances of the decade.

Stephen Glass saw the film and, when reflecting about the experience, he said, &quot;It was very painful for me. It was like being on a guided tour of the moments of my life I am most ashamed of&quot;.

<text>Mellon Financial Corporation was an American investment firm which was once one of the world&#x27;s largest money management firms. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it was in the business of institutional and high-net-worth individual asset management, including the Dreyfus family of mutual funds, business banking, and shareholder and investor services. On December 4, 2006, it announced a merger agreement with Bank of New York, to form BNY. After regulatory and shareholder approval, the banks completed the merger on July 2, 2007.

== History ==
Mellon was opened in January 1870 by Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew Mellon and Richard B. Mellon, as T. Mellon &amp; Sons&#x27; Bank. In 1902, the institution became Mellon National Bank.

Mellon Bank was an important force in the mass production revolution in the United States, especially in the Midwest. The Mellon family using the bank as a proxy had direct involvement with founding the modern aluminium, oil, consumer electronics and financial industries. Alcoa, Gulf Oil (now Chevron-Texaco), Westinghouse (now CBS Corporation and Siemens) and Rockwell, all were directly founded and managed by the bank. U.S. Steel (the world&#x27;s first billion-dollar corporation), Heinz, General Motors, Koppers and ExxonMobil (as Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil) were born and nurtured by Mellon.

* In 1920, Andrew left his leadership post of the bank to become the longest serving U.S. Treasury Secretary in history (serving under three separate administrations).
* In 1929, Richard founded Mellbank Corporation. In 1946, Mellon National, Mellbank, and the Union Trust Company merged to form Mellon National Bank and Trust Company.
* A reorganization in 1972 brought about a name change to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation.
* In 1983, Mellon bought Girard Bank of Philadelphia and Central Counties Bank of State College, Pennsylvania. The next year, Mellon National Corporation became Mellon Bank Corporation, and purchased Northwest Pennsylvania Corporation of Oil City, Pennsylvania.
* In 1986, Mellon bought Commonwealth National Financial of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It is also reported that Mellon operated the 2nd largest financial computing system in the world.
* In 1991, Mellon bought United Penn Bank of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The next year, Mellon bought 54 branch offices of Philadelphia-based Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, whose parent company had become insolvent. Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, was the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819.
* In 1993, Mellon bought The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The next year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella.
* 1998 saw Mellon&#x27;s purchase of United Bankshares, Inc., of Miami, 1st Business Bank of Los Angeles, and Founders Asset Management.
* In 1999, Martin G. McGuinn became chairman and chief executive officer of Mellon Bank Corporation. Mellon Bank Corporation then became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it sold its retail banking operations to Citizens Financial Group.
* In 2004, Mellon announced it would purchase Safeco Trust Company from Seattle-based Safeco Corporation. The same year, it purchased outstanding shares in London-based Pareto Partners and offered them floor space in Mellon Financial Center (opened earlier in the year).

==Merger with Bank of New York==
In 2006, Mellon announced its plans to merge with Bank of New York. Talks began when Tom Renyi approached Robert Kelly about a possible amalgamation between the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation. The $16.5 billion deal ($ billion today) was announced in December 2006 and finalized on July 1, 2007, with Kelly as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the new company, and Renyi as executive chairman. Per the deal, the new Board of Directors is composed of ten directors appointed by the Bank of New York, and eight by Mellon.

The merger was completed July 1, 2007, as The Bank of New York Mellon. Headquartered in New York, it is the world&#x27;s largest securities servicing firm and one of the world&#x27;s top ten asset managing firms. The new venture launched its brand identity on October 1, 2007.

These two companies, along with State Street, followed essentially the same evolution. All were originally large diversified financial service providers, particularly in the corporate banking space in the regions they were located in. However, competition in the corporate loans and retail banking businesses saw them jettison these operations in favor of what were believed to be more stable, fee based business: asset management (i.e. investment management in the form of mutual funds and other separately managed accounts) and asset servicing (i.e. corporate trust, stock transfer services and depository receipts).

Mellon is a large provider of what are known as controlled disbursement accounts. These are checking accounts in specialized locations which are given early warning by the Federal Reserve as to what checks will be clearing them. Companies can then transfer the exact amount needed to pay those checks, while then investing the unneeded money or using other funds to pay down debt.

==Mellon Bank CEOs==
* Frank R. Denton (1946 – February 8, 1963)
* John A. Mayer (February 8, 1963 – August 1, 1974)
* James H. Higgins (August 1, 1974 – March 1, 1981)
* J. David Barnes (March 1, 1981 – April 13, 1987)
* Frank Cahouet (April 13, 1987 – January 1, 1999)
* Martin G. McGuinn (January 1, 1999 – February 13, 2006)
* Robert E. Kelly (February 13, 2006 – July 1, 2007)

<doc id="594493" wikidata="Q45652" url="?curid=594493" title="Frogstomp">
<text>Frogstomp is the debut studio album by Australian rock band Silverchair. It was released on 27 March 1995, when the band members were only 15 years of age, by record label Murmur. The album features the band&#x27;s most commercially successful single, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, which was first released on the band&#x27;s extended play of the same name six months earlier on 16 September 1994. Music videos were made for the album&#x27;s four singles: &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Pure Massacre&quot;, &quot;Israel&#x27;s Son&quot;, and &quot;Shade&quot;.

==Recording==
According to drummer Ben Gillies and vocalist and guitarist Daniel Johns in 1996, &quot;Frogstomp&quot; was recorded in nine days. Gillies stated the album took &quot;even less days to mix.&quot; Prior to recording &quot;Frogstomp&quot;, Silverchair were previously named Innocent Criminals and consisted of drummer Ben Gillies and vocalist and guitarist Daniel Johns, with bassist Chris Joannou joining shortly after the band formed in 1992. Second guitarist Tobin Finnane was also in the band, though he later left. Demo versions of the songs &quot;Acid Rain&quot;, &quot;Cicada&quot;, &quot;Pure Massacre&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; were recorded by the band at Platinum Sound Studios in early 1994. In December 1995, Johns said about the recording of the demo songs, &quot;It cost about $75. We weren&#x27;t in there for more than an hour.&quot; &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Acid Rain&quot; were re-recorded at Triple J Studios in Sydney, Australia for the release of Silverchair&#x27;s four-track EP &quot;Tomorrow&quot; in September 1994, which also included the songs &quot;Blind&quot; and &quot;Stoned&quot;. Three months after the release of the EP, the band began recording their debut album, &quot;Frogstomp&quot;, during which &quot;Cicada&quot;, &quot;Pure Massacre&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; were re-recorded. The recording sessions for the album began in late December 1994 and ended in mid-January 1995 at Festival Studios in Pyrmont, New South Wales.

In July 2007, when asked about the grunge sound of &quot;Frogstomp&quot; and the band&#x27;s musical influences, Gillies stated &quot;We were definitely influenced by the whole Seattle sound.&quot;

In May 2015, when asked if the record was made live in the studio, Johns said: Yeah, that&#x27;s the thing that I do really like about that album – it sounds exactly like we sounded. There was no big American producer calling the shots behind the desk and telling us to do this, this and this. It was literally this guy, Kevin Shirley, who was a great producer, just saying, &quot;I want it to sound like you guys, but I want it to sound really f—ing loud and I want the guitars really f—ing loud.&quot; So to me, I was like, f—ing yeah! The songwriting might not be genius, but I think sonically, the performances are really good. It&#x27;s really honest; it&#x27;s just three Australian kids thrashing it out in the studio and that&#x27;s exactly how it sounds.

In August 2020, Gillies said the following about the album:We were always searching to keep that spark alive when &quot;Frogstomp&quot; came out because it was just so unrefined, it was just so raw. There was something magical about that we continued to try and capture. I think we did pretty well.

==Title==
In January 1996, when asked why the album&#x27;s name is &quot;Frogstomp&quot;, Johns said: I was at a guy from our record company&#x27;s house one night and I was looking through his CDs because he&#x27;s got a really good collection. I found this &#x27;60s pop collection record and I was just going (laughs), &quot;Why do you have this?&quot; I looked at the back and there was this song that some guy did called Frogstomp and I said, &quot;That&#x27;s a pretty good name.&quot; (laughs) I just rang up Ben and Chris and we just thought it was really funny so we used it for the album.

==Release==
&quot;Frogstomp&quot; was first released in Australia by record label Murmur on 27 March 1995. It reached number 1 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. The album was later released by Epic Records in the United States on 20 June 1995. &quot;Frogstomp&quot; is the only Silverchair album to receive platinum certification in the United States by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), selling 1,000,000 copies on 19 September 1995, making it the band&#x27;s best-selling album in the U.S., and it was later certified double platinum on 14 February 1996.

The LP version of the album was sold on a green vinyl with &quot;Blind&quot;, from the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; EP, as a bonus track and limited to 3,000 copies worldwide. A limited cassette edition of the album was also released.

On 27 March 2015, a remastered edition of &quot;Frogstomp&quot; was released as a two-CD/DVD set to mark the twentieth anniversary of its release. The standard edition of the &quot;20th Anniversary&quot; remaster includes a second CD titled &quot;Rarities&quot; with Silverchair&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&quot; EP, a vocal version of the song &quot;Madman&quot; (from the single &quot;Shade&quot;), and audio of a concert from June 1995 at the Cambridge Hotel in Newcastle, Australia. The &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; of the &quot;20th Anniversary&quot; remaster includes the &quot;Rarities&quot; CD as well as a DVD with video footage of the band&#x27;s Cambridge Hotel concert, a video recording of &quot;Israel&#x27;s Son&quot; at the 1995 Sydney Royal Easter Show, and the &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Pure Massacre&quot;, and &quot;Israel&#x27;s Son&quot; music videos.

==Reception==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote:For their age [15 years old], their instrumental capabilities are quite impressive, as the guitars and vocals growl with the force of rockers in their early twenties. At the same time, their songwriting abilities aren&#x27;t as strong, and they are never able to break away from the standard grunge formula. Nevertheless, the record does deliver a collection of songs replicating the thunder of ‘Tomorrow‘.
Chuck Eddy of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote in July 1995:the songs on &quot;Frogstomp&quot; almost all start out like dreary Metallica ballads and build toward gloomy, by-the-numbers grunge&quot;. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, on the other hand, wrote: &quot;Truly shameless wanna-be&#x27;s like Bush should be so lucky to have the hard smarts that Silverchair – particularly the band&#x27;s main writers, singer-guitarist Daniel Johns and drummer Ben Gillies – show on such &quot;Frogstomp&quot;-ers as ‘Pure Massacre‘ and ‘Israel&#x27;s Son‘. When these guys turn 18, they&#x27;ll really be dangerous.
In 1995, ABC Australia wrote that Silverchair provided:a thrilling synthesis of rage, confusion and pain, and as a distillation of teen angst, you couldn&#x27;t get a purer generational timestamp than &quot;Frogstomp&quot;.

==Legacy==

In June 2015, Colm Browne of Soundscape Magazine said the lyrics on &quot;Frogstomp&quot; &quot;show intelligence&quot; and &quot;a want to question the world, express feelings, get rid of negatives and be positive&quot;, saying the album &quot;was and still is mightily impressive.&quot; British publication &quot;Classic Rock&quot; said about the &quot;20th Anniversary&quot; remaster, &quot;&quot;Frogstomp&quot; is as grunge as it gets. So was the world in ’95, which bought 3.5 million copies of the album.&quot;

In October 2015, James Rose of the &quot;Daily Review&quot; wrote of the albumAs an album in its own right, it&#x27;s pretty good. As a debut by three 15-year-olds, it&#x27;s about as good as it gets. There are still kids out there today listening to &quot;Frogstomp&quot; and shitting themselves. And so they should.

In November 2017, The Amity Affliction member, Ahren Stringer, said of the album &quot;I was obsessed with &quot;Frogstomp&quot; as a 12-year-old boy. I wanted to &quot;be&quot; Daniel Johns.&quot;

In September 2018, the album was ranked #25 on Double J&#x27;s list of &quot;‘Top 50 Australian Albums of the &#x27;90s‘&quot;.

In July 2020, NME said about the album:25 years later, &quot;Frogstomp&quot; is too vital to be dismissed as meat-and-potatoes hard rock. There’s a lot to love, and much of it is heavy: the furious double-time onslaughts of “Israel’s Son“ and “Faultline“, the pop-punk “Findaway“ and the thrash-y instrumental “Madman“.

In July 2020, &quot;Mixdown&quot; listed the album as among the seven best Australian grunge albums. In September 2020, the publication said the album had a &quot;hard-edged sound with angsty (yet all too relatable) lyricism&quot; and described &quot;Frogstomp&quot; as &quot;one of the most definitive grunge records of its era.&quot;

In June 2021, American music magazine, &quot;Spin&quot; wrote about the album in a retrospective piece, saying &quot;&quot;Frogstomp&quot; was ours, music written by kids our own age speaking to us in a language only we understood.&quot;

In December 2021, &quot;Frogstomp&quot; was listed at no. 6 in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;‘s &quot;‘200 Greatest Albums of All Time‘&quot; countdown.

In April 2022, British newspaper publication, The Guardian, inlcuded four &quot;Frogstomp&quot; songs on their &quot;‘The 25 Best Silverchair Songs - Sorted‘&quot; list. &quot;Findaway&quot;, &quot;Faultline&quot;, &quot;Israel&#x27;s Son&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; ranked at #18, #14, #8, and #1, respectively.

In July 2024, Ultimate Guitar ranked &quot;Frogstomp&quot; at number 7 on their &quot;‘Top 10 Classic Grunge Albums That Didn&#x27;t Come From Seattle‘&quot; list, saying that Silverchair &quot;managed to write such catchy, dark tunes that perfectly encapsulate the grunge spirit while still sounding fresh and memorable.&quot;

<doc id="594501" wikidata="Q855175" url="?curid=594501" title="E-democracy">
<text>E-democracy (a blend of the terms electronic and democracy), also known as digital democracy or Internet democracy, uses information and communication technology (ICT) in political and governance processes. The term is credited to digital activist Steven Clift. By using 21st-century ICT, e-democracy seeks to enhance democracy, including aspects like civic technology and E-government. Proponents argue that by promoting transparency in decision-making processes, e-democracy can empower all citizens to observe and understand the proceedings. Also, if they possess overlooked data, perspectives, or opinions, they can contribute meaningfully. This contribution extends beyond mere informal disconnected debate; it facilitates citizen engagement in the proposal, development, and actual creation of a country&#x27;s laws. In this way, e-democracy has the potential to incorporate crowdsourced analysis more directly into the policy-making process.

Electronic democracy incorporates a diverse range of tools that use both existing and emerging information sources. These tools provide a platform for the public to express their concerns, interests, and perspectives, and to contribute evidence that may influence decision-making processes at the community, national, or global level. E-democracy leverages both traditional broadcast technologies such as television and radio, as well as newer interactive internet-enabled devices and applications, including polling systems. These emerging technologies have become popular means of public participation, allowing a broad range of stakeholders to access information and contribute directly via the internet. Moreover, large groups can offer real-time input at public meetings using electronic polling devices.

Utilizing information and communication technology (ICT), e-democracy bolsters political self-determination. It collects social, economic, and cultural data to enhance democratic engagement.

As a concept that encompasses various applications within differing democratic structures, e-democracy has substantial impacts on political norms and public engagement. It emerges from theoretical explorations of democracy and practical initiatives to address societal challenges through technology. The extent and manner of its implementation often depend on the specific form of democracy adopted by a society, thus shaped by both internal dynamics and external technological developments.

When designed to present both supporting and opposing evidence and arguments for each issue, apply conflict resolution and Cost–benefit analysis techniques, and actively address confirmation bias and other cognitive biases, E-Democracy could potentially foster a more informed citizenry. However, the development of such a system poses significant challenges. These include designing sophisticated platforms to achieve these aims, navigating the dynamics of populism while acknowledging that not everyone has the time or resources for full-time policy analysis and debate, promoting inclusive participation, and addressing cybersecurity and privacy concerns. Despite these hurdles, some envision e-democracy as a potential facilitator of more participatory governance, a countermeasure to excessive partisan dogmatism, a problem-solving tool, a means for evaluating the validity of pro/con arguments, and a method for balancing power distribution within society.

Throughout history, social movements have adapted to use the prevailing technologies as part of their civic engagement and social change efforts. This trend persists in the digital era, illustrating how technology shapes democratic processes. As technology evolves, it inevitably impacts all aspects of society, including governmental operations. This ongoing technological advancement brings new opportunities for public participation and policy-making while presenting challenges such as cybersecurity threats, issues related to the digital divide, and privacy concerns. Society is actively grappling with these complexities, striving to balance leveraging technology for democratic enhancement and managing its associated risks.

== Considerations ==
E-democracy incorporates elements of both representative and direct democracy. In representative democracies, which characterize most modern systems, responsibilities such as law-making, policy formation, and regulation enforcement are entrusted to elected officials. This differs from direct democracies, where citizens undertake these duties themselves.

Motivations for e-democracy reforms are diverse and reflect the desired outcomes of its advocates. Some aim to align government actions more closely with the public&#x27;s interest, akin to populism, diminish the influence of media, political parties, and lobbyists, or use public input to assess potential costs and benefits of each policy.

E-democracy, in its unstructured form, emphasizes direct participation and has the potential to redistribute political power from elected officials to individuals or groups. However, reforms aimed at maximizing benefits and minimizing costs might require structures that mimic a form of representation, conceivable if the public had the capacity to debate and analyze issues full-time. Given the design of electronic forums that can accommodate extensive debate, e-democracy has the potential to mimic aspects of representation on a much larger scale. These structures could involve public education initiatives or systems that permit citizens to contribute based on their interests or expertise. Further, E-democracies allow participants to engage online thus allowing it to reach a broader range of people.

From this standpoint, e-democracy appears less concerned with what the public believes to be true and more focused on the evidence the public can demonstrate as true. This view reveals a tension within e-democratic reforms between populism and an evidence-based approach akin to the scientific method or the Enlightenment principles.

A key indicator of the effectiveness of a democratic system is the successful implementation of policy. To facilitate this, voters must comprehend the implications of each policy approach, evaluate its costs and benefits, and consider historical precedents for policy effectiveness. Some proponents of e-democracy argue that technology can enable citizens to perform these tasks as effectively, if not more so, than traditional political parties within representative democracies. By harnessing technological advancements, e-democracy has the potential to foster more informed decision-making and enhance citizen involvement in the democratic process.

== History ==
E-democracy traces back to the development of information and communication technology (ICT) and the evolution of democratic structures. It encompasses initiatives from governments to interact with citizens through digital means and grassroots activities using electronic platforms to influence governmental practices.

=== Early developments ===
The inception of e-democracy corresponds with the rise of the Internet in the late 20th century. The diffusion of personal computers and the Internet during the 1990s led to the initiation of electronic government initiatives. Digital platforms, such as forums, chat rooms, and email lists, were pivotal in fostering public discourse, thereby encouraging informal civic engagement online. These platforms provided an accessible medium for individuals to discuss ideas and issues, and they were utilized by both governments and citizens to promote dialogue, advocate for change, and involve the public in decision-making processes.

=== Concept and approach ===

The structure of the Internet, which currently embodies characteristics such as decentralization, open standards, and universal access, has been observed to align with principles often associated with democracy. These democratic principles have their roots in federalism and Enlightenment values like openness and individual liberty.

Steven Clift, a notable proponent of e-democracy, suggests that the Internet should be utilized to enhance democratic processes and provide increased opportunities for interaction between individuals, communities, and the government. He emphasizes the importance of structuring citizen-to-citizen discussions online within existing power structures and maintaining significant reach within the community for these discussions to hold agenda-setting potential.

The concept involves endorsing individuals or policies committed to leveraging internet technologies to amplify public engagement without modifying or substituting existing constitutions. The approach includes data collection, analysis of advantages and disadvantages, evaluation of interests, and facilitating discussions around potential outcomes.

=== Late 20th century to early 21st century ===

In the late 20th century and early into the 21st century, e-democracy started to become more structured as governments worldwide started to explore its potential. One major development was the rise of e-government initiatives, which aimed to provide public services online.

One of the first instances of such an initiative was the establishment of the Government Information Locator Service (GILS) by the United States government in 1994. GILS was a searchable database of government information accessible to citizens and businesses, and it served as a tool to improve agency electronic records management practices.

Along with the rise of e-government services, government websites started to spring up, aiming to improve communication with citizens, increase transparency, and make administrative tasks easier to accomplish online.

The mid-2000s ushered in the era of Web 2.0, emphasizing user-generated content, interoperability, and collaboration. This period witnessed the rise of social media platforms, blogs, and other collaborative tools, further amplifying the potential for e-democracy through increasing opportunities for public participation and interaction. Concepts like crowdsourcing and open-source governance gained traction, advocating for broader and more direct public involvement in policymaking.

As the digital age progressed, so too did the interaction between governments and citizens. The advent and rapid adoption of the internet globally catalyzed this transformation. With high internet penetration in many regions, politics have increasingly relied on the internet as a primary source of information for numerous people. This digital shift has been supported by the rise in online advertising among political candidates and groups actively trying to sway public opinion or directly influence legislators.

This trend is especially noticeable among younger voters, who often regard the internet as their primary source of information due to its convenience and ability to streamline their information-gathering process. The user-friendly nature of search engines like Google and social networks encourages increased citizen engagement in political research and discourse. Social networks, for instance, offer platforms where individuals can voice their opinions on governmental issues without fear of judgement. The vast scale and decentralized structure of the internet enable anyone to create viral content and influence a wide audience.

The Internet facilitates citizens in accessing and disseminating information about politicians while simultaneously providing politicians with insights from a broader citizen base. This collaborative approach to decision-making and problem-solving empowers citizens. It accelerates decision-making processes by politicians, thereby fostering a more efficient society. Gathering citizen feedback and perspectives is essential to a politician&#x27;s role. The Internet functions as a conduit for effective engagement with a larger audience. Consequently, this enhanced communication with the public strengthens the capability and effectiveness of the American government as a democracy.

The 2016 U.S. presidential election is an example of social media integration in political campaigns, where both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton actively utilized Twitter as a communication tool. These platforms allow candidates to shape public perceptions while also humanizing their personas, suggesting that political figures are as approachable and relatable as ordinary individuals. Through resources such as Google, the Internet enables every citizen to readily research political topics. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram encourage political engagement, allowing users to share their political views and connect with like-minded individuals.

Generation X&#x27;s disillusionment with political processes, epitomized by large-scale public protests such as the U.K. miners&#x27; strike of 1984-1985 that appeared to fail, predated the widespread availability of information technology to individual citizens. There is a perception that e-democracy could address some of these concerns by offering a counter to the insularity, power concentration, and post-election accountability deficit often associated with traditional democratic processes organized primarily around political parties. Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader of the U.K. Labour Party, once stated:

Despite the benefits of the digital shift, one of the challenges of e-democracy is the potential disconnect between politics and actual government implementation. While the internet provides a platform for robust political discourse, translating these discussions into effective government action can be complex. This gap can often be exacerbated by the rapid pace of digital dialogue, which may outpace the slower, more deliberative processes of policy-making. The rise of digital media has created new opportunities for citizens to participate in politics and to hold governments accountable. However, it has also created new challenges, such as the potential for echo chambers, and the need for governments to be responsive to citizen concerns. The challenge for e-democracy, therefore, is to ensure that the digital discourse contributes constructively to the functioning of the government and the decision-making processes, rather than becoming an echo chamber of opinions with little practical impact.

As of the 2020s, e-democracy&#x27;s landscape continues to evolve alongside advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data. These technologies promise to expand citizen participation further, enhance transparency, and boost the overall efficiency and responsiveness of democratic governance.

The history of e-democracy exhibits significant progress, but it is also characterized by ongoing debates and challenges, such as the digital divide, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the impact of misinformation. One concern is whether or not e-democracies will be able to withstand terrorist threats; once people are assured that defenses are in place for this, e-democracies will better serve communities the way they were intended to.

As this journey continues, the emphasis remains on leveraging technology to enhance democratic processes and ensure all citizens&#x27; voices are heard and valued.

E-democracy promotes wider access to information, and its inherent decentralization challenges censorship practices. It embodies elements of the internet&#x27;s origins, including strong libertarian support for freedom of speech, widespread sharing culture, and the National Science Foundation&#x27;s commercial use prohibition. The internet&#x27;s capacity for mass communication, evident in newsgroups, chat rooms, and MUDs, surpasses traditional boundaries associated with broadcast media like newspapers or radio, as well as personal media such as letters or landline telephones. As the Internet represents a vast digital network supporting open standards, achieving widespread, cost-effective access to a diverse range of communication media and models is feasible.

Practical issues pertaining to e-democracy include managing the agenda while encouraging meaningful participation and fostering enlightened understanding. Furthermore, efforts are evaluated based on their ability to ensure voting equality and promote inclusivity. The success or failure of e-democracy largely depends on its capability to accurately delineate each issue&#x27;s relevant costs and benefits, identify their likelihood and significance, and align votes with this analysis. In addition, all internet forums, including Wikipedia, must address cybersecurity and protect sensitive data.

== Digital mobilization in social movements ==
=== Occupy movement ===
The Occupy movement, which proposed various demonstrations in response to the financial crisis of 2007–08, extensively utilized social networks.

=== 15-M Movement ===
Originating in Spain and subsequently spreading to other European countries, the 15-M Movement gave rise to proposals by the Partido X (X Party) in Spain. In 2016 and 2017, citizens involved in the movement together with the City Council of Barcelona developed a combined online and offline e-democracy project called Decidim, that self-describes as a &quot;technopolitical network for participatory democracy&quot;, with the aim of implementing the hopes of participatory democracy raised by the movement. The project combines a free and open-source software (FOSS) software package together with a participatory political project and an organising community, &quot;Metadecidim&quot;. Decidim participants refer to the software, political and organising components of the project as &quot;technical&quot;, &quot;political&quot; and &quot;technopolitical&quot; levels, respectively. By 2023, Decidim estimated that 400 city and regional governments and civil society institutions were running Decidim instances.

=== Arab Spring ===

During the Arab Spring, uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East were spearheaded by online activists. Initially, pro-democracy movements harnessed digital media to challenge authoritarian regimes. These regimes, however, adapted and integrated social media into their counter-insurgency strategies over time. Digital media served as a critical tool in transforming localized and individual dissent into structured movements with a shared awareness of common grievances and opportunities for collective action.

=== Egyptian Revolution ===

The Egyptian Revolution began on 25 January 2011, prompted by mass protests in Cairo, Egypt, against the long reign of President Hosni Mubarak, high unemployment, governmental corruption, poverty, and societal oppression. The 18-day revolution gained momentum not through initial acts of violence or protests, but via a single Facebook page, which quickly attracted the attention of thousands and eventually millions of Egyptians, evolving into a global phenomenon.

The Internet became a tool of empowerment for the protestors, facilitating participation in their government&#x27;s democratization process. Protestors effectively utilized digital platforms to communicate, organize, and collaborate, generating real-time impact.

In response to the regime&#x27;s failed attempt to disrupt political online discussions by severing all internet access, Google and Twitter collaborated to create a system that allowed information to reach the public without internet access.

The interactive nature of media during this revolution enhanced civic participation and played a significant role in shaping the political outcome of the revolution and the democratization of the entire nation.

The Egyptian Revolution has been interpreted by some as a paradigm shift from a group-controlled system to one characterized by &quot;networked individualism&quot;. This transformation is tied to the post-&quot;triple revolution&quot; of technology, consisting of three key developments. First, the shift towards social networks, second, the widespread propagation of the instantaneous internet, and third, the ubiquity of mobile phones.

These elements significantly impacted change through the Internet, providing an alternative, unregulated sphere for idea formation and protests. For instance, the &quot;6 April Youth Movement&quot; in Egypt established their political group on Facebook and called for a national strike. Despite the subsequent suppression of this event, the Facebook group persisted, encouraging other activist groups to utilize online media.

Moreover, the Internet served as a medium for building international connections, amplifying the impact of the revolt. The rapid transmission of information via Twitter hashtags, for example, made the uprising globally known. In particular, over three million tweets contained popular hashtags such as #Egypt and #sidibouzid, further facilitating the spread of knowledge and fostering change in Egypt.

=== Kony 2012 ===
The Kony 2012 video, released on 5 March 2012 by the non-profit organization Invisible Children, launched an online grassroots campaign aimed at locating and arresting Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA) in Central Africa. The video&#x27;s mission was to raise global awareness about Kony&#x27;s activities, with Jason Russell, a founder of Invisible Children, emphasizing the necessity of public support to urge the government&#x27;s continued search for Kony. The organization leveraged the extensive reach of social media and contemporary technology to spotlight Kony&#x27;s crimes.

In response to the campaign, on 21 March 2012, a resolution was introduced by 33 Senators denouncing &quot;the crimes against humanity&quot; perpetrated by Kony and the LRA. This resolution supported the US government&#x27;s ongoing efforts to boost the capabilities of regional military forces for civilian protection and the pursuit of LRA commanders. It also advocated for cross-border initiatives to augment civilian protection and aid populations affected by the LRA. Co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham noted the significant impact of public attention driven by social media, stating that the YouTube sensation would &quot;help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined&quot;.

=== India Against Corruption (2011–2012) ===
The India Against Corruption (IAC) movement was an influential anti-corruption crusade in India, garnering substantial attention during the anti-corruption protests of 2011 and 2012. Its primary focus was the contention surrounding the proposed Jan Lokpal bill. IAC sought to galvanize the populace in their pursuit of a less corrupt Indian society. However, internal divisions within the IAC&#x27;s central committee led to the movement&#x27;s split. Arvind Kejriwal left to establish the Aam Aadmi Party, while Anna Hazare created the Jantantra Morcha.

=== Long March (Pakistan) ===

Long March is a socio-political movement in Pakistan initiated by Qadri after returning from a seven-year residence in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in December 2012. Qadri called for a &quot;million-men&quot; march in Islamabad to protest government corruption. The march commenced on 14 January 2013, with thousands pledging to participate in a sit-in until their demands were met. The march began in Lahore with about 25,000 participants. During a rally in front of the parliament, Qadri critiqued the legislators saying, &quot;There is no Parliament; there is a group of looters, thieves and dacoits [bandits] ... Our lawmakers are the lawbreakers.&quot;. After four days of sit-in, Qadri and the government reached an agreement—termed the Islamabad Long March Declaration—which pledged electoral reforms and enhanced political transparency. Despite Qadri&#x27;s call for a &quot;million-men&quot; march, the government estimated the sit-in participants in Islamabad to number around 50,000.

=== Five Star Movement (Italy) ===

The Five Star Movement (M5S), a prominent political party in Italy, has been utilizing online voting since 2012 to select its candidates for Italian and European elections. These votes are conducted through a web-based application called Rousseau, accessible to registered members of Beppe Grillo&#x27;s blog.

Within this platform, M5S users are able to discuss, approve, or reject legislative proposals. These proposals are then presented in Parliament by the M5S group. For instance, the M5S&#x27;s electoral law and the selection of its presidential candidate were determined via online voting. Notably, the decision to abolish a law against immigrants was made by online voting among M5S members, in opposition to the views of Grillo and Casaleggio.

M5S&#x27;s alliance with the UK Independence Party was also determined by online voting, albeit with limited options for the choice of European Parliament group for M5S. These were Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD), European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), and &quot;Stay independent&quot; (Non-Inscrits). The possibility of joining the Greens/EFA group was discussed but not available at the time due to the group&#x27;s prior rejection of M5S.

When the Conte I Cabinet collapsed, a new coalition between the Democratic Party and M5S was endorsed after over 100,000 members voted online, with 79.3% supporting the new coalition.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance and impact of e-democracy. In 2020, the advent of COVID-19 led countries worldwide to implement safety measures as recommended by public health officials. This abrupt societal shift constrained social movements, causing a temporary halt to certain political issues. Despite these limitations, individuals leveraged digital platforms to express their views, create visibility for social movements, and strive to instigate change and raise awareness through democracy in social media. As reported by news analysis firm &quot;The ASEAN Post&quot;, the pandemic-induced limitations on traditional democratic spaces such as public meetings have led Filipinos, among others, to resort to social media, digital media, and collaborative platforms for engaging in public affairs and practising &quot;active citizenship&quot; in the virtual domain. This shift has enabled active participation in social, written, or visual interaction and the rectification of misinformation in a virtual setting.

== Opportunities and challenges ==

=== Potential impacts ===
E-democracy has the potential to inspire greater community involvement in political processes and policy decisions, interlacing its growth with complex internal aspects such as political norms and public pressure. The manner in which it is implemented is also closely connected to the specific model of democracy employed. Consequently, e-democracy is profoundly influenced by a country&#x27;s internal dynamics as well as the external drivers defined by standard innovation and diffusion theory.

In the current age, where the internet and social networking dominate daily life, individuals are increasingly advocating for their public representatives to adopt practices similar to those in other states or countries concerning the online dissemination of government information. By making government data easily accessible and providing straightforward channels to communicate with government officials, e-democracy addresses the needs of modern society.

E-democracy promotes more rapid and efficient dissemination of political information, encourages public debate, and boosts participation in decision-making processes. Social media platforms have emerged as tools of empowerment, particularly among younger individuals, stimulating their participation in electoral processes. These platforms also afford politicians opportunities for direct engagement with constituents. A notable example is the 2016 United States presidential elections, in which Donald Trump primarily used Twitter to communicate policy initiatives and goals. Similar practices have been observed among various global leaders, such as Justin Trudeau, Jair Bolsonaro, and Hassan Rouhani, who maintain active Twitter accounts. Some observers argue that the government&#x27;s online publication of public information enhances its transparency, enabling more extensive public scrutiny, and consequently promoting a more equitable distribution of power within society.

Jane Fountain, in her 2001 work &quot;Building the Virtual State&quot;, delves into the expansive reach of e-democracy and its interaction with traditional governmental structures. She offers a comprehensive model to understand how pre-existing norms, procedures, and rules within bureaucracies impact the adoption of new technological forms. Fountain suggests that this form of e-government, in its most radical manifestation, would necessitate a significant overhaul of the modern administrative state, with routine electronic consultations involving elected politicians, civil servants, pressure groups, and other stakeholders becoming standard practice at all stages of policy formulation.

States where legislatures are controlled by the Republican Party, as well as those characterized by a high degree of legislative professionalization and active professional networks, have shown a greater propensity to embrace e-government and e-democracy.

E-democracy provides numerous benefits, contributing to a more engaged public sphere. It encourages increased public participation by offering platforms for citizens to express their opinions through websites, emails, and other electronic communication channels, influencing planning and decision-making processes.

This digital democracy model broadens the number and diversity of individuals who exercise their democratic rights by conveying their thoughts to decision-making bodies about various proposals and issues. Moreover, it cultivates a virtual public space, fostering interaction, discussion, and the exchange of ideas among citizens.

E-democracy also promotes convenience, allowing citizens to participate at their own pace and comfort. Its digital nature enables it to reach vast audiences with relative ease and minimal cost.

The system promotes interactive communication, encouraging dialogue between authorities and citizens. It also serves as an effective platform for disseminating large amounts of information, maintaining clarity and minimizing distortion.

=== Challenges ===

While e-democracy platforms, also known as digital democracy platforms, offer enhanced opportunities for exercising voting rights, they are also susceptible to disruption. Digital voting platforms, for example, have faced attacks aimed at influencing election outcomes. As Dobrygowski states, &quot;cybersecurity threats to the integrity of both electoral mechanisms and government institutions are, quite uncomfortably, more intangible.&quot; That being said, if e-democracy options were more secure, people would be more comfortable using it for things such as voting. While traditional paper ballots are often considered the most secure method for conducting elections, digital voting provides the convenience of electronic participation. However, the successful implementation of this system necessitates continual innovations and contributions from third parties. Essentially for e-democracies to be used in real time, governments would have to prove it&#x27;s reliability to users.

==== Ensuring digital inclusion ====
To foster a robust digital democracy, it&#x27;s imperative to promote digital inclusion that ensures all citizens, regardless of income, education, gender, religion, ethnicity, language, physical and mental health, have equal opportunities to participate in public policy formulation. 

Early instances of digital inclusion in e-democracy can be seen in the 2008 election; individuals who were normally civically uninvolved became increasingly engaged due to the accessibility of receiving and spreading campaign information.

During the 2020 elections, digital communications were utilized by various communities to cultivate a sense of inclusivity.

Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic saw a surge in online political participation among the youth, demonstrated by the signing of online petitions and participation in digital protests. Even as youth participation in traditional politics dwindles, young people show significant support for pressure groups mobilized through social media.

For instance, the Black Lives Matter movement gained widespread recognition on social media, enabling many young people to participate in meaningful ways, including online interactions and protests.
==== Requirements ====
E-Democracy is facilitated by its significance in fostering participation, promoting social inclusivity, displaying sensitivity to individual perspectives, and offering flexible means of engagement. The Internet endows a sense of relevance to participation by giving everyone a platform for their voices to be heard and articulated. It also facilitates a structure of social inclusivity through a broad array of websites, groups, and social networks, each representing diverse viewpoints and ideas. Individual needs are met by enabling the public and rapid expression of personal opinions. Furthermore, the Internet offers an exceptionally flexible environment for engagement; it is cost-effective and widely accessible. Through these attributes, e-democracy and the deployment of the Internet can play a pivotal role in societal change.

==== Internet accessibility ====

The progression of e-democracy is impeded by the digital divide, which separates those actively engaged in electronic communities from those who do not participate. Proponents of e-democracy often recommend governmental actions to bridge this digital gap. The divergence in e-governance and e-democracy between the developed and the developing world is largely due to the digital divide. Practical concerns include the digital divide that separates those with access from those without, and the opportunity cost associated with investments in e-democracy innovations. There also exists a degree of skepticism regarding the potential impact of online participation.

==== Security and privacy ====

The government has a responsibility to ensure that online communications are both secure and respectful of individuals&#x27; privacy. This aspect gains prominence when considering electronic voting. The complexity of electronic voting systems surpasses other digital transaction mechanisms, necessitating authentication measures that can counter ballot manipulation or its potential threat. These measures may encompass the use of smart cards, which authenticate a voter&#x27;s identity while maintaining the confidentiality of the cast vote. Electronic voting in Estonia exemplifies a successful approach to addressing the privacy-identity dilemma inherent in internet voting systems. However, the ultimate goal should be to match the security and privacy standards of existing manual systems.

Despite these advancements, recent research has indicated, through a SWOT analysis, that the risks of an e-government are related to data loss, privacy and security, and user adoption.

==== Government responsiveness ====
To encourage citizens to engage in online consultations and discussions, the government needs to be responsive and clearly demonstrate that public engagement influences policy outcomes. It&#x27;s crucial for citizens to have the opportunity to contribute at a time and place that suits them and when their viewpoints will make a difference. The government should put structures in place to accommodate increased participation.

Considering the role that intermediaries and representative organizations might play could be beneficial to ensure issues are debated in a manner that is democratic, inclusive, tolerant, and productive. To amplify the efficacy of existing legal rights allowing public access to information held by public authorities, citizens ought to be granted the right to productive public deliberation and moderation.

Some researchers argue that many initiatives have been driven by technology rather than by the core values of government, which has resulted in weakened democracy.

== Participation and engagement ==
=== Interaction modes ===
 E-democracy presents an opportunity to reconcile the conventional trade-off between the size of the group involved in democratic processes and the depth of will expression (refer to the Figure). Historically, broad group participation was facilitated via simple ballot voting, but the depth of will expression was confined to predefined options (those on the ballot). Depth of will expression was obtained by limiting participant numbers through representative democracy (refer to the Table). The social media Web 2.0 revolution has demonstrated the possibility of achieving both large group sizes and depth of will expression. However, expressions of will in social media are unstructured, making their interpretation challenging and often subjective (see Table). Novel information processing methods, including big data analytics and the semantic web, suggest potential ways to exploit these capabilities for future e-democracy implementations. Currently, e-democracy processes are facilitated by technologies such as electronic mailing lists, peer-to-peer networks, collaborative software, and apps like GovernEye, Countable, VoteSpotter, wikis, internet forums, and blogs. 

The examination of e-democracy encompasses its various stages including &quot;information provision, deliberation, and participation in decision-making.&quot; This assessment also takes into account the different hierarchical levels of governance such as local communities, states/regions, nations, and the global stage. Further, the scope of involvement is also considered, which includes the participation of citizens/voters, the media, elected officials, political organizations, and governments. Therefore, e-democracy&#x27;s evolution is influenced by such broad changes as increased interdependency, technological multimediation, partnership governance, and individualism.

Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, and Blogspot, are increasingly significant in democratic dialogues. The role of social media in e-democracy is an emerging field of study, along with technological developments such as argument maps and the semantic web.

Another notable development is the combination of open social networking communication with structured communication from closed expert and/or policy-maker panels, such as through the modified Delphi method (HyperDelphi).

This approach seeks to balance distributed knowledge and self-organized memories with critical control, responsibility, and decision-making in electronic democracy. Social networking serves as an entry point within the citizens&#x27; environment, engaging them on their terms. Proponents of e-government believe this helps the government act more in tune with its public. Examples of state usage include The Official Commonwealth of Virginia Homepage, where citizens can find Google tools and open social forums, considered significant steps towards the maturity of e-democracy.

=== Community involvement ===

Civic engagement encompasses three key aspects: understanding public affairs (political knowledge), trust in the political system (political trust), and involvement in governmental decision-making processes (political participation). The internet enhances civic engagement by creating a new medium for interaction with government institutions.

Advocates of e-democracy propose that it can facilitate more active government engagement and inspire citizens to actively influence decisions that directly affect them. Digital tools have and continue to be used to determine the best practices for getting citizens involved in government. Collecting data on what gets citizens involved most efficiently allows for stronger practices going forward in citizen involvement.

Numerous studies indicate an increased use of the internet for obtaining political information. From 1996 to 2002, the percentage of adults claiming that the internet played a significant role in their political choices rose from around 14 to 20 percent. In 2002, almost a quarter of the population stated that they had visited a website to research specific public policy issues.

Research has indicated that people are more likely to visit websites that challenge their viewpoints rather than those that align with their own beliefs. Around 16 percent of the population has participated in online political activities such as joining campaigns, volunteering time, donating money, or participating in polls.

A survey conducted by Philip N. Howard revealed that nearly two-thirds of the adult population in the United States has interacted with online political news, information, or other content over the past four election cycles. People tend to reference the websites of special interest groups more frequently than those of specific elected leaders, political candidates, political parties, nonpartisan groups, and local community groups.

The vast informational capacity of the Internet empowers citizens to gain a deeper understanding of governmental and political affairs, while its interactive nature fosters new forms of communication with elected officials and public servants. By providing access to contact information, legislation, agendas, and policies, governments can enhance transparency, thereby potentially facilitating more informed participation both online and offline.

As articulated by Matt Leighninger, the internet bolsters government by enhancing individual empowerment and reinforcing group agency. The internet avails vital information to citizens, empowering them to influence public policy more effectively. The utilization of online tools for organizing allows citizens to participate more easily in the government&#x27;s policy-making process, leading to a surge in public engagement. Social media platforms foster networks of individuals whose online activities can shape the political process, including prompting politicians to intensify public appeal efforts in their campaigns.

E-democracy offers a digital platform for public dialogue, enhancing the interaction between government and its residents. This form of online engagement enables the government to concentrate on key issues the community wishes to address. The underpinning philosophy is that every citizen should have the potential to influence their local governance. E-democracy aligns with local communities and provides an opportunity for any willing citizen to make a contribution. The essence of an effective e-democracy lies not just in citizen contribution to government activities, but in promoting mutual communication and collaboration among citizens for the improvement of their own communities.

E-democracy utilizes information and communication technologies (ICT) to bolster the democratic processes of decision-making. These technologies play a pivotal role in informing and organizing citizens in different avenues of civic participation. Moreover, ICTs enhance the active engagement of citizens, and foster collaboration among stakeholders for policy formation within political processes across all stages of governance.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) identifies three key aspects regarding the role of ICTs in fostering civic engagement. The first aspect is timing, with most civic engagement activities occurring during the agenda-setting phase of a cycle. The second factor is adaptation, which refers to how ICTs evolve to facilitate increased civic participation. The final aspect is integration, representing how emerging ICTs blend new and traditional methods to maximize civic engagement.

ICT fosters the possibility of a government that is both more democratic and better informed by facilitating open online collaborations between professionals and the public. The responsibility of collecting information and making decisions is shared between those possessing technological expertise and the traditionally recognized decision-makers. This broadened public involvement in the exchange of ideas and policies results in more democratic decision-making. Furthermore, ICT enhances the notion of pluralism within a democracy, introducing fresh issues and viewpoints.

Ordinary citizens have the opportunity to become creators of political content and commentary, for instance, by establishing individual blogs and websites. Collaborative efforts in the online political sphere, similar to ABC News&#x27; Campaign Watchdog initiative, allow citizens to report any rule violations committed by any political party during elections.

In the 2000 United States presidential race, candidates frequently utilized their websites to not only encourage their supporters to vote but to motivate their friends to vote as well. This dual-process approach—urging an individual to vote and then to prompt their friends to vote—was just beginning to emerge during that time. Today, political participation through various social media platforms is typical, and civic involvement via online forums is common. Through the use of ICTs, individuals interested in politics have the ability to become more engaged.

=== Youth involvement ===

In previous years, individuals belonging to Generation X, Generation Y, and Generation Z, typically encompassing those aged 35 and below as of the mid-2000s, have been noted for their relative disengagement from political activities. The implementation of electronic democracy has been proposed as a potential solution to foster increased voter turnout, democratic participation, and political literacy among these younger demographics.

==== E-citizenship ====
Youth e-citizenship presents a dichotomy between two predominant approaches: management and autonomy. The strategy of &quot;targeting&quot; younger individuals, prompting them to &quot;play their part,&quot; can be interpreted as either an incentive for youth activism or a mechanism to regulate it.

Autonomous e-citizens argue that despite their relative inexperience, young people should have the right to voice their perspectives on issues that they personally consider important. Conversely, proponents of managed e-citizenship view youth as nascent citizens transitioning from childhood to adulthood, and hence not yet fully equipped to engage in political discourse without proper guidance. Another significant concern is the role of the Internet, with advocates of managed e-citizenship arguing that young people may be especially susceptible to misinformation or manipulation online.

This discord manifests as two perspectives on democracy: one that sees democracy as an established and reasonably just system, where young people should be motivated to participate, and another that views democracy as a political and cultural goal best achieved through networks where young people interact. What might initially appear as mere differences in communication styles ultimately reveals divergent strategies for accessing and influencing power.

==== In Scotland ====
The Highland Youth Voice, an initiative in Scotland, is an exemplar of efforts to bolster democratic participation, particularly through digital means. Despite an increasing emphasis on the youth demographic in UK governmental policy and issues, their engagement and interest have been waning.

During the 2001 elections to the Westminster Parliament in the UK, voter turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated to be a mere 40%. This contrasts starkly with the fact that over 80% of 16- to 24-year-olds have accessed the internet at some point.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasizes the importance of educating young individuals as citizens of their respective nations. It advocates for the promotion of active political participation, which they can shape through robust debate and communication.

The Highland Youth Voice strives to boost youth participation by understanding their governmental needs, perspectives, experiences, and aspirations. It provides young Scots, aged 14 to 18, an opportunity to influence decision-makers in the Highlands.

This body, consisting of approximately 100 elected members, represents youth voices. Elections occur biennially and candidates are chosen directly from schools and youth forums. The Highland Youth Voice website serves as a pivotal platform where members can discuss issues pertinent to them, partake in online policy debates, and experience a model of e-democracy through simplified online voting. Thus, the website encompasses three key features, forming an online forum that enables youth self-education, participation in policy discourse, and engagement in the e-democracy process.

== Civil society&#x27;s role ==

Civil society organizations have a pivotal role in democracies, as highlighted by theorists such as Alexis de Tocqueville, acting as platforms for citizens to gain knowledge about public affairs and as sources of power beyond the state&#x27;s reach. According to Hans Klein, a public policy researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology, there exist several obstacles to participation in these forums, including logistical challenges of physical meetings. Klein&#x27;s study of a civic association in the northeastern US revealed that electronic communication significantly boosted the organization&#x27;s capacity to achieve its objectives. Given the relatively low cost of exchanging information over the Internet and its potential for wide reach, the medium has become an attractive venue for disseminating political information, especially among interest groups and parties operating on smaller budgets.&#x27;&quot;

For example, environmental or social interest groups might leverage the Internet as a cost-effective mechanism to raise awareness around their causes. Unlike traditional media outlets, like television or newspapers, which often necessitate substantial financial investments, the Internet provides an affordable and extensive platform for information dissemination. As such, the Internet could potentially supplant certain traditional modes of political communication, such as telephone, television, newspapers, and radio. Consequently, civil society has been increasingly integrating into the online realm.

Civic society encompasses various types of associations. The term &quot;interest group&quot; is typically used to refer to formal organizations focused on specific social groups, economic sectors like trade unions, business and professional associations, or specific issues such as abortion, gun control, or the environment. Many of these traditional interest groups have well-established organizational structures and formal membership rules, primarily oriented towards influencing government and policy-making processes. Transnational advocacy networks assemble loose coalitions of these organizations under common umbrella organizations that cross national borders.

Innovative tools are increasingly being developed to empower bloggers, webmasters, and social media owners. These aim to transition from the Internet&#x27;s strictly informational use to its application as a medium for social organization, independent of top-down initiatives. For instance, the concept of Calls to action is a novel approach that enables webmasters to inspire their audience into action without the need for explicit leadership. This trend is global, with countries like India cultivating an active blogosphere that encourages internet users to express their perspectives and opinions.

The Internet serves multifaceted roles for these organizations. It functions as a platform for lobbying elected officials, public representatives, and policy elites; networking with affiliated associations and groups; mobilizing organizers, activists, and members through action alerts, newsletters, and emails; raising funds and recruiting support; and conveying their messages to the public via traditional news media channels.

=== Deliberative democracy ===
The Internet holds a pivotal role in deliberative democracy, a model that underscores dialogue, open discussion, and access to diverse perspectives in decision-making. It provides an interactive platform and functions as a vital instrument for research within the deliberative process. The Internet facilitates the exchange of ideas through a myriad of platforms such as websites, blogs, and social networking sites like Twitter, all of which champion freedom of expression.[citation needed] It allows for easily accessible and cost-effective information, paving the way for change. One of the intrinsic attributes of the Internet is its unregulated nature, offering a platform for all viewpoints, regardless of their accuracy. The autonomy granted by the Internet can foster and advocate change, a critical factor in e-democracy.

A notable development in the application of e-democracy in the deliberative process is the California Report Card. This tool was created by the Data and Democracy Initiative of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at the University of California, Berkeley, in collaboration with Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom. Launched in January 2014, the California Report Card is a web application optimized for mobile use, aimed at facilitating online deliberative democracy. The application features a brief opinion poll on six pertinent issues, after which participants are invited to join an online &quot;café&quot;. In this space, they are grouped with users sharing similar views through Principal Component Analysis, and are encouraged to participate in the deliberative process by suggesting new political issues and rating the suggestions of other participants. The design of the California Report Card is intended to minimize the influence of private agendas on the discussion.

Openforum.com.au also exemplifies eDemocracy. This non-profit Australian project facilitates high-level policy discussions, drawing participants such as politicians, senior public servants, academics, business professionals, and other influential stakeholders.

The Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN Act), presented as an alternative to SOPA and PIPA, garners the support of major companies like Google and Facebook. Its website, Keep The Web Open, not only provides full access to the bill but also incorporates public input—over 150 modifications have been made through user contributions.

The peer-to-patent project allows public participation in the patent review process by providing research and &#x27;prior art&#x27; publications for patent examiners to assess the novelty of an invention. In this process, the community nominates ten pieces of prior art to be reviewed by the patent examiner. This not only enables direct communication between the public and the patent examiner but also creates a structured environment that prompts participants to provide relevant information to aid in decision-making. By allowing experts and the general public to collaborate in finding solutions, the project aims to enhance the efficacy of the decision-making process. It offers a platform for citizens to participate and express their ideas beyond merely checking boxes that limit their opinions to predefined options.

=== Voting and polling ===

One significant challenge in implementing e-democracy is ensuring the security of internet-voting systems. The potential interference from viruses and malware, which could alter or inhibit citizens&#x27; votes on critical issues, hinders the widespread adoption of e-democracy as long as such cybersecurity threats persist.

E-voting presents several practical challenges that can affect its legitimacy in elections. For instance, electronic voting machines can be vulnerable to physical interference, as they are often left unattended prior to elections, making them susceptible to tampering. This issue led to a decision by the Netherlands in 2017 to count election votes manually. Furthermore, &#x27;Direct Recording Electronic&#x27; (DRE) systems, used in numerous US states, are quickly becoming outdated and prone to faults. A study by USENIX discovered that certain DREs in New Jersey inaccurately counted votes, potentially casting votes for unintended candidates without voters&#x27; knowledge. The study found these inconsistencies to be widespread with that specific machine. Despite the potential of electronic voting to increase voter turnout, the absence of a paper trail in DREs can lead to untraceable errors, which could undermine its application in digital democracy.

Diminished participation in democracy may stem from the proliferation of polls and surveys, potentially leading to a condition known as survey fatigue.

=== Government openness and accessibility ===

Through Listserv&#x27;s, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can disseminate information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. For instance, many government representatives, including Rhode Island State Treasurer Frank T. Caprio, have begun to utilize Twitter as an easy medium for communication.

Several non-governmental websites, like transparent.gov.com, and USA.gov, have developed cross-jurisdiction, customer-focused applications that extract information from thousands of governmental organizations into a unified system, making it easier for citizens to access information.

E-democracy has led to a simplified process and access to government information for public-sector agencies and citizens. For example, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records for admission in county court proceedings. Indiana became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically using Electronic Postmark technology.

The internet has increased government accessibility to news, policies, and contacts in the 21st century. In 2000, only two percent of government sites offered three or more services online; in 2007, that figure was 58 percent. Also, in 2007, 89 percent of government sites allowed the public to email a public official directly rather than merely emailing the webmaster (West, 2007)&quot;(Issuu).

== Controversies and concern ==

=== Opposition ===
Information and communications technologies can be utilized for both democratic and anti-democratic purposes. For instance, digital technology can be used to promote both coercive control and active participation. The vision of anti-democratic use of technology is exemplified in George Orwell&#x27;s Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Critiques associated with direct democracy are also considered applicable to e-democracy. This includes the potential for direct governance to cause the polarization of opinions, populism, and demagoguery.

=== Cybersecurity ===

The current inability to protect internet traffic from interference and manipulation has significantly limited the potential of e-democracy for decision-making. As a result, most experts express opposition to the use of the internet for widespread voting.

=== Internet censorship ===

In countries with severe government censorship, the full potential of e-democracy might not be realized. Internet clampdowns often occur during extensive political protests. For instance, the series of internet blackouts in the Middle East in 2011, termed as the &quot;Arab Net Crackdown&quot;, provides a significant example. Governments in Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Iran, and Yemen have all implemented total internet censorship in response to the numerous pro-democracy demonstrations within their respective nations. These lockdowns were primarily instituted to prevent the dissemination of cell phone videos that featured images of government violence against protesters.

=== Social media manipulation ===

Joshua A. Tucker and his colleagues critique e-democracy, pointing out that the adaptability and openness of social media may allow political entities to manipulate it for their own ends. They suggest that authorities could use social media to spread authoritarian practices in several ways. Firstly, by intimidating opponents, monitoring private conversations, and even jailing those who voice undesirable opinions. Secondly, by flooding online spaces with pro-regime messages, thereby diverting and occupying these platforms. Thirdly, by disrupting signal access to hinder the flow of information. Lastly, by banning globalized platforms and websites.

=== Populism concerns ===
A study that interviewed elected officials in Austria&#x27;s parliament revealed a broad and strong opposition to e-democracy. These officials held the view that citizens, generally uninformed, should limit their political engagement to voting. The task of sharing opinions and ideas, they contended, belonged solely to elected representatives.

Contrary to this view, theories of epistemic democracy suggest that greater public engagement contributes to the aggregation of knowledge and intelligence. This active participation, proponents argue, enables democracies to better discern the truth.

=== Stop Online Piracy Act ===

The introduction of H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), in the United States House of Representatives, was perceived by many internet users as an attack on internet democracy. A contributor to the Huffington Post argued that defeating SOPA was crucial for the preservation of democracy and freedom of speech.

Significantly, SOPA was indefinitely postponed following widespread protests, which included a site blackout by popular websites like Wikipedia on 18 January 2012.

A comparable event occurred in India towards the end of 2011, when the country&#x27;s Communication and IT Minister Kapil Sibal suggested pre-screening content for offensive material before its publication on the internet, with no clear mechanism for appeal. Subsequent reports, however, quote Sibal as stating that there would be no restrictions on internet use.

== Suitable government models ==
=== Representative democracy ===

A radical shift from a representative government to an internet-mediated direct democracy is not considered likely. Nonetheless, proponents suggest that a &quot;hybrid model&quot; which leverages the internet for enhanced governmental transparency and greater community involvement in decision-making could be forthcoming. The selection of committees, local town and city decisions, and other people-centric decisions could be more readily facilitated through this approach. This doesn&#x27;t indicate a shift in the principles of democracy but rather an adaptation in the tools utilized to uphold them. E-democracy would not serve as a means to enact direct democracy, but rather as a tool to enable a more participatory form of democracy as it exists currently.

=== Electronic direct democracy ===

Supporters of e-democracy often foresee a transition from a representative democracy to a direct democracy, facilitated by technology, viewing this transition as an ultimate goal of e-democracy. In an electronic direct democracy (EDD) – also referred to as open source governance or collaborative e-democracy – citizens are directly involved in the legislative function through electronic means. They vote electronically on legislation, propose new legislation, and recall representatives, if any are retained.

==== Technology supporting electronic direct democracy ====
Technology to support electronic direct democracy (EDD) has been researched and developed at the Florida Institute of Technology, where it has been applied within student organizations. Many other software development projects are currently underway, along with numerous supportive and related projects. Several of these projects are now collaborating on a cross-platform architecture within the framework of the Meta-government project.

EDD as a system is not fully implemented in a political government anywhere in the world, although several initiatives are currently forming. In the United States, businessman and politician Ross Perot was a prominent supporter of EDD, advocating for &quot;electronic town halls&quot; during his 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns. Switzerland, already partially governed by direct democracy, is making progress towards such a system.
Senator On-Line, an Australian political party established in 2007, proposes to institute an EDD system so that Australians can decide which way the senators vote on each and every bill. A similar initiative was formed 2002 in Sweden where the party Direktdemokraterna, running for the Parliament, offered its members the power to decide the actions of the party over all or some areas of decision, or to use a proxy with immediate recall for one or several areas.

=== Liquid democracy ===

Liquid democracy, or direct democracy incorporating a delegable proxy, enables citizens to appoint a proxy for voting on their behalf, while retaining the ability to cast their own vote on legislation. This voting and proxy assignment could be conducted electronically. Extending this concept, proxies could establish proxy chains; for instance, if citizen A appoints citizen B, and B appoints citizen C, and only C votes on a proposed bill, C&#x27;s vote will represent all three of them. Citizens could also rank their proxies by preference, meaning that if their primary proxy does not vote, their vote could be cast by their second-choice proxy.

=== Wikidemocracy ===
One form of e-democracy that has been proposed is &quot;wikidemocracy&quot;, where the codex of laws in a government legislature could be editable via a wiki, similar to Wikipedia. In 2012, J Manuel Feliz-Teixeira suggested that the resources necessary for implementing wikidemocracy were already accessible. He envisages a system in which citizens can participate in legislative, executive, and judiciary roles via a wiki-system. Every citizen would have free access to this wiki and a personal ID to make policy reforms continuously until the end of December, when all votes would be tallied. Perceived benefits of wikidemocracy include a cost-free system that eliminates elections and the need for parliament or representatives, as citizens would directly represent themselves, and the ease of expressing one&#x27;s opinion. However, there are several potential obstacles and disagreements. The digital divide and educational inequality could hinder the full potential of a wikidemocracy. Similarly, differing rates of technological adoption mean that some people might readily accept new methods, while others reject or are slow to adapt. Security is also a concern; we would need to trust that the system administrators would ensure a high level of integrity to safeguard votes in the public domain. Peter Levine concurs that wikidemocracy could increase discussion on political and moral issues but disagrees with Feliz-Teixeira, arguing that representatives and formal governmental structures would still be needed.

The term &quot;wikidemocracy&quot; is also used to refer to more specific instances of e-democracy. For example, in August 2011 in Argentina, the voting records from the presidential election were made available to the public in an online format for scrutiny. More broadly, the term can refer to the democratic values and environments facilitated by wikis.

In 2011, a group in Finland explored the concept of wikidemocracy by creating an online &quot;shadow government program&quot;. This initiative was essentially a compilation of the political views and goals of various Finnish groups, assembled on a wiki.

=== Egora ===
Egora, also known as &quot;intelligent democracy&quot;, is a free software application developed for political opinion formation and decision-making. It is filed under the copyleft licensing system. The name &quot;Egora&quot; is a blend of &quot;electronic&quot; and &quot;agora&quot;, a term from Ancient Greek denoting the central public space in city-states (polis). The ancient agora was the hub of public life, facilitating social interactions, business transactions, and discussions.

Drawing from this Ancient Greek concept, Egora aims to foster a new, rational, efficient, and incorruptible form of democratic organization. It allows users to form their own political philosophies from diverse ideas, ascertain the most popular ideas among the public, organize meetings to scrutinize and debate these ideas, and employ a simple algorithm to identify true representatives of the public will.

== In popular media ==
The theme of e-democracy has frequently appeared in science fiction. Works such as &quot;David&#x27;s Sling&quot; by Marc Stiegler and &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; by Orson Scott Card notably predicted forms of the internet before it actually came into existence. These early conceptualizations of the internet, and their implications for democracy, served as major plot drivers in these stories.

=== David&#x27;s Sling ===
In &quot;David&#x27;s Sling&quot;, Marc Stiegler presents e-democracy as a strategy leveraged by a team of hackers to construct a computer-controlled smart weapon. They utilize an online debate platform, the Information Decision Duel, where two parties delve deeply into the intricacies of their arguments, dissecting the pros and cons before a neutral referee selects the more convincing side. This fictional portrayal of an internet-like system for public discourse echoes real-world aspirations for e-democracy, underscoring thorough issue analysis, technological enablement, and transparency. The book&#x27;s dedication, &quot;To those who never stop seeking the third alternatives,&quot; epitomizes this emphasis on comprehensive issue scrutiny.

=== Ender&#x27;s Game ===
Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; also explores e-democracy, with the internet portrayed as a powerful platform for political discourse and social change. Two of the characters, siblings Valentine and Peter, use this platform to anonymously share their political views, gaining considerable influence. Their activities lead to a significant political shift, even though they are just children posing as adults. This highlights the issue of true identity within online participation and raises questions about the potential for manipulation in e-democracy.

=== Other portrayals ===
E-democracy has also been depicted in:

*&quot;The Evitable Conflict&quot; by Isaac Asimov: Machines manage the economy for common welfare and make all key societal decisions.
*&quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein: A sentient computer assists Lunar colonists in their rebellion against Earth, with significant decisions made through public electronic voting.
*&quot;Distraction&quot; by Bruce Sterling: The novel explores potential perils of e-democracy in a future United States heavily influenced by the internet and electronic voting.
*&quot;Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom&quot; by Cory Doctorow: The future society in this work practices digital direct democracy with a reputation-based currency called &quot;Whuffie&quot;.
*&quot;Rainbows End&quot; by Vernor Vinge: The novel imagines societal changes due to technological advancements, including more participatory democracy through continuous public polling and consensus-building tools.
*&quot;The Prefect&quot; by Alastair Reynolds: The narrative centers on a future society where an artificial intelligence, the Prefect, administers a democratic system.

These works provide varied perspectives on the potential benefits and challenges of e-democracy.

<text>Death Cab for Cutie (commonly abbreviated to DCFC or Death Cab) is an American rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington, in 1997. Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s music has been classified as indie rock, indie pop, and alternative rock. The band is currently composed of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Nick Harmer (bass), Dave Depper (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Zac Rae (keyboards, guitar), and Jason McGerr (drums).

The band was originally a solo project by Gibbard, who expanded the project into a complete group upon getting a record deal. They released their debut album, &quot;Something About Airplanes&quot;, in 1998. The band&#x27;s fourth album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;, broke into the mainstream both critically and commercially; its songs were featured in various TV series and films. The band&#x27;s major label debut for Atlantic Records, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Plans&quot;, went platinum. Founding guitarist Chris Walla left the band in 2014 after 17 years. The band&#x27;s tenth and latest studio album, &quot;Asphalt Meadows&quot;, was released on September 16, 2022. Alongside their ten full-length studio albums, the band has released four EPs, two live EPs, one live album, and one demo album.

== History ==

=== Early years (1997–2002) ===
Death Cab for Cutie, the name deriving from the Vivian Stanshall/Neil Innes song &quot;Death Cab For Cutie&quot;, began in 1997 as a solo project by Ben Gibbard when he was a guitarist for the band Pinwheel. He recorded under the name All-Time Quarterback. As Death Cab for Cutie, he released a cassette, &quot;You Can Play These Songs with Chords&quot;, during the same year. The release was surprisingly successful, and he decided to expand the project into a band, hiring Chris Walla (who worked on the cassette) on guitar, Nick Harmer on bass guitar, and Nathan Good on drums. Death Cab for Cutie was formed at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. Lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band&#x27;s development. Many of the early songs were recorded in the basement of a house on Ellis Street in which Gibbard lived with several roommates.

The four released their debut album, &quot;Something About Airplanes&quot;, on August 18, 1998. In 1998, the band met their manager, Jordan Kurland. Kurland had heard the band praised, and after a failed attempt to see them perform at South by Southwest he met them while touring with a client.

The band released &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; in March 2000. Nathan Good left the band during the making of the album and was replaced briefly by Jayson Tolzdorf-Larson. Gibbard played drums on the majority of the album, with Good&#x27;s playing on &quot;The Employment Pages&quot; and &quot;Company Calls Epilogue&quot; kept on the final release. Although Tolzdorf-Larson did not contribute to the album, he did appear on the song &quot;Spring Break Broke&quot; from the &quot;Death Cab for Fiver&quot; 7-inch record. He also joined the band on two tours, including their first full tour of the United States. Tolzdorf-Larson was later replaced by Michael Schorr, who would first appear on &quot;The Forbidden Love EP&quot;, released on October 24, 2000.

In 2001, Death Cab for Cutie released their third album, &quot;The Photo Album&quot;. Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as &quot;The Stability EP&quot;. The album produced the band&#x27;s first charting single, &quot;A Movie Script Ending&quot;, which reached number 123 on the UK Singles Chart, and was the first of three songs by the band to be used on the television show &quot;The O.C.&quot; &quot;I Was a Kaleidoscope&quot; and &quot;We Laugh Indoors&quot; reached numbers 115 and 122 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively.

=== Transatlanticism (2003) ===
In 2003 there was another change of drummer with Jason McGerr, who had previously played in the band Eureka Farm with Gibbard and Harmer, joining the band. McGerr&#x27;s debut came with the band&#x27;s next release, their fourth album &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;, which was released in October 2003. The album received critical acclaim and launched the band into mainstream commercial success, with the two singles &quot;The Sound of Settling&quot; and &quot;Title and Registration&quot;, appearing in the soundtracks of the television shows &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Californication&quot;, and the films &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;, &quot;Easy A&quot;, and &quot;Mean Creek&quot;. A tenth-anniversary version containing demos and outtakes was released in 2013.

=== Signing to Atlantic and &quot;Plans&quot; (2004–2006) ===

In early 2004, the band recorded a live EP, entitled &quot;The John Byrd EP&quot;, named for their sound engineer. It was released on Barsuk Records in March.

Death Cab for Cutie had been contacted by major labels on-and-off for several years, but it was only after the proven success of &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; that they decided to start talking to labels about a potential deal. The fact that they had already achieved considerable success allowed the band to negotiate with a lot of creative freedom. According to their manager Jordan Kurland, the band had spoken to &quot;pretty much all of them&quot;, and then decided they were most satisfied with their offer from Atlantic Records. In November 2004, the band signed a &quot;long-term worldwide deal&quot; with Atlantic, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the band&#x27;s official website that nothing would change, except that &quot;next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7&quot;, there will be the letter &#x27;A&#x27; on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums.&quot; After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.

The band released their fifth studio album and debut major-label release, &quot;Plans&quot;, on August 30, 2005, to critical and commercial success. Two singles from the album, &quot;Soul Meets Body&quot; and &quot;Crooked Teeth&quot;, reached the top ten of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart, while the single &quot;I Will Follow You into the Dark&quot; became the band&#x27;s best-selling single to date. Death Cab for Cutie performed &quot;Crooked Teeth&quot; live on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on January 14, 2006. &quot;Plans&quot; received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album of 2005, as well as achieving gold certification in 2006 after being featured on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album chart for 47 consecutive weeks, and later was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in early May 2008.

The band released a touring DVD, &quot;Drive Well, Sleep Carefully&quot;, in 2005. Copies of the DVD were given away to promote animal rights, and the band are supporters of the activist group PETA. In early 2006, the band announced the upcoming release of &quot;&quot;, which features eleven short films inspired by songs from the &quot;Plans&quot; album, each directed by a different person. The videos were posted one at a time on the band&#x27;s website, and the DVD went on sale April 11, 2006. The iTunes Store began selling the videos (formatted for iPod) early on March 28, 2006. Lance Bangs, P.R. Brown, Ace Norton, Jeffrey Brown, Lightborne, Autumn de Wilde, Rob Schrab, Laurent Briet and Monkmus, as well as Aaron Stewart-Ahn, are among directors that have contributed to the project. An episode of MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean&quot; played these videos for the full hour with additional discussion with members of the band. Death Cab for Cutie made their first appearance at Neil Young&#x27;s annual Bridge School Benefit, and completed their lengthy 2006 tour of the United States on December 10, 2006, finishing with a show at the KeyArena in Seattle, Washington.

=== &quot;Narrow Stairs&quot; and &quot;The Open Door EP&quot; (2007–2009) ===
Walla claimed on October 18, 2007, that a new album was &quot;in full swing&quot; and that they had six songs completed. He went on to call the new music &quot;weird,&quot; &quot;spectacular,&quot; and &quot;creepy,&quot; saying that it contained &quot;lots of blood.&quot; He noted that the album had a &quot;Can jam&quot; that lasted 10 minutes, which Walla said that he would have never imagined doing in 1998. In a &quot;Billboard&quot; piece in January 2008, the band promised the album to be a &quot;curve ball&quot; and said that although it would have slower songs, there would be some surprises. Walla said, &quot;I&#x27;m really excited about it. It&#x27;s really got some teeth. The landscape of the thing is way, way more lunar than the urban meadow sort of thing that has been happening for the last couple of records.&quot; Walla added that the album was &quot;louder and more dissonant and ... abrasive.&quot; They claimed that they were influenced by &quot;synth-punk band Brainiac.&quot;

Their sixth full-length album, &quot;Narrow Stairs&quot;, was released on May 12, 2008. The first single, &quot;I Will Possess Your Heart&quot;, was released on March 18, 2008. The album version of the song is over eight minutes in length, leading radio and promotional edits to remove the extended intro to shorten the song to four minutes. The second single, &quot;Cath...&quot;, was released on July 21, 2008, and the third single, &quot;Grapevine Fires&quot;, was released on March 3, 2009. The two singles &quot;I Will Possess Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Cath...&quot; both reached the top ten of the Alternative Songs chart, while &quot;Grapevine Fires&quot; reached number 21. In an album review, MTV writer James Montgomery said &quot;Narrow Stairs is a great album, one that could make them very famous, but could very well also kill their careers,&quot; and although &quot;Death Cab for Cutie had gone insane,&quot; he believed the LP could be &quot;an early contender for the best album of 2008.&quot; Indeed, &quot;Narrow Stairs&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Alternative Music Album&quot; and &quot;I Will Possess Your Heart&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Best Rock Song&quot; at the 51st Grammy Awards. The band lost in both categories, but prompted debate after appearing at the ceremony sporting blue ribbons to protest against what they view as the excessive use of Auto-Tune in the music industry. &quot;Narrow Stairs&quot; was their first album to reach No.1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on May 31, 2008. Though the album achieved strong success, Gibbard went on to call it the band&#x27;s most &quot;depressing record&quot;.

On March 31, 2009, the band released &quot;The Open Door EP&quot;, containing tracks left off &quot;Narrow Stairs&quot; as well as a demo for &quot;Talking Bird&quot;. &quot;The Open Door EP&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards. In 2009 the band wrote the song, &quot;Meet Me on the Equinox&quot; for &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Meet Me on the Equinox&quot; was not the first song that Death Cab for Cutie contributed to a soundtrack, as they contributed &quot;Soul Meets Body&quot; to the soundtrack for Catch and Release in 2006.

=== &quot;Codes and Keys&quot; (2010–2012) ===
The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Codes and Keys&quot;, was released on May 31, 2011. Ben Gibbard and Nick Harmer have both been quoted as saying that the album was &quot;a much less guitar-centric album than we&#x27;ve ever made before&quot;. The 1983 album &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot;, by English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), was a major influence on the record.

In March 2011, Ben Gibbard performed a new Death Cab for Cutie song at a solo concert in San Francisco, which would later be revealed as the title track from &quot;Codes and Keys&quot;. The track list for the album was released on Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s website on March 15, 2011.

The first single from the album, &quot;You Are a Tourist&quot;, was released on March 29, 2011. The song&#x27;s music video was their first ever live, scripted, one-take music video shoot: the group streamed a live performance of the music video as it was being recorded on April 5, 2011. The video was accomplished in a single take, using multiple cameras, and no edits or re-takes. The production employed dancers, actors, and projected images. &quot;You Are a Tourist&quot; was also Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s first (and to date, only) single to reach number one, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs, Adult Alternative Songs, and Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles charts, as well as reaching number three on the Rock Songs. The band released the video for the song &quot;Home is a Fire&quot; on May 9, 2011, featuring street artist Shepard Fairey plastering lyrics from the song around Los Angeles. &quot;Stay Young, Go Dancing&quot; was released as the second single on September 26, 2011, reaching number 31 on the Alternative Songs chart. &quot;Underneath the Sycamore&quot; was released as the third single on January 10, 2012, but did not chart. &quot;Codes and Keys&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012.

The band was due to play at the Ottawa Bluesfest on July 17, 2011, but the outdoor stage collapsed earlier in the evening after sudden severe weather hit the area. On their website, the band posted: &quot;Our hearts go out to those that were injured and we are so thankful that no one was killed.&quot;

In 2012, the band toured across the globe, starting in Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia. In April and May, the band toured in the United States with members of the Magik*Magik Orchestra, who collaborated on tracks on &quot;Codes and Keys&quot;. After headlining the inaugural Bunbury Music Festival in Cincinnati, the band played summer festivals in Europe.

=== Departure of Walla and &quot;Kintsugi&quot; (2013–2016) ===
On October 11, 2013, they began working on their eighth studio album, produced by Rich Costey. In an interview with &quot;Stereogum&quot;, Gibbard said of the new album, &quot;I do think from start to finish it&#x27;s a much better record than &quot;Codes and Keys&quot;. If that record turned anybody off, I feel pretty strongly that this one could win them back. There are threads in this one that connect back to our earliest stuff that people love.&quot;

As part of the 2014 Record Store Day, the band released its first live album, a vinyl-only double LP recorded during various 2012 tour dates with Magik*Magik Orchestra. Included within the packaging was a code for a digital download of the recording.

On August 13, 2014, after 17 years as a member of Death Cab for Cutie, guitarist and songwriter Chris Walla decided to part ways with the band, with his last performance occurring on September 13, 2014, at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia. In a 2015 interview, Walla explained that he left the band because he found himself uninterested in the music they were working on for &quot;Kintsugi&quot;. He critiqued the songs as &quot;flat,&quot; none of his ideas seemed to be sticking, and he felt the band needed an infusion of fresh blood; &quot;I was really dissatisfied with where the Death Cab stuff had gotten to when I quit as producer, and that’s why I quit.&quot; Walla plans to &quot;continue making music, producing records, and erring on the side of benevolence and beauty whenever possible.&quot; When asked in an interview about Walla&#x27;s involvement in the eighth album, McGerr confirmed that Walla &quot;played on everything and has been involved all the way through, even in the mixing. Even though he&#x27;s played his last show with us, he&#x27;s still been involved in everything involving this record.&quot;

On January 12, 2015, the band officially announced the album, titled &quot;Kintsugi&quot;, which was released on March 31, 2015. &quot;Kintsugi&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. The band toured &quot;Kintsugi&quot; across the world through September 2016, with new touring members Dave Depper (guitar/keyboards/backing vocals) and Zac Rae (keyboards/guitar) replacing Walla. The album was the first since Gibbard&#x27;s highly publicized divorce from actress Zooey Deschanel, which is believed to have been a major influence on several of the album&#x27;s songs.
In October 2016, the band announced the release of a new standalone single, entitled &quot;Million Dollar Loan&quot;. The song, intended to be a protest song against Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump, was released as a part of a campaign entitled 30 Days, 30 Songs , in which a previously unreleased song by a different artist was put out each day. Other artists participating in the project included Aimee Mann, who sang on Gibbard&#x27;s solo album, as well as My Morning Jacket&#x27;s Jim James and R.E.M. In a Facebook post about the song, Gibbard mentioned both Depper and Rae as part of the band and contributors to the writing of the song&#x27;s arrangement, indicating that the two had joined the band on a full-time basis.

&quot;Kintsugi&quot;, the name of the album, refers to a Japanese repair method: &quot;(Noun) To repair with gold; The art of repairing pottery with gold or silver lacquer and understanding that the piece is more beautiful for having been broken.&quot;

=== &quot;Thank You for Today&quot; and &quot;The Blue EP&quot; (2017–2020) ===
On November 17, 2017, the band announced via Instagram that they had begun work on a new studio album due in 2018. On May 1, 2018, the band published a teaser video indicating an August 2018 release date. On June 12, 2018, the band announced the title of the new album, &quot;Thank You for Today&quot;, and shared the lead single from the album, &quot;Gold Rush&quot;. Following this, on July 19, 2018, &quot;I Dreamt We Spoke Again&quot; was released. &quot;Autumn Love&quot; was the last single to be released on August 1, 2018.

The album was released on August 17, 2018. It is the band&#x27;s first album without Chris Walla, and the first album to feature Depper and Rae. Lauren Mayberry was also featured on the album, contributing vocals on &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. On August 28, 2018, the album ranked No. 1 on the Billboard Top Rock Albums and Alternative Albums charts.

On July 29, 2019, the band announced a new EP, &quot;The Blue EP&quot;, would be released on September 6, 2019. On the same day, they also released the first single from the EP, &quot;Kids in 99&quot;, whose lyrics are loosely based on the Olympic pipeline explosion. On 16 August 2019, the EP&#x27;s second single, &quot;To The Ground&quot; was released.

On December 2, 2020, the band announced that a Bandcamp exclusive EP titled &quot;The Georgia E.P.&quot; would be released for 24 hours only on December 4. The album is a collection of covers by artists from Georgia. The proceeds will go to Stacey Abrams organization Fair Fight Action in honor of Georgia voting for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, as well as the 2020–21 United States Senate election in Georgia and the 2020–21 United States Senate special election in Georgia.

===&quot;Asphalt Meadows&quot; and touring with The Postal Service (2021–2024)===
The band returned to in-person live performances after 18 months in September 2021, playing shows with Perfume Genius and Deep Sea Diver. On October 29, 2021, the band shared a commemorative 20-year anniversary reissue of &quot;The Photo Album&quot; which featured studio outtakes, demos and rare recordings.

In February 2022, the band shared their first new music since the release of &quot;The Georgia E.P.&quot;: A cover of Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for the Sunrise&quot;, which was recorded as part of Gibbard&#x27;s curated tribute album to Ono entitled &quot;Ocean Child: Songs of Yoko Ono&quot;.

On May 5, 2022, the band confirmed that they had finished work on their tenth studio album, which was announced the following week on May 11 as being titled &quot;Asphalt Meadows&quot;, which was released on September 16. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Roman Candles&quot;, was released on the same day, alongside the announcement of a North American tour with Low and Yo La Tengo.

Between 2023 and 2024, the band embarked on an extensive arena tour with Gibbard&#x27;s other project, The Postal Service, performing both &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; and &quot;Give Up&quot; in full to celebrate the albums&#x27; 20th anniversaries.

At the tour&#x27;s close in August 2024, Gibbard noted that the band would take their time in writing and recording an eleventh studio album. Speaking to &quot;NME&quot;, Gibbard noted: &quot;The band has been writing intermittently, over the last couple of years. I can’t give you a release date for a new record, but I think we’re going to take time off from touring and being in the limelight. We have asked our fans for a lot over the last two years. Speaking merely strategically, it is very much in our best interest to get the fuck out of people’s faces! We’re from an era where artists went away for a while, into the woodshed.&quot;

== Musical style ==
Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s music has been labeled indie rock, indie pop, emo, and alternative rock. Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s early work on &quot;You Can Play These Songs with Chords&quot; was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;emotion through its lack of emotion&quot;. Pitchfork also remarked that the work on the cassette was &quot;ultra-lo-fi&quot;. On &quot;Something About Airplanes&quot; the band&#x27;s style remained similar, with some new instrumental work introduced; &quot;flute, synth, or cello&quot; were noted by AllMusic&#x27;s Nitsuh Abebe. On &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot; the band again expanded their use of unorthodox instruments, including organ and glockenspiel. Pitchfork called them a &quot;gentle niche&quot; in the current rock climate, compared with bands such as Modest Mouse and Built to Spill.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewed &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; and commented that it contained &quot;melodic, melancholy songs about feeling both smart and confused, hopelessly romantic but wary of love.&quot; Gibbard&#x27;s voice was described as &quot;plaintive boy-next-door&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented on the music on &quot;Plans&quot;, saying &quot;The lush arrangements are long on hothouse organs and pianos, but short on the squirmy guitars and squirrelly beats that, on Gibbard&#x27;s best work, offset his sweet voice and borderline-maudlin poetics with a sense of emotional danger.&quot; The band&#x27;s music on &quot;Plans&quot; was described by the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; as &quot;a literate, whispery style, the kind of stuff that normally sounds better in headphones than in large venues&quot;.

In an interview with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he &quot;never sit[s] down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I&#x27;m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it has more to do with the fact that just what&#x27;s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision.&quot;

== Band name ==
Gibbard took the band name from the song &quot;Death Cab for Cutie&quot;, which was written by Neil Innes and Vivian Stanshall and recorded by their group the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. The song is a track on the Bonzo&#x27;s 1967 debut album, &quot;Gorilla&quot;, and was performed by them in the Beatles film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. The title was originally that of a story in an old pulp fiction crime magazine that Innes came across in a street market. In a 2011 interview, Gibbard stated, &quot;The name was never supposed to be something that someone was going to reference 15 years on. So yeah, I would absolutely go back and give it a more obvious name.&quot;

<text>The Ben Stiller Show is an American sketch comedy series starring Ben Stiller that aired in two iterations, the first series airing six episodes on MTV in 1990, and the second series airing 12 episodes on Fox from September 27, 1992, to January 17, 1993, with a 13th episode airing in 1995 on Comedy Central. The Fox version also starred Andy Dick, Janeane Garofalo and Bob Odenkirk. Character actor John F. O&#x27;Donohue also appeared in every episode.

The program featured numerous filmed comedy segments, many of which parodied pop culture trends from the late &#x27;80s to early &#x27;90s. Despite receiving mostly positive reviews, Fox canceled the series after only 13 episodes, due to low ratings.

Unlike most sketch comedy programs, &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; did not use a studio audience, and was the first Fox sketch comedy program not to use a laugh track. The semi spinoff, &quot;The Andy Dick Show&quot;, used the same format. After cancellation, the series won the 1993 Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program.

==MTV series==
The original MTV version of &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; aired in 1990, and ran for six episodes. It is not available on DVD, although excerpts from the program are featured as a bonus on the release of the Fox series. Produced by Jim Jones, who would go on to produce the Fox series and starring Ben Stiller and co writer Jeff Kahn, it was a self effacing show within a show format.

Part of MTV&#x27;s pre-&quot;Real World&quot; and experimental Vid-Com season of 1989 to 1990, it was interspersed with music videos that Ben and company would introduce in their short comedy sketches. Regulars included Harry O&#x27;Reilly and Ben&#x27;s sister Amy Stiller. Guest stars included Ben&#x27;s parents Anne Meara and Jerry Stiller, as well as John F. O&#x27;Donohue, Melina Kanakaredes, Al Lewis and MTV regular Martha Quinn.

==Episodes==
==Home media==
Warner Home Video released all 13 episodes of the Fox version of &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on December 2, 2003.

==Reunion==
In November 2012, there was a reunion at the New York Comedy Festival with the original cast members. Apatow hosted the reunion which featured Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Andy Dick and staff writers Robert Cohen and Jeff Kahn. Bob Odenkirk also appeared via Skype video chat.

<doc id="594515" wikidata="Q6137309" url="?curid=594515" title="James Kilfedder">
<text>Sir James Alexander Kilfedder (16 July 1928 – 20 March 1995), usually known as Sir Jim Kilfedder, was a Northern Irish unionist politician.

==Early life==
Jim Kilfedder born in Kinlough, a village in the north of County Leitrim in what was then the Irish Free State. His family later moved to Enniskillen in neighbouring County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, where Jim was raised. Kilfedder was educated at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen and at Trinity College, Dublin (TCD). During his time at TCD, he acted as Auditor of the College Historical Society, one of the oldest undergraduate debating societies in the world. He became a barrister, called to the Irish Bar at King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin, in 1952 and to the English Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1958. He practised law in London.

==Political career==
At the 1964 general election, Kilfedder was elected as an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Member of Parliament for West Belfast. During the campaign, there were riots in Divis Street when the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) removed an Irish flag from the Sinn Féin offices of Billy McMillen. This followed a complaint by Kilfedder in the form of a telegram to the Minister of Home Affairs, Brian McConnell. It read &quot;Remove tricolour in Divis Street which is aimed to provoke and insult loyalists of Belfast.&quot; Kilfedder lost his seat at the 1966 election to Gerry Fitt. He was elected again in the 1970 general election for North Down, and held the seat until his death in 1995.

Kilfedder was elected for North Down in the 1973 Assembly election, signing Brian Faulkner&#x27;s pledge to support the White Paper which eventually established the Sunningdale Agreement but becoming an anti-White Paper Unionist after the election. In 1975 he stood for the same constituency in the Constitutional Convention election, polling over three quotas as a UUP member of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition (UUUC) although he refused to sign the UUUC&#x27;s pledge of conduct.

He left the UUP in 1977 in opposition to the party&#x27;s policies tending to integrationism, preferring to advocate the restoration of the Stormont administration. For a time he sat as an &quot;Independent Ulster Unionist&quot;. He contested the 1979 European Parliament Election under that label, finishing fourth in the count for the three seats, having overtaken the UUP leader Harry West on transfers.

In 1980 he formed the Ulster Popular Unionist Party (UPUP) and was re-elected under that label in all subsequent elections. He again topped the poll in the 1982 Assembly election and was elected as Speaker of the Assembly (to 1986). He generally took the Conservative whip at Westminster. Whilst Speaker, he was paid more than the Prime Minister.

==Death and legacy==
On 20 March 1995, while travelling by train into London from Gatwick Airport, Sir Jim Kilfedder died of a heart attack. This was the same day that the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; carried a front-page story saying that an Ulster MP had been targeted as one of twenty MPs invited by the LGBT rights organisation OutRage! in a letter to come out.

He died unmarried, survived by two sisters. Kilfedder was described as &quot;a phenomenon or perhaps a left-over from a remote era of Northern Irish politics when Ulster was represented by such figures as Lord Robert Grosvenor, Major Robin Chichester-Clark, Stratton Mills, and Rafton Pounder.&quot;

Kilfedder was described by Democratic Unionist Party MLA Peter Weir as &quot;the best MP North Down ever had.&quot;

The UPUP did not outlive him, and the by-election for his Commons seat was won by Robert McCartney, standing for the UK Unionist Party. McCartney had fought the seat in the 1987 general election as a &quot;Real Unionist&quot; with the backing of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship. At the 1987 election count, in his victory speech, Kilfedder had &quot;attacked his rival&#x27;s supporters as &#x27;a rag tag collection of people who shame the name of civil rights.&#x27; He said they included communists, Protestant paramilitaries and Gay Rights supporters and he promised to expose more in future.&quot; McCartney lost North Down in 2001 to Lady Hermon of the UUP.

Kilfedder&#x27;s personal and political papers (including constituency affairs) are held at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, reference D4127.

Kilfedder is buried in Roselawn Cemetery in East Belfast.

<text>The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a statistical survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The SIPP is designed to provide accurate and comprehensive information about the incomes of American individuals and households and their participation in income transfer programs.

The survey&#x27;s mission is to provide a nationally representative sample for evaluating annual and sub-annual income dynamics, movements into and out of government transfer programs, family and social context of individuals and households, and interactions among these items. A major use of the SIPP has been to evaluate the use of and eligibility for government programs and to analyze the impacts of options for modifying them.

SIPP data are used to evaluate the effectiveness of Federal, state, and local government programs.

==Methods== 
The SIPP gathers information from a series of panels, each with 14,000 to 37,000 households. Each panel lasts from 2.5 to 4 years. The SIPP sample is a multistage-stratified sample of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population. The respondents are all household members 15 years or older.

Each wave of interviews lasts four months. Interviews are conducted by personal visits and telephone calls.

Certain core questions are asked in every survey. Respondents are asked whether or not they participate in the labor force, what government programs they participated in, and about their incomes. Additional “topical modules” are added to the SIPP survey sometimes with questions on personal history, child care, wealth, program eligibility, child support, disability, school enrollment, taxes, and annual income.

The Census Bureau sponsors the survey under the authority of Title 13 of the United States Code, Section 182.
The SIPP was developed from the Income Survey Development Program, conducted between 1977 and 1981, which developed survey data collection strategies and instruments as well as data processing strategies for the SIPP. 

Statistics Canada conducted an analogous survey, the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID), a longitudinal study following each of a panel of 15,000 households for 6 years, from 1993 until 2011. This was replaced by the cross-sectional Canadian Income Survey in 2012.

== Content ==
While the main objective of SIPP is to provide accurate and comprehensive information about the income and program participation of individuals and households in the United States, SIPP also collects extensive data on many additional factors of economic well-being. Financial situations of households and individuals are not solely determined by their employment status and income. In order to create a more complete representation of national well-being, SIPP also collects extensive information concerning family dynamics, educational attainment, housing expenditures, asset ownership, health insurance, disability, childcare, and food security. These data put the income and program recipiency of individuals and households into the family and social context. Thus, researchers may examine the ways in which these factors interact to influence financial well-being and movement into or out-of government assistance programs.

== Uses ==

The main objective of the SIPP is to provide accurate and comprehensive information about the income and program participation of individuals and households in the United States.

The survey&#x27;s mission is to provide a nationally representative sample for evaluating: 1. annual and sub-annual income dynamics, 2. movement into and out of government transfer or assistance programs, and 3. effects of our changing family and social situations for individuals and households.

A major use of the SIPP has been to evaluate the use of and eligibility for government programs and to analyze the impacts of modifications to those programs. These kinds of information help in evaluating the economic status of the nation, show how things change, and give policy makers the facts that enable them to make better economic decisions.

SIPP produces national-level estimates for the U.S. resident population and subgroups. Although the SIPP design allows for both longitudinal and cross-sectional data analysis, SIPP is intended to primarily to support longitudinal studies. SIPP&#x27;s longitudinal features allow the analysis of selected dynamic characteristics of the population, such as changes in income, eligibility for and participation in transfer programs, household and family composition, labor force behavior, and other associated events.

One of the most important reasons for conducting SIPP is to gather detailed information on participation in transfer programs. Data from SIPP allow analysts to examine concurrent participation in multiple programs. SIPP data can also be used to address the following types of questions:

*How have changes in eligibility rules or benefit levels affected recipients? 
*How have changes in the eligibility rules affected the program target population, that is, those eligible to receive benefits? 
*How does income from other household members affect labor force participation and reasons for not working? 
*How do wealth and income patterns differ for various age, gender, and racial groups?

Because SIPP is a longitudinal survey, capturing changes in household and family composition over a multiyear period, it can also be used to address the following questions:

*What factors affect change in household and family structure and living arrangements?
*What are the interactions between changes in the structure of households and families and the distribution of income? 
*What effects do changes in household composition have on economic status and program eligibility? 
*What are the primary determinants of turnover in programs such as Food Stamps?
*What factors affect change in household and family structure and living arrangements?

==Re-engineered SIPP==

In response to budget pressures, the Survey of Income and Program Participation nearly ceased to exist in 2006. The survey, then beginning the process to convert the existing instrument format to more modern software, suspended the instrument conversion and prepared to shut down operations. The strident backlash and public petition from the public policy, academic, and partner agency communities led a large contingent of Senators and Representatives from Congress to endorse the petition to request the reinstatement of SIPP&#x27;s funding. With funding restored, the US Census Bureau began re-engineering the SIPP. The re-engineering focused on several key goals, including reducing burden on respondents, reducing program costs, improving accuracy, improving timeliness and accessibility, and improving relevance. The SIPP stakeholders and data users have been, and continue to be, critical partners for the SIPP program.

==Social Security Administration (SSA) Supplement==

The U.S. Census Bureau conducted the Social Security Administration Supplement on Retirement, Pensions, and Related Content (SSA Supplement) on behalf of the SSA. The SSA Supplement is a separate survey from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), even though the sample includes households that completed 2014 Wave 1 SIPP interviews. The topics included in the SSA Supplement are from previous SIPP panel topical modules.

Topics included in the SSA Supplement:

*Personal retirement plan contributions and withdrawals
*Participation in pension and retirement plans provided by an employer or business
*Marital history
*Health status
*Work, Adult, and Child disabilities

The 2014 SIPP removed these topics in order to reduce overall respondent burden since it is not necessary to ask them each wave. However, the SSA still needs the data from these topics to analyze the economic and social situation of people with disabilities and people in or approaching retirement. Examples include adjusting the age for retirement benefits, assessing people&#x27;s ability to save for retirement, estimating the number of legally eligible people for Social Security divorce benefits, and evaluating and modifying the disability criteria for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility.

The SSA Supplement was a one-time survey conducted after Wave 1 of the 2014 SIPP panel, from September through November 2014. All interviews were conducted by centralized telephone – there was no personal visit component.

<doc id="594519" wikidata="Q991871" url="?curid=594519" title="Bruce Weber (photographer)">
<text>Bruce Weber (born March 29, 1946) is an American fashion photographer and filmmaker known for his work with fashion brands and magazines.

Weber has directed several films, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot; (1988), a documentary about jazz musician Chet Baker, and &quot;Chop Suey&quot; (2001), a portrait of a wrestler. &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot; received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature and a Cinecritica Award at the Venice Film Festival.

Weber is also the founder and co-owner of Little Bear Press, which publishes books and the independent arts magazine &quot;All-American&quot;.

Weber has been accused of sexual assault by more than 20 models, and has been the subject of three lawsuits, all of which have reached settlements.

He currently resides in Miami and is married to , who is also his agent.

==Life and work==
Weber was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, to a Jewish family. His fashion photography first appeared in the late 1970s in &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, where he had frequent cover photos. Nan Bush, his longtime companion and agent, was able to secure a contract with Federated Department Stores to shoot the 1978 Bloomingdales mail catalog. He came to the attention of the general public in the late 1980s and early 1990s with his advertising images for Calvin Klein. He was first approached by Klein to work on an underwear campaign, and Weber took inspiration from Herbert List&#x27;s shoot in Santorini. His straightforward black-and-white shots, featuring an unclothed woman and man on a swing facing each other, two clothed men in bed, and model Marcus Schenkenberg suggestively holding jeans in front of himself in a shower, catapulted them both into the national spotlight. His photograph for Calvin Klein of Olympic athlete Tom Hintnaus in white briefs is an iconic image. He photographed the winter 2006 Ralph Lauren Collection.
Some of Weber&#x27;s earliest fashion photography appeared in the &quot;SoHo Weekly News&quot; and featured a spread of men wearing only underwear. The photos became the center of controversy and Weber was told by some that he would never find work as a fashion photographer again. This reputation stuck with him as he says: &quot;I don&#x27;t really work editorially in a large number of magazines because a lot of magazines don&#x27;t want my kind of photographs. It&#x27;s too risky for them.&quot;

After doing photo shoots for and of famous people (many of whom were featured in Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; magazine), Weber made short films of teenage boxers (&quot;Broken Noses&quot;), his beloved pet dogs, and later, a longer film entitled &quot;Chop Suey&quot;. He directed &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot;, a 1988 documentary about jazz trumpeter Chet Baker.

Weber&#x27;s photographs are occasionally in color; however, most are in black and white or shades of a tone. They appear in compilations in books including &quot;A House is Not a Home,&quot; as well as &quot;Bear Pond&quot; and &quot;Gentle Giants.&quot; The latter two are books of his photographs of his pet dogs.

Weber began collaborating with crooner Chris Isaak in the mid-1980s, photographing Isaak in 1986 for his second album, &quot;Chris Isaak&quot;. In 1988, Weber photographed a shirtless Isaak in bed for a fashion spread in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Isaak appeared in &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot; and Weber has directed a music video for Isaak. Weber photographed Harry Connick, Jr. for his 1991 album &quot;Blue Light, Red Light&quot;. In 1993, Weber photographed singer-songwriter Jackson Browne for his 1993 album &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;.

His ad campaigns include projects for Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Pirelli, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Revlon, Miu Miu, Armani, Louis Vuitton and Gianni Versace. His editorial work has appeared in &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stones&quot; magazines.
===Museums and Libraries===
Weber exhibits his work in prominent museums around the world, often working closely with the curator and art director Dimitri Levas to realize his vision. Weber&#x27;s most recent solo shows include &quot;Far From Home&quot; at Dallas Contemporary (2016), &quot;Detroit: Bruce Weber&quot; at the Detroit Institute of Arts (2012), and &quot;Haiti/Little Haiti&quot; (2010) at the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami.

==Filmmaking==
Weber&#x27;s cinematic works—including his five feature-length films—often begin with a photo sitting. &quot;All my films begin from finding someone I want to take a photograph of,&quot; Weber told the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; of London in 2008.

Broken Noses (1987)

While he was photographing the Olympic hopefuls for Interview Magazine in 1984, Weber met Andy Minsker, a young boxer from Oregon, and started interviewing him on camera. While he originally intended to make a short to accompany an exhibition he was opening in Paris, Weber became very excited when he reviewed the dailies and decided to continue the story. &quot;Broken Noses&quot; (1987), the resulting feature documentary, was nominated for the Grand Jury Award at Sundance in 1988.

Let&#x27;s Get Lost (1988)

As Weber was completing work on &quot;Broken Noses&quot;, he met the jazz trumpeter and vocalist Chet Baker and began filming him, again with a mind to creating a short film based on their portrait sitting. But filming with Baker continued right through the presentation of &quot;Broken Noses&quot; in Cannes that year—with Weber ultimately assembling the footage of travel, recording sessions, and interviews into his second feature, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot; (1988). The film debuted in Venice (where it won the Cinecritica award) and was subsequently nominated for a Grand Jury Award at Sundance, and for an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Filming took a year with Weber approaching it, as he told &quot;The Times&quot; of London&quot;, &quot;&quot;like his (Baker&#x27;s) interpretation of a song, open-ended, not lyrical or strict.&quot; The film features clips of Baker &quot;in his prime in the 1950s...combined with his drug-damaged incarnation in the film&#x27;s present day: gaunt and spaced out but still striking.&quot; Baker, Weber said, &quot;was like a geyser in a national park. Exploding up and raining and raining back down, falling apart on everyone.&quot;

Chop Suey (2001)

&quot;Chop Suey&quot;, a kaleidoscopic portrait of the wrestler Peter Johnson, was released in 2001. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London reviewed it as &quot;an aesthetic autobiography, in which he ruminates on some of his heroes and inspirations.&quot; According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; review at the time the film &quot;moves easily between video and film and between black-and-white and color as Mr. Weber explores the world around him, a world that he finds full of beauty and erotic possibility. One of his most engaging discoveries is the 91-year-old Sir Wilfred, who as a young desert explorer made photographs of Bedouin tribesman that prefigure Mr. Weber&#x27;s own work.&quot;

A Letter to True (2004)

Weber released the impressionistic anti-war film &quot;A Letter to True&quot; in 2004, in the aftermath of 9/11, and addressed to one of Weber&#x27;s beloved golden retrievers.&quot; The film is an &#x27;audiovisual scrapbook&#x27; In a review of the film &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London details how Weber rhapsodises over some of his favourite people, memories and ideas. (He) is a shameless old softie for whom dogs are emblematic of a happy home, (and)‘cherishes domestic security amid the fear created by the…attacks.&quot;

The Treasure of His Youth (2022)

Weber&#x27;s fifth feature-length film focuses on the prominent Italian photojournalist Paolo Di Paolo, who was 94 when Weber began shooting the documentary.

Short Films

His work-in-progress Robert Mitchum feature, &quot;Nice Girls Don&#x27;t Stay for Breakfast&quot; was screened at the New York Film Festival in 2017. He has also directed seven short films: &quot;Beauty Brothers, Parts I-IV&quot; (1987), &quot;Backyard Movie&quot; (1991), &quot;Gentle Giants&quot; (1994), &quot;The Teddy Boys of the Edwardian Drape Society&quot; (1995), &quot;Wine and Cupcakes&quot; (2007), &quot;The Boy Artist&quot; (2008), and &quot;Liberty City is Like Paris to Me&quot; (2009).

==Sexual assault allegations==
In December 2017, model Jason Boyce sued Weber in New York State Supreme Court, claiming sexual assault, including inappropriate touching and kissing during a 2014 casting session. The suit also targets Jason Kanner of Soul Artist Management, which managed Boyce when the alleged assault took place, and Little Bear Inc., the production company operated by Weber&#x27;s companion, Nan Bush. A second model, Mark Ricketson, came forward in December 2017 alleging similar claims and joined Boyce&#x27;s lawsuit against Weber.

Weber has denied the allegations, stating to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the allegations were &quot;untrue&quot; and that he had &quot;never touched anyone inappropriately&quot;.

In January 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; detailed sexual assault allegations by 15 male models against Weber.

In January 2019, it was reported that Weber asked to dismiss the original suit by Jason Boyce, with evidence provided that the model sent him racy photos and texts prior to and after the shoots.

By 2020, the Plaintiffs&#x27; cases against Weber began to face apparent setbacks, and in June 2020, Lisa Bloom, a high-powered harassment claims lawyer representing Weber&#x27;s accusers in various suits, was ordered to pay Weber $28,000 in legal costs after Boyce refused to answer certain questions at a deposition.

By September 2021, the 3 cases against Weber were each either dismissed or settled for undisclosed sums.

On 3 April 2024, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; published an interview on Alan Ritchson wherein the Reacher star comments on prior allegations against Weber and Mario Testino reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
Some of the stories were just like mine. I was just starting to build a platform and get my voice in the business, and I wondered, ‘Should I say something?’ Because all of the stories that those models were telling were my own. It’s all true.

==Personal life==
Weber is married to Nan Bush who is also his agent and one of his collaborators.

In a 2002 interview he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve had a lot of great romances. Men and women, I mean I feel like I can fall in love almost every day. I feel sorry for people who don&#x27;t feel that.&quot;

He has lived in Miami since 1998.

==Films==
===Music videos===
In 1990, Weber directed the music video for the Pet Shop Boys single &quot;Being Boring&quot;. He filmed a party with a diverse group of models. The video was filmed in one day by two film crews in a house on Long Island. Content including male and female nudity prevented the video from being played on MTV in the United States. In 1996 he directed the video for the Pet Shop Boys single &quot;Se a vida é (That&#x27;s the Way Life Is)&quot; on location in a Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild, a water park near Orlando, Florida. In 2002, he again directed a Pet Shop Boys video, for the song &quot;I Get Along&quot; from the album &quot;Release&quot;. Weber filmed this video on location at his own Little Bear studio in New York City. He also directed the music video for the Chris Isaak song &quot;Blue Spanish Sky&quot;.

===Books and monographs===
===Little Bear Press===
Bruce and his wife, Nan, began the publishing imprint Little Bear Press where, in addition to monographs and exhibition catalogs, they have published an independent arts journal titled &quot;All-American&quot;. While some volumes have been published by external publishers, the bulk of the series has been published by Little Bear Press. The &quot;All-American&quot; publishes works by artists, photographers, essayists, poets and other personalities. The subjects of the journal are sometimes already well known but just as often, the participants and subjects of &quot;All-American&quot; are noteworthy not for fame, but because their stories or accomplishments reveal something that Weber believes will resonate with readers on a deeper and more personal level. His dedication to the &quot;All-American&quot; project is motivated by a desire to connect, inspire, and support the work of emerging artists.

<text>Andrea Calogero Camilleri (; 6 September 1925 – 17 July 2019) was an Italian writer best known for his Salvo Montalbano crime novels.

==Biography==
Originally from Porto Empedocle, Girgenti, Sicily, Camilleri began university studies in the Faculty of Literature at the University of Palermo, but did not complete his degree; during that time he published poems and short stories.

From 1948 to 1950, he studied stage and film direction at the Silvio D&#x27;Amico Academy of Dramatic Arts (Accademia Nazionale d&#x27;Arte Drammatica) and began to take on work as a director and screenwriter, directing especially plays by Pirandello and Beckett. His parents knew and reportedly were &quot;distant friends&quot; of Pirandello, as he relates in his essay on Pirandello, &quot;Biography of the Changed Son.&quot; His most famous works, the Montalbano series, exhibit many Pirandellian elements: for example, the wild olive tree that helps Montalbano think is on stage in his late work &quot;The Giants of the Mountain.&quot;

With RAI, Camilleri worked on several TV productions, such as &quot;Le inchieste del commissario Maigret&quot; with Gino Cervi. In 1977, he returned to the Academy of Dramatic Arts, holding the chair of Film Direction and occupying it for 20 years.

Camilleri wrote his first novel, &quot;Il Corso Delle Cose&quot; (&quot;The Way Things Go&quot;), in 1978. This was followed by &quot;Un Filo di Fumo&quot; (&quot;A Thread of Smoke&quot;) in 1980. Neither of these works enjoyed any significant popularity.

In 1992, after a long pause of 12 years, Camilleri once more took up novel writing. A new book, &quot;La Stagione della Caccia&quot; (&quot;The Hunting Season&quot;) became a best-seller.

In 1994, Camilleri published &quot;La forma dell&#x27;Acqua&quot; (&quot;The Shape of Water&quot;), the first in a long series of novels featuring Inspector Salvo Montalbano, a fractious detective in the police force of Vigàta, an imaginary Sicilian town. The series is written in Italian but with a substantial sprinkling of Sicilian phrases and grammar. The name Montalbano is a homage to the Spanish writer Manuel Vázquez Montalbán; the similarities between Montalban&#x27;s Pepe Carvalho and Camilleri&#x27;s fictional detective are noteworthy. Both writers make use of their protagonists&#x27; gastronomic preferences.

This interesting quirk has become something of a fad among his readership, even in mainland Italy. The TV adaptation of Montalbano&#x27;s adventures, starring Luca Zingaretti, further increased Camilleri&#x27;s popularity to such a point that in 2003 Camilleri&#x27;s home town, Porto Empedocle – on which Vigàta is modelled – took the extraordinary step of changing its official name to that of Porto Empedocle Vigàta, no doubt with an eye to capitalising on the tourism possibilities thrown up by the author&#x27;s work. On his website, Camilleri refers to the engaging and multi-faceted character of Montalbano as a &quot;serial killer of characters,&quot; meaning that he has developed a life of his own and demands great attention from his author to the detriment of other potential books and characters. Camilleri added that he wrote a Montalbano novel every so often just so that the character would be appeased and allow him to work on other stories.

In 2012, Camilleri&#x27;s &quot;The Potter&#x27;s Field&quot; (translated by Stephen Sartarelli) was announced as the winner of the 2012 Crime Writers&#x27; Association International Dagger. The announcement was made on 5 July 2012 at the awards ceremony held at One Birdcage Walk in London.

In his last years, Camilleri lived in Rome where he worked as a TV and theatre director. About 10 million copies of his novels have been sold to date and are becoming increasingly popular in the UK (where BBC Four broadcast the Montalbano TV series from mid-2011), Australia and North America.

In addition to the degree of popularity brought him by the novels, Andrea Camilleri became even more of a media icon thanks to the parodies aired on an RAI radio show, where popular comedian, TV host and impressionist Fiorello presents him as a raspy-voiced, caustic character, madly in love with cigarettes and smoking, since in Italy, Camilleri was well known for being a heavy smoker of cigarettes. He considered himself a &quot;non-militant atheist&quot;.

On 17 June 2019, Camilleri suffered a heart attack. He was admitted to hospital in a critical condition. He died on 17 July 2019.

<text>The Ulster Popular Unionist Party (UPUP) was a unionist political party in Northern Ireland. It was founded in 1980 by James Kilfedder, independent Unionist Member of Parliament for North Down, who led the party until his death in 1995. For a brief period in 1980, it was known as the Ulster Progressive Unionist Party before it adopted the &quot;Popular&quot; name.

==History==
In the 1981 Northern Ireland local elections, the party took three seats on North Down Borough Council and two seats on Ards Borough Council. Two of these were in North Down &#x27;Area B&#x27;, where sitting councillor George Green, a former Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party member who had been elected to the 1975 Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention, had joined the party. The other, Gladys McIntyre, was Mayor of Ards in 1985-86.

Kilfedder won a seat for the party in North Down at the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election. Only a minority of his votes transferred to his running mate, George Green, who missed out on taking a second seat by just six votes. Kilfedder was subsequently elected Speaker of the Assembly.

Kilfedder held his seat in the UK Parliament at the 1983 general election with a large majority, but fared less well when he stood in the 1984 European election, taking only 2.9% of the first preference votes. A unionist pact enabled Kilfedder to easily win a by-election in 1986, when he joined the other unionist MPs in resigning in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement. A challenge from Bob McCartney, who stood as a &quot;Real Unionist&quot;, led to a close election in 1987 that Kilfedder ultimately won. He then beat a Conservative Party opponent in 1992.

The party was reduced to three councillors in 1985, and remained at this level until Kilfedder&#x27;s death in 1995. George Green had defected to the Conservative Party before 1989 but the party compensated by gaining a seat in the Dundonald area of Castlereagh. Following Kilfedder&#x27;s death, the three UPUP councillors went their separate ways, Valerie Kinghan to the newly formed UK Unionist Party. Thomas Jeffers to the Democratic Unionist Party and Cecil Braniff setting up a short-lived independent DUP. No party member contested the North Down by-election resulting from his death.

<text>The Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) was a college athletics organization in the United States, founded in 1971 to govern women&#x27;s college competitions in the country and to administer national championships (see AIAW Champions). It evolved out of the &quot;Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women&quot; (CIAW), founded in 1967. The association was one of the biggest advancements for women&#x27;s athletics on the collegiate level. Throughout the 1970s, the AIAW grew rapidly in membership and influence, in parallel with the national growth of women&#x27;s sports following the enactment of Title IX. 

The AIAW functioned in the equivalent role for college women&#x27;s programs that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) had been doing for men&#x27;s programs. Owing to its own success, the AIAW was in a vulnerable position that precipitated conflicts with the NCAA in the early 1980s. Following a one-year overlap in which both organizations staged women&#x27;s championships, the AIAW discontinued operation, and most member schools continued their women&#x27;s athletics programs under the governance of the NCAA.

== History ==
Women&#x27;s intercollegiate athletics were organized on a national basis in 1941, the year the first national collegiate championship was held in the sport of golf by the &quot;Division for Girls&#x27; and Women&#x27;s Sports&quot; (DGWS) of the American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation. During the late 1950s and the 1960s, many colleges around the country had started women&#x27;s sports teams that competed with other schools in their respective geographic areas. In 1956 the Tripartite Committee was formed by representatives of three organizations: the National Association for Physical Education for College Women, the National Association for Girls&#x27; and Women&#x27;s Sport, and the American Federation of College Women.

Upon the recommendation of the Tripartite Committee, the National Joint Committee on Extramural Sports for College Women (NJCESCW) was formed in 1957 to guide and administer women&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic programs. In 1965, with the desire to consolidate governance of women&#x27;s intercollegiate athletics under one organization, the NJCESCW disbanded and agreed to let the DGWS assume control over competition and extramural events.

The first action the DGWS took was to establish the &quot;Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (CIAW)&quot; to assume responsibility for designing, sponsoring, and sanctioning women’s intercollegiate sports and championships. The purposes of the CIAW were (1) to provide the framework and organization for women&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic opportunities and (2) to sponsor national championships for college women under the authority of the DGWS.

The AIAW developed from the CIAW in recognition of the need for institutional membership and elected representation. Formation of the AIAW was approved by the DGWS Council and the AAHPER Board of Directors in 1971, but the CIAW continued to operate until early 1972, at which time the AIAW officially came into existence, with over 280 schools as members.

At that time the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) had no interest in women&#x27;s athletics, and administrators of the AIAW had no interest in the NCAA either. The NCAA was seen as being commercially driven and neglecting the meaning of the student-athlete. There were distinct differences between the two associations in the AIAW&#x27;s early years. For example, student-athletes playing in AIAW programs were allowed to transfer freely between schools, and to prevent unfair advantages, programs were initially forbidden to offer scholarships and recruit off-campus. The AIAW continued the rules established by the CIAW, which were intended to prohibit unethical practices that were observed in men&#x27;s sports. To enforce the rules, students receiving scholarships were forbidden from championship participation. The ban on scholarships ended in 1973, following a lawsuit by players and coaches from two colleges in Florida. The AIAW was not without criticism however, as some outsiders and individual members complained that the association devoted too much time, efforts, and funds securing distinction and independence from the NCAA.

The annual softball tournaments and basketball tournaments received the most publicity and drew the biggest crowds; however, the association organized championships in various other sports. They included mainstream sports like volleyball and tennis but were as far reaching as badminton and fencing. Aside from national championships, individual schools worked together to stage annual state championships.

While in existence, the AIAW organized and administered all competition at the regional and national levels. In 1981-82 the organization offered 41 national championships in 19 sports — badminton, basketball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, indoor track and field, lacrosse, rowing, skiing, soccer, softball (fast and slow pitch), swimming and diving, synchronized swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.

The 1973 Basketball Tournament was the first sign that women&#x27;s sports could be financially successful. Over 3,000 fans watched the final game between Queens and Immaculata, and the tournament earned over $4,500 in profits. In 1975 these two teams met again, this time in Madison Square Garden. The first women&#x27;s basketball game to be played in the arena drew a crowd of more than 12,000 spectators. The AIAW started to take advantage of corporate sponsorships and television payouts not unlike its male counterpart, but on a smaller scale.

In 1972, the United States Congress passed Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. Although the impact today is primarily discussed in terms of the impact on athletics, the bill made no explicit mention of athletics. The bill provided that neither men nor women could &quot;be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance&quot;. The task of issuing regulations fell to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). One of its early decisions was that athletic programs would indeed be subject to the requirements of the law. The effect was to require the creation of new women&#x27;s teams instead of stipulating that women could simply try out for men&#x27;s teams. Consequently, the regulations required colleges to provide equal opportunities for both genders in collegiate athletics. Any school that received federal funds was required to provide gender equality by the 1978-79 school year. In 1974 colleges started giving scholarships to female student-athletes. That year (aside from the exceptional Wayland College basketball team in the 1950s), Ann Meyers became the first female to receive a full scholarship by committing to play for UCLA. Title IX is credited with the vast improvement in funding for women&#x27;s athletics. By 1980, the average university spent over 16% of its athletics budget on women&#x27;s sports. In the early 1970s that number was less than 1%.

Although the regulations promulgated under the law required additional funding for women&#x27;s teams, athletic directors did not immediately embrace the requirements. Their concerns included the relative inability for many schools to sufficiently fund the necessary women&#x27;s teams, making it possible for the budgets for men&#x27;s teams to be reduced to achieve compliance. The NCAA, which regulated men&#x27;s intercollegiate sports, raised money to help fight Title IX. In 1974 the Senate passed the Tower Amendment, which decreed that Title IX did not cover football or other revenue-producing sports. The recently formed AIAW responded, hiring a lawyer, Margot Polivy, to fight the Tower Amendment. Their efforts were successful, as a joint Congressional conference committee decided to eliminate the Tower Amendment.

On June 1, 1979, the AIAW assumed a separate legal identity and became a nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia. Then in 1981, following the NCAA&#x27;s decision to offer championships for women in its top competitive division, Division I, the AIAW suffered substantial losses of members and revenue.

=== AIAW vs. NCAA ===

At its peak, the AIAW had almost 1,000 member schools. In the late 1970s, however, schools began to realize that women&#x27;s athletics could be profitable, and the NCAA decided to offer women&#x27;s championships. The NCAA&#x27;s Divisions II and III voted to offer championships in 1980; however, Division I members failed to gain a majority vote on this issue until the 1981 national meeting. This decision was quite contentious. During the tense floor debate, AIAW representatives objected to the motion to sponsor Division I championships, but their objections were met with pockets of &quot;ridicule and hissing&quot;. After considerable debate, a vote was called, and the initial result was a tie, 124–124. A recount of the votes revealed the defeat of the motion by a vote of 128–127. However, parliamentary rules permit &quot;reconsideration&quot; of a vote if someone on the prevailing side asks for it. Several delegates on the losing side knew of one institution that had voted against the motion but whose faculty representative favored the NCAA position. When the influencer of the school’s &quot;nay&quot; vote left the room, those delegates prevailed upon that representative to request reconsideration. This time it passed, 137–117.

For the 1981-82 academic year, schools were able to compete in either the NCAA or the AIAW championships. There were a few occasions when a school participated in both tournaments that year (Florida in gymnastics, 1982; Oklahoma State in softball, 1982; indeed the University of Tulsa won &quot;both&quot; the AIAW and NCAA women&#x27;s golf championships in 1982). However, the battle of members had started, as schools whose men&#x27;s teams were already participating in the NCAA started to integrate their women&#x27;s teams. Although some schools permitted their individual women&#x27;s teams to choose, most schools made the weighty decision to support only one of the two organizations. The AIAW had fought for women&#x27;s rights in the Title IX battle, while the NCAA had opposed those efforts. In contrast, the NCAA was much better funded and had better access to television contracts. The University of Texas, where the last AIAW president, Donna Lopiano, was the women&#x27;s athletics director, was one of the stronger holdouts. But when 17 of the top 20 basketball teams agreed to enter the NCAA tournament, it proved to be the end for the AIAW.

In 1982 the first NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament was held. The NCAA was able to offer incentives, such as payment of transportation costs, to participating members, something the AIAW was not able to do. When former AIAW powerhouses like Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, and Old Dominion decided to participate in the NCAA tournament, the AIAW tournament lost much of its appeal and popularity.

NBC canceled its TV contract with the association, and in mid-1982 the AIAW stopped operations in all sports. Following the last AIAW sanctioned event in 1982, the AIAW pursued a federal antitrust suit against the NCAA. But one year later, after the presiding judge ruled against the organization, the AIAW ceased existence on June 30, 1983.

Under NCAA governance, scholarships increased. However, several problems the NCAA was facing, then and now, began to also affect women&#x27;s intercollegiate athletics. Examples of these include recruiting irregularities and increased turnover in coaching positions for revenue-producing sports.

Several AIAW championships were televised by the TVS Television Network in 1979.

<text>Mother Meera, born Kamala Reddy (born 26 December 1960) is believed by her devotees to be an embodiment (Avatar) of the Divine Mother (Shakti or Devi).

==Life account==

Born in Chandepally a small village in the Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district of Telangana, India, she allegedly had her first samādhi, a state of complete spiritual absorption, at the age of six, which lasted for a whole day. When she was 12 her uncle Bulgur Venkat Reddy met her for the first time, and was convinced that the girl had already appeared to him in the form of visions. He came to believe that she is the Divine Mother and started to take care of her, allowing her to unfold her inner experiences. Her parents Antamma and Veera Reddy live in Madanapalle, Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.

In 1974, uncle Reddy brought Mother Meera to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, India, of which he was a member. There she first met Westerners and started to give &quot;darshan&quot;. She is however not associated with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram today. In 1979 she was invited by her first devotees to Canada, where she went several times. Meanwhile, uncle Reddy&#x27;s health started to deteriorate.

In 1981 she made her first trip to West Germany, where she, together with uncle Reddy and her close companion Adilakshmi, settled down a year later. She married a German in 1982. Uncle Reddy died in 1985 and was buried in the local cemetery in Dornburg-Thalheim, Hesse. For some years now, she has been giving &quot;darshan&quot; (literally &quot;seeing&quot;, primarily in a spiritual context) at Schloss Schaumburg in Balduinstein, a small town in Germany. Previously, in the early 1990s, she gave &quot;darshan&quot; in a house in the town of Thalheim, some 5 km northwest of Hadamar in Germany. She also visits the United States on a regular basis (see links below).

==Activities==

Mother Meera receives thousands of visitors of all religions for &quot;darshan&quot; which she conducts in total silence. Her &quot;darshan&quot; consists of a ritual, where she will touch a person&#x27;s head, and then look into their eyes. During this process, she reportedly &#x27;unties knots&#x27; in the person&#x27;s subtle system and permeates them with light. She doesn&#x27;t charge any money for doing so and she will not give lectures. Mother Meera&#x27;s reported task on Earth was in calling down a dynamic light-force from the Supreme (Paramatman – the supreme Self) in collaboration with other saints and divine beings, as she says, making spiritual progress on earth easier. About this light she says:

Through Japa, the mental remembrance of &quot;any&quot; Divine Name or Mantra, which may be done informally, and whenever convenient, people could open themselves up to this Light. She does not claim to be a guru or have followers. To be connected to her work, people do not have to recognise her. Her teaching is mainly related to Bhakti, that is devotion to God, and in that she accepts all denominations.

Mother Meera does not belong to any particular tradition, except for a certain closeness to the work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, whom she was reported to have met in their subtle bodies, when she was a child, visiting their Samadhi (grave). She teaches the unity of all religions. Everyone can go their own ways. It is only important to be connected with the light (the personal spiritual role model) every day by praying, reading or meditating.

== Critics ==
After splitting from Mother Meera, the writer and former follower Andrew Harvey wrote &quot;The Sun at Midnight&quot;. In it, Harvey accused Meera of homophobia, saying that Mother Meera disapproved of Harvey&#x27;s marriage to another man. In his first book about her, &quot;Hidden Journey&quot;, Harvey had originally praised her as an avatar, attributing his own claimed enlightenment to her. Harvey&#x27;s accusation of homophobia is disputed. One of Harvey&#x27;s former lovers, the writer Mark Matousek (1997), said that: &quot;I do know that the idea that she&#x27;s homophobic is completely ridiculous. For God&#x27;s sake, we were served breakfast in bed together in her house.&quot;

<doc id="594538" wikidata="Q5402934" url="?curid=594538" title="Ethan Frome">
<text>Ethan Frome is a 1911 novella by American author Edith Wharton. It details the story of a man who falls in love with his wife&#x27;s cousin and the tragedies that result from the ensuing love triangle. The novel has been adapted into a film of the same name.

==Plot==
An unnamed male narrator is working at a power plant but due to a carpenter&#x27;s strike, finds himself forced to spend a winter in the nearby small town of (fictional) Starkfield, Massachusetts. The man who chauffeurs him to work is a limping, quiet man named Ethan Frome, a lifelong resident and local fixture of the community. The narrator learns that Frome&#x27;s limp arose from being injured in an accident. The story then flashes back 24 years to detail Frome&#x27;s past.

The young Frome is married to a sickly woman named Zeena (Zenobia), who appears older than her age, is unkind to Ethan, and whose life revolves around seeking expensive treatments for her varied illnesses. Although the Fromes have limited means themselves, they have taken in Zeena&#x27;s cousin Mattie, whose family is poor. Ethan falls in love with Mattie, and it becomes increasingly clear that Mattie also loves him. While it remains ambiguous if Zeena suspects Ethan&#x27;s unfaithfulness, she makes plans to send Mattie away. Zeena claims that, because of her failing health, her physician has recommended she hire a maid who will relieve her of housework. Zeena has already arranged for the hired girl to arrive by train soon, and Mattie must vacate her room immediately. Ethan, miserable at the thought of losing Mattie, considers running away with her, but he lacks the money to do so, and will feel guilty about leaving Zeena with the farm.

The next morning, Ethan rushes into town to try to get a cash advance from a customer for a load of lumber in order to have the money with which to elope with Mattie. His plan is unhinged by guilt, however, when his customer&#x27;s wife expresses compassion for Ethan. He realizes that he cannot cheat this kindly woman and her husband out of money.

Ethan comes back to the farm and picks up Mattie to take her to the train station. They stop at a hill upon which they had once planned to go sledding and decide to sled together as a way of delaying their sad parting. After their first run, Mattie suggests a suicide pact: that they go down again, and steer the sled directly into a big elm tree, so they will never be parted and so that they may spend their last moments together. The resulting crash leaves both of them alive, Ethan with a permanent limp and Mattie paralyzed from a spinal injury.

The narrative returns to the present, where he tells of being forced by a blizzard to stay the night at the Frome house, the first stranger to enter the house in 20 years. He witnesses an unhappy scene with Mattie and the Fromes living together, with Zeena as Mattie&#x27;s caregiver. Ironically, Ethan and Mattie have gotten their wish to stay together, but in mutual unhappiness and discontent, with Mattie now having developed an irritable disposition, and the sickly Zeena rising to the challenge of becoming a caretaker. Zeena is a constant presence between the two of them, although it remains ambiguous as to whether she knew of their dalliance.

==Development==
The story of &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; had initially begun as a French-language composition that Wharton had to write while studying the language in Paris, but several years later she took the story up again and transformed it into the novel it now is, basing her sense of New England culture and place on her ten years of living at The Mount, her home in Lenox, Massachusetts. She would read portions of her novel-in-progress each day to her good friend Walter Berry, who was an international lawyer. Wharton likely based the story of Ethan and Mattie&#x27;s sledding experience on an accident that she had heard about in 1904 in Lenox. Five people total were involved in the real-life accident, four girls and one boy. They crashed into a lamppost while sledding down Courthouse Hill in Lenox. A girl named Emily Hazel Crosby was killed in the accident. Wharton learned of the accident from one of the girls who survived, Kate Spencer, when the two became friends while both worked at the Lenox Library. Kate Spencer suffered from a hip injury in the accident and also had facial injuries. It is among the few works by Wharton with a rural setting. Wharton found the notion of the tragic sledding crash to be irresistible as a potential extended metaphor for the wrongdoings of a secret love affair.

Lenox is also where Wharton had traveled extensively and had come into contact with at least one of the victims of the accident; victims of the accident are buried in graves nearby Wharton family members. In her introduction to the novel, Wharton talks of the &quot;outcropping granite&quot; of New England, the austerity of its land and the stoicism of its people. There are frequent references to larch, elm, pine, and hemlock trees. The connection between land and people is very much a part of naturalism; the environment is a powerful shaper of man&#x27;s fate, and the novel dwells insistently on the cruelty of Starkfield&#x27;s winters.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; &quot;a compelling and haunting story.&quot; Wharton was able to write an appealing book and separate it from her other works, where her characters in &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; are not of the elite upper class. However, the problems that the characters endure are still consistently the same, where the protagonist has to decide whether or not to fulfill their duty or follow their heart. She began writing Ethan Frome in the early 1900s when she was still married. The novel was criticized by Lionel Trilling as lacking in moral or ethical significance. Trilling wrote that the ending is &quot;terrible to contemplate,&quot; but that &quot;the mind can do nothing with it, can only endure it.&quot;

Jeffrey Lilburn notes that some find &quot;the suffering endured by Wharton&#x27;s characters is quite bleak and makes for a dull read,&quot; but others see the difficult moral questions addressed and note that it &quot;provides insightful commentary on the American economic and cultural realities that produced and allowed such suffering.&quot; Wharton was always careful to label &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; as a brief reminiscence rather than a novel. Critics did take note of this when reviewing the book, some in more candor than others. Elizabeth Ammons reflected that reading Wharton&#x27;s novel compelled her to reminisce upon when literature was more enthralling. She found a story that functions as a &quot;realistic social criticism,&quot; a reminder that some are willing to indulge in dull prose based solely upon the name of the author. Despite her obvious quarrels with the work, Ammons proceeded to analyze the text. The moral concepts, as described by Ammons, are revealed with all of the brutality of Starkfield&#x27;s winters. Comparing Mattie Silver and Zeena Frome, Ammons suggests that Mattie would grow as frigid and crippled as Zeena, so long as such women remain isolated and dependent. Wharton cripples Mattie, says Lilburn, but has her survive in order to demonstrate the cruelty of the culture surrounding women in that period.

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted to the 1993 film of the same name, directed by John Madden, and starring Liam Neeson, Patricia Arquette, Joan Allen and Tate Donovan.

Cathy Marston adapted the book to a one-act ballet titled &quot;Snowblind&quot; for the San Francisco Ballet. The ballet premiered in 2018, with Ulrik Birkkjaer as Ethan, Sarah Van Patten as Zeena and Mathilde Froustey as Mattie.

<doc id="594542" wikidata="Q445862" url="?curid=594542" title="Percy Sledge">
<text>Percy Tyrone Sledge (November 25, 1940 – April 14, 2015) was an American R&amp;B, soul and gospel singer. He is best known for the song &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, a No. 1 hit on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and R&amp;B singles charts in 1966. It was awarded a million-selling, gold-certified disc from the RIAA.

After working as a hospital orderly in the early 1960s, Sledge achieved his greatest success in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a series of emotional soul songs. In 1989, Sledge received the Rhythm and Blues Foundation&#x27;s Pioneer Award. He was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Sledge was born on November 25, 1940, in Leighton, Alabama. He worked in a series of agricultural jobs in the fields near Leighton, before taking a job as an orderly at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama. Through the mid-1960s, he toured the Southeast with the &quot;Esquires Combo&quot; on weekends, while working at the hospital during the week. A former patient and mutual friend of Sledge and record producer Quin Ivy introduced the two. An audition followed, and Sledge was signed to a recording contract.
Sledge&#x27;s soulful voice was perfect for the series of soul ballads produced by Ivy and Marlin Greene, which rock critic Dave Marsh called &quot;emotional classics for romantics of all ages&quot;. &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; was Sledge&#x27;s first song recorded under the contract, and was released in March 1966. According to Sledge, the inspiration for the song came when his girlfriend left him for a modelling career after he was laid off from a construction job in late 1965, and, because bassist Calvin Lewis and organist Andrew Wright helped him with the song, he gave all the songwriting credits to them. It reached No. 1 in the US and went on to become an international hit. &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; was a hit twice in the UK, reaching No. 4 in 1966 and, on reissue, peaked at No. 2 in 1987. The song was also the first gold record released by Atlantic Records. The soul anthem became the cornerstone of Sledge&#x27;s career, and was followed by &quot;Warm and Tender Love&quot; (covered by British singer Elkie Brooks in 1981), &quot;It Tears Me Up&quot;, &quot;Take Time to Know Her&quot; (his second biggest US hit, reaching No. 11; the song&#x27;s lyric was written by Steve Davis), &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, and &quot;Cover Me&quot;.

Sledge charted with &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Everything&quot; and &quot;Sunshine&quot; during the 1970s, and became an international concert favorite throughout the world, especially in the Netherlands, Germany, and on the African continent; he averaged 100 concerts a year in apartheid-era South Africa.

===Later career===
Sledge&#x27;s career enjoyed a renaissance in the 1980s during which &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; re-entered the UK Singles Chart after being used in a Levi&#x27;s commercial, peaking at No. 2 behind the reissued Ben E. King classic &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. On March 23, 1987, Sledge performed &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; as the musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosted by Bill Murray. In the early 1990s, Michael Bolton brought &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; back into the limelight again on his hit album &quot;Time, Love, &amp; Tenderness&quot;. On the week of November 17 to November 23, 1991, Bolton&#x27;s version also hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, exactly 25½ years to the week after Percy&#x27;s did in 1966.

In 1994, Saul Davis and Barry Goldberg produced Sledge&#x27;s album &quot;Blue Night&quot; for Philippe Le Bras&#x27; Sky Ranch label and Virgin Records. It featured Bobby Womack, Steve Cropper, and Mick Taylor among others. &quot;Blue Night&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Blues Album, Vocal or Instrumental, and in 1996 it won the W.C. Handy Award for best soul or blues album.

In 2004, Davis and Goldberg also produced the &quot;Shining Through the Rain&quot; album, which preceded his induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Songs on the CD were written by Mikael Rickfors, Steve Earle, the Bee Gees, Carla Olson, Denny Freeman, Allan Clarke and Jackie Lomax. The same year, Percy recorded a live album with his band Sunset Drive entitled &quot;Percy Sledge and Sunset Drive – Live in Virginia&quot; on WRM Records produced by Warren Rodgers.

In May 2007, Percy was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in Baton Rouge, LA.

In December 2010, Rhino Handmade issued a four-CD retrospective, &quot;The Atlantic Recordings&quot;, which covers all of the issued Atlantic masters, as well as many of the tracks unissued in the United States (although some are simply the mono versions of songs originally issued in stereo; Disc 1 comprises Sledge&#x27;s first two LPs, which were not recorded on stereo equipment). In 2011 Sledge toured with Sir Cliff Richard during his Soulicious tour, performing &quot;I&#x27;m Your Puppet&quot;.

===Personal life===
Sledge married twice and had twelve children, three of whom became singers.

==Death==
Sledge died of liver cancer at his home in Baton Rouge on April 14, 2015, at the age of 74. His interment was in Baton Rouge&#x27;s Heavenly Gates Cemetery.

<text>Tracy Jeanne Grandstaff (born November 1963) is an American actress, writer and producer best known for her work portraying Daria Morgendorffer from the MTV animated series &quot;Daria&quot;. This role was spun off from another MTV series, &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, for which Grandstaff provided the voices of Daria and other minor characters.

==Career==
She has written for various series on MTV, including &quot;The Tom Green Show&quot; and the annual Video Music Awards, and for other Viacom-owned networks, including Comedy Central and Nickelodeon. In April 2011 Grandstaff conducted an interview with the website Can I Get A Man With That to promote the DVD release of the complete series of &quot;Daria&quot;. On her view of the character eight years since the finale, Grandstaff said, &quot;She is, was, and always will be the Misery Chick who loathes attention more than she loathes herself. Eight years later, there are new things that would totally annoy her—primarily words like totally and bestie. ...I don&#x27;t see her as a sad character. I see her as tolerant of her unavoidable reality—eager to put the whole miserable experience behind her, so she could get out into the world and surround herself with people she actually admired and respected, or not.&quot;

She reprised her role of Daria Morgendorffer for a GPS in 2010.
